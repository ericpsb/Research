{"date": "September 16, 2016", "body": "In a recent (and I would add \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d)  piece of reporting from the New Zealand Herald , we are told that an explanation for children turning up at school with American accents is that children are watching too much Disney Channel. We are told that such issues as poor oral skills, poor eye-contact, poor social interaction skills, and talking in phrases rather than typical sentences, are also attributable to this Disney Channel watching. If you think that actually sounds like a very good description of a child with autism, you\u2019d be right, and you\u2019d be in agreement with  a speech therapist who wrote into the NZ Herald  in response to that article, trying to explain that the issues being described are more complex than can be simply ascribed to enjoying the Disney Channel. So whose opinion was the NZ Herald sharing then, if it wasn\u2019t the opinion of an expert in the field of speech-language issues, and why does it matter? It was the opinion of a school principal, and it matters because this individual is in charge of students with speech-language issues. It matters because the Herald is a widely read national publication that chose to share this view as if it was important or noteworthy. It matters because our Minister of Education \u2013 Hekia Parata \u2013 is later quoted in that same article as saying that research into such poor language skills is likely to turn out explanations such as \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mix of stuff like screen time, less reading between adults and kids.\u201d It matters because this woman is overseeing some seriously concerning changes to our special education sector, and it sounds like she has pre-accepted explanations for what is causing such issues \u2013 it is irresponsible for her to endorse such opinions before research backs it up. It is all the more dangerous because this view perpetuates the very ill-informed and dangerously unhelpful view held by some (none of whom are experts in autism or language development) that autism, and its symptoms, are really just caused by poor parenting decisions such as too much screen-time. My youngest son has an American accent. I am a born and bred New Zealander, so is my husband. My son\u2019s kindy teachers had Indian and Chinese accents. My son watched far less TV growing up than his brother did, and his brother has a very clear New Zealand accent (his brother is also autistic by the way \u2013 having an accent isn\u2019t a necessary feature for having autism). Also, we don\u2019t have the Disney Channel. The TV shows my son did watch growing up, were mostly New Zealand made shows, some UK and some US shows too, but those did not dominate his viewing experiences. In fact, my son\u2019s peculiar American accent is one of the signs that he has mild autism \u2013 which he does, it is a firm diagnosis and has been for a couple of years now. He also has odd social skills, difficulty with eye contact; can\u2019t blame the Disney Channel for that either. I didn\u2019t even know his unusual accent was indicative of his autism until his specialist remarked on it, and my own research threw it up as a common indicator. (Try typing in \u201cautism accent\u201d or \u201cAmerican accent autism\u201d in a search engine, and see what happens, just for starters.) The complicating issue in the article, is that it is trying to explain an  increase  in such language issues, and some will respond here that autism can\u2019t be increasing at that rate. However, there are plenty of studies that show autism rates (or, at the very least, recognition of autism symptoms), have been increasing steadily. There is also a growing awareness and concern about children with special needs, that shines an early and intense light on these needs that may have otherwise gone unremarked. There may be other factors causing such delays or speech issues, which may include such things as the increased numbers of children taking part in early childhood education (and the associated issues with the quality of care and amount of one-on-one time that can occur in some such settings), and may include other disorders that are poorly understood or are growing in number for whatever reason. Or hey, maybe it\u2019s the Disney Channel\u2019s fault. The point is, we don\u2019t know, and we definitely don\u2019t know enough to have national newspapers sharing the un-researched views of a single principal and the responsible Minister, as if their views were meaningful explanations; even worse, to have such views shared in the main article without balancing views from experts in the field of speech-language therapy \u2013 only hearing one such voice at the  bottom of a list of views  sent in by readers, in a secondary article released later. A secondary article that will not get nearly the same readership or coverage that the first article did. To say all this makes me upset, is an understatement. It makes me mad, it makes me concerned, it makes me scared about how the public and other schools and the Minister in charge views children like mine. It makes me despair. I think this situation is indicative of how and why the special education sector in New Zealand is so screwed up and not looking like it\u2019s going to improve \u2013 we need someone at the top who knows and understands our children\u2019s challenges, and who doesn\u2019t come in with preconceived ideas that special needs are caused by poor parenting. We need change, and \u201cwatching less Disney\u201d isn\u2019t the change we desperately need. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11709785", "http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11710524", "http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11710524"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2016/09/16/american-accents-arent-disneys-fault/", "title": "American Accents Aren\u2019t Disney\u2019s\u00a0Fault"},
{"date": "September 20, 2016", "body": "You may have noticed your Facebook friends\u2019 profile pictures changing to the \u201ceducation for all\u201d picture. It should be simply a statement of something we can take for granted in this country \u2013 we\u2019re told we have a world-class education system, we\u2019re told it is inclusive, we\u2019re told it is free. The reality is our education system is failing it\u2019s most vulnerable students, and in turn their families and wider society. Students that have so much potential, students who could flourish and succeed if our education system was genuinely inclusive and resourced adequately; students who are instead treated like after-thoughts and who are given up on.  It\u2019s such a waste, and the impact of the lack of training for working with children who have special needs, lack of in-class supports, and dire under-resourcing, is widely-felt. It\u2019s felt by the teachers and the other students. It\u2019s felt by the parents of children who can\u2019t work because they\u2019re being called into school all the time, or who are expected to home-school their children or keep their children at home during \u201c kiwi suspensions \u201d because the school can\u2019t cope. And most importantly, it\u2019s felt by the children who have these different needs; it\u2019s affecting their future, and the way they see themselves and their own potential. The impact on their educational and career opportunities, on their ability to ultimately contribute to society themselves, and on their image of self-worth, can be life-long. We should all be concerned about this, not just because it ultimately affects all of us, but because what is happening in our schools is shameful and embarrassing and is falling short of what we expect and value in this beautiful country of ours. Recently the government decided to look at special education in New Zealand, and its proposals for how to fix the system have not addressed any of the core problems we face. What we need is better training, better resourcing, better supports, a simpler system for accessing supports, shorter waiting times for services, and meaningful inclusion. What we got was tinkering on language and a shifting of resources without an increase in funding. We are not being listened to. And so it\u2019s time to make them listen. That brings us to the \u201ceducation for all\u201d rally. There will be a rally this Thursday, September 22nd, for everyone who wants to stand up and be heard about the shortcomings of our education system. If you can, please join the rally outside Parliament Building in Wellington, from 4:30pm to 5:30pm on that day. It\u2019s going to be a family-friendly event, and a good chance to meet some like-minded people uniting for a good cause. You can find out more about the rally through their Facebook event page  here . If you can\u2019t make it, then consider sharing the event with others who may be able to attend, and consider changing your Facebook (and twitter, etc) profile pictures to show your support and promote this event. I can\u2019t make it, but if I lived in Wellington I\u2019d have proudly been there. If you go, please do come back after the event and share your experience; I\u2019d love to hear how it goes, and to thank you for standing up for our families and our children.

{"date": "September 1, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My son\u2019s obsessions are a part of his autism (as recognised under both  DSM-IV  and the future  DSM-5 ). He was quite typical with his original fixations; the classic autistic child lying with his head on the floor, eyes level with the wheels on his toy cars, while he watched the wheels spin. This intense and repetitive fixation / obsession, has evolved (and I purposefully use the word \u201cevolved,\u201d I\u2019ll expand on that soon), from vehicle wheels, to clocks to globes. But always, the fixation has come as a double-edged sword: Whatever he is obsessed with has immense power to both calm him, and drive him to high levels of anxiety. From a parenting perspective, I can use his interests to calm him, reward him, and motivate him, but I have to balance this \u201cpower\u201d carefully; if I indulge it excessively his anxieties attached to the object in question also escalate and he disengages more with the people and the world around him. My son has always been the driving force behind the evolution of his interests. He gets exposed to a range of different things and ideas in the world on a daily basis; what he chooses to latch on to next is his own decision. I have seen him gently and slowly let go of previous fixations, after many months of directing his every day towards the item and finding ways to integrate it into his world. I\u2019ve learnt at those times to keep an eye out for his next obsession. For example, he stopped insisting that every time we visited his grandma and great grandma, that they get out and give him every watch or clock in the house. But just as he was letting that go, he shifted to wanting to see and talk about their calendars, eventually asking to touch and keep them too. Thus began (and still continues) his calendar fixation. His bedroom currently has five calendars in it. He becomes quite precise in his fixations though; it\u2019s not simply the object in itself, it\u2019s the deeper meaning or function. By which I mean, he didn\u2019t just want clocks, he wanted clocks that worked and told the correct time. He doesn\u2019t just want calendars, he wants calendars that have the correct month showing for the correct year. (So kindly relatives who have gifted him calendars from previous years, have put me in the position of having to change all the days along the top of each month, to match the actual date to day of the week for 2011.) If the clock didn\u2019t tell the correct time, or the month shows the wrong day, it can be source of anxiety or upset instead of joy. It\u2019s not like this at the beginning of a fixation; before he has learnt the deeper meaning and function of such items, he obviously can\u2019t identify when they are faulty. That move (or \u201cinner-evolution\u201d if you will) towards requiring precision within the obsessional object, is of course evidence of enhanced understanding (and perhaps evidences the pre-waning of that fixation, ready for a shift to the next? I don\u2019t know, that thought has only just occurred to me as I write it.) This preference for precision even goes back to his fixation on vehicle wheels. One of the first signs to me that he had a deeper awareness than what I\u2019d previously been aware of in him, was the day he brought me the correct wheels to go with the correct vehicles, prior to being able to functionally use language (see  my post on this story , from my previous blog, entry from Jan 17th 2009). So it wasn\u2019t just \u201cwheels\u201d that got him excited; you couldn\u2019t just give him a wheel to play with and expect happiness, neither could you give him a vehicle with the wrong wheels and expect him not to care about the error. Over the years he has fixated on things that turn; wheels, clocks, and now world globes too. But where do calendars fit in you may be wondering. This is what I have found particularly interesting lately in trying to understand and find patterns in his interests (as I am prone to do, both as his mother and more simply, as a human being). Calendars, like clocks, and the rotations of the world represented in globes, measure time; initially, in the form of turning. That turning, and time, is predictable; I have mentioned in  previous posts on his fixations  that I\u2019ve thought he was attracted to the things he is because they represent and provide predictability. But more than that, I have realised, turning seen in time  qua  time, also provides an organising mechanism for his world. An order of events, a way to see where he was before and where he is now. A way to understand what has happened and what will happen. Thereby also bringing more predictability  into  his life, not just providing a  thing of predictability  in itself (like watching a wheel turn). And so, his interest in things that turn, has evolved into an interest in time \u2013 and the measurement of time \u2013 more generally. And in quite remarkable ways. He knows how to read time (he learnt roman numerals in that regard too). He knows all the days of the week, and months of the year, in order. He has taken an interests in and is coming to understand the changing seasons. He is now beginning to comprehend the world as a globe, with countries as representative of actual locations, and I think he is starting to appreciate that the space between those countries then represent distance (and therefore, ultimately, time taken to travel, which we also discuss sometimes). He continues to obsess over related notions of time, that have spun off from his interest in time as represented by turning: Specifically, life and all its stages, including death. We still have regular conversations about what kills people, who in his family is alive and dead, and who is likely to be alive in reference to his own future ages (will mummy or grandma or his brother still be alive when he is 70, and so on). ( Here\u2019s my previous post  about some of those previous life / death conversations). Such interesting discussions would not have been possible without the immense growth in his language over the past two years. Just yesterday I was reading in my personal journal about him mastering the joint expression \u201cI want,\u201d but really struggling to learn the next phrase, \u201cI see.\u201d This was when he was four years old (February 2010 was the date of that entry). You can just imagine the leap from \u201cI want\u201d to discussions of life and death, 18 months later! Considering the challenges he faces, I find it quite astounding. Without that language \u2013 and indeed the improved social skills \u2013 I wonder if his fixations would have evolved in the same way. And if they did, would I have understood the real interest and understanding he had about those items, or would I have thought them random rather than evolutions of interest? If he had taken on a fixation with calendars, would I have seen it then as connected to a deeper interest in \u201ccircular\u201d time, or as unconnected? I have learnt to expect more of him, as he keeps living up to and then exceeding my expectations. So too, I have learnt to find more meaning and function in his intense interests. Am I reading more into them than is actually there; is this connection I see with time my own construct I\u2019ve overlayed on his interests..? Maybe. Maybe what draws him to these things is far less complex, or far more complex. I don\u2019t think my misunderstanding (if it is that) matters at this point, since I let him largely drive his own fixations. I should clarify that I would never encourage fixations  qua  fixations, considering their often intense down-sides, but neither do I try to break his interests since they are great learning opportunities and motivators. As I said earlier in this post, it\u2019s a fine line to walk sometimes as a parent of an autistic child. And so I will continue to observe and try to understand what he is passionate about. One day, probably far off, he will have the words and concepts to explain to me why he is so drawn to such things, and why his obsessions shift when they do. Until then, the world keeps spinning anyway, and I will do my best to understand and make the most of this ride with him, through circular time. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clock_calendar.jpg", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94#", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/from-circular-wheels-to-circular-time-reflections-on-the-evolution-of-my-sons-fixations/", "title": "From Circular Wheels to Circular Time; Reflections on the Evolution of my Son\u2019s\u00a0Fixations."},
{"date": "September 2, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Richard Masoner / Cyclelicious via Flickr \n Back in February 2011, Jon Brock of the most excellent blog, \u201cCracking the Enigma,\u201d wrote  a post about the current number of variations in autism diagnoses . He explained that the variations are important to researchers in the field, and to understanding autism (and autistic individuals) more generally. He performed a calculation of the different ways (essentially different combinations of symptoms) that can lead to an autism diagnosis under the  current DSM-IV , and reached the staggering number of 2027. That doesn\u2019t even include the full range of what has become known as the \u201cautism spectrum,\u201d such as Aspergers and PDD-NOS. That \u201cautism spectrum\u201d gets the official name (instead of just the five \u201cpervasive developmental disorders\u201d) under  the proposed DSM-5 , due to come in to effect in May 2013. The proposed DSM-5 makes  significant changes to the autism spectrum , such as  removing the terms \u201cAspergers\u201d and PDD-NOS , pushing  Retts  out of the DSM altogether, and shuffling around the  criteria for an autism diagnosis . Not surprisingly, these changes accompany a change in the number of ways you can get an autism diagnosis. There would no longer be 12 tick-the-box options under category A of the DSM-IV criteria for autism, as discussed in Brock\u2019s post. Instead, under the proposed DSM-5, there are four criteria that must be met for a diagnosis (A, B, C and D). Only criteria B has variations of things an autistic person might or might not have \u2013 the variant tick-the-box style that dominated the DSM-IV criteria. Within criteria B there are four options, at least two of which must be present for a diagnosis. Essentially, the criteria from DSM-IV has been shuffled into a new formation for the proposed DSM-5. By my own breakdown, the proposed criteria A (all of which would be compulsory for a diagnosis) groups together all the current criteria A (1) (social interaction) and some of A (2) (communication). The proposed criteria B (the one with 4 options), is a mix of some of the current A (2) and A (3) (repetitive behaviours and interests), plus a new consideration for sensory issues. The only significant removal from the current criteria, is (2) (a) about a delay or lack of spoken language. When it gets to the numbers, what all this means is that instead of over 2027 variations for an autism diagnosis under DSM-IV, the proposed DSM-5 brings that number down to only 11. Considering how much the huge variation under the old diagnostic criteria (even if it had been  far  less than the number calculated by Brock), can and does affect research and general statements and understanding of autism, that significant drop in variation numbers would be a real game-changer. With just 11 variations, it would be easier to research and draw wider-ranging conclusions about autism and those with an autism diagnosis. It\u2019s an interesting and important change to ponder, putting it into numbers just makes that change more stark and astounding. A huge thank you to Jon Brock of course for posing the original question and calculating the 2027 number. Another thank you to his commenter on that post,  mamafog,  for wondering how this would change in the DSM-5 thus prompting me to find out for myself. And an advanced apology if my 11 figure is somehow wrong; I ran the process past my husband who lectures in Economics and he reached the same figure as I did independently, so I\u2019m hopeful that means it\u2019s correct. Do let me know if I\u2019ve made a mistake and where the mistake has been made if you spot one!

{"date": "September 2, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Dear Teacher-named-Claire, When the taxi van pulled up today to drop my son off after school, you shouted at me and the taxi driver from across the other side of the road, that he wasn\u2019t allowed to stop there. You made your scowly face, and you swiped your hand at us irritatedly, and you did your best to make sure everyone saw your outrage. Even though the only other people present were the couple of students in bright vests doing the crossing guard with you. If you had calmly approached me to discuss the matter, that would have been OK, and I would have politely explained the situation; that my son has special needs, and there are frequently other special needs children in the van. That the taxi driver can\u2019t fit the van in our drive-way or bring my son to the door since he must stay with the vehicle the whole time. That my son is a danger to himself and so can\u2019t just be let out to find his own way to the front door. That the \u201chonk\u201d the driver sounds to let us know he\u2019s arrived, is often lost in the other road and neighbourhood noise, so the best he can do is briefly pull up outside our house in visual range \u2013 the far side of the crossing, a safe distance away from any crossers \u2013 so I can go get my son from the van. But no. You shouted. So, I shouted back (granting you the same respect), that my son has special needs and we wouldn\u2019t be long. But that didn\u2019t make you happy, you continued the shouting match, painting us some dastardly villains in your tidy mainstream world, where children can walk home and van drivers don\u2019t have to stay with their vehicles at all times. I could see your persisting outrage, which fed my own irritation, so I asked in the continued shouting match, whether you would like me to come talk to you about it. You said yes. You didn\u2019t offer to come to me, even though the crossing was no longer in use. You made me, my autistic child in one hand, his car seat in the other, and his bag on my back, cross the road to come to you. So you could lecture me. Not so you could hear my explanation, or reason with me. But so you could lecture me about how we were endangering children. The children who weren\u2019t even there because it was long enough after school that the only ones left were your crossing guards. You didn\u2019t let me speak, you just spoke over me, so my anger grew to the point that you actually had me shaking. That you wouldn\u2019t listen, that his disabilities meant nothing to you, that your concerns about children who weren\u2019t there to even be in danger, were more important to you than my actual special needs child standing right there in front of you. Strictly, legally speaking, you are probably in the right. But in terms of manners, decency, respect and compassion, and the morality that shapes the application of the law, you are dead wrong. You threw your weight around like a bully, shouting instead of talking to us with calm respect, and you brought out the worst in me in return. I hope I made your day you little control freak. You threatened to get the police involved, to come and tell us off for our yellow-line disability-van infringement. Police would have shown better judgment than you in this situation. Well behaved children would have shown better judgment than you in this situation. Teachers like you \u2013 who don\u2019t understand the challenges related to having a disabled child and don\u2019t care to understand \u2013 are one of the reasons I\u2019m glad I chose to send my son to a school which does understand and care. Where people listen before they lecture, and explain rather than order others around, by virtue of their brightly-coloured school-issue vest. I can only hope you treat your students with more respect than you treat a fellow adult, but somehow I doubt it. A&O. (And yes, I feel better having written this.

{"date": "September 4, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n As discussed in  my introductory post , I\u2019ll be reviewing (and to a certain extent, commenting) on the policies of the political parties running in the New Zealand 2011 General election, as to how they affect individuals and families who live with autism. The first party I\u2019ll be looking at is the Green Party, full name, \u201cGreen Party of Aotearoa New Zealand.\u201d The Green Party have been remarkably visible this year when autism has hit the headlines; responding with concern and support. Key examples are  World Autism Awareness Day  in April; speaking out  about the government insufficiently funding the charity \u201cAutism NZ,\u201d  when the Waikato branch shut down in July; and about  the dropping of the Charges against Arie Smith-Voorkamp  in August. The Green Party was one of only two political parties that responded to Autism NZ\u2019s request for answers to questions about policies relevant to autism families (the only other party that responded was the Maori party). Almost all of the content in the Green party\u2019s answers to Autism NZ (see page 3 of the  Autism NZ September newsletter ), can already be seen in their Disability Policy,  viewable here . There is a lot of cross-over, filler, and matters not directly relevant to autism, in these pieces, so I\u2019ve sifted through for major themes and promotions that I think are most important and interesting for families and individuals with autism. The overall attitude of the Green Party is pro facilitating inclusion, on the \u201csocial model of disability\u201d: \u201c the real obstacle to full participation in society by people with impairments is not the impairment itself but rather physical, environmental, social and organisational barriers, poorly informed attitudes, and inadequate support services .\u201d The Green Party pinpoints discrimination and negative attitudes towards impaired persons, as a serious barrier to their inclusion in society. To this end they\u2019d like to see more awareness campaigns supporting respect and equality for disabled individuals. They would also implement affirmative action to help overcome such barriers, in areas such as employment; including the attractive notion of setting up some way through which employers can let people know that they are affirmative action employers (such as via a website). They want to make sure disability awareness is a part of all courses for those working with directly with the public in public service roles. Indeed, they would like to see mandatory training about disability rights and needs as part of teacher education. The Green Party also wants to empower disabled people with the knowledge of their rights. They want to promote and encourage the ability of those with impairments to take on leadership roles. I was interested to see their awareness of how hard it can be for our children to take part in mainstream education, everything said here applies to our families in these situations: \u201c At the moment parents constantly have to advocate so school principals and trustees understand their obligations and work in positive, non-discriminatory ways. Some teacher education still does not include any component on supporting children with diverse needs. Many children living with impairments are made to feel unwelcome when enrolling at their local school, partly because of prejudice, but mainly because resources are not adequate to meet their needs. Some schools are sending children home at lunchtime or telling them to stay at home on days when there is no teacher aide .\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re also aware that those with \u201cmoderate needs\u201d often miss out on individual funding and have to rely on the goodwill of schools. Again, an issue very close to the heart of many parents of autistic children. To help address these problems, the Green Party wants to double the percentage of children receiving independent funding. They want to \u201c ensure all children have the absolute right to education in their local school and have the resources to support this, and that schools are accountable for the way they use disability funding. \u201d The Green Party also expresses concerns about how National Standards might impact on children with ASD (you can see  my own recent post on this issue, here ). Out of concern over inefficiencies and other problems rife in the provision of services to disabled individuals, the Green Party wants to see the formation of a Disability Issues Commission. They\u2019re aware that currently the \u201c funding support for people with impairments is immensely complex. \u201d This is again, very true for those of us seeking help for our autistic children. The Green Party is very pro individualised funding: \u201c Individualised funding has been trialed with some people \u2013 usually those whose needs are so complex that no service can meet them. It bypasses bureaucracy and the complexity that has evolved, giving control back to individuals and their families. \u201d Again, directly relevant to families with autistic children, they state they will: \u201c Review the Child Disability Allowance with a view to increasing the levels in acknowledgment of the extra financial needs that parents and caregivers have when raising a child with special needs .\u201d I was also very pleased to see their desire to: \u201c Improve inter-agency cooperation, streamline services and reduce the complexity of funding and the need for constant advocacy for basic entitlements. \u201d My overall impression of the Green Party is that they have impressive levels of awareness and responsiveness to the concerns and realities of autistic individuals and their families. They take disability rights seriously and intend to be proactive about making sure the rights just aren\u2019t there in theory, but also in practice. They show a rather developed understanding that the impact of disability is hugely affected by attitudes within society. Another point I haven\u2019t mentioned in the body of my post, but that they are very interested in addressing, is the relevance of cultural factors and experiences to providing supports to disabled people (with particular reference to Maori). I have tried to pull out the aspects of their policies that most impact on autism families. There is much more information there about policy on disability more generally, and that might particularly apply to autism families where more than one condition affects the individual. So I would encourage you to click-through on the links provided in my post if you want more information or details. Please note, I\u2019m not endorsing voting for the Greens, and I am not a member of the Green party, or indeed any other political party. No one has asked me, or paid me, to write these posts. If I become aware of the Green Party introducing any major changes to their policy relevant to autism pre the election, I will add it as a dated edit under this paragraph.

{"date": "August 14, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I am exhausted, which is a good reason not to write a post. But I have so many ideas and thoughts floating around in my head tonight, I can feel them slowly coming together, and it helps to organise my thoughts by writing them down, and especially by hearing the opinions and responses of others to those thoughts. So please excuse me if this post is a bit disorganised, and do feel free to help me make sense of this stream-of-consciousness. I no longer know how to categorise my autistic son. His autism was once so severe that the speech therapist couldn\u2019t say whether he\u2019d ever be able to speak a sentence (and we doubted it too). He self-harmed, other-harmed, destroyed property, screamed, cried, never wanted to try anything new and would have long-lasting anxiety attacks at any effort to do so. He was astoundingly hard to care for, it was like being trapped in a nightmare that had no end. I don\u2019t think I could ever forget the true horror, I don\u2019t think describing it could ever do it justice. But now. He behaves beautifully much of the time, with a bit of a naughty streak that you might expect of a child anyway. He struggles with language but he uses sentences and can make himself understood most of the time. He likes trying new things, though he does get caught up in requiring routine and predictability. He is becoming the child I thought I\u2019d never see in him. And I\u2019m really not sure how to think of these changes. I do think he will always be autistic; that the way he perceives and understands the world is via a mind very different from \u201cthe norm\u201d specifically because of his autism. And that perhaps the impact of autism on how he sees the world will always be quite strong because he was once so severely affected by all its symptoms from such a very young age. I don\u2019t think of him as a high functioning autistic now, though compared to how he once was, he might be considered that. And I suppose that is the correct focus for me; comparing how  he  was to how  he  is now. Figuring out if someone else\u2019s child is more or less autistic than my own increasingly feels like a fool\u2019s game, with no real benefit. All I need to know  as his mother , is that my own son is improving. I dare not call him \u201cmildly autistic\u201d even though that\u2019s closer to the truth now than severely autistic. It has been a while since I did call him severely autistic; I tend to leave off any descriptor other than \u201cclassic\u201d autism, which remains accurate. I\u2019m trying to understand that fear over using a gentler describing word, like \u201cmild.\u201d I think it\u2019s partly a worry that people will not treat him with the extra consideration and support he needs otherwise, but that\u2019s probably the old me speaking; the me who had to fight to get him the help he needed and now has. I also think it\u2019s partly because I took so long to understand and come to terms with what it meant to be a mother of a severely autistic child. I know a part of me is also worried that if I get too hopeful or complacent, that I risk utter despair all over again as reality comes crashing down; no point dreaming of rainbows when you\u2019re still facing the storm. I know his autism affects him in waves; some weeks are good, with challenges everyday but ones I and he can handle. Other weeks, the challenges are so intense that the old hopelessness and worry for his life, pulls me under again. But there is that overall strong trend of improvement that keeps me going through the worst times. I often wonder and worry about his life ten years, twenty years from now. Will he be able to have a job, a girlfriend, have children? Will he be able to buy his own food, wash his own clothes, drive a car? But I remind myself; he is five. Only five. If he has come this far in the space of two / three years, who knows where he\u2019ll be in even one more year. I don\u2019t know how severe an impact his autism will have on his future, and worrying about it distracts from the here and now, which is where my mind and efforts need to be. The more I focus on helping him right now, at his current level of development, the brighter I can help make his future too. So yes, I think he will always be autistic as such, but I think the import of that statement will lessen over time for him. He is getting close to the point where I think he will notice and ask about his differences from \u201cnormal\u201d children, and I suspect the way I explain his differences to him will be very important to how he views himself and his potential. (I think about the conversation a lot, if anyone has any helpful links about how to explain these things realistically and kindly to their child, I would be grateful for the guidance.) Which is to say, it will come to matter less whether I see him as lower or higher functioning, and it will matter more how he views  himself . I love the idea of that shift; that he will be able to comprehend and consider what autism means, and the most important battle will be his to have. Not because I think my opinion of autism won\u2019t matter or affect him, of course it does. And not because I look forward to his potential struggles to make sense of his differences, of course I don\u2019t. But because he will be capable of having that conversation with me, and his own opinion of himself will take the rightful place as fore-front in my views of autism. What an amazing thought; to know what  he  thinks of autism someday. The very idea just leaves me breathless. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Camomile_Colza_and_Rainbow_01.JPG"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/my-changing-son-and-what-autism-might-mean-to-him/", "title": "My changing son, and what autism might mean to\u00a0him."},
{"date": "August 20, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Yesterday I went to watch my five year-old son run the cross-country at school. On the way home in the car I was shuddering and wiping tears from my eyes. I\u2019m going to tell you what happened. My son attends a mainstream school, as far as the school grounds and school uniform go. But his class is a \u201csatellite class;\u201d all the students in that single classroom have special needs, and the classroom resources and teachers are from a special needs school based at a different location. The whole mainstream school \u2013 including the classroom my son attends \u2013 took part in the cross-country during the school day. Parents were invited to attend. The children run by age group, so my son\u2019s grouping was early on in the day. He was in the second \u201cheat\u201d (basically, the second rather large grouping of children for that age group). The group included only a few children from the special needs class, the rest of the many children were all mainstream. As the starting gun fired he set off, me on the side-lines watching on proudly. Proud because he understood what was required of him on this occasion, and proud because he was able and willing to do it. Within metres he was last of the pack, even though he was running as fast as his legs would carry him. My son looks like any normal child, but his autism affects his gross movement; he doesn\u2019t run well, it\u2019s a sort of rolling gait that most people might not notice. And his ankles roll in significantly, so he wears orthotics to correct the alignment (and thereby address the consequent muscle and bone issues). He has always had notably low muscle tone, particularly in his core. He has trouble coordinating movement in general. (I\u2019ve been told that all of these issues are results of his autism; he has no comorbid conditions causing these problems.) So I see my boy run, and already I know he\u2019s doing something great. He continues to be last as he reaches the top of the hill and turns to the right. But he is still running as fast as he can, so I am smiling my motherly head off. I am impressed that he follows the route and I am glad to see him not running away as he has a tendency to do. I notice that a teacher and some other student seem to be lagging back with him, and as they get closer to the finish line I can see that it is one of the special needs assistance teachers, and one of his own classmates, actively encouraging and directing him; it is harder for him to figure out which way to go now that almost everyone else has crossed the finish line and there\u2019s not really anyone left to follow. As he pulls into the final straight, I can see all the next heat of children anxiously waiting for the starting gun, which will not fire until the last child from the previous heat crosses the line. My son. So everyone is watching, waiting, and I am ashamed that a small part of me feels exposed and worried that my boy is holding everyone up. This isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about my son. I refocus as he nears the finish line; I shift his baby brother to my other hip as he tries to wiggle free, trying to draw his attention to his clever older brother running his cross-country race. As my son crosses the finish line all the parents there don\u2019t breathe a loud sigh of relief and turn to watch their own children running the next race. They don\u2019t mutter or make impatient faces. They cheer. And they clap. For my boy. The boy who came last but ran the whole way and did it with a smile. They are happy he has finished, not because they\u2019re glad the race finished, but because they see the dedication and joy in what he has just accomplished. It\u2019s written all over his beautiful face, for everyone to see. And what a sight it is. I felt a wave of emotion just engulf me. The classmate who stayed with him out on the field, clapping and encouraging him along. The parents who genuinely cheered and clapped as he crossed the line. And my little man doing something that doesn\u2019t come easily or naturally, but doing it as best he can. I gave him a cuddle and my goodbyes; I had to get his by-now very tired and increasingly grumpy brother, back to the car and home for a nap. As I walk back to the car I feel the tears start. I\u2019m embarrassed by the tears; walking in bright sunlight in public, openly crying. And I don\u2019t even know for sure why I\u2019m crying. It\u2019s a mix of emotions that I still can\u2019t quite pin down and describe. I was just over-whelmed, by so many aspects of the experience. There is something I can say for the whole experience. It was like a metaphor of what I want for my son\u2019s life. I want him to try to be part of the world and take part in the world. I want him to try his best, and challenge himself. I want him to be supported by friends and mentors along the way. And I want those observing his life to rejoice in the achievements he makes, even though he\u2019s not about to win the race. And I want him to know that his mother will always be watching proudly from the sidelines, celebrating him and his achievements along the way. I hope that all of that is not too much to expect for his life. He may have placed last in a cross-country, but my son was still a winner that day, in more ways than even he may ever know. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:XCgunstart.JPG"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/the-last-placing-winner/", "title": "The Last-placing Winner"},
{"date": "October 30, 2010", "body": "Image via Wikipedia It is hard navigating the minefield of modern parenting\u2026  even harder when you hit an actual mine before you make your first  parenting decision. It would have been nice if the only issues I had to  deal with were the hot topics of\u00a0 whether to let my kid watch TV, or go  to preschool before three years old, or breastfeed versus bottle-feed. Despite popular myth, it didn\u2019t take a bad  parenting decision about vaccinating my child that sealed my son\u2019s fate \u2013  rather, the signs of Autism were there from the start, and we just didn\u2019t recognise them. I try not  to beat myself up about that since the medical experts in my son\u2019s  infant life also failed to pick up on it until it was so obvious that  everyone had formed a theory about what was going on with him \u2013 even my  neighbour\u2019s three year old had a theory (I kid you not \u2013 we\u2019ll get to  that in another post). On a weekly basis I have to deal with  theories about what caused our son\u2019s Autism, or how to fix it. On almost  a daily basis I have to deal with opinions from other parents of Autistic kids who do things differently, or parents of \u201cnormal\u201d kids who want to  share their insights. Far too often I also have to deal with  conflicting advice from the therapists assigned to my son. So I\u2019ve  decided to start this blog to wade my way through the mess \u2013 to keep a  record of the good and the not so good, the helpful and the hateful, and  to vent my frustrations and share my joys.

{"date": "October 30, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n When my son was three, we started taking him to a \u201cplaygroup\u201d for Autistic preschoolers. Quite a few of my experiences that I\u2019ll be sharing on this blog, come from what I heard and saw there. One that surprised me \u2013 but really shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 was the suggestion that I stop trying to toilet-train my child since if I was successful it lowered the liklihood of receiving adequate government funding and support. I initially thought the comment was made in jest, but no it wasn\u2019t, and yes it was a correct statement. My son\u2019s government appointed Educational Psychologist confirmed how wide-spread the attitude was when she told me of her own accord many months later, that I shouldn\u2019t hold off toilet-training my son just to secure his government funding. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 it had never crossed my mind to intentionally not toilet-train him \u2013 who would want their child in expensive nappies, that you have to change many times a day? Who would actually want their child to live like that? All parents want their kids past the nappy stage as soon as possible. Government support is nice, but not changing a four year old\u2019s nappies is even better (and no we\u2019re not rich enough that the support wouldn\u2019t have made a difference). I was insulted that the Educational Psychologist would think I would intentionally not toilet-train him, but because of that original conversation months prior, I at least understood where her comment was coming from and didn\u2019t take it as personally as I might otherwise have. I did eventually get him toilet-trained, when he was four and a half. How I successfully achieved this after years on trying, is an interesting story that I\u2019ll share in another post. And yes the success did and does affect the level of support and educational funding he receives. But you couldn\u2019t pay me to put him back in nappies, and I\u2019d accuse you of being sick if you tried. The way the funding is set up it does encourage parents not to toilet-train their special needs kids. And even though most (all?) of those parents will do their best to achieve toilet-training anyway, it casts a cruelly suspicious light on those who don\u2019t succeed \u2013 as seen in the otherwise un-necessary words of my son\u2019s Educational Psychologist. So no matter which way you come at it, the situation stinks. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Toilet_in_german_theater_munich.JPG"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/dont-toilet-train-your-kid/", "title": "Don\u2019t Toilet-Train your\u00a0Kid!"},
{"date": "August 15, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n The publication of the DSM-5 is still a long way off (May 2013). But critiques of its  proposed changes  to the existing definitions and criteria in DSM-IV, for autism and associated conditions, are well underway. I am very interested in not only understanding the changes, but also understanding those critiques. In this post I will attempt to summarise what I\u2019ve come across as the main criticisms of the changes. This post is not intended as a summary of the merits or strengths of those critiques, just an effort to compile them at this point. 1. The  removal of Aspergers . Aspergers is currently a separately identifiable condition; making up one of the five pervasive developmental disorders that are widely known as the autism spectrum. The DSM-5 proposal has the title of \u201cAspergers\u201d removed, and subsumed instead under the new \u201cAutism Spectrum Disorder\u201d (ASD). Most of the concerns with this proposal seem to turn around the meaning and community that individuals have attached to the word \u201cAspergers,\u201d rather than concern that people with Aspergers will no longer fit-in or receive support under the new ASD criteria. There is also worry from those already within the heading of \u201cclassic autism:\u201d (1) That the addition of people with Aspergers to the name \u201cautism\u201d in this way, will confuse the public into thinking autism is less severe than it often is; and (2) that it will result in a lessening of the much-needed supports that they are already fighting hard to establish. 2. The exclusion of the intellectually disabled. The new criteria for ASD, has an exclusionary criteria, in as far as the \u201cpersistent deficits in social communication and social interaction\u201d of those with ASD, must be \u201c not accounted for by general developmental delay .\u201d \u201cGeneral developmental delay\u201d in this context appears to refer to a variety of other possibilities, such as an \u201c intellectual or global developmental delay  not elsewhere specified\u201d or an \u201c intellectual developmental disorder .\u201d The complaint about this aspect of the proposal, is (1) that this exclusionary criteria is a political move; trying to exclude genuinely autistic individuals, in order to further the agenda of high-functioning autistics, and (2) distorting of the reality that a large proportion of autistic people do have intellectual disabilities. 3. The  removal of PDD-NOS . \u201cPervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\u201d (PDD-NOS), will be subsumed into ASD (somewhat like \u201cAspergers\u201d will be). There are other categories those who currently have PDD-NOS might also go under instead of ASD, particularly the new category of  Social Communication Disorder  (SCD). The key concern here seems to be that those currently listed as PDD-NOS might lose the much-needed assistance that comes with recognition of being on the autism spectrum, if they were to be removed from it. There is also general anxiety as to the uncertainty where these children will now go: Under ASD; SCD; some other disorder; or out of the DSM altogether. 3. The  severity scale . There are concerns that the new severity scale for ASD will be difficult to apply consistently or in a meaningful fashion, and that the misapplication of the scale might have serious consequences for these individuals (including affecting support levels and distorting the experiences and challenges of those slotted into the scale). These four categories of concerns only represent a portion of the actual changes to the criteria for an ASD diagnosis. Many other changes \u2013 some subtle, some major \u2013 will come in as well but do not seem to be garnering as much concern or rhetoric as those I\u2019ve listed above. I suspect this will change as May 2013 approaches and those affected by the changes become more aware of how it might impact them.

{"date": "May 1, 2012", "body": "I write over twice as many posts as I ever publish. Sometimes it\u2019s because I want to think further over what I\u2019ve written (and never come back to the post because life gets in the way). But the vast majority of the time, I choose not to hit \u201cpublish\u201d because I suspect my post will be taken the wrong way or upset someone (or a group of someones) that I don\u2019t want to upset. This is a sad state of affairs, since one of the reasons I started my blog was as a personal outlet, and a way to investigate and discuss sometimes-controversial ideas, and it has been very valuable for me (and apparently others) as such.  The post below is one of those posts I didn\u2019t publish; it was written a few days ago and I was going to leave it on my dashboard like all the others. But due to the issue continuing to run around in my mind, and be present in so many discussions I come across, I\u2019m going to share it anyway. I know some are going to react poorly to it, but I\u2019m tired of paralyzing my self-expression and sharing of experiences, just to attempt the impossible task of keeping everyone else happy; that point is part of why I\u2019m sharing this post (as you\u2019ll see), but also deserves a post in itself at some point. For now though: I must start this post by saying that I do think language choice can make a difference to perceptions and understandings of autism; that negative language can be detrimental and foster incorrect views about autism, and that positive (or neutral) language can encourage acceptance and better understanding. However, I\u2019ve often seen these \u201clanguage corrections\u201d been used to shut down discussion, and to exclude people from taking part in discussions. Such language corrections also often come hand-in-hand with condescending and judgmental attitudes, that also serve to make the person being corrected feel belittled and shamed, regardless of the message or experience they were attempting to share. In this post I am going to talk about this aspect of \u201cpolitically correct autism rhetoric.\u201d I am not pre-supposing the value (or lack of value) of such language corrections; that is a related and important topic, but not one central to this post (as I hope I will make clear). First off, what sort of language corrections am I talking about here? Some examples: \u201cneurotypical\u201d instead of \u201cnormal;\u201d \u201cperson with autism\u201d instead of \u201cautistic\u201d (or swapped around, depending on your preference); \u201ccondition\u201d instead of \u201cdisorder;\u201d and \u201cdifferently abled\u201d instead of \u201cdisabled.\u201d It is hard \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to discuss autism without falling into some or all of these language pitfalls. In fact, it is so difficult to maintain the \u201ccorrect language\u201d that even when you carefully change your word-choice to match the version you were last told to use, you\u2019re as-often a target for someone else who thinks you\u2019ve made an error too. There is nothing wrong with arguing for a particular language choice in addition to a substantive comment responding to what has been said. Perhaps the writer is sharing their experience with autism and wasn\u2019t aware of their faux-pas, in which case a response to the content of what they have said, accompanied by a side-point about the language they\u2019ve used, would be perfectly appropriate and even educational. Far too often though what I come across is comments that do not respond to the content of what someone has said, but instead solely attack a word being used. Even worse, these attacks on chosen-words are rarely accompanied by an explanation of why the writer should have chosen different words. For example, I think we\u2019ve all come across someone who replies to a post \u201cit\u2019s person with autism, not autistic person\u201d without any further comment.\u00a0 Or \u201cit\u2019s not a disorder, it\u2019s a condition\u201d, or \u201cdon\u2019t use the word normal.\u201d These sorts of quick-dump comments, may leave the commenter feeling righteous and superior, but they leave the original writer feeling like not a word they have said was taken in or considered important. If anything, I suggest such comments leave a bad impression of the commenter, and may even lead to resistance to change on behalf of the original writer, since their intent and meaning is evidently considered less important or relevant than a poorly chosen word. Many people who are new to autism rhetoric, can be overwhelmed by these endless corrections. I\u2019ve read comments and posts by some who were scared away from either writing about or commenting on autism, because nothing they ever said was \u201cright;\u201d no matter how kind, correct or insightful their actual writing is. Obviously particular posts \u2013 such as those directly reflecting on language choice and the effect of language choice \u2013 openly invite comment on wording; because that is the content of the post. And there are times when the language used through-out a post is used in support of a particular view about autism; where the language is used to intentionally reinforce a view without otherwise confronting the assumptions hidden in the language choice. Again though, the appropriate response to such writing is to explain to the author that their language choice is \u201cin error\u201d and why; merely telling them they shouldn\u2019t use a word, or should replace it with another, is unlikely to impact on someone who has put such thought in the first place into their deliberate choice of words. If one doesn\u2019t want to explain the issue each time, it\u2019s not hard to add more explanation and relevance to the language correction, by using a link to an explanation of what terms are preferred and why. The internet is chock-full of that sort of goodness. I for one always click-through to links people provide in comments, and have learnt a lot from doing so over the years. Surely it makes sense to presuppose the interest and intelligence of a writer, than to presume that they will mend their ways now that you\u2019ve told them off. I\u2019ve got so used to trying to respond to the different autism rhetorics, that I will tend to use entirely different grab-bags of language depending on what sort of writer I am responding to. If it\u2019s a new parent coming to terms with autism, I don\u2019t drown them in \u201cyou\u2019re speaking about it wrong\u201d discussions, because that is not what those parents need; they\u2019re already in a new world of scary unknowns, I wouldn\u2019t want to isolate them further. Some blogs I visit intentionally use language that is more \u201caggressive\u201d / traditional / medical (if you will) than the politically correct versions. If I want to comment on what those bloggers have written, I will avoid using language that I know will pit them against listening to what I have to say; the discussion and its content is more important than semantics (again, unless semantics are actually central to the post or what\u2019s at issue). Similarly, I make the effort on other blogs to use the language that they find most respectful and most accurate; again, so that the discussion won\u2019t be side-lined by debates over language choice. This doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have strong views about certain word choices; I do. For some words I don\u2019t have preferences or my views are continuing to evolve or change. And so I actively seek out posts about language choice and pay attention when people intelligently argue one way or the other. But I do not let those debates overwhelm meaningful exchanges with others; I want to understand the point someone is trying to make, even when they struggle to find the \u201cright\u201d words to make it. Autism, and living with autism, is challenging enough, without trying to satisfy every autism-faction with your word choice. I\u2019m going to end on the point that I have already tried to make clear, but I know it will suit some agendas to ignore my insistence: I am  not  saying language doesn\u2019t matter; it does. I am  not  saying we shouldn\u2019t correct upsetting or incorrect wording choices; we should. I  am  saying that we shouldn\u2019t let language choice dominate or override otherwise meaningful exchanges, and that the content of a post shouldn\u2019t be ignored because we don\u2019t like word choice (I\u2019ve seen plenty of instances too where commenters have claimed the author doesn\u2019t mean what they\u2019re saying \u2013 for example, that despite professed love, they clearly hate their child \u2013 since they used the \u201cwrong words\u201d). I think it is meaningful \u2013 and more helpful \u2013 to discuss language choice  alongside  discussions about autism, rather than let them dominate and shut-down otherwise important dialogues. In a community where communication issues are a central concern anyway, I\u2019d have hoped to see more understanding and tolerance of language \u201cmistakes\u201d made along the way. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/concern-over-politically-correct-autism-rhetoric/", "title": "Concern Over Politically Correct Autism\u00a0Rhetoric"},
{"date": "August 19, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n There\u2019s a fine line between giftedness and Aspergers.  This thought-provoking and carefully considered article , explains to a certain extent how closely related the two can be (or more precisely, can seem to be). There are people \u2013 including professionals \u2013 who hold to the position that to be gifted is to have Aspergers; but they tend not to believe the inverse, that having Aspergers is the same as being gifted. Clearly the claim that Aspergers and giftedness are the same in some regard, can be a confused and distorting view. If one insists on a relationship between them, surely it makes sense to think of them as potentially \u201cco-morbid:\u201d That sometimes people who have Aspergers are gifted, and sometimes they\u2019re not. Similarly, sometimes people who are gifted have Aspergers, and sometimes they don\u2019t. How tightly related the two \u201cconditions\u201d are, might reflect confused and imprecise diagnostic practices, rather than a \u201ctrue\u201d relationship between them. The difference matters. We need to know whether a child is struggling to relate to others and make their way in the world, due to functioning at a much higher level than their peers, or due to a neurological condition which makes these tasks fundamentally more difficult and challenging. One of the reasons this matters so much, is because of how you then address the problems: Do you respond to their difficulties by actively extending their education and increasing interactions with those of much higher intellect than their peers; or do you respond to their challenges by giving them remedial assistance and addressing their anxieties and behaviours with therapies and maybe even drugs. (Or, indeed, do all of the above, since the child is gifted  and  has Aspergers.) Will the changes to Aspergers placement in the  DSM-5 (due to come into effect in May 2013) , make the distinction between giftedness and Aspergers, better or worse? Having looked over the differences, my opinion is it will make the distinction much clearer. Indeed, those who are gifted and as a consequence of their giftedness were diagnosed as having Aspergers, would appear to be likely to drop off the autism spectrum under the DSM-5. And those who have problems that are not caused by giftedness, appear likely to slip quite easily into the new Autism Spectrum Disorder category. Allow me to explain how I\u2019ve reached that view. Here is  the current (DSM-IV) criteria for Aspergers. If you read the article I linked to at the start of my post, you\u2019ll see how it would be quite easy for a gifted child to fall into Aspergers so-defined. In particular, the observed social impairments under \u201cA\u201d could be a consequence of being gifted. And the behaviour under \u201cB\u201d \u2013 particularly the intense focused interests under (1) \u2013 would be easily met by many (most?) gifted children too. Ticking the rest of the boxes in the list is easily done, especially since being gifted can \u2013 and often does \u2013 isolate a child socially. Voila, you have Aspergers. So how does this change for DSM-5? DSM-5  removes Aspergers  from the DSM altogether, but specifically folds Aspergers into the newly defined  Autism Spectrum Disorder  (Aspergers was already considered as being on the autism spectrum, the change just makes that even more explicit). It will be harder for a gifted child to be mistaken for a child with Aspergers, considering they now need to exhibit persistent deficits in social interaction and social communication across all three areas under \u201cA\u201d. But of particular note, it\u2019s no longer enough to have intense interests (like under B (1) that I mentioned above, now represented by B (3)). Rather, the child must meet two of the criteria under B, ie, something  more  than just intense interest in an area. It\u2019s arguable too that the requirement under D that the symptoms limit and impair everyday functioning, will be harder to show for a gifted child than the previous DSM-IV requirement that it significantly impairs social \u201cor other important areas\u201d of functioning. So it seems to me, that the proposed changes to the DSM will help separate the \u201cmerely\u201d gifted, from those with a neurological impairment. Hopefully leading to a clarification of relevant treatments and responses in general to the child. (I have focused on the child rather than the adult through-out this post, since there are consequences for a child\u2019s education and the way their self-image is formed, in a way that is  usually  going to be much more impactful and severe than for an adult.) These changes do  not  mean someone could not have Autism Spectrum Disorder (for example, they were previously diagnosed as having Aspergers) and be gifted at the same time. It still seems most correct to think of these two conditions as sometimes occurring together: There is nothing inherent in autism that means you aren\u2019t highly intelligent, or inherent in giftedness that means you can\u2019t have autism. In summary then, there is clearly some modern confusion about where to draw the line between Aspergers and giftedness. The drawing of that line does have serious consequences, particularly for treatments / therapies and education. The proposed changes to the DSM \u2013 that abolish Aspergers and fold it into a new criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder \u2013 would seem to clarify that distinction between giftedness and Aspergers. In turn, I would be hopeful that the resultant clarity will also mean more accurate and helpful responses to the challenges faced by these remarkable children. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/5464232/Autistic-or-just-brilliant/", "http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=97#", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=97#", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/distinguishing-giftedness-from-aspergers-will-the-dsm-5-help/", "title": "Distinguishing Giftedness from Aspergers; will the DSM-5\u00a0help?"},
{"date": "April 2, 2012", "body": "Please note that this post is an attempt to bring together a range of ideas and concerns I\u2019ve been grappling with for a while, rather than a definitive version of my view on all these issues. It is \u201cunpolished\u201d, but I still want to share it in the hope that others\u2019 insights will help me clarify and refine what I\u2019m trying to get across. \n I do not have to justify the existence of my son. I do not accept the notion that a worth of a person is tied into what they can do for someone else. My son has basic rights by virtue of his being a human in a humane society;  not  by virtue of what he can do for someone (or everyone) else around him. Yet I very frequently read the view \u2013 even from disability rights advocates \u2013 that the value of my son, as an autistic child, is tied to the hidden potential he has to enhance everyone\u2019s else\u2019s life: That his hidden savant talent or hidden high IQ will allow him to solve world hunger or write the ultimate computer program; that he should be allowed into a mainstream school because it will enrich the lives of the  other  children. So I\u2019m not surprised when I read stories about autistic children being used as  a stepping-stone to another child\u2019s fame , or about  businesses gloating about using cheap autistic labour and expecting everyone to pat them on the back . It\u2019s how they\u2019ve been taught to value autistic people, in part by autistic people who are arguing for equal rights but who have accepted the rhetoric that human value comes from what we can do for others. I want to be clear that I do think that messages about hidden talents and great potential can be important, where it helps the public to understand that autism can get in the way of appreciating and accessing a person\u2019s \u201cwholeness\u201d; their own voice, their skills, their potential. That providing adequate support and services can help an autistic person towards independence, to form loving relationships, and achieve employment. But that message \u2013 about the nature and challenges of autism \u2013 is far too often linked to the idea that the  value  of autistic person lies in those unseen and unknown abilities. Not only should we not see a human\u2019s basic value in this way, it is also dangerously distorting for autistic individuals; supporting the idea that autistic people who  don\u2019t  have high IQs or hidden savant talents, are either thereby not  truly  autistic, or are of lesser human value. It ironically encourages parents to not accept and love the child they have, but the child they might one day have; ironic because acceptance is so much of the message of the disability rights movements. The fact is some autistic children will always remain non-verbal, or of excessively low functioning levels (etc). Telling parents that their child has fallen short not just of the normal human ideal, but also the mystical autism ideal (the high IQ or savant for instance), is a sort of un-necessary cruelty that I think few really understand unless they have lived their daily lives with the care of such children. There are no prognosis promises, no magic cures, with autism. Nor are there any promises of a bright and happy future for any other child (disabled or otherwise). We don\u2019t just love children because of what they might be someday, we love them because of who they are right here, right now. If we encourage people to only value our autistic children for what they might become, we are just encouraging them to see those who can\u2019t and don\u2019t reach that supposed potential, as failures. To see their parents as failures too. The fact is the vast majority of autistic people are going to be painted then as failures in a society that primarily values them for their \u201chidden\u201d astounding talents that will better the world for everyone else. So much media attention is given to this idealised autistic person \u2013 so much focus on the unusual and high-end talents, or the \u201cmiracle recoveries\u201d \u2013 that the more simple yet wonderous achievements of autistic people are ignored. The autistic people who learn to drive, get employment at all, have relationships and have children; these wonderful things that enhance their own lives \u2013 instead of focusing on autism as a side-show to benefit the rest in society \u2013 get side-lined. Those who overcome the enormous challenges autism presents to them in order to get some level of independence, to live their own idea of \u201cthe good life\u201d without reference to everyone else\u2019s versions, need to be seen and heard more. Their stories might not make for flashy headlines, but they make you cry with joy and take pleasure in achievement in the face of serious adversity. They make us celebrate achievement in reference to the  individual themself , not in reference to \u201ceveryone else.\u201d It makes sense in a democracy supported by taxes to take an interest in whether someone can contribute to the pool of resources we all draw on in times of extreme need. But that interest is that people have genuine need when they draw on the resources, and that those who can contribute do (rather than, say, those who actively choose to draw down resources without intent of ever adding to them). Autism is relevant here in regards to genuine need; through no fault of their own many autistic people need higher levels of support. As a caring society, we provide accordingly. And we know that we may find our lives or our children\u2019s in the same needy situation some day, so most of us accept this arrangement as necessary and moral. But these concerns do not mean it is a kindness to say all autistic people can one day contribute more than they will need; it\u2019s unlikely to be true and it creates false expectations from society about what autistic people can and will do. In turn, creating cynicism from a public asked to support autistic adults who haven\u2019t \u201creached\u201d that magical potential the public was promised (I\u2019m increasingly encountering forum discussions attacking autistic adults for not getting jobs, calling them lazy and not \u201ctruly\u201d disabled). It is true that higher levels of support and services from a younger age can help very many autistic people reach higher levels of skill and functioning in life (relative to themselves otherwise), in turn lowering the required costs to help them live their lives as adults. But this needs to be a separate argument from some overall picture of what all autistic people can achieve with adequate support. The focus must remain on how it can help  that individual  towards a better life and independence, without ultimate referral to super-talents (or otherwise) of the few. If we don\u2019t like human lives been ground-down into \u201cmoney-in, money-out\u201d, the response should not be \u201cbut really these people can be amazing in-puts to society, just look at this amazing example\u2026\u201d. Rather, the response should be a reaffirmation of humanity and of a society that supports those who need it when they need it. Otherwise you\u2019re just buying into a view that will always ultimately view the disabled as lesser human beings, in general and within society. If my son has the same rights as everyone else, it is not because of some idealised version of what he might one day be or what he can do for others, it is because of who he is  right now . He is a human being. Promising or pretending he will be something \u201cmore\u201d than what he is now, just buys into the rhetoric of those who would treat my son as a less worthy human being by virtue of his disability. If he becomes an amazing savant, has a tremendous hidden IQ, or will one day enrich everyone else\u2019s life as much as he has mine, then so be it. But if he doesn\u2019t \u2013 if he can\u2019t \u2013 it does not detract from his being human, and deserving to be treated with humanity. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/shereen84/3187315381/", "http://thautcast.com/drupal5/content/kathie-lee-gifford-laughs-autistic-boys-sadness-howard-stern-attacks", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.co.nz/2012/03/jabberwocky-of-day-businessweek-on.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/the-objectification-of-autistic-people/", "title": "The Objectification of Autistic\u00a0People"},
{"date": "April 8, 2012", "body": "Figuring out what benefits \u2013 if any \u2013 you can access from the government, to help financially support a child (or adult) with autism, can be quite a daunting task. I\u2019ve encountered many people with an autistic child who have never heard of the Child Disability Allowance, and I\u2019ve encountered parents who have simply assumed that their autistic child will qualify for \u201cthe disability allowance\u201d once they reach 16. So I\u2019ve decided \u2013 for my own education as well as others\u2019 \u2013 to pull together what information I can about what benefits and allowances are available specifically for families raising an autistic child (or for an autistic adult). I will not include the more generic benefits and allowances that can be applied for independent of autism / disability. Neither am I attempting in this post to cover the government-paid services and supports (including therapists, carer support, and respite). But it is worth knowing that the benefits I discuss in this post are not the sole government supplied funding and services available to autism families. I\u2019ll provide links at the end of the post to point you in the right direction for more information and help in those areas, and may do future posts to expand on those topics too. I\u2019m going to provide a list of the benefits and allowances, including picking out vital criteria, how the benefits relate to each other, and I\u2019ll mention (where it\u2019s otherwise not clear or obvious) on whether the severity of autism impacts on eligibility: The  Child Disability Allowance  (CDA) ( comprehensive pdf link,  and the  WINZ website summary page ). The CDA is paid to the caregiver (typically parent) of a disabled child. The child must meet these criteria: \n under 18 years old, \n has a serious disability (including sensory, intellectual and neurological disabilities), \n requires constant care and attention because of that disability (which goes beyond the amount otherwise required for a child that age), and \n is likely to require that attention for more than 12 months. \n It is  not  income-tested, and can be received while also receiving the Disability Allowance ( see below ). If the child qualifies for an Invalid\u2019s Benefit at the age of 16 ( also see below ), then the parent can no longer receive the CDA . There is a review period that will differ from child to child; the time frame is suggested by the medical practitioner who fills out the required medical certificate. Whether a child qualifies at all and how long the review period is, will depend on the severity of the autism; autism is not an automatic qualifying condition, though it is expressly recognised as a potentially qualifying condition. The current weekly rate is $45.34 ( link to the latest rate , updated as the amount changes). The  Disability Allowance  ( WINZ webpage ) is available to the person affected by a disability, and can be applied for by the caregiver if the child is under 18. It is for those who need help with costs associated with everyday tasks or ongoing medical care. It can be received  in addition  to other main benefits. This benefit  is   income-tested . The amount you receive under this benefit depends on actual costs associated with the disability (unlike the CDA), including costs for specialists, prescriptions fees, and travel costs (if those costs aren\u2019t already covered by another agency of course). The maximum weekly payment for this allowance is $60.17 ( link to latest rate ). Domestic Purposes Benefit \u2013 Care of Sick or Infirm  (DPB-CSI) ( WINZ page , and more extensive  pdf guide ). This benefit provides financial assistance to carers (but not if those carers are spouses or partners), who care at home for someone who would otherwise need high and special levels of care elsewhere. The person being cared for must require access to 24 hour care and attention (but need not actually receive that many hours of attention everyday from the carer). The home where the care is happening, can be that of the carer or the cared-for person. This benefit is income-tested. The amount received under this benefit  depends on circumstances; it\u2019s around $200 to $300 per week . This benefit  can be applied for retrospectively  too. Autism is included in the list of illustrative examples of conditions that might qualify, again, the severity of the impact of the autism is essential for determining whether someone qualifies or not. Like the CDA, there is a potential review period involved too. Similarly, a medical certificate is required. Invalid\u2019s Benefit  ( WINZ webpage ) is available to people over the age of 16 who are severely limited in their ability to work because of their disability. The individual must be unable to regularly work 15 hours or more a week. Proof of the condition is required (though this need not be a medical certificate). A person may not qualify if they have other money to live on, such as a partner\u2019s income. Payments again depend on individual circumstance; they vary between $207 to $336 per week. It is possible to work and still receive the Invalid\u2019s Benefit (including over 15 hours a week on a trial period). The amount received from work can impact on the weekly amount from the Invalid\u2019s Benefit. This benefit is reviewable. The  Sickness Benefit  ( WINZ webpage ) is like a step down from the severity required for the Invalid\u2019s Benefit. It is available to those over 18 (and those who are 16 and 17 if they live with a partner and have children). This benefit is for those who have had to stop work due to their disability, or who are finding it hard to look for work or find full-time work due to their disability. It is income tested, and a medical certificate is required. Payments again depend on individual circumstances, and vary from $136 to $293 per week. Other income is allowed, and will impact the benefit amount after a certain point. The sickness benefit is reviewable too. So those are the five main autism-relevant benefits / allowances I could find, and the best sense I could make of them based on what I found. There are numerous other benefits and allowances that are available to autistic people and their families too, based on circumstances independent of their disability. Examples include: \n The  Accommodation Supplement \n Various payments made in situations of  Financial Hardship . \n Working For Families \n I must of course emphasize that you need to speak to WINZ directly to figure out whether you or your child might actually qualify, and what else you might qualify for besides what I\u2019ve found, but I think it is helpful to have some idea of what is currently available (this information will become out-dated over time, I\u2019ll update it or provide links to my updates when I become aware of such changes). If talking to WINZ is a bit nerve-wracking, you can contact a charity like  Autism NZ  or  IHC  to support you in finding the information and accessing the funding. I have found it particularly useful to have gone through this fact-finding exercise; I hope some others have found it useful to read too! Please do let me know if you spot any errors in my information, and what if any of these supports you have qualified for, and how hard (or easy) it was to qualify based on autism. Thanks! *** Links to a couple of my previous posts looking at the supports and services my family received for my son: \n From Diagnosis to Support, Part One: The Kindergarten Years \n From Diagnosis to Support, Part Two: Funding for Starting School. \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/documents/child-disability-allowance.pdf", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/child-disability-allowance.html", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/documents/child-disability-allowance.pdf", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/extra_help_information/child_disability_allowance_tables/child_disability_allowance_rates.htm", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/disability-assistance-guide.html#DisabilityAllowance2", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/extra_help_information/disability_allowance_tables/disability_allowance_rates-30.htm", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/extra_help_information/disability_allowance_tables/disability_allowance_rates-01.htm", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/community/health-and-disability-practitioners/dpb-care-of-sick-guide-for-medical-practitioners/financial-assistance-for-carers.html", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/community/health-and-disability-practitioners/documents/dpb-csi-guide-for-medical-practitioners.pdf", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/domestic_purposes_benefit_care_of_sick_or_infirm_tables.htm", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/dpb-csi-retrospection.html", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/invalids-benefit-guide.html", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/sickness-benefit.html", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/accommodation-supplement.html", "http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/in-financial-hardship.html", "http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz/", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/", "http://www.ihc.org.nz/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/government-benefits-and-allowances-for-autism-in-new-zealand/", "title": "Government Benefits and Allowances for Autism, in New\u00a0Zealand"},
{"date": "April 15, 2012", "body": "I\u2019ve very often heard people say to me \u2013 as if it was an accepted maxim of all children\u2019s development \u2013 that they can always understand more than what they can say. It\u2019s also often said in regards to autistic children; that just because they can\u2019t speak much doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t understand. However, my own son\u2019s early language abilities didn\u2019t give off this impression; his spoken language was obviously more limited than his peers, but it struck me too that his receptive language \u2013 how much he understood of what I said \u2013 was also severely limited compared to other children his age. His frustration and anger and anxiety weren\u2019t eased by the right words or by explanations, it was like we had to deliberately construct his language from the ground up, starting with the seemingly simple task of developing joint-attention. I remember the speech therapist insisting on the importance of working on joint-attention as the starting building block of language development, and me thinking she was wasting my time; surely getting him to look at the same thing as me, or work on the same task as me, wasn\u2019t as crucial as she thought, shouldn\u2019t we be working on some concrete language tasks rather than playing simple games with him? Similarly the skill of turn-taking, which my son also sorely lacked (and not in the bad-discipline sense of not wanting to share, it was far more fundamental and important than that); I used to wonder whether we were wasting precious early-intervention time on this skill, but the language therapist insisted it too was vital for teaching language. These ideas \u2013 turn-taking, joint attention \u2013 their importance, and how to teach them, were not \u201cnatural knowledge\u201d to me. Neither were they to those laypeople around me; those who offered advice that if I just spoke to my son more he would understand me (which was ridiculous, I talked to the poor boy all the time, and he went through an extended phase of  hurting me when I talked ). And the advice that he would just pick up language by himself, that simply being human meant he would and could figure it out himself like all the normal kiddies do. I\u2019m reminded of those early speech therapy lessons, and the importance of speech therapy, by an interesting piece I have come across of the SFARI site, entitled \u201c Cognition and behavior: Language defect identified in autism .\u201d That piece goes beyond a mention of what is taught in speech therapy though, it is more generally about the impact of having autism and intellectual disability (in tandem) on expressive and receptive language. It refers to a study that found what I think is an important and much overlooked truth; that autistic children don\u2019t always understand more than they can say (the study compared that group to those with just intellectual disability, and those without either condition). The reason I think this is so important and so overlooked, is that the public \u2013 and extended family members, if not immediate family members too \u2013 tend to assume that a child who can use complex phrases and say interesting words (seemingly beyond their physical age capacity), also understand what they are saying and more complex ideas than what they are already talking about. But  echolalia , as a very typical feature of autism, can be deceptive. I know there were many times that others were astounded at what my son seemed to say of his own accord, though I\u2019d know he was repeating a phrase repeated endlessly on a favourite DVD (for instance). Having said that, echolalia is a complex thing, and can be present in various ways on the path to emerging meaningful language. I wouldn\u2019t want to over-simplify this process (I find this particular post very insightful on the topic:  Dr. Strangetalk or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Echolalia ). My son doesn\u2019t have intellectual disability beyond his autism, as far as I know \u2013 and that was the specific group looked at by the study in the SFARI piece \u2013 but oddly enough I think my son\u2019s intellectual ability also  hampers  the ability of others to accurately judge what he understands: My son is a highly adaptive little man, he finds ways to appear beyond his actual capacities; to give off the right look and learn to say the right sort of things, but when pressed for true comprehension or engagement, he isn\u2019t quite there yet. It\u2019s kind of like the idea of \u201cpassing\u201d ( I\u2019ve discussed this notion and how it relates to my son in a previous post ). Figuring out what he really understands and how well he\u2019s really getting on, is never a simple task. So I tend towards thinking that expressive language exceeding receptive language, would be a truth beyond just those with both autism and intellectual disability, to also many of those with just autism. But here I am using pure conjecture, I\u2019m just trying to sort out these challenges and issues for myself, and hoping to hear back from readers through comments to help me figure this out too! I want to be clear that I don\u2019t mean to say at all, that all autistic people\u2019s expressive language exceeds their receptive language. That would be completely incorrect, since some autistic people cannot (or choose not to) communicate (in the conventional sense), yet clearly understand what is said to them and what is going on around them. But I do think it is important to realise that there is this unusual gap between expressive and receptive language for a significant portion of children with autism. Being aware of this can help to lessen frustrations when an autistic child seems to understand but refuses to \u201cobey,\u201d and can draw attention to the importance of building language from the ground-up for some of our children; not presuming comprehension and language competence based on the beautiful sentences our children sometimes come out with. Perhaps the up-shot of all these thoughts, is not to take things for granted when it comes to autism and language, and not to assume that normal language development is at play (as if it is simply \u201cdelayed\u201d but otherwise will be normal, as many seem to think). To treat each autistic child as a complex individual, rather than as a genius-in-hiding, or as a lost cause. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/in-brief/2012/cognition-and-behavior-language-defect-identified-in-autism", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echolalia", "http://momnos.blogspot.co.nz/2006/03/dr-strangetalk-or-how-i-learned-to.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/asd-and-language-impairment-sometimes-they-dont-understand-more-than-you-think/", "title": "ASD and Language Impairment; Sometimes, they don\u2019t understand more than you\u00a0think\u2026"},
{"date": "April 28, 2012", "body": "My son and I were watching his favourite after-school TV show yesterday, when they started promoting a competition for the kids: Send in a self-portrait and you\u2019ll go in the draw for a game system. Awesome opportunity to do some art and explain the concept of a competition and \u201cself-portrait\u201d, I think. Also a chance to teach him about addressing and stamping envelopes. So I do my best to explain to him what is required and why we\u2019re doing it, and he enthusiastically sits down to produce a self-portrait. Being a loving and open-minded mother, I am determined to accept whatever he produces. But as usual, my son challenges my expectations. This was his first picture: At first I\u2019m not sure what to say. Then I manage: \u201cIs that a picture of you?\u201d And he replies no, it\u2019s a picture of a girl from school. At which stage I\u2019m a little relieved, but also confused (still): It would seem then that he realises he doesn\u2019t actually have giant breasts. But I\u2019m wondering why he thinks his school friend does, and what are those two extra breasts doing further down the body? I\u2019m thinking this isn\u2019t the most appropriate entry for a kid\u2019s drawing competition \u2013 especially considering that they share the art-work on the show \u2013 so I gently encourage him to try again; and this time to remember it\u2019s meant to be a picture of himself. This is the second work of art he produces: I spot a theme. So I first make sure this is a picture of him: yes, he says it is. One can tell it is now a boy instead of a girl because the hair is shorter, you see. Small problem; what\u2019s with the giant double pair of breasts again? He assure me they are nipples. He\u2019s quite proud of his creation but I\u2019m still not sure this is really appropriate art to forward to strangers who might wonder what-the-hell. So I gently, lovingly, reassuringly, ask him whether he might try one more time, and this time put some clothes on himself in the picture. His third effort: Notice the four nipples have appeared yet again. I tell him that he\u2019s meant to be wearing clothes in the picture. He assures me that he is (you can see the fatter outline round the stick figure; representing clothing). I make my thinky face and push the point: \u201cBut I can still see the nipples.\u201d To which he wisely replies: The clothing has pretend nipples on it. What could I say to that\u2026 All a reminder that my son is a very literal wee man: If I want him to do art with no nipples on it, I need to say exactly that. The fourth effort was successful (by non-nipple standards) and has been sent off as an entry for the competition. As a side point that some of you might notice about the art, which I can\u2019t quite figure out yet: Each picture drawn had a count-down added at the top right: 3, 2, 1 (then no number on the final entry art). I have no idea why he was numbering them; they were created in reverse order, and he can\u2019t have possibly known in advance that it would take four pictures to create the \u201cright\u201d one.. ? Also, the pictures each have alternating happy and sad face top right. No, I don\u2019t know why (and yes, I asked, and couldn\u2019t get an answer). Neither could I find out why each figure required two sets of nipples, except maybe the arms on the stick-figure confused him in terms of correct nipple-placement..? Anyway, he learnt a little about competitions and art entries and may have also learnt the meaning of \u201cself-portrait,\u201d so I\u2019m going to put this whole experience in the \u201cyay\u201d pile. And next time, I think I\u2019ll just send in his first art effort, even if it contains a few too many nipples; let the judges at the other end problem-solve the nippled art instead. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/problem-solving-nippled-art/", "title": "Problem-Solving Nippled Art"},
{"date": "April 12, 2012", "body": "My son has autism. This is a fact,  not  an insult. And yet\u2026 Today I was reading a new forum discussion on a local website. The original poster was a carer of a two-year-old child. She was asking for advice on what she should say \u2013 if anything \u2013 to the parents of the child she cares for. The behaviour she was worried about is pretty-much textbook autism, including no eye-contact, lack of social involvement (with adults or children), complete lack of speech (despite good hearing), no exhibited emotions. Perhaps worst of all, the two year old is self-harming, and again, showing none of the expected emotional response (such as pain, despite the actions clearly causing physical damage). The response from the many commenters?: Say nothing, it will offend the parents if you point out problems with the child; Say nothing, it will look like you\u2019ve been hurting the child yourself and have come up with an elaborate excuse about the child doing it themself; Say nothing, my child was probably autistic but they\u2019ve grown out of it \u201c90%\u201d and are now almost normal. One person thought the self-harm was evidence of the child having been abused, and therefore you should say nothing to the parents\u2026 but you might want to document it and get the authorities involved. As I read the responses I literally felt my breath taken away. Shouldn\u2019t these people be encouraging this observant and caring carer to speak to the parents about the concerns? To talk openly and honestly;  not  to keep quiet because finding out there\u2019s \u201csomething wrong\u201d with the child might make  the parents  feel bad? Or is this notion that finding out a child needs help is a bad thing, so deeply entrenched in my society, that the responders are right to fear a harsh instead of appreciate reaction from the parents? Even so, say something! And yes, I said this to the original poster in a comment; I told her to speak directly and openly to the parents, and that if I\u2019d been the parent, I would have  thanked  her for her concern, even if I didn\u2019t share it. I saw some of this \u201cshut up and then the problem doesn\u2019t exist\u201d going on around my own son\u2019s diagnosis. Extended family rubbishing our concerns, telling us our son will turn out \u201cnormal.\u201d Friends and family saying I was paranoid, my son just needed more outings and social engagement (without bothering to ask first the efforts I was already making to achieve just that, with only negative outcomes for my son who had severe anxiety attacks). Just close your eyes, and wait. And wait. And if your child doesn\u2019t come right then it must be your parenting that is at fault; god forbid we ever point out concerns about the child, or advise someone to seek professional advice, even to rule something out. Just shhhh, and reality will change\u2026 Since the diagnosis I have encountered many situations and stories where parents weren\u2019t told about carers\u2019 concerns, because the carers or other family members didn\u2019t want to insult the parents. I have had concerned friends ask me in hushed voices about whether they should say anything about behaviour that is making them worried for some else\u2019s child\u2019s wellbeing. If only other people had spoken out about my son, sharing and openly hearing my concerns, I know \u2013 I  know  \u2013 I would have had more confidence about getting the earlier diagnosis for my son. He would have been easy to diagnosis a good year prior to the point at which he finally was (three-years-old); instead I held off, listening to the people calling me an overly-concerned first-time parent, and assuring me he\u2019d be just fine. By three years old he was so obviously  not-fine  that my and his life had become a living hell. An earlier diagnosis and earlier intervention would have made the world of difference in our lives. When we finally began the interventions, they did make a serious difference, but it took a lot of time to work and was so much harder \u2013 for everyone \u2013 than it would have been if we\u2019d started earlier. If I\u2019d figured it out earlier. If someone had just said \u201chey, why don\u2019t you see a professional just to rule it out\u2026\u201d, instead of telling me that parents who did such a thing were attention-seekers buying into the modern popular labels to excuse bad and lazy parenting. And so I\u2019m not surprised about the under-diagnosis going on: That studies which look beyond diagnosed populations, consistently find undiagnosed autistic children. (I also believe there is over-diagnosis and misdiagnosis going on, to what extent I wouldn\u2019t venture to say. You can still perfectly coherently and importantly say there is under-diagnosis going on in the face of those other phenomena; there is no particular surprise that all these things can and do happen for a symptom-defined and broad and stigmatised condition, like autism.) Carers, family, parents, need to hear that it is not an insult to think or say that a child might have autism. It is a potential fact, to be investigated and determined either way. Perhaps the child doesn\u2019t have autism; perhaps they are \u201cfine\u201d, or perhaps they have some other condition that needs special help. But without pursuing the truth \u2013 instead closing our eyes and encouraging others to do the same \u2013 the child may be missing out on vital services, the parents may be missing out on vital support. This silence, reflects and encourages a society that views my son \u2013 and his autism \u2013 as something to be ashamed of. The only shame I feel is being part of a society that thinks not-causing parents offense, is more important than speaking out for a child who can\u2019t speak out for themself. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/shyald/3194950746/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/epidemic-silence-under-diagnosis-and-the-insult-of-autism/", "title": "Epidemic Silence: Under-diagnosis and the Insult of\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "January 1, 2011", "body": "\n Image by plewicki via Flickr \n Parenthood is littered with pointless unhelpful  platitudes . It\u2019s like someone handed out a hand-book of \u201cthings to say when you have nothing to say\u201d, and everyone read and memorized it. I\u2019m getting real sick of conversations where I can predict the reaction of the person I\u2019m talking to, down to the word. It\u2019s hard not to roll my eyes; instead I kindly smile and  oooh  and  aaah  at their insights. So what I tend to do now is not share what I feel and experience with friends and family out there, I just write it in here instead. Lucky you. One particular saying is so common, and so wrong, that it\u2019s getting an entire post to itself. \u201cThey grow up so fast, don\u2019t they!\u201d. This is commonly accompanied by \u201cuh oh, your child looks like it\u2019s about to learn to crawl / walk, what a nuisance that is\u2026 they just grow up too fast..!\u201d These people  know  I have a developmentally delayed child, and I still hear it all the time. Let me tell you something, children grow up at the exact right speed nature intended. Because you sure as heck notice it when their growth is delayed; it is worrisome, and painful and distressing. It is hard to carry a 20kg child who should be walking and climbing by themself. It is almost impossible to contain a tantrum of the type that should have stopped happening when they were a baby, and have since grown into a child\u2019s body. Changing a four-year old\u2019s nappies isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of a good time. Growing up \u2013 developing at the right speed \u2013 would be just awesome from where I\u2019m sitting. And no it\u2019s not a time to dismay when they learn to crawl and walk, it is a reason to celebrate and breathe a sigh of relief. I accept that I have to protect my house from my one year-old baby and protect my baby from my house as he\u2019s learnt these skills, and not once did I think \u201cgosh he grew up so fast, I wish I could turn back the clock.\u201d Sure he was a cute infant, but do I have wistful thoughts of the sleepless nights that I used to hate because he was feeding every two hours..? No. He grew up when he should, as he should, and that\u2019s firmly in the \u201cyay\u201d category for me. As it should be for everyone. A friend recently said I would one day miss having my children at home so I should cherish every day I have with them now, even when it sucks monkey-butt. Really? She can promise me that my autistic son will one day leave home? Because if she can, she got a memo my son\u2019s health professionals didn\u2019t get. I will not regret the day he leaves home, if he ever leaves home, I will instead cherish it as the next step in his development as a human being. One of our primary jobs as parents is to give our children independence. I work hard to give that gift to both my children. So I refuse to mourn when they advance to the next stages of their lives.

{"date": "January 19, 2011", "body": "I\u2019m tired of being told (and reading about) what to feel and not feel, in regards to my son\u2019s autism. How I feel about his autism is a reflection of scores of factors that others do not have access to: My feelings are not some random spurting, that needs to be corrected and adjusted by more enlightened parents. I want to  throttle  enlighten other people sometimes when they are busy rejoicing in their child\u2019s disabilities, but I understand that emotions are informed by our experiences, expectations, political and religious views, etc. There is much more sense in debating those underlying beliefs and knowledge that  lead  to the emotions, rather than skipping the hard stuff and going straight t o attacking people for their feelings. There are some emotions that are particularly important to feel, in order to reach a place from which you can adjust to your new reality, without having those suppressed emotions coming out in inappropriate or hurtful ways in the future. A prime example is grief, and the various stages of grief. Yet it is common that parents of autistic children are told  not  to feel this; \u201cdon\u2019t grieve, your grief implies loss of a child, but you still have the child you always had, so stop feeling that, righto?\u201d Let the poor parent feel what they\u2019re going through, without criticising them into silence and withdrawal. Give them time to work their way through the change. You don\u2019t know whether this is their first autistic child, or their third. Maybe it\u2019s the only child they will ever have, or they took ten years to conceive it. Maybe they don\u2019t have any resources in their local area for special needs children, or they themselves have special needs and don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to cope with an afflicted child.\u00a0 Even if you do know such things about the person, you probably don\u2019t know their level of experience with and understanding of autism, or their values in life. It\u2019s very likely they are going through the process of learning about  autism, and are coming to terms with the unknown. Give them a chance to  do that. To a large extent, emotions are not right or wrong, they just \u201care\u201d. It\u2019s like attacking someone for daring to sneeze, without knowing if they were sick or had hay fever or pepper tickled their nose or they faked the sneeze. In the same way, the emotion is the \u201csymptom\u201d, but you can\u2019t definitively tell someone what it is a symptom of and then attack them for it. Humans are not quite so simple or obvious. I understand the desire to share wisdom that comes from years of dealing with these children; the impression that you might have of yourself as a beacon of light to the confused and lost new parents. But there is no one path we all tread on this life-long journey. The severity of the autism and whether it ever improves, differs immensely for each person on the spectrum. It can help other parents if you share your journey, and the reasons for your own emotions, but it may do very real harm to tell them what their own journey and emotions must be. I\u2019m going to tell you to feel whatever you feel. Try to understand it, yes. Try to change it, if you\u2019re ready to do so. But try to deny and ignore it, or feel guilt about it? No. [I wrote a  previous post  about \u201cunhelpful platitudes\u201d which might help anyone trying to figure out what you should (and shouldn\u2019t) say to parents dealing with a newly-diagnosed child.] \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/feelings-youre-doing-it-wrong/", "title": "Feelings; you\u2019re doing it\u00a0wrong."},
{"date": "February 2, 2011", "body": "\n Image by ihtatho via Flickr \n What do you focus on when you look at a picture, or the television\u2026 or the world? You can go test your own perception before you read further, if you haven\u2019t consciously thought about this before. Have a look at a photograph of some friends, or turn the TV on just briefly. Now what can you remember of what you just looked at, and what did you see first? Chances are you looked at the faces of your friends in the photo, and can remember their emotions. Regardless of what you looked at just now, you are most likely to have looked at the foreground before noticing (if you noticed at all) the background. There have been many times that my autistic five year-old has revealed to me the very different way in which he focuses on the world. I\u2019m going to share a few examples, and then explain how I think understanding the difference in focus helps to illustrate some important points about the intelligence and knowledge of these children. One of my favourite images for my blog posts, is the one on the  About page  \u2013 with the (wrongly) stacked blocks shapes in the foreground. My son was looking at my blog today, saw the picture, and said \u201cAunty\u2019s House!\u201d It isn\u2019t his Aunty\u2019s house, and she doesn\u2019t have the block puzzle, but he said it again passionately and sure of himself, \u201cAunty\u2019s House!\u201d. Because what he had seen was the out-of-focus lawnmower toy in the left background of the shot, which his Aunty  does  have at her home. I hadn\u2019t even seen it there before, let alone recognised the toy. Her house is the only place he had seen that particular lawnmower toy, so naturally he decided it was Aunty\u2019s House. He was recently looking at a photo of me holding his younger brother. I thought he might comment on me or his brother, as he stared at the photo, turning his head to the side, focusing intently. Then he said, \u201cmummy\u2019s old watch\u201d. Again, he was right; there barely visible on my turned wrist in the photo, as I held his brother, was my old watch which I haven\u2019t worn for the better part of a year. A while back we were watching a TV show together and the presenter was holding up coloured objects. I asked my son what colours he saw on the TV, expecting him to name the colour of the presented items on-screen. Instead he said, very sure of himself, \u201cpurple\u201d. I couldn\u2019t see any purple objects, I looked and looked, and then after a while I saw what was right in front of my face. Most of the background of the scene, was indeed, purple. There are many other instances as well, of him picking up on small details in photo backgrounds, and in people\u2019s homes, that I am otherwise oblivious to. Not only does he notice the smallest details, he also picks up on any variations in those small details. He frequently surprises people with his amazing attention to detail, and remarkable memory. People seem to treat these as signs of how amazing his mind and intelligence must truly be, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite that simple. He might notice things we don\u2019t \u2013 certain colours, objects, details. But he\u2019s not quite noticing these in  addition  to the objects and bigger details in the foreground. It rather appears that he is noticing them  instead of  those more obvious (and socially relevent) bits of our world. (And yes, his eye-sight has been tested and is absolutely normal). He can tell you types and parts of cars and trucks as if it comes naturally, but he had to specifically be taught to meet eyes, read emotions, and answer questions about things at the centre and front of pictures when the picture has a busy or distracting background. This has implications too for tests of intelligence and knowledge, that you might apply to these children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t learn or notice or remember, it\u2019s that they\u2019re learning and noticing and remembering the sorts of things that us \u201cnormals\u201d don\u2019t particularly notice or value. In order to function in this world, you need to learn what those around you think is significant and meaningful. This comes naturally to most people \u2013 I see my 13 month old doing effortlessly things I\u2019m still trying to teach my five-year old. The amount of concentration and will power it must take for a young autistic child to actively  learn  what comes so naturally to the rest of us, must be exhausting, and sometimes simply puts me in awe of my son. He could slip away and stay in his own world, like he tended to at times before we as his parents had the explanation of his autism. But he instead meets the challenges we present him. He learns our language, he learns our social rules. He learns our sight. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/78198666@N00/627226315"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/perceived-focus/", "title": "Perceived Focus"},
{"date": "January 3, 2011", "body": "\n Image by AJC1 via Flickr \n My son had all his vaccinations. My son has autism. Depending on whether I think these two statements are related, I will be viewed by some as an ignorant, neglectful parent who pays too much attention to mainstream media, or by others as\u2026 an ignorant, neglectful parent who pays too much attention to mainstream media. If I refuse to voice an opinion one way or the other, I\u2019m weak and by consequence of my indecision I lend my support to \u201cthe other side\u201d of whoever I happen to be talking to at the time. As it happens, I am not a fence-sitter. I have very strong views and opinions, formed after years of research and reading\u2026 but everyone says they\u2019ve done years of research and reading and yet they disagree; should I not be humble and friendly and admit I do not know, no one knows, can\u2019t we all just get-along? When I see avoidable death and suffering, which is justified on grounds of invalid arguments and poor \u201cscience\u201d, I do not hop on a fence and pat the heads of people on both sides. I choose instead to\u2026 choose. And to do my utmost best to make that choice informed and rational, trying not to get dragged into the classic argument fallacies that breed like the rate of autism. Reading through the heated debates on the topic, reads like a philosophy textbook of those fallacies: Ad hominem attacks, straw-man arguments, confused appeals to authority\u2026 and one of the most over-looked ones, the fallacy of the golden mean, which is the main point of this post, so I shall expand on it: The fallacy of the golden mean is made when people argue that the truth lies between two extremes, or between two disagreeing views, merely  because  it is in the middle of them. So, some people say all autism is caused by vaccinations, and some say no autism is caused by vaccinations, therefore the conclusion reached is to sit in the middle: That the truth must be that some autism is caused by vaccines and some isn\u2019t. This argument style is very common in politics, and we are perhaps most used to it in that forum; that extreme left and extreme right are wrong because they are extremes, and the truth must sit in a moderate middle. It holds some appeal in the realm of politics when that realm is a democratic one, and you are trying to create a political landscape that a wide variety of people can live within. Though even with political issues, the golden mean can and will lead you astray: Some people think slavery of children and african-americans is wrong, some people believe slavery of children and african-americans is OK, so we should accept a middle ground that slavery of children is wrong but it\u2019s OK to enslave african-americans? Or maybe a middle ground of enslaving only some children and african-americans? More importantly though for my point here, science is not a democracy. The cause of autism, is a question of science, not a question of which side of the debate has more believers and supporters. When science (and let\u2019s be clear here, not just malleable  statistics ), show that vaccines have caused some (but not all) instances of autism,  then  there are good valid grounds to make that statement. So whether you call it sitting on the fence, or whether you call it falling for the fallacy of the golden mean, I choose not to stand there because I know of no good science that gives me reason to do so . Where I do stand and why, is the topic for another post\u2026 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/47353092@N00/3482053519"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/ought-to-vaccine-or-autism-vaccine-part-one-the-golden-mean/", "title": "Ought to vaccine, or Autism Vaccine: Part One, The Golden\u00a0Mean."},
{"date": "February 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image by big/sara via Flickr \n The most common observation I hear about my youngest son (the one without autism), is how happy he is. He\u2019s always ready with a smile and a laugh. If he falls as he\u2019s toddling around, he gets up and throws himself back into the joyful task of learning to walk. He\u2019s easy to amuse; the world fascinates him and he wants to experience it all. People find him remarkably happy, even for a child his age. He makes everyone smile too, it\u2019s beautifully infectious. In contrast my eldest (who has autism), has not had a particularly happy childhood, despite our very best efforts to give him one. Small things could set off intense meltdowns, simple things that brought other children joy and laughter, would confuse and frighten him. He could smile, but didn\u2019t do it a lot. He had to be taught to allow others to hug and kiss him, and eventually learnt to initiate these expressions of happiness and affection. He\u2019s gone through a lot in the past few years, our whole family has, as we\u2019ve used various therapies to bring more joy and less anxiety into his life. So what happened this morning as he got on the taxi shuttle for school, was all the more special: The same taxi driver ferries my son to and from school everyday, along with the other special-needs children in the class. This morning, (as has become usual), my very happy little man climbed into the taxi, sporting the smile he wears more and more often over the past few months. The taxi driver shuts the door then turns to me to share a simple little comment: \u201cHe\u2019s a happy child!\u201d Yes.

{"date": "December 1, 2010", "body": "\n Image by George Eastman House via Flickr \n Sometimes people really want to make your life better, but don\u2019t know how, and in the process of trying to help they make things that much worse. This applies in a lot of ways to the help offered to families of autistic children. A classic example that I experienced far too often, was of the \u201clet me save your marriage\u201d variety. Now I\u2019m not saying that having an autistic child isn\u2019t rough on the marriage, of course it is \u2013 any extra stresses in a relationship can have a negative impact. And it was (and still is often considered) common knowledge, that parents of autistic children had a remarkably high divorce rate. Back when my son was diagnosed it was cited around 80%, and just the other day someone cited it to me as 90%. So perhaps I should not be surprised that these agencies (which were all either government-run or at least government-funded) kept asking me about how my relationship with my husband was going, or took any sign of domestic stress as evidence of a flailing marriage. Frankly, if you watch any marriage with the scrutiny that my family has been under since my son\u2019s diagnosis, you\u2019re going to find all sorts of \u201csigns of trouble\u201d. I was frequently encouraged to talk openly about my marriage. \u201cHow\u2019s the marriage going?\u201d \u201c Well we\u2019re under stress but we\u2019re hanging in there .\u201d \u201cWould you like to attend counselling?\u201d \u201c No .\u201d I had enough on my plate on a daily (and hourly) basis, without adding in counselling appointments for something I had no interest in talking to strangers about anyway. Still, the pressure to talk, still I\u2019d say no \u2013 I don\u2019t have the time, and I\u2019m not interested. I learnt to just stop talking about how my husband and I were doing when these \u201chelpful\u201d people asked. I began giving stock answers and then trying to divert the conversation back to the subject which would save my marriage even if it was in trouble \u2013 working on making my son\u2019s autism easier to handle. But of course these diversion tactics were interpreted as evidence that something was wrong, and round and round we\u2019d go. Even when the marriage was humming along beautifully despite my son\u2019s autism, and I gave full and heart-felt answers to assure them we were doing fine, still they would push to find something wrong with the marriage which they could \u201cfix for us\u201d. In so doing, they would at times end up raising frictions between my husband and I that we didn\u2019t previously have! At those times they weren\u2019t uncovering hidden problems, they were simply creating new ones. I even eventually turned down the otherwise potentially helpful services of a particular agency, that was absolutely determined to also find error in our marriage. Yes our marriage went through a very rocky patch after the diagnosis. But we stuck together, we worked through it, and the challenges of bringing up a child with autism has brought us very close: Like no one else, we understand what we both go through every single day. We need and rely on each other. Divorce would be a poor decision for us; when things get tough, we are reminded of how much harder it would be to be doing this alone, so we buck up and get appreciative of each other all over again. But we must be the exception to the rule, right? Look at those high divorce statistics! There\u2019s my contact, who works for an Autism Charity, who cited 90%. I have great respect for her but the figure has no foundation that I can find. Trying to find an original source for the very commonly cited 80% figure, is very difficult. It appears to have originated in an  Oprah interview with Jenny McCarthy in 2007,  quoting the figure possibly from the charity \u201cAutism Speaks\u201d (Jenny is also a very vocal advocate of the claim that autism is caused by vaccinations). A  May 2010 study cites a 65% rate of separation,  compared to couples without an autistic child who have 64%. And here\u2019s one from August 2010  citing a better than three in four chance of staying together after your child is diagnosed with autism .The 80% divorce figure has now been firmly debunked. When we got the diagnosis a couple of years back this public debunking hadn\u2019t happened, so perhaps I can then understand the obsession of all those help-groups and agencies trying to stop us becoming another divorce statistic. Or maybe they should have just done some research into the statistics, and respected my wishes when I said I had enough on my plate with my son, without tackling every tiny issue in my marriage at the same time. I often get my husband to proof-read my posts before I publish them; find the odd non-sensical or badly structured sentence. I particularly get him to approve any post that refers to him. I told him I was having trouble figuring out how to end this post well; I really wanted to end on a strong quote which summed up my experiences with these helpful agencies. He immediately thought of the perfect one (how could I divorce such a helpful man?): \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: \u2018I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.'\u201d \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/7167652@N06/3123698414", "http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Mothers-Battle-Autism/7", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100519143403.htm", "http://www.jsonline.com/features/health/100266159.html", "http://politicalhumor.about.com/cs/quotethis/a/reaganquotes.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/till-autism-do-we-part/", "title": "Till Autism Do Us\u00a0Part"},
{"date": "February 8, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n We\u2019re not new to mystery injuries on our autistic son; his communication and comprehension is limited, so we often end up in unhelpful guessing-games trying to figure out their cause. One of the more unforgettable injuries was last year when he kept getting sore eyes. Finally a carer noticed our son running off to the bathroom, to look in the mirror as he poked himself in the eye. We told our son not to do that. No more sore eyes. Today after school I noticed him favouring his elbow, and saw something he didn\u2019t have when he left this morning: A weird shaped and sizable bruise on the inside of his elbow. This began the question and semi-answer session, that went something like this: Me: \u201cDid that happen at school?\u201d Him: \u201cYes\u201d Me: \u201cDid someone hurt you?\u201d *silence* Me: \u201cDid that happen on the slide?\u201d (fishing for answers there..) Him: \u201cYes\u201d (I\u2019m suspicious so I test my theory..) Me: \u201cDid Jason do that?\u201d (I\u2019d chosen a random name) Him: \u201cYes\u201d (OK, let\u2019s try again) Me: \u201cDid that happen in the classroom or playground?\u201d Him: \u201cPlayground\u201d Me: \u201cHow did it get hurt?\u201d Him: \u201cOh no\u2026!\u201d I continued the questioning for a while and kept getting confusing and at times contradictory answers (including him saying the taxi man did it, it happened in the classroom, the clock did it). So I just settled for the fact that it had happened between leaving home and getting back, and that he needed some cream on it (he likes cream). My line of questioning, and his answers, reminds me of my studies in a course on Evidence as part of my law degree: Interviewing children (autism or no autism), can create some very damaging and inaccurate \u201cevidence\u201d, particularly for issues children don\u2019t fully comprehend\u00a0 and when they are just trying to agree with the authority figure who is clearly looking for a \u201cyes\u201d in answer to certain questions. You\u2019re not meant to ask leading questions of witnesses, but it\u2019s so hard to get conversation out of my autistic son, that I fell into that trap. And then the \u201canswers\u201d I had gotten early on the questioning tainted the rest of the discussion as he started to incorporate what he\u2019d already said into contradictory later statements. One of the issues that always worried me about my son attending a mainstream school was potential for bullying, and the fact that if he was bullied (which was more likely than not), that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get information from my son about how he was being bullied or by whom. We can\u2019t even figure out if injuries were inflicted by a person or a thing, and whether it was intentional or accidental. Mystery injuries happen even under the watchful eyes of his specially trained teachers though, as my son might not have alerted them to the injury or the teachers might have deemed it unworthy of comment in the notebook they write to me in everyday. I trust the teachers, so I\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt \u2013 that no one hurt my son, that it was in all likelihood a self-inflicted accident \u2013 and leave it at that. It\u2019s just an unfortunate reminder of a long-term problem: Mystery injuries on a child who struggles to communicate, and would rather  happy dance  in front of  clocks  than talk about his day. [Update: Days later I asked my son again, and he clearly said the taxi driver did it. I asked him again later that same day to confirm; same response. Best I can tell the taxi driver unintentionally hurt my son when he was lifting him in or out of the taxi van. It hasn\u2019t happened again, but I keep an eye out.] \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bandaid.JPG"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/mystery-injury/", "title": "Mystery Injury"},
{"date": "February 6, 2011", "body": "\n Image by r-z via Flickr \n My son hates gravity. I first noticed this hatred when he was about two and was obsessing over lining up his cars in exactly the right way. This line-up was sometimes on a slope, typically the slope of the edge of the couch. If gravity moved one of his cars, there was hell to pay: Screaming, biting, throwing, often directed at the offending car, and eventually directed at me as an innocent bystander. He would avoid anything that got his feet off the ground too; anything that let gravity take its evil hold. Slides and swings especially. While other children his age were climbing ladders and throwing themselves onto slippery surfaces and in every-which-way the playground allowed them to go, my son would have a meltdown if we dared to move in their direction. He wouldn\u2019t even go up a ramp. It took weeks of the physiotherapist and occupational therapist working together, to get him to start moving up a very safe and gradual ramp in their gym. He was three-years old when they succeeded. Gravity still upsets my son, a recent example is somewhat (and sadly) amusing. He learnt to jump when he was about four and a half. It was a huge deal, and he loves showing off how he can get both his feet off the ground. The other day he started to get upset as he was jumping; \u201cno down, no down!\u201d. It was hard to keep a straight face as my husband and I tried to inform him that what goes up, must come down, as he effectively attempted flight by denying gravity. There are times I wish I could jump and not come down too, so I do sympathise with him. (Though I didn\u2019t get as insistent and upset as he did about Down\u2019s refusal to stop.)

{"date": "February 11, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Before I had my first child I put a lot of thought and time into figuring out good parenting skills. I watched all the right programmes and documentaries, read the right books, and spoke to the right people. I went into parenting with sound and consistent principles, an eagerness to do it all right, and an acknowledgement that you can\u2019t pre-empt all the problems; there was always going to be some learning on the job. None of that knowledge or those skills, worked with my eldest son. Words and physical affection made him angry, change of any sort could scare him to the point of self-harm, playing with him was as good as impossible \u2013 all he\u2019d do is line up cars and scream if anyone touched them. Parenting an autistic child is not like parenting a neurotypical one: More parenting classes, more books, more programme-watching, isn\u2019t going to give you the skills you need. In the same way that bad parenting doesn\u2019t make your child autistic, neither does \u201cgood parenting\u201d fix the autism. I am not saying that caring for an autistic  person isn\u2019t made easier   with generally good parenting skills, such as  using consistency, discipline,   and communication. Or made worse by bad  parenting skills, such as   punishment for acts beyond the child\u2019s  control, ignoring or being  violent to the child. Rather, I\u2019m pointing  out that more is required than an adjustment in usual parenting skills. Parenting classes run by people who understand the autistic mind, do help. As do therapies that adjust and refine your parenting to take into account the sensory issues and communication problems of an autistic child. It is  different , rather than  better  parenting, which is required. This different parenting style, in turn, doesn\u2019t quite work for neurotypical children. I found after I\u2019d learnt how to deal with my autistic son, that my new parenting style no longer matched his neurotypical peers. The way I spoke to and interacted with children who didn\u2019t have autism, now confused and bored them: My slow and careful actions and eye-contact, my repetitive speech supplemented with basic sign-language, the way I transitioned them between activities \u2013 all un-necessary and unwanted. I had become a mum of an autistic child, and I couldn\u2019t just switch it off. I could consciously change the way I spoke to and dealt with other people\u2019s children with some effort. And when I returned to having to deal with my own son again I was always immensely aware of the change in my parenting style. Even with a neurotypical son, I am consciously aware of the different parenting techniques I employ for my boys. My youngest is carefree and enthusiastic, parenting him is highly enjoyable and natural. He loves new experiences and interactions of almost any sort, he loves language and music. He gets into mischief and tests his boundaries. I get to employ all those wonderful skills I learnt back before I had my autistic son, and guess what, they work! But whenever I move between parenting my two children I have to make those adjustments to suit the different ways they perceive and experience their worlds. These are not the subtle differences you might make to parenting merely different individuals. The difference is more fundamental. I can interact with all neurotypical children essentially the same way, adjusting and applying foundation principles to new situations as they arise. Similarly, I can use the parenting principles for my autistic son and apply those to other autistic children I meet \u2013 for example, I don\u2019t rely on them reading my facial expressions or body language like I would for a neurotypical child. I constantly watch for signs of anxiety, try to identify the stimulus that might be causing it and minimise the impact. Whenever I run an ad looking for a carer for my autistic son, I always ask for someone with training or experience with autistic children. And I always get some people who have neither, saying surely there\u2019s no difference between looking after \u201cnormal\u201d children and looking after autistic children \u2013 they\u2019re all just children after all. It\u2019s true that a large number of skills cross-over, such as patience and empathy. Those are good foundations for looking after anyone, hell they\u2019re good foundations for looking after pets and for making friends too. But it is not adequate for looking after an autistic child. Even when I get in carers with experience and knowledge of autism, I still have to spend a fair while teaching them about my son\u2019s specific challenges and how autism manifests in him. Taking on someone with no knowledge or experience of autism, would mean a huge job for me teaching them what they need to know, and the significant risk that the carer will walk out that door once they realise what it\u2019s truly like to look after these children ( Big Daddy Autism did a great cartoon  that helps illustrate that point). These different skills in parenting \u2013 and generally caring for \u2013 these children, vary with the severity of autism to an extent. My son\u2019s autism was quite severe early on (prior to interventionist therapies), so I got to really experience and appreciate those differences. As his autism has improved, the parenting challenges have lessened. But I cannot parent my two children in the same way, and I would be doing them a disservice if I tried. I apply the same rules to them both (such as re violence, and ownership and sharing of toys), but my interactions, communication, game-playing, and expectations of them, for instance, are not the same, and go beyond mere differences in their ages and personalities. Maybe as I mature as a parent (I have after all only been doing this for five years), my attitudes or understandings of these issues, will change. But this at least is my current understanding of all I have seen and been through over those five years. I would be interested to hear how your own attitudes and experiences have differed. \u00a0 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg", "http://bigdaddyautism.com/?p=1968"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/refined-better-or-different-parenting/", "title": "Refined, better, or different\u00a0parenting?"},
{"date": "February 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Sex, religion, politics: The three topics you should avoid to keep friendships on an even keel, and to steer clear of arguments in general. That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t important topics \u2013 quite the contrary. It\u2019s because they are important that they polarize people and bring out their (both rational and irrational) passions. If you\u2019re moving in autism circles, you can add a fourth word to that list: Vaccines. I confess that I am guilty of thinking less of fellow autism parents and bloggers, when I\u2019ve found out their views on vaccines were diametrically opposed to my own. I still keep them as friends if they already are, I still read the blog if I already did. But if I find out at the outset that someone thinks vaccines cause autism, I am a lot less likely to invest my time and emotions in them. I used to be part of an autism preschoolers play-group. I was there when it first started and saw many other families come and go. I decided to make an effort to be very welcoming to new families, to encourage them to stay on and to support them however I could. One day a new set of parents turned up with their autistic preschooler, and the other parents and I went to greet and get to know them. The new parents didn\u2019t want to talk about their child, or their struggles, or themselves. The conversation the new family launched into straight away, was about how the MMR vaccine had given their child autism. Telling us how their child was fine before the shot, but straight afterwards they got autism, and isn\u2019t it a horrible thing, and how soon after the vaccine did we notice our children got autism.. I didn\u2019t feel like getting into what would have turned into an argument \u2013 these parents were particularly passionate and sure about MMR causing their child\u2019s autism. But I wasn\u2019t going to just stand there and agree or encourage the rant, so I politely excused myself and went off to watch my son playing outside with the other children instead. It does matter what other people think about vaccines. For many reasons. The belief that autism is caused by vaccines impacts on how those families will \u201ctreat\u201d their child. The choice not to vaccinate and to encourage other people not to vaccinate, has an important impact too. Just like sex, politics and religion, vaccines are an important topic with serious implications for millions of lives. Once those parents find out I don\u2019t think  autism is caused by vaccines, it also makes them see me as misinformed  or ignorant or even evil. It\u2019s hard to just ignore the white elephant in the room once you both know it\u2019s there. But what we have in common is often more important than our views about vaccines: We\u2019re bringing up children facing the same struggles, fighting to get the same resources from a cumbersome bureaucracy, dealing with the same prejudices in society. So if what you\u2019re primarily looking for is friendship, support and understanding, in a world that is too short of all three for parents of autistic children, it\u2019s usually best to just not mention the V word. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Syringe_with_Green_Fluid.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/dont-mention-the-v-word/", "title": "Don\u2019t mention the V\u00a0word"},

Maybe the messages about vaccines not being evil and not causing autism, are finally sinking in! Second, we had the wonderful news that t he government has adjusted how it provides school funding for special needs children. My son receives funding (after an arduous process), but it was going to be reviewed in three years time. At which point we would have gone through the excessive stress of re-applying and dealing with all the un-knowns. The system has changed so that we no longer have to reapply for special funding, he now will receive support until the end of his schooling! And on another (and somewhat random) happy note. Today is my seventh wedding anniversary! And finally, I just felt like sharing two photos I took today of a praying mantis in our garden.

{"date": "February 18, 2011", "body": "\n Image by BLW Photography via Flickr \n I\u2019ve decided I should record the steps we went through, from diagnosis to full and on-going support for our autistic son. It was a very long and stressful journey, but worth the outcomes. I hope by sharing this other people will better understand what to expect for their own diagnosed child, and better understand what our families have to go through (specifically within New Zealand). To avoid it being an endlessly long post, I\u2019ll try to keep to the steps as much as possible, and leave the emotion, frustration, successes and failures, for other posts. The first step was initiated by us as his parents. I visited my son\u2019s usual medical doctor, when my son was three years-old (in 2008), to talk about our many and growing concerns. The doctor observed my son, and interviewed me about his behaviour and development. He told me he suspected (in fact, was very sure) that it was autism. He referred us on to a developmental pediatrician at the local hospital. We were warned it would take many months before we could get an appointment with the developmental pediatrician. During that time I made various inquiries with private specialists to see whether I could get a confirmed diagnosis faster. We chose not to go private since they also had huge waiting lists \u2013 we\u2019d save some time but not much. And the costs for seeing the private specialists were significant. During that waiting period we sought out help and advice from the main local autism charity. They gave us some simple tools to help us deal with our son in the meantime, but also advised that to get any substantive government support (in the form of therapists and funding) we first needed that specialist confirmed diagnosis. The appointment with the developmental pediatrician at the local children\u2019s hospital finally arrived. It consisted again of observing our son, but also of a large number of questions that I and my husband answered in as much detail as possible. The pediatrician had no doubts; it was autism. She informed us that she would pass our details on to a range of government agencies, including the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of Education (MOE), and Taikura Trust (who hold government funding for carers). She also filled out a form for the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), so we could receive the approximately $80 a fortnight that I get to help with the costs of having a child with a disability. (We continue to see the pediatrician about twice a year \u2013 she is the linchpin to all the support we would eventually receive.) It would be many more months before we received any help from the MOH, MOE, or Taikura Trust. In those intervening months \u2013 after an emotional phone conversation with one of the therapists from the MOH, who apologized for the long wait for services \u2013 I was assigned a social worker (SW) from the MSD. He made contact quite quickly and supported me in speeding up the services from the MOH, MOE, and funding from Taikura Trust. Once everyone was on-board, and at the peak of intervention, my son had all of these people involved in his life: From the MOH, a physiotherapist (PT) and an occupational therapist (OT). From the MOE, an educational psychologist (EP), a speech therapist (ST), an early intervention teacher (EIT). From the MSD, a SW. Once we had all the therapists in place and had them communicating effectively with each other, I told the SW his services were no longer required, and he dropped out of the picture. Once my son had started kindergarten, we also got an education support worker (ESW) from the MOE, she attended kindergarten a couple of hours a day with my son. As time went by, the MOH services started to drop off \u2013 they are principally involved with younger children and their services are in very high demand, so they focus on enabling parents with knowledge and skills to help their own children. But I noticed my son\u2019s ankles were rolling in quite severely and re-contacted the PT, who put us onto an orthotist for orthotic insoles. My son continues to see the othotist twice or so a year. Every service I have spoken of, was free (the developmental pediatrician, OT, PT, ESW, SW, ST, EIT, EP, and orthotist). The only thing I have spoken of that I had to pay money for was the initial doctor visit, which was $12. Though even he let me return for a second visit for free since my son screamed virtually the whole time at the first visit, and he wanted to be able to hear what I had been trying to say! Towards the end of my son\u2019s time at kindergarten, it was time to start the steps of applying for services at school level. That application process and the different support we received through-out and after it, needs a post of its own \u2013 this is already longer than I intended for what it is meant to be. I hope some of this though has already helped clarify how the journey starts and where it leads.

{"date": "February 24, 2011", "body": "\n Image by stevendepolo via Flickr \n With a recent measles outbreak in my home city \u2013 and the accompanying call by the authorities to get children up-to-date with their MMR \u2013 the autism/vaccine debate has again roared to life. For a while, I get passionate and roll up my virtual sleeves. I go in to bat against misinformation, bad arguments and baseless scare-mongering. After a while I get tired and battle-weary, and take a step back; I take a break from reading the forums in particular because there\u2019s always another conspiracy-nut ready to take the last one\u2019s place, and make the exact same assertions that I knocked down from someone else a page earlier. Stepping back gives me perspective too, about some very central questions \u2013 in particular as to what are the main claims and arguments I\u2019m coming up against, and why do people cling to them so fervently in the face of opposing evidence and science. Why do they keep citing the same few poor studies, in the face of scores of larger and more robust ones? Why do they think anecdote is stronger than scientific explanation? I\u2019m half way through a book which is doing a fantastic job of helping me to understand those \u201cwhys\u201d. Reading the book, and reflecting on all those debates I get involved in, have helped me to see a huge part of the reason that some people just can\u2019t open their minds to trying to find the answers, instead of asserting the conclusions first and then grasping so tightly to any evidence they can find to support it. It\u2019s a lot to do with a misunderstanding of how scientific inquiry works, and an inability or unwillingness to fact-check and follow where those superscript numbers lead. Because this is such a time-consuming task, we naturally look for people of authority to shorten the process \u2013 doctors, professors, trusted people who seem to know what they\u2019re talking about. But if we don\u2019t check the credentials and quality of those authority figures, we\u2019ve got the same problem. Again, checking credentials is also very time-consuming and may not always be possible. As I read my book (\u201c Bad Science \u201d by the amusing  Ben Goldacre ), I am given reason to believe his claims about science and whether certain people are worth listening to, because he as good as makes an art-form out of this in-depth fact-checking, and teaches us to do the same. However I am also reminded that even someone as intelligent and informed as him, can get mislead when they take steps out of their arena of expertise. He tends to make certain claims about societal ills and potential political cures, without understanding the history, evidence and theories behind such suggestions. He doesn\u2019t provide any tidy superscripts for his societal recommendations, but they are not the point of his book \u2013 attacking bad science is. He is clearly aware that these side-points are not matters he is trained to understand, but he brings them up time and again anyway. It annoys me in an otherwise sound and impressive book (which I must repeat, I have not finished just yet \u2013 I will write a post about the entire book after I have). The lesson in that can be taken to the general discussion of the autism/vaccine debate too. That we should be careful when taking a  gastroenterologist\u2019s  claims about immunology and developmental disorders. Yet we have to avoid getting stuck in thinking we can\u2019t trust an immunologist because they\u2019re not an autism expert, or an autism expert because they\u2019re not a immunologist. Yes it would be ideal to have access to a developmental pediatrician who was trained in immunology, who had both decades of field experience and a professorship at a highly ranked university. But such markers (though helpful and relevant) don\u2019t guarantee you someone worth listening to either \u2013 like the woman I\u2019ve mentioned previously who is Harvard trained but links autism to breastfeeding. *sigh* I am used to having to deal with conflicted authorities and irreconcilable claims. My training in both philosophy and law was filled to the brim with arguments that looked unresolved and unresolvable. Many of my peers felt overwhelmed by the conflicts and became nihilists, anarchists, or relativists. I felt the same temptation. But instead I did much along the same lines as what Ben Goldacre encourages us to do: Look deeper. For him and science, it is a matter of looking at the foundation of the claims and the studies that lead to them, as well as understanding human psychology for why we get sucked in by bad science. For me, and law and philosophy, it is a matter of looking to the arguments for the claims too \u2013 go deeper to the epistemology, the logical fallacies, the contradictions. Seek to understand the method, and you will be well-armed when faced with conflicting \u201cauthoritative\u201d statements at higher levels of discussion. It\u2019s hard, no doubt. It is time-consuming and exhausting. But if the conclusions matter to you \u2013 if you really want to know whether to vaccinate your child, and what might cause your child\u2019s autism \u2013 then it is worth the effort. Is it not? And we will make mistakes along the way. We will sometimes be in error and we may feel embarrassed by our errors and not want to admit to them. But again, embarrassment and admitting you\u2019ve been wrong, is the much lesser of the comparative evil of continuing to espouse incorrect claims which cause harm to people. I have made errors before, and I will again. That does not make me a lesser person, and it does not mean I should conclude there are no truths in the world. I would only be a lesser person if I refused to learn from those errors, and concluded that the search for truth was impossible or pointless. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/10506540@N07/3020361085", "http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Science/General/9780007284870/?cf=3&rid=1353567918&i=1&keywords=bad+science", "http://www.badscience.net/about-dr-ben-goldacre/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/getting-to-the-roots-of-bad-science-reflections-on-the-autismvaccine-debate/", "title": "Getting to the roots of Bad Science: Reflections on the autism/vaccine\u00a0debate"},
{"date": "January 20, 2011", "body": "Today, as I took photos of my son playing with the flowers in our backyard, I suddenly realised he was staring at something sitting on his hand. A small, scared little praying mantis had found its way to the tip of his finger. At first I thought it must have been on one of the flowers he picked, but going back through the photos I realised I\u2019d captured its progress from the ground, up his leg, to the flower he was holding in his little five year-old fingers. He asked if he could touch it with his other hand, and I said no, just hold still if you can because it\u2019s scared right now. And he did. We both watched it, as it watched us with those beautiful alien eyes. And I realised how much my son was like this little wonder. He\u2019s found himself in a world that doesn\u2019t quite make sense (on my son\u2019s finger, away from home). What he needs is caring minds and gentle hands to guide him through it safely.

{"date": "January 21, 2011", "body": "\n Image by George Eastman House via Flickr \n As a teenager and young adult, I often found myself wrestling with whether it was worse to find out the truth, or be left wondering. Sometimes it was in regards to things people had told me, such as that someone I cared deeply about had done something horrendous years ago; did I want to know the truth or was it best left alone? There were times when the questions that arose were serious medical ones; is that mole cancerous, do I have a psychiatric illness, do I have AIDS..? (The answers were no, no, and no, by the way.) I didn\u2019t want to find out something was wrong with me; my life seemed hard enough without adding to the load. I often tried to hide from reality, reality was scary (I was a rather anxious and over-thinking child). The problem was that \u201cnot knowing\u201d doesn\u2019t take away the worry \u2013 the usually pointless worry \u2013 that plagues you when you\u2019re living with doubt. I underestimated the impact that worry can have on both mental and physical well-being. In my mind the choice was \u201cworry about it\u201d or \u201clive with the horror of knowing I\u2019m doomed\u201d. Of course I was largely discounting the much higher likelihood of finding out there was nothing wrong with me, and therefore the option of\u00a0 neither living with worry nor living with knowledge of some horrible condition. But there was an extra dimension that my young mind didn\u2019t full comprehend; that if something horrible was wrong with me, the knowledge would be the first step to making my entire life better because I could address and perhaps fix the problem. I was too fixated on the \u201cfinding out\u201d; the diagnosis bit. But a diagnosis is just the first step in a long journey. There is grief when you find out something horrendous will affect the rest of your life, but grief is a stage in experience, not the entirety of the experience. Years later, by the time I\u2019d given birth to my first son, I\u2019d learnt much of that lesson. I\u2019d been in many situations that had taught me that not knowing, always turned out to cause much more worry and pain, than knowing. Especially when you have a vivid and fertile imagination. So when my son\u2019s behaviour and development was increasingly concerning, I didn\u2019t \u201cnot want to know\u201d whether he had autism or something else, I just went through the steps required to find out. Yes, he had autism. Yes, it was devastating. But the diagnosis was only the first \u2013 and necessary \u2013 step, to making both his and our lives better. The diagnosis gives you access to funds, services, help and understanding, and makes you part of a community of people going through the same trials. Since finding out the diagnosis, I have encountered many situations of parents who suspect their child has autism, but they don\u2019t want to know for sure. The most recent one was via a parenting forum that I frequent. The mother described her child\u2019s behaviour and said she had seen a range of natural therapy providers, but she still didn\u2019t know what was wrong. It looked very much like autism to me, and I said so and encouraged her to rule it out. She said that if it was autism, she didn\u2019t want to know, because her family had a history of autism and she didn\u2019t want her child to have the condition too. As if not getting a diagnosis, means her child doesn\u2019t have the condition. This attitude is ridiculous and pointless and upsetting, but I knew telling her so would just put her on the defensive and do nothing to encourage her to get the answer. So I came back with some of what I\u2019ve said above: That the diagnosis is just the first step, and opens up avenues to help and funding. I wished her luck in her endeavours to find answers, whatever those answers may be. It occurs to me that there is a very serious difference between being afraid of getting a diagnosis about your own health, and being afraid of getting a diagnosis about your child. When it comes to children, you can\u2019t choose to worry instead of know. You can\u2019t choose to hide your head in the sand out of fear of how  you\u2019ll  feel if you knew for sure. There are other factors that might be at play when a parent refuses to take their child along to get a suspected diagnosis. Maybe they don\u2019t like labels, or they don\u2019t think the condition in question is a genuine one. I can understand these arguments (though I don\u2019t find them persuasive), as long as the parent is otherwise doing everything they can to help their child cope with the challenges it faces.Though getting the correct and best help available, as fast as possible, is always assisted by a diagnosis. It seems to me that the huge benefits from getting a confirmed diagnosis, outweigh the sorts of concerns that parents put forward for not getting one. If you\u2019ve chosen to not get your child diagnosed, even though you suspect they have autism, I\u2019d be interested to know why. Similarly, if you know other parents who have made this choice and given you the reasons why, I encourage you to share those too. Is there a powerful argument against diagnosis that I am over-looking\u2026 or do the parents who refuse to find out, need a wake-up call to the reality of the responsibilities \u2013 as hard as they often are \u2013 of being a parent to a child with special needs. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/7167652@N06/3334095096"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/fear-of-diagnosis/", "title": "Fear of Diagnosis"},
{"date": "February 19, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Espen Klem via Flickr \n Once my son\u2019s fifth birthday loomed, it was time to work on his ORRS application. ORRS stands for Ongoing and Reviewable Resourcing Scheme, it is administered and supplied by the Ministry of Education. If his application was approved, he would receive significant school funding, for services like speech therapy and a teacher aide. But most importantly for us, a successful ORRS application meant our son would be eligible to attend a special needs school. We wanted to have our options as open as possible. I had personally always felt he would be best suited for a special needs school. I felt so strongly about this \u2013 and so negatively about \u201cdumping\u201d him in a mainstream school \u2013 that I was investigating homeschooling if special need schooling wasn\u2019t available to him. I didn\u2019t want to have to homeschool him \u2013 I was exhausted and had his younger brother to raise \u2013 but I was determined to do what was best for him. At the same time though I did try to maintain an open-mind; if visits to mainstream schools showed he would be welcome and safe, then I was prepared to reconsider. Applying for ORRS was a very drawn out process. It consisted principally of his two key therapists at the time \u2013 his educational psychologist (EP) and speech therapist (ST) \u2013 working extensive hours over more than a month, to write-up a draft. The application sums up a child\u2019s abilities, disabilities and needs, across a variety of areas (such as language and behaviour). The application draft was refined and added to by those working with him at kindergarten, and by us as his parents. I spent a fair amount of time reading, correcting and refining it until I personally was satisfied with the application too. We applied under  criterion 8 , the main criteria for autistic children. I had been warned that many people did not succeed in getting ORRS funding. I was told that some disabilities were always approved funding (Down syndrome for example), but other conditions like autism were a far less sure-bet. It was only after the application was sent in that I realised how low the application success rate was, usually  around 50% ! The whole process was rather too mysterious. Our son\u2019s therapists couldn\u2019t say how good our chance of success was, despite working for the Ministry which made the decisions. While we waited for the decision about the application, the EP and I began the process of organising visits to the schools he might attend. On the day of the first school visit, we received the news that the ORRS application had been successful. He had been approved the reviewable (not the ongoing) funding; ie RRS rather than ORS (ORRS being the acronym for the scheme as a whole). He was in the \u201chigh needs\u201d category, as opposed to \u201cvery high needs\u201d \u2013 those were the only two categories. What all that meant was that his funding would be reviewed in three years time, at which point \u2013 if he still fit the criterion \u2013 he would be moved to the ORS. I was not looking forward to going through the whole process all over again, but we had won a big victory for now. Just under a month ago we received a letter telling us that the  government has changed ORRS . The RRS (reviewable) category was being removed \u2013 the category our son was under. Instead all the children were being folded into the ORS category \u2013 the ongoing option, so he wouldn\u2019t face a review in three years time. He will have the funding until the end of his school days, which could go beyond the normal 18 years-old too if required (up to 21 if I recall correctly). The reason for this change is given in the letter too. I will write it out here because by golly it\u2019s nice to see a government ministry making sense: \u201c In the past, most students placed in the RRS have successfully applied to the ORS at the end of the reviewable period because they continued to have a high or very high level of need. Thus, the process of re-application was an unnecessary additional task for families, schools, and specialists. \u201d And to reassure those of you who may now be worried about whether that change will make it harder for your child to qualify, the letter goes on to state later that: \u201c This change will not affect the overall integrity of the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme, as the number of eligible students has remained consistent over time. \u201d I\u2019ve had a good look through the Ministry of Education\u2019s website about  ORS , and nothing much appears to have changed, other than the removal of the specific RRS category. Autistic children will still tend to come under criterion 8, for instance. And it is still available to 7000 students at any one time, throughout New Zealand. I will share in a future post, the story of what types of schools we visited and how we made the decision of where to send our son. The purpose of this post was to both share our story, and to inform and help demystify an otherwise confusing process. To that end, please do ask if you have any questions or if something isn\u2019t clear, and I will help if I can! \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/23874626@N06/3131753775", "http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/FormsAndGuidelines/ORSGuidelines/Criterion_8.aspx", "http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/special_education/ongoing_and_reviewable_resourcing_scheme_orrs", "http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/ServicesAndFunding/ORSOngoingResourcingScheme/ORS/Brief_history_of_ORS.aspx", "http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/ServicesAndFunding/ORSOngoingResourcingScheme/ORS/The_Ongoing_Resourcing_Scheme.aspx"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/from-diagnosis-to-support-part-two-funding-for-starting-school/", "title": "From Diagnosis to Support, Part Two: Funding for starting\u00a0school"},
{"date": "February 28, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n One of the options introduced to me in the search for the best school for my autistic son, was the idea of a satellite class. It took a while for me to understand how these classes were run and their benefits. So to help others speed up that learning process, I\u2019m going to share what I learnt. As usual this comes from a New Zealand perspective and experience. The way these classes are run will no doubt vary between countries, and even between local regions, but this should still serve as a relevant introduction to the concept. A special needs satellite class is run by a special needs school, but within the grounds of a mainstream school. The special needs school itself is the \u201cbase school\u201d. Classes within the base school are organised primarily by the need of the student, rather than focusing on age (as mainstream schools do). This is true of the satellite classes too \u2013 for example the class my five year-old child attends has children aged through the full primary school age range, not just new entrants. The special needs school catchment area is typically a lot wider than your usual mainstream school. Within that large area the special needs school might run multiple satellite classes at multiple mainstream schools. Whether a child attends the base school, or a satellite class, is not a question of how close a family lives to each option, or what the individual family chooses. (For example, the satellite class my son attends is particularly far from where we live, there are many schools between here and there, even the base school is closer.) The most challenging and high needs students are looked after at the base school, the more able students attend the satellite classes, usually after a year or more at the base school where they will learn skills such as sitting still, paying attention and following basic instructions. The satellite classes are also grouped according to the ability of the individual student \u2013 not all students sent to satellite classes have the same level of ability and need. For example, considering the level of need and ability of our son, we were told to choose between two particular satellite classes at two mainstream schools. We visited both and chose our preferred one \u2013 which matched the opinion of the principal of the special needs school too. So what then is the benefit of sending a special needs child to a satellite class? My initial instinct was it must be about the child learning \u201cnormal\u201d behaviours from the mainstream children. This was incorrect. They are not in the same classes as the \u201cnormal\u201d children (at least not initially), though they do spend playtime in the same area, and do other group activities with the whole school, such as an exercise program at the start of each school day. The special needs children can be integrated into mainstream classrooms if they show particular skills and abilities which mean they can learn effectively within that environment for specific subjects (say, they\u2019re very good at maths and can follow a teacher\u2019s instructions). One of the benefits of removing these children from the base school, rather than to help them learn from \u201cnormal\u201d children, was to remove them from picking up bad behaviours from (more challenged) peers at the base school. I have done a  previous post dealing with myths and confusions around this socialization question , so I won\u2019t repeat all that here. It is directly relevant to this discussion though, so do have a look if you\u2019re interested. Though the satellite classes are staffed and run by the special needs school, they look like and fit into the mainstream school where they are physically based. For example, my son\u2019s ORS funding goes to the special need school to pay for the extra support he needs (see my post  here about ORS funding ), and we don\u2019t pay school fees to the mainstream school. However, we do pay for our son to wear the school uniform for the mainstream school, and that money goes to the mainstream school since we bought it from them. We exist between the two schools, and I feel a rather equal sense of belonging to both at this early stage: If someone asked me what school my son went to, the correct answer would be both \u2013 he\u2019s enrolled at the special needs, but he spends everyday at the mainstream school. Because of the distance required to get my son to this class where he best belongs, we had the choice between being paid for the petrol or having a taxi service funded for our son \u2013 either a single taxi or a group taxi. Again, this is funded from the special needs school. We chose to let our son go in a group taxi with his class friends; a nice way for him to start and end each school day. The taxi picks him up and drops him off to our door, very handy to say the least. As you\u2019ve probably noticed by now, one of the major benefits of being with a special needs school is they can pool the funding attached to the special needs children, allowing them to maximise the resources available to all the children. They also deal with the funding and associated bureaucracy on a daily basis, as well as of course having an excellent understanding of the types of challenges faced by children with various conditions. So they know what they\u2019re talking about and don\u2019t leave you with that lost and worried feel that we got from the local mainstream school when they were faced with directly taking on our son. Only a month into my son\u2019s first year at school, I know we still have a lot to learn about how this all works, and the benefits and draw-backs. At this point though, I am confident that we have sent our son to the best class available, in the best set-up. We are very impressed with what he has already learnt, and happy with how much he enjoys his school days. The best schooling option will vary from child to child, an autistic child might belong at a special needs base school or in a mainstream school, homeschooled, private or public, the great thing is to be able to make those choices. And for us, the best choice was this wonderful thing called a satellite class. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jupiter_family.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/special-needs-satellite-classes/", "title": "Special Needs Satellite\u00a0Classes"},
{"date": "December 5, 2010", "body": "Image by Sree_ via Flickr Any changes to my autistic son\u2019s routine or introduction of new experiences, have to be carefully thought-out and pre-planned. It gets frustrating. A lot. Some days I just want to try something new with him without doing the exhausting ground-work; surely there\u2019s a chance it will all turn out OK, that it won\u2019t end in a meltdown or the creation of a new anxiety. Those times I remind myself of a little story about a bath. About six months ago my son was having a bath. He doesn\u2019t like water on his head or face. I had become frustrated with not being able to wash his hair; it was starting to smell and look unpleasant, and I had become worried both about the health of his scalp, and about what other people would think it said about my mothering skills. So I decided enough was enough; I was going to wash his hair that night. He\u2019d be fine\u2026 Together, my husband and I poured water over his head, put some shampoo in \u2013 avoiding the eyes of course, washed it out, dried him off. He screamed, cried, struggled, shook uncontrollably, and scratched himself so much that he bled. But it was done, and he would realise now it\u2019s not so bad, right..? The next night he wouldn\u2019t get in the bath (crying, struggling, screaming, scratching himself to the point of bleeding). I tried to compromise with a sink full of water \u2013 I\u2019d just wash him with a face-cloth as he stood by the sink. He refused that too \u2013 in fact any collection of water that was more than a cup-full was no a no-go zone for him now. I had to resort to using wet-wipes to clean his body. Slow step by slow step we had to undo the anxiety we had created in him that fateful bath day. It took many months to work our way up from washing his body with a wash cloth as he stood by the sink, to getting him to quickly put his feet in a small bath of water, to eventually getting him to sit in a bath of water again. He\u2019d still shake with anxiety and scratch himself until he bled each time, but the screaming and crying reduced. Once he started having baths again I had to dry him very quickly afterwards to reduce the shaking and scratching, and I had to dry him in a particular order. For instance, his feet had to be dried first, and had to be bone-dry. Eventually we worked up to putting water in his hair, just at the back. Then a little on the top. The current point we are at, he allows me to wash his hair if I hold a dry flannel over his face, tip his head back, and count to ten as I make his hair wet and as I wash it out. He\u2019s decided to start wearing daddy\u2019s goggles too, which looks suitably amusing and makes both him and us laugh. He still gets anxious and it has to all be done as quickly as possible. If I leave out any of those considerations (forget the flannel or forget to count), it works up quickly towards a meltdown. I only get to put water on his head every second day. He needs the day in-between to get his anxiety levels back down. If I try to do it each day, then he gets all upset again and then I have to take two days off in-between until he\u2019ll let me try again. If I had taken the time all those months ago, to prepare my son for the hair wash with a warning (maybe a social story) and possibly a reward system, we all could have avoided the resulting mess. I should have worked up to it step by step, over a matter of days or weeks. Days like today, when his autism feels like it\u2019s suffocating me by not letting me be spontaneous or break from routine in even the smallest way, I take a deep breath and remind myself of the water wars; because however annoying it may be to lack spontaneity in life, it\u2019s a whole lot more annoying to spend months battling the anxieties created by trying to be spontaneous. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/11294700@N07/4212675120"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/05/spontaneity-and-water-wars/", "title": "Spontaneity and Water\u00a0Wars"},
{"date": "January 22, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My son sleeps sideways in his bed, with his long legs splayed like a frog so they don\u2019t hang off the edge. He has two pillows, but neither go under his head; he has them both lying parallel to either side of his upper body. His bed is pulled away from the wall, because he otherwise rubs his head against it to the extent that he used to have two very noticeable balding patches from the nightly friction. Each night as he falls asleep I can hear him humming to himself as he rocks from side to side, occasionally bursting out in giggles. At least I know he goes to bed happy! Bedtimes have always been interesting with our autistic son. We\u2019ve fought through so many rituals and habits to get him to the point he is at now. He used to insist on having no sheets on even in the dead of winter, at the same time that he refused to wear socks. Once we got him wearing socks, he refused to go without, even in the height of summer! Same for the breakthrough with the bed sheets \u2013 once we finally got him to sleep under some decent blankets at winter, he continued to insist on them during the hot sticky nights of summer. We\u2019ve got to the point now that it\u2019s summer, and he goes to bed with no socks, and only one sheet and a blanket (solid yay). There was a time that he enjoyed throwing everything out the window of his second-storey bedroom at night. Each morning we\u2019d be fetching tissue boxes, blankets and toys from the lower veranda roof, or the car park space outside our home (depending on which window he chose). He even managed to get his pillows out the windows at times. This was a particular nuisance when it had rained over-night. The novelty eventually wore off, but it took a long time to get him to stop. He used to be a miraculously good sleeper at night \u2013 a good twelve hours from about 6pm to 6am. Unfortunately he\u2019s now in a solid routine of waking at least once a night, usually around 3am, at which point one of us walks him back to his bedroom and tucks him in. Sometimes he\u2019s anxious during those night visits, but mostly he seems to just be performing a routine. This would bother me more than it currently does, if I wasn\u2019t already up twice a night for my 13 month old; my sleep is already disturbed and I\u2019ve gotten sort of used to it (severe daily sleep-deprivation feels like my natural state of being now). We pick our battles; you can\u2019t fight every issue at once. Every single day we are working on a variety of problems, prioritising ones that affect his health. We\u2019re currently working on hair washes, drinking from cups, correcting his rolled-in ankles, toilet habits and skills, and at all times we try to help his communication skills, such as correcting his pronoun reversals. We take one day at a time. One night at a time.

{"date": "January 25, 2011", "body": "We visited the local zoo today; the first time for both of our children. I finally felt my 5 year-old autistic son would be able to handle the newness, the long walk, and take joy in the experience. (Plus a kind friend had given us a discount voucher, so it wasn\u2019t going to be expensive.) We arrived early in the day to avoid the anxiety our son would have felt waiting in line. My husband carried / kept an eye on our 1 year-old toddler, and I was largely responsible for shepherding the 5 year-old through the experience. I\u2019d pre-planned a circuit that meant we\u2019d be able to make a reasonable exit if my son started having a meltdown, this was a good idea because half way around the first loop he decided it was time to go home. I used a tactic of sadly saying good-bye to each animal we passed to try to peak his interest again. That worked for a few animals, but he figured out what I was doing and not even the kiwis and tuataras could get him to swerve off his exit-path. We did get to see some fantastic animals before he started getting upset. He particularly loved the lions and cheetahs. The elephant bored him to the extent that he barely looked at it even though it was close to the fence. Instead he and his brother were fixated with the bamboo fencing around a tree in front of the elephant inclosure, \u201cbamboo, bamboo!\u201d *sigh* On the way out, he spotted a clock on a wall, and forgot he was desperate to leave for a while. He pointed at it and talked about it, and didn\u2019t want to leave it. That was one loved-up clock. Once we got out the front gate, I asked him if he had fun, and he said yes. By the time we were half way down the road from the zoo, he was asking to go back again, so I guess that counts as a success! I, for one, loved it. My favourite animal was the cheetah this time round, particularly because of how close you could get to it; a truly beautiful animal.

{"date": "January 30, 2011", "body": "\n Image by happy via via Flickr \n I am so anxious and angry about everything that\u2019s gone wrong as we move towards my son\u2019s first day at school, that it\u2019s keeping me up at night when  I already don\u2019t get enough sleep , and it\u2019s giving me the tight-gut feeling you get when your emotions start to make you feel physically sick. Sure the  school had an arson  a month or so ago, that\u2019s not their fault\u2026 though I am not impressed with the fact that the school didn\u2019t have sprinklers. Considering how horribly  common school arson is , they should have had some measures in place to avoid it happening, or being as bad as it was, or even to catch the culprits (who are still un-caught). Even so, it happened, and they\u2019re doing what they must to fix the situation, but that doesn\u2019t explain or excuse all these other problems we\u2019re trying to work our way through: There was one day, with a one and a half hour period, in which we could buy the school uniform, from one location (all those details were the same pre-arson I should add). That would have been bad enough, but we made it work. Or it would have worked. If they had the uniform in stock. They were out of the compulsory shorts in my son\u2019s size (he\u2019s just a typical first-year size). This would have been a minor inconvenience perhaps for other parent\u2019s, but like adjusting to the change in classroom, autism makes all these things a lot harder to cope with. We\u2019d been telling him all about the uniform he must wear to school everyday, but it won\u2019t be available until who-knows-when. We had to figure out what room to take our son to for his first day. Class rooms and children\u2019s names were on lists on the school hall wall. Except our son\u2019s classroom, or his name. My husband had to make special inquiries to find that out. (That feeling that our son is being forgotten about gets worse as you\u2019ll see later in this post.) And then there\u2019s the replacement classroom itself. Not finished yet, with only two working-days before school starts. Other classrooms are ready for use, but the special needs classroom \u2013 the classroom for the neediest children in the school \u2013 is one of the last ones to be put together and have access made available to it. Couldn\u2019t \u2013 shouldn\u2019t \u2013 this have been prioritized since these children would suffer the most from not having their classroom ready on time, due to their anxieties associated with change and uncertainty? Then there\u2019s the taxi service which is part of our son\u2019s funding package. He is meant to be taxied to and from his school each day; the school is quite a distance from our house, but it\u2019s the correct one for him to attend considering his level of need. The taxi service is contracted out by the special needs school (ie not the burnt school). We bought a booster seat expressly for the taxi. The person who drives this special taxi-service for these children, was meant to turn up a couple of weeks ago so he could meet our son and our son meet him, and discuss the pick-up and drop-off time, check out the taxi van, make sure the seat suits, etc. He never turned up. We contacted the principal in charge of the special needs school and she is still following it up, and hasn\u2019t got back to us yet. Again, with only two working-days to go. Then there\u2019s the shoes. Our son has just had his scheduled orthotics appointment, and had apparently out-grown his last set of orthotic insoles. The insoles help correct the way his ankles roll in, which is just one of the many physical effects autism has on our son. It will take a month for them to make new insoles. We were waiting until after the appointment before buying his school shoes, and have now been told not to bother until we have the inserts because they may not fit in whatever shoes we buy. So he\u2019s going to have the wrong colour shoes at school, oh well, I guess they\u2019ll go with his wrong shorts. So much for not sticking out. All these changes of course affect the  social story  we were reading him everyday going towards his first day of school. It\u2019s become farcical. Almost every page is now inaccurate \u2013 the uniform, the room number, the room itself, the taxi service. Every night we read (and adjust) it, is a reminder of how wrong everything is going right now. It\u2019s got to get better, right? What else could go wrong at this stage? It\u2019s going to be hard enough with him refusing to go toilet at school (he\u2019s made it clear this is going to be a major issue), coping with morning tea time (which freaks him out for some reason), and being away somewhere that many hours in a row for the first time in his life. So many new things for him to adjust to, and all these challenges just making it all so much worse. Please don\u2019t tell me \u201cit will all be all right\u201d, I\u2019ve heard that enough over the past month, yet things keep going wrong in new ways. I know I have to deal with this anyway, I have no choice, it might all turn out OK, or it might not; there\u2019s nothing more I can do at this stage (that I\u2019m aware of). Every effort we\u2019ve made keeps getting undercut by bad fortune, or other people\u2019s evil (the arsonists) or incompetence. At this point it doesn\u2019t particularly matter whose fault all this is (though I have wanted to write off some strongly worded emails of complaint). What matters is how this is all affecting my son. And me.

{"date": "January 30, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n When people see or hear how far my son has come in the past two years, they frequently end up telling me what they think caused the improvement. It is rarer that someone actually asks me what I think made the difference. The most common theory I hear is that it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been such a great mum over the past two years. If there is truth in that, it is that I did my best to learn what all his therapists taught me, and tried to apply it to my son\u2019s life. Autism is not caused by bad parenting, nor fixed by good parenting, but parenting with an enhanced and consistently applied understanding of the autistic mind, definitely makes a difference. I always point out that my son is quite intelligent, and that without his intelligence all my efforts wouldn\u2019t have amounted to much. More specifically, he has an immense desire to learn, which I feed and encourage. My assertion of his intelligence is based on many pieces of evidence, including the opinions of his various therapists. Severe autism doesn\u2019t mean lack of intelligence, and mild autism (or Aspergers) doesn\u2019t imply high intelligence. But when faced with the challenges of reducing the severity of autism, the child\u2019s intelligence has been shown to make a significant difference. Sometimes people ask me which therapy I think helped him most. Speech therapy perhaps, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, ABA therapy, educational psychologist, or maybe just being around neurotypical children at kindergarten? I should be able to answer this because I have kept track of his improvements against whatever therapies he is undergoing. But the only solid pattern I have noticed is that he goes through big improvements in the times during which he is not actively engaged in any therapies! My (and other\u2019s) theory about this is that he needs down-time to process all he\u2019s been taught, and that while he is being taught so many new skills it can be overwhelming and make him worse. Unfortunately the way he\u2019s received help from government-funded therapies has been all in a block, so it\u2019s hard to separate out the effect of one therapy from another. My personal opinion though would be that what the occupational therapist taught me about how to teach my son, was perhaps the most important information that was given to me as a parent for helping my son. I\u2019ve always thought communication was the key to him flourishing in this world, but whether the speech therapy he actually received was what made the difference, is less obvious. There are always those who wonder whether he would have improved regardless; with no interventions or changes in his life. It\u2019s clear to us (and his therapists) that such improvements would not have been significant, and that he would have picked up comparatively more challenges along the way; we\u2019re always fighting new manifestations of his autism-related anxieties, but we spot them quickly and act to stop them if we can, before they become imbedded. Without training, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this. This is my ultimate opinion on what caused his improvements: It was dominantly a result of us applying what the therapists taught us, to an intelligent and driven child. There was no magic pill, no magic single therapy that did the job, just a family that refused to let autism take over. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/who-or-what-is-responsible-for-my-sons-improvements/", "title": "Who or what is responsible for my son\u2019s\u00a0improvements?"},
{"date": "January 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Thomas Hawk via Flickr \n The following claim is easy to make, and made far too often: \u201cAnyone who speaks out pro-vaccination, in the face of the over-whelming evidence of it causing autism, must be funded by a corporation that makes a tidy profit from selling vaccines. It\u2019s just a matter of time and research before you find the link between the money and the claim that vaccines aren\u2019t causing autism.\u201d Such statements should be easy to dismiss. But as usual, the pro / anti vaccine debate in this area is muddled by emotion and conspiracy theories. Considering  yesterday\u2019s revelation  of another serious flaw in Wakefield\u2019s study, and some of the reactions already popping up, it\u2019s timely for me to do this second installment in my vaccines series. I\u2019m breaking this discussion into three parts, all very important and too easily over-looked. (1) Money can\u2019t change science or fact The claim that people are making money off vaccines or off promoting vaccines, goes right past the more important question of whether what they are saying is correct or not. If the claim is about a scientific study\u2019s findings, then, by the very nature of science itself, the study must conform with reality, be testable, and repeatable. Regardless of whether the study was done for free or for countless millions of dollars, that statement holds true. If the claim being made is not about a scientific study, but just someone stating \u2013 without any science or facts to back it up \u2013 that vaccines do not cause autism, then it is surely a good idea to do your own research into what they\u2019re saying. But claiming what they\u2019re saying is false just because they might be paid by interested parties, is a weak attack. (2) You can always find a link to money Finding a link between someone and a money-interest in what they are saying, may require some digging and creativity, but it does not qualify as a meaningful revelation if you do find a link. In our adult lives we study at different places, make various influential friends, and take various jobs; the chances of never interacting with someone who has some link to some cause, is low, especially if you have a passion for the area of interest (in this case, vaccinations and autism). Furthermore, those claiming that there are money links between people coming out \u201cpro-vaccination\u201d (though I think the term \u201canti-anti-vaccination\u201d is more accurate in this dialogue), should be consistent and turn the same spot-light on those claiming there  is  a link between vaccines and autism. There is money to be made off books, appearances at conferences, even ads on blogs, by  both  sides. (3) Do it for free? The only way to appease people who use this line of reasoning, is to refuse any monetary compensation for the work. That is to say, do the science for free, write for free, show up at conferences for free. That is a luxury that very few people can afford. To demand such a thing is to treat years of study and hard work, as not worthy of monetary compensation. Even if someone chose to forgo accepting any payment for their time and effort, so as to avoid claims of being linked to pharmaceutical companies (for instance), they can still be the subject of personal attacks, and their claims are no more likely to get traction considering the level of blind fanaticism often involved in this debate (I will be doing a future post about unfalsifiable theories). So don\u2019t bother turning down offers to get paid for work, otherwise all you\u2019re doing is passing up money, for no advantage. The people who employ these arguments will sooner or later find something in your past to link you to money interests anyway, even if they have to make it up. I wish that was over-stating the point, but it sadly isn\u2019t. This post was not about trying to convince you that autism is or is not caused by vaccines; is it a reaction to the claims I\u2019ve found flung painfully and mindlessly around the blogosphere and forums, replacing what should be rational and fact-based discussions. It is a lot harder to find these money claims thrown at people who think autism is caused by vaccinations, not least of all because it\u2019s easier to point a finger at large pharmaceutical companies who employ enormous numbers of people, than to point at evidently poorer individuals \u201cfighting the system\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to get emotional when children and life and death are involved. But it is  because  children and life and death are involved, that we must try to find the truth, and not get swept up in these types of ultimately pointless and poor arguments. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/3298287657", "http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110106/ap_on_he_me/eu_med_autism_fraud"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/ought-to-vaccine-or-autism-vaccine-part-2-money-vs-science/", "title": "Ought to vaccine or Autism Vaccine: Part 2, Money vs\u00a0Science"},
{"date": "January 4, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Take hash-browns, baked beans and sausage. Offer to one autistic five year-old, for breakfast. He\u2019d got upset the night before because we didn\u2019t have sausage for dinner, so my husband thought he\u2019d like it for breakfast. But now it\u2019s a very anxious \u201cno sausage, no sausage!\u201d. That\u2019s fine, only put baked beans and hash-browns on the plate. Unfortunately, some hash-brown touched the baked-beans at one point, making those pieces inedible according to our son. The inedible pieces can\u2019t be left on the plate though, or even on mum or dad\u2019s plate, they must be put out of sight into the bin. He\u2019s very clear that he wants only a spoon and fork, no knife. The fork gets dirty (ie, it touches food) at one stage and must be cleaned straight away. Not licked clean, not just put out of sight, but cleaned properly so there is no trace of food on it anymore, but then left on the table beside his plate again. Later I make the oversight of using the fork to assist him in the aim of scooping beans onto his spoon. That of course upsets him again. At least he now has beans on a spoon and can get them to his mouth.. right..? Beans make it to his lips where he has a pretend nibble of a single bean, then lowers the spoon carefully to his plate and gets up to leave the table, anxiously saying over and over \u201ccold cold, timer\u201d. He\u2019s trying to say that he wants his food to be cold, not warm. And believe me, by this stage, the food barely counts as luke warm, and is very close to cold after the various theatrics. But fine, I tell him that\u2019s OK and he leaves the table, having only eaten a couple of small pieces of the hash-brown, using his fingers. He doesn\u2019t return to his plate. I feel like a poor mother on the days that I can barely get him to eat. I console myself with the fact that I can get a kid\u2019s multivitamin into him each night, and he drinks enough chocolate milk and juice that I know he\u2019s getting a fair dose of calcium and vitamin C. I worry about him being under-weight, but the last time we saw his developmental pediatrician she told me he was doing OK, that she was more concerned about the number of children she sees who are over-weight. It never crossed my mind when I had a child, that I would have to worry about him not eating enough, in an age when obesity is said to be at \u201cepidemic\u201d proportions. I\u2019d rather have to stop him eating non-stop than struggle to get him to eat at all (but I\u2019m guessing the mums with obese children would say the opposite just as passionately). So I\u2019m willing to do a few crazy things, like avoid foods touching each other and making sure grapes don\u2019t have any tiny bits of skin sticking up on them, just to get him to open that mouth. Thankfully, my neurotypical one year-old is a vacuum cleaner, and will attempt to eat both the inedible and edible without much distinction. My five year-old frequently gives him the food he doesn\u2019t want, which can make it difficult sometimes to keep track of what both children have actually eaten through-out the day. At least that\u2019s one family member who enjoys these daily food fights. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dish_and_Knife.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/one-large-breakfast-autism-on-the-side-hold-the-sanity/", "title": "One large breakfast, autism on the side.

{"date": "January 10, 2011", "body": "\n Image by mdanys via Flickr \n Keeping up a social life \u2013 of any description \u2013 when you have an autistic child, is a real challenge. You can either take your child with you, which creates all sorts of issues and anxieties for the child, and often ends in the visits been brief and stressful for everyone involved. Or you can attempt to leave the child with some other person who is familiar with your child\u2019s forms of communication and sensory issues; you\u2019re lucky if you can find these sorts of people, let alone afford them. The easiest option is for people to visit us at home, where everything is set-up in such a way as to minimise meltdowns and handle them if they do occur. So I was pleasantly surprised when someone I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from in a while, texted me to say she was in the area with her two kids, and could she come by for a catch-up. I confirmed what a nifty idea that was, but warned her that I had to go out for a half-hour physio appointment soon (I have a recurring neck injury, lifting a 5 year-old boy a lot does that to you). That threw a spanner in the works and she chose to cancel her visit, but suggested maybe we could come visit her later instead. At this stage I\u2019d gone from \u201cyay\u201d to \u201csigh\u201d, considering the difficulties involved in visiting people with our kids. Preparation includes not just taking nappies and milk for the baby (I\u2019ve just started weaning him off breast-milk), but also taking along a timing device that we use to calm our autistic son, and mentally preparing myself for the usual anxieties my son has when we have to even think about going somewhere. Such as the battle over footwear or lack of footwear; he often changes his mind about footwear so we usually take a couple of options. Choosing footwear sometimes ends in tears. Then there\u2019s the car ride, which hurts my already damaged neck, as I constantly have to turn around to deal with whatever is going on in the backseat between the kids. The constant reassurance for our autistic son that yes we are going to \u201cx\u201d, yes we will get there in \u201cx\u201d minutes, no we haven\u2019t taken a wrong turn, yes the lights will turn red soon. You get the idea. Then once we get there we have to worry about what our son can and cannot touch at the destination, and constantly watch his mood for signs of rising anxieties. He can be set off by something as simple as a window or door that \u201cshould\u201d be shut or open, but isn\u2019t. He never wants to stay the time we\u2019re meant to stay, it\u2019s always leave early or stay longer, and face a meltdown if we don\u2019t comply. I rarely enjoy going places with my children, not least of all because it\u2019s always me having to manage the anxieties and calm down my autistic son, while keeping an eye on the one year-old baby. It is exhausting, on all levels. Anyway, back to the conversation which inspired this post. So I told her it would be easier for us to have her visit us, since our house is baby and \u201cJohn\u201d (let\u2019s call my autistic son \u201cJohn\u201d) proof. This friend of mine knows my family very well, and we\u2019ve visited her and her us, often over the years. So her reply suitably surprised and shocked me. She said that her home was baby proof so it would be safe for both our baby and John. Geez. If baby-proofing a home was all that was required to make visiting people easy, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem now would it. But, as I hope this post has made clear, the issues with John are a bit wider and more complicated than erecting door barriers and hiding the good china. It\u2019s not simply a matter of protecting a home from the damage my son can do to it, in fact he\u2019s very gentle and careful. Baby-proofing would do nothing to address sensory issues, indeed it could frustrate him further by feeling penned-in, literally. I didn\u2019t think I needed to explain all this to her in the first place, but it turns out I do. I am too tired and disappointed to bother today though, and I just know that she\u2019d take it the wrong way, so I\u2019m going to leave that discussion for another day. I agreed to visit her and that is what we\u2019ll do. I will do all the preparation I must, cope with the car ride there and back, and try to smile while I wrestle with the kids while we\u2019re there. Maybe next time she\u2019ll visit us instead.

{"date": "January 27, 2011", "body": "\n Image by veo_ via Flickr \n When a child suffers, and science can\u2019t provide definitive answers and solutions to stop the suffering, parents turn to whatever is left, no matter how unproven. No matter how expensive. No matter how demeaning, or dangerous..? In the world of autism, there are far more unproven treatments than proven ones. A  recent study  found only five or six out of a hundred treatments used by parents, were proven. I can understand the desperation these parents feel, to try anything and everything. But I do not condone them acting on that desperation, and I do not think that it is harmless. At one end of the slippery slope of unproven autism interventions, you have things like vitamin supplements (such as  Omega 3 ), and  gluten-free casein-free diets . (There are good reasons you might want your children to take these supplements and follow this diet; it\u2019s doing it to improve  autism  which is unproven). As you slip further down the slope you\u2019ll come to the demeaning practice of  packing . Towards the dangerous end you\u2019ll even find people subjecting their children to  chelation . There is harm in even the gentlest forms of unproven therapy, for many reasons: There is the money spent on \u201cexperts\u201d and the books, products and services they peddle. The time spent as a family taking part in the therapies (which can be many hours daily). That time and money that could have otherwise been spent on therapies that do actually work. There is too, the false hope. It\u2019s easier to see the damage at the extreme end of unproven therapies and cures; psychological damage, and even death. As a mother of any child you come up against suggestions for unproven therapies; teething is an easy and common example of such a situation. I\u2019ve been told to try amber necklaces more than once, even though the only backing for their use is inconsistent anecdotal evidence, and even though science strongly suggests they  cannot work as claimed . My local pharmacy suggested we buy a homeopathic remedy for teething, again, despite openly admitting to me that there was no scientific basis for it working (as indeed,  for any homeopathy ever working ). These might then seem like harmless suggestions, but they suffer from the same critiques as the unproven autism cures (wasted money, wasted time, being the least of these). I know some other mothers think I should take the attitude that if it helps them feel better in the face of their desperation about \u201cdoing something, anything\u201d to assist teething pain, then why say anything negative about it..? If we spoke out more about the \u201cless harmful\u201d lies, maybe we\u2019ll make in-roads to stopping the more extensive harms. If we stop throwing good money at such therapies, there would be more spent on improving current working therapies, or finding proven alternatives: I don\u2019t think we have all the answers yet, and I know current proven therapies can only do so much, but it is  because  of those missing answers and needed treatments that we should insist on evidence and proven results, and not let our blind desperation lead the way. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/72018489@N00/2358714636", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10688116", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/study-watch-omega-3-fatty-acids-for.html", "http://www.asatonline.org/suggreading/reviews/elder.htm", "http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/01/packing-autistic-kids-french-scandal.html", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9074208/ns/health-mental_health/", "http://www.3news.co.nz/Teething-necklaces-dangerous---sceptics/tabid/423/articleID/160820/Default.aspx", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/bravo_homeopathy_deconstructed_by_the_cb.php"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/wheres-the-harm/", "title": "Where\u2019s the Harm\u2026"},
{"date": "January 9, 2011", "body": "\n Image by mrtwism via Flickr \n It took us months as parents, to decide where to send our autistic son for his schooling. Homeschool, mainstream school, special-needs school, or a satellite class. After much research, and multiple visits to the various schools, we made our decision; a satellite class run by a special-needs school, situated at a main-stream school. It even has a teacher who was trained overseas specifically in dealing with autistic children. Everyone concerned agreed that he fitted in perfectly. His teacher-to-be made a special story-book for him, with photos of his class-mates, teachers, and the class-room itself, which he has visited a few times and loves. We read the book to him every night, and everyday we do a count-down to school which is now only a few weeks away\u2026 A couple of days ago, an arsonist (or arsonists \u2013 they are yet to be apprehended), burnt down half of the school he was due to attend. Specifically, the two-story building that comprised the junior school. Including the special needs satellite classroom he was meant to attend. I was so distraught. For the school, for all those students, and for us. The photos in the story-book are not correct anymore. His orientation that we worked on teaching him in advance, so he knew where his classroom was, is now wrong. Our countdown to the starting date of school, is now up in the air, depending on if they can get replacement prefabs in on time. The favourite things in the classroom that motivated him and made him want to go back, are gone. Anyone with an autistic child can imagine how upsetting all these changes and uncertainties are, even those without an autistic child must have some idea. I quite honestly feel sick to my stomach. All that time to make the best decision, all the effort and preparation we put into removing anxieties and uncertainties. Up in smoke. Literally. We don\u2019t know how to tell him, because we don\u2019t know what to tell him. Decisions about replacement classrooms and resources are currently been made. Thankfully the principal of the special-needs school was quick about making contact, so we don\u2019t feel forgotten about; my son isn\u2019t enrolled via the school itself, but by the special-needs school which provides the teachers and funding, so I was worried we\u2019d be out of the information loop. It\u2019s now a matter of waiting to see what happens and how fast it happens. I\u2019m past the initial shock and devastation of hearing about the arson. It\u2019s now time to mentally prepare for what effect this is going to have on our son, as we get closer to what should have been a very special and well-planned first day of school. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/26352095@N00/40371169"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/the-burning-question/", "title": "The Burning Question"},
{"date": "January 30, 2011", "body": "\n Image by publik16 via Flickr \n Regardless of the reasons that lead up to it, I\u2019ve never condoned my autistic son being violent. Whether the violence was due to fear, anxiety, anger or confusion, if he went to cause someone harm I would do everything in my power to stop him and let him know it was unacceptable. This seems obvious to me. It worked too, though it took a while. He went from a destructive, biting, hitting little boy, to the almost-always gentle child I have today. In fact, he is gentler than most children his age. But not all parents have the same attitude as I do, and my son has been at the receiving end of it, while the parents just stood there and watched. One such incident happened at an autism play-group for preschoolers. One particularly violent child was an absolute bully. The parents just stood there and watched it, seeming to accept that it was part-and-parcel of the autism. I don\u2019t like telling other people\u2019s children off, particularly when the parent is right there, so I did nothing except try to keep my son out of his way. At one point the children went out to play, my son and this bully were in the sandpit. The bully threw sand at my boy\u2019s face! Can you imagine how distressing that is \u2013 sand in the hair, mouth, nose, eyes even. I told him to stop it, but he persisted, even though his speech was remarkably good for an autistic child and he clearly understood what I was saying. That was the first time that I thought some people might just be crap parents, and using the label of \u201cautism\u201d to not take responsibility for their children\u2019s behaviour \u2013 an opinion I\u2019ve heard many times over from other people both before and since then. But over time I\u2019ve refined that view to this: It\u2019s not that some parents are bad parents and simply use autism as an excuse when their child doesn\u2019t actually  have  autism. Rather, from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s simply that having an autistic child doesn\u2019t automatically mean you are a misunderstood and good parent. To put it another way, a child can be a misbehaving terror with negligent or bad parents, and also happen to genuinely be autistic. I had a similar thing happen today at the local playground. My son and I ran into another family there and we started chatting away, as you do. Then their three year-old boy started pushing my son, prodding him, hitting him. My son kept backing up and trying to protect himself, still the boy advanced. I watched the parents do nothing, even though they were right there watching their son attacking my own. I tried to intervene, I said to my son \u201ctell him no, stop\u201d, and my son mimicked me as instructed. Still the boy pushed, still the parents did nothing. I gently tried again to get the parents to tell their own son off \u201che doesn\u2019t seem to want to leave my boy alone..\u201d. To which the mother replied, \u201coh he\u2019s just being territorial because he loves me and doesn\u2019t want other boys around.\u201d Still, no effort to tell off or stop the boy. So I said we had to leave and took my son off home. On the way home I told him he was good for telling the boy to stop, and that boy had been mean, and hitting was bad. At least my son understood this, despite all the language issues in his way. Their child had no such excuse. There is no link between bad parenting and autism, nor between good parenting and autism. There are just good parents, and bad parents, and sometimes their children have autism. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/22941790@N02/2909054830"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/violence-autism-and-bad-parenting/", "title": "Violence, Autism and Bad\u00a0Parenting"},
{"date": "January 13, 2011", "body": "\n Image by EssoPics via Flickr \n I took part in a TV production recently; a \u201chelp-show\u201d where people write in and each week a panel addresses a different topic. I was on a panel about autism, I was chosen because they liked my blog. I was shown in advance what the letters would be, and I\u2019d prepared myself for what sorts of discussions and questions might specifically arise. Towards the end of the filming they threw us a curve-ball (\u201cus\u201d was myself and another mother of an autistic child). They wanted to end on an up-beat note, so could we tell them a funny story about what it\u2019s like to raise an autistic child..? Um. I\u2026 no. I tried. Really, I did, but I couldn\u2019t find any light-hearted stories, let alone funny ones. I know autism is funny for some other families, they seemed to be able to laugh, but I couldn\u2019t. Was I defective, was I missing something..? I\u2019d had people tell me it gets easier, and I kept waiting for it to get easier, but all autism kept throwing me was endless exhausting challenges. I\u2019d solve one problem and another would arrive. Life was one step forward, two steps back, and I couldn\u2019t see that light at the end of the tunnel. Every time I tried to grasp how this could better, that light just turned out to be someone else waving a torch: It wasn\u2019t real to me, it was false hope, and often it seemed like a cruel prank. Why were people lying to me about the prospects of my future? Over-time I adjusted to the darkness, got used to the horror of it all. That\u2019s not the same as seeing a light at the end of a tunnel though. And then, one day, a glimmer. So real, so full of hope, that everything I\u2019d been through started to feel more distant, and I only wanted to look forwards. What changed..? Did I finally get the \u201cright\u201d attitude? Read the right book? Make the right friends? No. It was words. Beautiful, meaningful, words. My son was largely non-verbal, so we couldn\u2019t figure out what set him off, and he couldn\u2019t tell us. Everything was a confusing madness where I\u2019d stumble through each day, trying to fend off the next anxiety attack he\u2019d have, constantly trying to pre-empt all his meltdown triggers, and try to reduce them when I could. In my desperation I\u2019d often trap myself in a cage of everything I couldn\u2019t do and everything I must do, just so I wouldn\u2019t be screamed at and bitten. We\u2019d tried to find alternative ways for him to communicate \u2013 sign language, pictures, but they were only small in-roads that became useless during the worst moments. So many therapies and therapists, but daily life was still near unbearable. Over the past couple of months particularly, my son\u2019s ability to put together sentences and original thoughts, has sky-rocketed. Now he can tell us what is upsetting him, and we can explain why he can\u2019t have his way, or when he will have his way, or how he can alternatively have his way. He\u2019s still very confusing at times, but now we can try to communicate with him about why he\u2019s acting so oddly. His sentences are comically unusual. Comically. That\u2019s where I started to laugh at autism. At words. His beautiful words. I know every autistic child is so very different: I discovered this wonderful saying on a  wonderful blog  the other day, \u201cIf you meet one person on the Spectrum, you\u2019ve met\u2026one person on the Spectrum\u201d. So utterly true. So in turn I know what drove us mad might be completely different from what drives you mad. And what gave me hope and ended up being the light at the end of the tunnel, might be completely different from what gives you hope. My tunnel light might just be like me waving my own torch at you, and I get that. But I\u2019m just saying here, how truly and deeply and madly I love words. My life is still hard, will probably always be hard. But everyone in the house smiles more these days, and that\u2019s a damn good start. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/8077795@N08/4566341640", "http://lifewithasperger.wordpress.com/about/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/the-torch-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-and-words/", "title": "The Torch at the End of the Tunnel, and\u00a0Words."},
{"date": "January 15, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Leo Reynolds via Flickr \n My son has an (often annoying) fascination with clocks. Time used to haunt him, and be the cause of many a meltdown. Until we got him a  Time Timer , which is a fantastic device for helping special needs children cope with issues around waiting and transition. Now he thinks clocks and watches are quite awesome. So awesome in fact that his collection of clocks from around the house and from everyone\u2019s wrists, is sitting just off to the side of where I am now, and I can count five watches, one timer, one alarm clock, and two wall clocks. All together. All driving me nuts. Whenever we go out shopping, he will want to find and stare at clocks. He\u2019s done this at  The Warehouse ,  Farmers , and every  Two Dollar  style store we\u2019ve gone to lately. He\u2019ll  happy dance  in front of them for long stretches of time, generally making people stare, but they are almost always too polite to ask what he is doing. We get some questioning looks and the occasional searching question, nothing too worrisome though, and it keeps him happy, giving me the chance to get some shopping done. He\u2019ll often want to talk about the clocks he sees, ask if he can turn the dials on the back, tells me which ones are working and which ones aren\u2019t, what colours they are, and whether they are a \u201cbong bong\u201d clock or not (like  Big Ben ). He has an amusing habit of rushing up to people who he feels comfortable with, even if he\u2019s only met them once before in passing, and putting his ear to their wrist-watch to listen to the ticking. He frequently asks for their watches, and sometimes they\u2019re nice enough to give them to him to run off with and look at. At his great grandmother\u2019s house, one of the first things he does is collect her unused wall clock, her standing clock, and her wrist-watch, place them on the couch, and lie down to watch them all. He always asks for her other two wall clocks and her other standing clock, although he\u2019s always told he can\u2019t have them. No harm in trying! I\u2019ve never liked the ticking sound of clocks. Unlike some people who find it soothing, I find it distracting and irritating. Whenever I had university exams (I had nine years worth of those things), I always carefully chose a seat away from the clocks, because hearing ticking would majorly disturb my line of thought. If I\u2019m watching a movie, I take clocks off the wall and hide them in the ever-present washing pile so the ticking won\u2019t disrupt me sinking into the movie world. OK, so maybe I\u2019m a little odd too, but I just can\u2019t seem to block out the tick tick tick.. My most recent strong association with that constant and multiple ticking, is from watching  Heroes .  Sylar  is my favourite character on the show; he\u2019s so multi-layered and misunderstood. Sylar is always closely associated with clocks, and frequently shown with them and their tickings. So I find myself absently thinking of my son as my Little Sylar. You may have noticed as well that my header is of cogs. There are layers of meaning in the header image (the little cog that doesn\u2019t quite fit the rest of society\u2019s cogs, that doesn\u2019t quite fit into the niche it is meant to..). But part of the inspiration was also the attractiveness of clocks and cogs to the autistic mind: Clocks are beautifully predictable, in a world full of confusing uncertainties. You can rely on a clock. The steady ticking noise, the clock-wise motion, the speed of the hands: \u201cClocks will go as they are set, but man, irregular man, is never constant, never certain.\u201d (Thomas Otway). \n Well, until the battery dies anyway. But my son finds broken things amusing too, so that\u2019s not a problem either. My Little Sylar drives me nuts sometimes, and all this ticking does too, but putting up with a little bit of crazy, to reduce some of my son\u2019s anxieties and to give him joy, is worth it. He\u2019s been through various obsessions in the past, and I suspect he\u2019ll find a new obsession soon anyway, given time \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/49968232@N00/60496147", "http://www.timetimer.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylar", "http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/thomasotwa212209.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/my-little-sylar/", "title": "My Little Sylar"},
{"date": "May 4, 2012", "body": "My six year-old son has figured out a way to understand what is good and what is appropriate in this world: does it affect your ability to drive. Knowing how important driving is to him, can make it easy to motivate him (\u201cyou must practice reading lots because people who drive need to learn how to read, so they can pass driving tests and read road signs\u2026\u201d). But much more than this, he uses driving to structure his own knowledge about other people, their appearance, choices and their actions. For example, we recently walked past a very small man at the supermarket. Which lead to many questions about whether that man would still be able to drive (yes we said, though his vehicle may require modifications). Similarly, he\u2019s asked in the past whether blind people can drive, and has decided that since they can\u2019t, he\u2019d rather not be blind (though I explained that there are alternatives forms of transport of course). So to him, the pertinent aspect of the difference, is in reference to how it affects your ability to drive. He also asks a lot of questions about why animals and children can\u2019t drive, which can be a useful tool for explaining the difference in minds and bodies not just between people, but between adult people and other \u201cways of being.\u201d My son doesn\u2019t want to be a criminal when he grows up, because criminals aren\u2019t allowed to drive. But understanding what is \u201ccriminal,\u201d and what is just ill-advised or inappropriate, is a fine distinction for a six year-old (and for a lot of adults too, it must be said). Last night we were watching a baking competition on TV (a \u201creality show\u201d), which happened to feature some people with tattoos, and some people with various piercings. My son wanted to know whether having tattoos or piercings meant you weren\u2019t allowed to drive. I told him no, that it was a decision adults can make about their own bodies. He followed this up by asking whether being a smoker meant you\u2019re not allowed to drive. The smoking question is an interesting one for him, since he knows smoking is a \u201cbad decision,\u201d but clearly wanted to find out whether it was bad enough (ie, criminal) that it could impact on one\u2019s ability (or rather, freedom) to drive. His question gave me the opportunity to explain that smoking was a bad decision, but not one which meant you were not allowed to drive; that adults are free to make bad decisions. I followed this up by giving examples about how I make bad decisions sometimes \u2013 about the food I eat or what I buy \u2013 to help him understand that not every bad decision is life-threatening (as he understands smoking can be). It\u2019s incredibly useful to have this reference point of driving, even though obviously it\u2019s somewhat limited in its wider application (certain crimes fall short of imprisoning you so that you can\u2019t drive, or fall short of having one\u2019s license taken away). It provides something he is interested in and motivated by, around which he can discuss and group together other (more confusing) aspects of people and their differences, actions, and choices in life. I think it\u2019s a nice example too of how you can take an autistic child\u2019s obsession, and accept and use it to teach a much wider range of information about the world. Trying to abstractly teach him concepts of criminality, legal consequences, adult decisions, and adult freedoms, would otherwise have been an up-hill battle. In fact, without his interest in how it all impacts on driving, I don\u2019t know that he would have attempted to understand their importance and relevance to life (at this age anyway), or rather, that he would have really struggled to ask questions and get meaningful answers to those questions. I worry about whether he will ever have the skills to drive a vehicle himself; there are a lot of aspects to driving which will foreseeably challenge him much more than someone who is neurotypical. I\u2019d hate to see something so centrally important to him and his value system, shaken by that potential inability. But I\u2019m hopeful that his own intense ambition and passion for driving, will in turn help him achieve that highest of values: The ability and freedom to drive. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/professorbop/2667948934/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/his-guide-to-appropriateness-criminality-and-the-good-can-you-still-drive/", "title": "His Guide to Appropriateness, Criminality, and The Good: Can you still\u00a0drive?"},

You\u2019ll be familiar with this, especially if you\u2019ve ever accidentally found yourself in the middle of an online \u201cdiscussion\u201d about the relationship between vaccines and autism. Usually it follows this mold: One side makes a claim, and backs it up with a link. The other side refutes the claim and\u2026 backs it up with a link. Pretty soon the discussion degenerates into people posting links instead of discussing the point at issue. Whoever stops posting links first supposedly loses the argument, under the assumption they can\u2019t reply with sources to back them up. A particularly annoying variation is when people selectively quote an extremely long piece from the link, and then state that if you want to get more information you should go read the rest of the (also very long) piece. One of the tricks of Battle Links is that it either bores or confuses your opponent (and audience) into silent submission: They can no longer be bothered reading through each biased or ridiculously long piece you have linked to, or the link is so far off point that it makes no sense within the discussion. Once people realise they\u2019re watching Battle Links, they\u2019ll just start scrolling down, looking for some substantive content or argument. And then realise they haven\u2019t updated Facebook in the last hour. Or go turn that cute thing  their cat did earlier, into a \u201cI Can Haz Cheezburger?\u201d poster. Either way, you\u2019ve lost them. I\u2019m not saying people shouldn\u2019t back up what they\u2019re saying. But the  fact is, the internet can be used to back up pretty much any conceivable  claim. There are reputable and original sources, and there are well  researched opinion pieces, and those are all very valuable. But before you link to them, you should  clearly state the argument or fact you are trying to prove, and why.  Anyone who reads what you have written, should be able to understand you  without having to click on the link, unless they specifically want  detailed explanations and source material for further research. Links  should not supplant reasoning. At the end of the day, endlessly posting links to reply to links, only  proves the point that finding a link proves very little, except that you  know how to use Google. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/69446921@N00/1434742207"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/whos-up-for-a-round-of-battle-links/", "title": "Who\u2019s up for a round of Battle\u00a0Links..?"},
{"date": "May 15, 2012", "body": "Yesterday the New Zealand Court of Appeal released its decision confirming the outcome of two previous rulings (at the Human Rights Review Tribunal and the High Court): That it is discrimination for the Government to have a rule against paying parents for providing care to their disabled children. But what does that mean? I\u2019ve seen some very confused interpretations by the lay public, and I too was unsure about what this meant for families like mine, so I read the decision and have decided to do a post attempting to explain it. It helps to keep in mind that this is a decision about whether what the Government was doing, was discrimination. The answer to that question is \u201cyes.\u201d So what was the Government doing? It had a blanket rule against parents being the recipients of carer payments, for care provided to their disabled children. To clarify: Disabled individuals can receive government funding specifically targeted to pay for care and support, but it comes with the restriction that this funding not go towards parents; the carer had to be someone the disabled individual was not related to. The courts decided this was discrimination on the grounds of \u201cfamily status.\u201d It helps to understand who it is discriminating against. The action was brought by disabled adults and some parents of disabled adults. The discrimination was found to be against both groups. It is discriminating against the parents because they are excluded from employment they are willing and able to do merely on the grounds of their family status. And it is discriminating against the children since it restricts their ability and right to choose their own carers, on the grounds again of family status. The court\u2019s reasoning as to why this was discriminatory would seem to apply beyond the groups they were specifically addressing \u2013 disabled adults and their parents \u2013 since parents of younger disabled children are similarly blocked from payment purely on the grounds of family status. How widely the decision applies \u2013 including to beyond the disabled \u2013 is a controversial issue, and one that the Government is very concerned about (not surprisingly). Even in its immediate application \u2013 the decision relating to adult disabled children and their parents \u2013 the government is concerned about the financial implications. But the Court of Appeal was not convinced that it would actually lead to a huge financial blowout (the court was of the opinion that the cost would be closer to $17 million a year than the potential $593 million a year). The Ministry of Health argued that the change proposed by the courts\u2019 decisions would require a complete change to the system in place, and though the court was not convinced on this point,  I  would personally be happy to see a complete change to the system in place; it is confusing, slow, and bureaucratically overladen, it could do with a major shake-up. There are a lot of interesting (and frequently complex) arguments through-out the decision, about the tests for discrimination and the Ministry\u2019s arguments against the finding of discrimination (that it is a justified discrimination if it is a discrimination), that I\u2019m not going into detail in this post. If you have any particular questions, I can try to answer them for you, or you may want to  read the decision for yourself (pdf) . The news items I provide links to below, are also helpful. I hope at least that my post somewhat clarifies the decision. I will of course be keeping an eye on what happens next, and may write further commentaries on whether this was a good decision, and for whom. **** \n \u201c Appeal court\u2019s landmark disability decision \u201d Stuff.co.nz 14th May 2012 \n \u201c Caregiver parents should now be paid \u201d NZ Herald 14th May 2012 \n \u201c Appeal against pay for caregiver parents rejected \u201d NZ Herald 14th May 2012 \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/jsmoorman/2298671281/", "http://static.stuff.co.nz/files/courtofappealdisability.pdf", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/6917209/Appeal-courts-landmark-disability-decision", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10805896", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10805814"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/making-sense-of-the-nz-court-of-appeal-decision-on-paying-parents-as-carers/", "title": "Making sense of the NZ Court of Appeal decision on paying parents as\u00a0carers"},

{"date": "May 20, 2012", "body": "Experience soon teaches us that we learn better when we are physically and mentally well; we all have experienced the flu, or extreme stress or depression, something that made us perform well below our capacity. This truth is recognised within mainstream education, where marks in exams can be altered or ignored to take into account such mental or physical illnesses. But that simple life lesson seems to be forgotten by the public, when it comes to acknowledging and addressing the needs to special-needs children within the education system. Children with special needs frequently have health issues that far exceed those of non-special-needs children. Sometimes those health issues are an integral part of the child\u2019s special needs, sometimes they are more indirect results of the special needs. For example, my son is not physically or mentally sick, but his autism frequently causes high anxieties and interferes with his ability to learn and perform basic self-care skills, so he needs higher levels of assistance than the average student, in order to just be able to attend a class-room and follow a lesson. If he is receiving adequate assistance, he is better able to learn (or able to learn at all). For other children with special needs, the health needs can be more extreme and obvious, such as those who simply cannot feed themselves or who pose a frequent physical danger to themselves if not adequately monitored. Just like mainstream children, a contagious or serious illness will mean they\u2019re kept home from school. But the mere fact of having higher and on-going health needs can\u2019t be a reason to keep them home from school, else they\u2019d never attend school at all. Which is what some members of the public strongly feel should be the case. Today I was reading a public forum discussion where a number of people were arguing that special-needs children who spend a lot of their time at school having basic health needs addressed, shouldn\u2019t be at school at all. That services like physiotherapy and occupational therapy should not be part of any school\u2019s function; that they have nothing to do with an education system and should be done at home or at a hospital. Some of these people were expressly calling special-needs schools \u201cbaby-sitting services;\u201d places where children don\u2019t learn anything because of their high health needs, so would be better off never coming to school in the first place. This discussion took place within the broader topic of the  closing down of various residential special needs schools here in New Zealand . The up-shot of saying education and health should never mix, is the denial of an education to children like my son, and to potentially all special-needs children. My son would be at home or at various government health institutions for these therapies, a fair chunk of the week, obviously and necessarily impacting on this education. I can imagine some responding that isn\u2019t this what is essentially happening anyway; that his education at school is side-lined to attend his health needs. The answer is no: Within the special-needs school that he attends, his therapies are coordinated fully into his learning program. They tie the skills and assistance they give him, into speech goals, physical education goals, social goals, maths goals. The integration of all services being provided through the single institution, provides coherence and focus that couldn\u2019t be achieved if all these therapies were separated out from his education. Because they are performed through the same institution, the school also has that immediate and meaningful understanding of how his health is directly impacting on his learning. He is treated as a whole individual, not as a grouping of separate issues dealt with in an isolated and unconnected manner. This often artificial distinction between health and education \u2013 and the problems that arise from their separation \u2013 was obvious to me from the Early Intervention point with my son, prior to school. Back then he had a speech therapist, educational psychologist and support worker through the Ministry of Education, and an occupational therapist, physiotherapist and carer support hours, provided from the Ministry of Health . The various professionals and organisation attempted to organise themselves with each other, but there were frequent times that the lack of co-ordination meant conflicting goals and expectations that I had to work hard to smooth over and co-ordinate myself, which would at times make me appear to be a \u201cdifficult parent\u201d as I argued with various therapists about what they were doing and how it was impacting on other services he was receiving. I recognise why my son\u2019s services were provided in this manner \u2013 that he has complex needs that required various professionals \u2013 but the consequences of approaching his care in this diverse manner were not good, for him  or  for me as his primary care-giver. I do understand the arguments against combining health needs part-in-parcel with education needs, and I understand why we have split Ministries at a government level to that end. But I think it is important to recognise that the distinction will often be unhelpful, and that if we insist that they not mix, then we are effectively arguing that children with special needs don\u2019t have a right to the education that other children do, simply by virtue of their special needs. If we are going to tell parents to keep their children at home or in the hospital \u2013 and out of the school \u2013 we are socially isolating our children and negatively impacting on their general development. We all know that we need good mental and physical health to be able to learn, but this simple important truth is inconvenient and \u201ctoo expensive\u201d when it comes to our most vulnerable citizens.\u00a0 If that is the case, then the government \u2013 and society \u2013 needs to change; it is not our special needs children who are falling short, it is the \u201cmainstreamed\u201d adults in positions of power and influence, who are failing them. I expect much of what I discuss in this post is addressed in teacher-training institutions, especially training institutions for those who will interact with our special needs children. I haven\u2019t been through any such course. If you have, or otherwise have insights of the relationship between health and education, I would love to hear from you. This post is just the musings of a frustrated parent trying to make sense of a world that doesn\u2019t seem to want children like my own, to get an education. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/maistora/3237164755/", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10806694"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/thoughts-on-the-line-between-health-and-education/", "title": "Thoughts on The Line Between Health and\u00a0Education"},
{"date": "May 24, 2012", "body": "There is $2280 of funding, aimed at supporting myself and my husband as carers of a disabled child, that we don\u2019t access each year. We didn\u2019t access it at all last year, we\u2019ve just been told we\u2019ve been granted it again this year, but we are extremely unlikely to access it this year either\u2026 unless we set out to commit fraud to do so. Fraudulent claims to access the funding are rife, and with good reason: The funding rules are confusing, counter-intuitive and unjust. The support system I\u2019m talking about is \u201ccarer support days,\u201d funded by the government and meted out via various regional agencies (which themselves are frequently criticised for unjust and confusing practices, I\u2019ve written  a previous post about one such incident ). The support packages are parceled as \u201cdays\u201d but actually represent fixed amounts; for example, my family is allocated \u201c30 days\u201d a year, at $76 a day, meaning a potential total claim pool of $2280. The money can be claimed in half day or full day amounts. A \u201chalf day\u201d is for 4 to 8 hours of work, a \u201cfull day\u201d is 8 to 24 hours (yes, apparently a full day is more than twice a half day). Confused yet? It gets worse. The subsidy covers care provided to the disabled child specifically in order to give the carer a break (thus \u201ccarer support\u201d), but cannot be used to pay immediate family members or people who live at the same address as you. It cannot be used to pay anyone while the carer is working (ie you can\u2019t pay someone to care for your child while you are in paid employment during those hours). The funding is paid either directly to the carer \u2013 if they have paid the worker themselves already \u2013 or to the person providing the care. If the funding has not all been used at the end of the year (when a year ends differs from family to family), then the left-over days expires, and a new amount of days is allocated (or not allocated, depending on the child\u2019s situation). There were a couple of years that I did access the funding. Every time I filled out one of these horrendous forms, I struggled. They are confusing forms, that took me ages to work out in the first place, and then a rather amazing amount of time to fill out each time I wanted to lodge a claim. Claims are slow to be processed, when they get processed at all. Over the years I had a number of forms returned to me because of various minor technical errors, meaning I had to re-do a form and contact the original care provider again (if possible) in order to be given the funding. This is from someone who has an Honours Law degree \u2013 the Honours in the area of contract law. If  I  struggled with these forms, imagine how other people get on. In fact, I can tell you how other people get on. I know more than one family who were so confused by the forms that they never lodged a claim, even though the desperately needed the funding and could have been legitimately using it. I know families that have used the funding to pay for nappies and various other physical items, not realising (and in one case, not caring) that it was against the rules. Some families use the carer support days to pay for attending various events and places (say, the zoo), but when other families attempt to do the same, they are denied entry and the staff refuse to fill out the forms. What you can and can\u2019t use the funding for is frequently unclear; it can apparently be used to attend places and events to amuse the child or educate the parent, even though these aren\u2019t clear instances of actual \u201ccarer support\u201d that gives the adult a break from caring for the child. I still can\u2019t figure out why certain such activities are OK and when they\u2019re not OK, and neither can many service providers. It is also apparently quite common that families will claim for days that have not actually been used because their year is coming to a close and they don\u2019t want to lose or waste the unused funding, so the carer agrees to sign off on days used \u201cin advance\u201d (lying about the actual time and day of provided care). There is extra incentive to do this, because un-used days from previous years can apparently be used as evidence that the family does not need that allocation of days for the future. The fraudulent practices \u2013 sometimes intentional, often not \u2013 have just made it to  the national news this morning . The examples cited in the piece are more extreme than the everyday examples I\u2019ve provided above (not surprisingly since the news piece deals with court cases), but the underlying problems are the same: That the system is confusing, wide-open to abuse, and arguably completely unjust anyway. I say \u201cunjust\u201d because of the payments can\u2019t be made to family members, which goes against  the ruling recently made that excluding family members from support payments merely on the basis of them being family, is discrimination . As mentioned in that ruling, it is frequently hard for families of high needs children to even find suitable and willing carers (and the organisation that are meant to help us do so are notoriously unhelpful), so often we\u2019re just left without any breaks from full-time care, and of course financially suffering despite the funds otherwise ear-marked to pay for such care. But I think the injustice goes further than that. Despite the purpose of the funding, it can\u2019t be used to pay for things that would actually make our lives\u2019 easier in regards to our childrens\u2019 needs: Such as nappies over  extended years of toilet-training , and aids required to help our children communicate and generally get by in the world (like  Time Timers ). Families like mine desperately need access to this funding to help our children and ourselves \u2013 as it is supposed to do \u2013 but because of the rules surrounding it we can rarely touch it. I also think it is very short-sighted that we can\u2019t use the funding to pay for childcare while we\u2019re at work; we should be encouraged and helped back into the work-force, not provided funding on the prerequisite that we  don\u2019t  use it while we work. Yes I understand the reasons behind the rules \u2013 as many and stupid as they are \u2013 but the reasons against the restrictions (and the consequences of the long list of restrictions), easily outweigh them in my humble opinion. The alternative to the overly-clumsy system currently in place? That they simply trust us with the funding in-bulk, even if we must explain to them either in advance or after the fact, what the funding was spent on (ie, as long as it was spent on something to specifically make our children\u2019s lives easier, and as a consequence, our lives easier, since that is what the funding is for). Alternately, they could just loosen the rules around use, get rid of or immensely simplify the ridiculous forms, and stop presenting the funding in this artificial construct of \u201ccarer days\u201d which many parents and carers struggle to understand and use. The system almost invites fraud, despite its strict rules and forms and needs assessment processes and gatekeepers galore. Rather than punishing those who are trying to access the funding they are supposedly entitled to, how about they just find a new way to make sure the funding actually gets to the people for whom it is intended? The huge amounts spent to prop-up the organisations that deny us the funding, would be better distributed to the families who so desperately need real carer support. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/connortarter/4754231502/", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10807955"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/carer-support-days-a-flawed-and-failing-support-system-that-invites-fraud/", "title": "\u201cCarer Support Days\u201d: A Flawed and Failing Support System, that invites\u00a0Fraud"},
{"date": "October 30, 2010", "body": "Image by veo_ via Flickr Before I knew my son had Autism, the only cause I had heard of, was  vaccinations . But since then I have heard a wide and ever-growing list of causes \u2013 from  vinyl floors , to  jaundice , to  bad parenting . Just about anything and everything causes Autism, even the  rain ! If desperate parents were trying to avoid all these factors \u2013 and as a parent of one of these very difficult children I can understand and have felt that desperation \u2013 you\u2019d end up quite neurotic. And in a cruel twist, even  that would then be blamed  for the Autism. If it wasn\u2019t so soul-destroying, it would be funny.

{"date": "October 30, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n It\u2019s the common parenting wisdom now that there are no benefits and  plenty of detriments , to exposing your preschool children to TV. I\u2019m of the view that as long as you monitor what they\u2019re watching, make it interactive, and give them time for plenty of other (more active) activities, that there are some large benefits for both the child and the whole family, from preschoolers watching TV. There\u2019s a lot to be said on this issue, especially in regards to Autistic children, but at this stage I just want to introduce a special little Train who vastly improved our lives. The idea that \u201cThomas the Tank Engine\u201d has strong appeal and applications in the lives of Autistic children, is not a new one. Indeed, the first full book I read about Autism, as recommended by my son\u2019s pediatrician, was \u201c A Friend Like Henry \u201d \u2013 about the influence Henry the train from the Thomas series (and the dog named after him), had on an Autistic child. Thomas\u2019 relationship with Autistic children is also acknowledged on the  official Thomas webpage , and in various  studies . The anti-TV stance is just one example of how much of modern parenting wisdom is aimed at your \u201caverage\u201d child, instead of taking the much more helpful approach of encouraging parents to respond to the individual child and their specific stage of development. Frankly, I would have exposed my child to TV even if he hadn\u2019t been Autistic, but being Autistic is a reason to actively try to access the benefits of watching TV \u2013 as a parent of a special needs kid you need to be willing to embrace whatever solutions present themselves. Especially if it\u2019s otherwise just sitting there in the corner of your room, turned off all day because modern parenting wisdom told you to leave it that way. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Tank_Engine_1.JPG", "http://www.limitv.org/health.htm", "http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Fiction_Literature/General/9780340934029/?cf=3&rid=1989572511&i=1&keywords=a+friend+like+henry", "http://www.thomasandfriends.com/au/Thomas.mvc/WhatsNew", "http://www.myfavoritetoys.com/autism_thomas.php"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/thomas-and-the-tv-debate/", "title": "Thomas and the TV\u00a0Debate"},

{"date": "October 31, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Over the space of about two years, I tried many different methods of toilet-training my Autistic son \u2013 some methods that were specifically recommended by his therapists, and some that I\u2019d read about online or seen on TV, for normal kiddies. I\u2019d try a new method whenever life wasn\u2019t too busy to focus fully on the task, then take a gap between methods. People had plenty of theories about my failures to toilet-train him, the two most common ones were I wasn\u2019t trying enough methods, and I was trying too many different methods. Either way it was my fault as a parent. Apparently his developmental delays which affected his language and physical abilities weren\u2019t the problem\u2026 It was obvious to me that he just wasn\u2019t ready yet \u2013 he couldn\u2019t understand my verbal instructions and couldn\u2019t master the physical skills required to achieve the tasks, but I was under pressure to keep trying (and failing) and so I did. Finally, when he was around four and a half years old, I felt it was time to try yet again. But this time I didn\u2019t use the methods suggested by his therapists, and I didn\u2019t use some system for normal kids, instead I pulled together my own method based on my understanding of my son \u2013 his strengths, weaknesses, and motivations. I started by making story books about the toileting process, and reading them to him each day. Then I did my best to make him understand that he would get a new Thomas the Tank Engine toy, if he went for a wee in the toilet \u2013 I knew which toy he would want the most by watching which ones he got most excited about on the TV programs. I\u2019d pre-bought a few toys from the range that I knew he wanted most. I finally got him to sit on the toilet and keep reminding him that if he stayed there until he did a wee, that he would get his toy. After two hours of me perched on the edge of the bathtub, while my son anxiously and repeatedly asked when he would get his toy (\u201cAlfie, Alfie\u201d) as he sat on the toilet, it happened. He chose to stand up like he\u2019d seen his dad do, and that was that. He got his toy. The madness that followed was sadly predictable, but I was ready for it. He wanted a new toy every time he went to the toilet \u2013 that was fine, except he often wanted the toy so much that he would stand at the toilet and cry while he desperately tried to make himself pee. He\u2019d have meltdowns when he couldn\u2019t make it happen. Eventually I managed to get him down from a toy at every wee, to a Thomas book instead, and then down to Thomas stickers. When he started going pooh it was toys for that since it was a big deal, but the wees were at the book stage by then, and so we had a system in place \u2013 gradually reducing the reward for each act as he started doing them more often. After about two months we\u2019d even got him off the stickers, and he now goes without any reward, but not before spending over $300 on Thomas rewards connected to toileting. His therapist was very concerned at more than one stage \u2013 that we shouldn\u2019t be using such expensive rewards or for so long. But I\u2019d learnt by this stage to trust my own instincts when they clashed with therapists, and afterall it was me who had cracked the toileting. I knew that if we dropped the highly motivating reward too fast we\u2019d lose him and go backwards (I\u2019d had hints of such already). Yes it cost a lot, but so do nappies. We saw it as an investment in his long-term independence too, which is worth a lot more than $300. Even now that therapist praises me in front of other people for cracking the toilet-training, and for doing it so well and so fast (he has had very few accidents). When there\u2019s something wrong with your child from birth \u2013 such as Autism \u2013 you get the reins taken off you as other people step in to tell you what to do and when, based on their (sometimes dubious) expertise of the condition. Your parental instincts are often side-lined or ignored. It\u2019s important to get the confidence and strength to take those reins back, for your child\u2019s sake, but also for your own mental health. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Toys_R_Us_Rows_of_carts_2009.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/toilet-training-with-thomas/", "title": "Toilet-training with Thomas"},
{"date": "May 31, 2012", "body": "There\u2019s a new study out (published May 30th 2012), entitled \u201c Mentalizing Deficits Constrain Belief in a Personal God .\u201d If you prefer not to read the study itself, you can read this news write-up \u201c Autism May Diminish Belief in God .\u201d The idea that autistic people believe in a god less often than non-autistic people, is not itself news. But the explanation for it, and the approach taken in this study to verifying it, is going to really (and legitimately) upset a lot of people. I\u2019m no scientist \u2013 I admit that openly and up-front \u2013 but the method used to gather the data for this study, and the presumptions which the study builds upon, appear highly questionable, to say the least. (Indeed, they will appear offensive to many.) I don\u2019t just mean the very small sample size of people who had a confirmed autism diagnosis used in the study. More so, the fact that the guiding and principal method to determine \u201clevel of autisticness\u201d (if you will) for the vast majority of people used in the study, was a focus on empathy versus systematizers, using the Empathy Quotient. The Empathy Quotient test was beautifully and thoroughly attacked by Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg over at \u201cJourneys with Autism\u201d ( link to her first piece in that series ). Rachel also oversees a website that collects posts attacking the supposed wide-spread lack-of-empathy \u2013 and lack of capacity for empathy \u2013 among autistics (\u201c Autism and Empathy \u201c). If you\u2019re not familiar with the controversy, those two sites are an excellent starting point to get your head around the issues. This new study links lack of empathy \u2013 and lack of theory in mind more generally \u2013 with a lower likelihood to believe in god. It links lack of empathy with autistics. Voila, we have a link \u2013 a  correlation  only, as they at least admit in the study \u2013 between autism and a lack of god-belief, due to lack of empathy. The questions asked of the participants in the study were not about  why  they didn\u2019t believe in god, they were only aimed at identifying level of belief. I would have thought it would be insightful \u2013 and highly relevant \u2013 to attempt to find out the reason behind the belief / non-belief, rather than the supposition of lack of empathy as key; the idea that a  deficit  is linked with non-god-belief. The researchers did attempt to control for other potentially influencing factors \u2013 such as IQ (and education, as a typical correlate of IQ), since high IQs are positively correlated with high levels of non-belief \u2013 but kept coming back to autism (and therefore, lack of empathy) as the dominant determinate. Which of course comes back to my previous issue with how they even identified autism and autistic individuals. (Another factor they tried to control for was interest in subjects that tend to reduce religious belief, such as maths and science. They also took into account attendance at religious meetings in the lives of participants.) But controlling for such potential influencers, does not address reasons for belief. I suppose they built the reason (or thought they did) into the study itself. I would have been interested in seeing whether the reason for belief (and non-belief) across autistics and neurotypcials, were the same sorts of reasons. Admittedly one study would struggle to address every question in this area, and figuring out what questions need to asked, can arise after a study like this suggests reason to enquire in the first place. But none of that stops the news stories like the one I linked to at the start of this post, linking mental deficiency with atheism and therefore autistics. Oh, and men by the way; did you know half the human race is also deficient? \u201cOn average, men are less adept at theory of mind than women, studies have shown. And in the current study, men generally scored lower than women on this ability as well, an effect that translated to fewer men with strong religious beliefs.\u201d I must say \u2013 even if the researchers are completely correct about the link between autism and atheism \u2013 I just don\u2019t really see the merit of the study. So what if less autistic people believe in god? Choosing to believe in god or not is a question for an individual, at an individual level. I don\u2019t see why we need to know whether a group of people believe in god or not. It doesn\u2019t make them less human \u2013 or less anything else \u2013 to not believe in god.\u00a0 Except as soon as I say that, I hope you can see the extra concern here; autistics have often been referred to as  lacking fundamental humanity  because of theory of mind / empathy issues, and so it would not be at all surprising to me, to see this latest study being used in furtherance of that rhetoric; \u201cthey can\u2019t even believe in god, they are un-godly\u2026\u201d At the very least this study does perpetuate the highly questionable link between empathy and autism, and for that alone, it would be deeply flawed. I reiterate, I am not a scientist. I did my best to understand and think about everything I read in the study; I\u2019m sure others can do a better job of explaining and examining the study than I have (please do provide links to others\u2019 writings on the research, if you have them). If I have goofed up in some way, do let me know, I\u2019m happy to be corrected. In fact, I\u2019d dearly like to be wrong about the messages in the research. \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036880", "http://news.yahoo.com/autism-may-diminish-belief-god-210727266.html", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/1909383717/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/08/06/8829/", "http://www.autismandempathy.com/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/autistics-atheists-and-men-are-mentally-deficient-looking-at-a-recent-studys-findings-on-belief-in-god/", "title": "Autistics, atheists, and men, are mentally deficient..?

{"date": "August 22, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I have been asked a few times to \u201cintervene\u201d with other families that are raising autistic children. People see how far my son has come, and how well we appear to manage his difficult behaviours, so they think I\u2019d be the perfect tool to set another autism family straight. Specifically, to tell this other family that they\u2019re not doing enough or should be doing something different. They expect me to reach conclusions about how well this family is doing, and what they need to change, based on their second-hand observations and sometimes my own observations (\u201ccome to this party and tell me what you think\u2026\u201d). These requests don\u2019t typically come from the autism family itself; they come from some well-meaning friend of the family or distant relative; someone who doesn\u2019t actually live with autism. If a family with an autistic child wanted my support or advice, I\u2019d be cautious about saying yes but I\u2019d be willing to help if I could (keeping in mind that autism types, severity and causes differ so much that my experiences and applicable knowledge may well differ significantly from what they need). But I will not step in without a direct invite from the family itself, even if I can see something that I\u2019d do differently. And there are some very good reasons for my inaction in those situations. I\u2019m going to just give you four of those reasons. First off, the family will probably already have a team of experts working with them. They will be regularly interacting with that team too; it\u2019s not like you see a speech therapist or occupational therapist once then never follow-up. Those experts and that family know best what is working and not working with that individual child. To form a meaningful opinion I\u2019d have to get a full history of what they\u2019ve tried and who they\u2019ve seen, and I have no right to ask them such information unless they offer it up. Neither will having that information make me skilled and knowledgeable enough to fix the problems; the only thing I\u2019m an expert in is my  own  son, and even there I have a heck of a lot left to learn. Secondly, with an autistic child, it is generally not recommended that you work on every issue at the same time, otherwise you can overload the child and drive them into withdrawal and negative coping behaviours. So when you observe a family dealing with an autistic child and see issues 1, 2 and 3 not being worked on, you\u2019re not noticing their constant (and often exhausting) efforts to combat issues 4, 5 and 6 right in front of you. I know my own extended family has often remarked on how well-behaved my son is and how I\u2019m not having to do much anymore to keep him that way. I am always amazed that they haven\u2019t noticed any of my constant verbal and physical efforts to avoid and manage the meltdowns and anxieties, right there as they watch; I\u2019m glad I make it look effortless, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s exhausting. Thirdly, the exact situation you see \u2013 maybe a party, or a visit \u2013 even if you\u2019ve seen it many times before, is just that; situational. In some situations you might have to make allowances you wouldn\u2019t under other circumstances, such as giving your child more freedom to stim because they otherwise get too worked up or they\u2019ve had a very long day already. Or perhaps the family thinks they\u2019re around friends so they don\u2019t have to constantly monitor every tiny aspect of their child\u2019s communication and behaviour, just for a while; thinking those around them understand. Not realising those friends have recruited strangers like me to judge them from the sidelines. Fourthly and finally, it\u2019s very difficult to form any meaningful judgment without knowing how far the child has come. You may see a family allowing an autistic child to wear nappies at age 8, but what you might actually be looking at is a family that fought for years to stop their child smearing faeces on everything and have finally conquered that issue; the nappy is just the next step in that on-going challenge. Or you might see a child who hits his head with his hand a few times each half hour, but not realise that used to be walls he hit his head against until it bled. You see a problem, which might actually represent a success story from the parents\u2019 point of view. It\u2019s like approaching someone who has just run a marathon, noticing that they\u2019re all red in the face and bent over, and suggesting that they go for a run right there and then because the exercise would do them some good (since the bad posture and ragged appearance are evidence of lack of healthy habits). You need to know what you\u2019re looking at, understand it, and know what\u2019s gone prior, before you jump in to hand out unrequested advice. So no, I\u2019m not going to do an intervention for that family with an autistic child; presuming to tell them what they did wrong and what to do instead. Rather I\u2019m going to offer them my support and understanding, and let them share if they want to. I will not be pulled into the very same judgmental words and actions that drove my own family into deeper isolation years ago. If you want to help our families, learn to listen and show compassion. Start by learning about autism and how much it varies, then learn as much as you can about the individual, what type of autism they have, what may have caused it (if known, it\u2019s usually not), and how severe it is. Dealing with autism is difficult. Dealing with other people\u2019s ill-informed and judgmental attitudes about autism, is a challenge too. There are right ways and wrong ways to go about getting a family help; encouraging a stranger to watch and judge the family who don\u2019t even know they\u2019re under scrutiny, is a wrong way. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autismawareness.png"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/why-i-wont-do-that-autism-family-intervention/", "title": "Why I won\u2019t do that autism family\u00a0intervention"},
{"date": "August 23, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n The man with Aspergers syndrome, who was charged with looting after the Christchurch Earthquake six months ago, has finally had the charges against him dropped by the police. I would like to say this was a reflection of an improved attitude and understanding on behalf of the police, who up to this point had persisted with what many have seen as an injustice. But it appears that such an optimistic view about a change in attitudes or increased understanding, may be premature. First, a recap of the incident. Arie Smith-Voorkamp was charged with looting, in the emotionally charged aftermath of the Christchurch Earthquake. He had entered a badly damaged building, and attempted to steal two light-bulbs. He was driven towards this behaviour by obsessions related to his Aspergers. He was made the \u201cface of looting,\u201d and thereby an object of public hatred, before it was known that he had a relevant mental condition (though it has been suggested that the police knew there was something \u201cwrong\u201d with him at the time of arrest). He spent 11 days in custody after his arrest. Despite judges suggesting three times that Arie be granted diversion, the police refused, claiming it went against their policies to do so. Six months later they dropped the charges. The crown prosecutor  stating : \u201cThe police, having reviewed the matter, and the nature of the alleged offence, being at the lower end of the scale, and the potential penalty, and the fact that he has no previous convictions, seek leave to withdraw the charges against him.\u201d The police argument that it went against policy to grant Arie diversion, and that they had to wait this long before they had a psychological report to back dropping the charges, has been  openly rubbished by Arie\u2019s lawyer : Arie had originally plead guilty, as the police claim is required for diversion, back in March. An official psychological assessment was also made available back in May. Now that the charges have been dropped, the police have introduced the claim that Arie and his friend were \u201c affected by alcohol and potentially drugs at the time of the arrest .\u201d Arie\u2019s lawyer says his client has never taken drugs, and had only two glasses of wine on the night; he was not intoxicated. The stuttering and problems with communication that may have led the police to think he was, were results of extreme stress  as documented in psychiatric reports . Why the police have found it necessary to introduce this unproven claim about drugs and alcohol, after the charges have been dropped, is unclear, and adds to a picture of something rather rotten about police attitudes throughout this ordeal. In July, while waiting for Arie\u2019s case to go before the court, \u201cSunday\u201d ran a current affairs\u00a0 which openly discussed details of the case, and included interviews with Arie and the \u201cvictims\u201d (who did not see themselves as victims and accepted Arie\u2019s apology). After the documentary aired, the police launched an investigation into the current affairs show, leading to  even more public outrage at the police\u2019s conduct throughout this situation . A month later, the decision was reached  not to charge the current affairs show . The details and legal arguments surrounding the charges and the case against Arie, haven\u2019t had the full airing they might have had they gone to court, and details continue to emerge even now that the charges have been dropped. But one thing appears clear; that from the time of arrest, to his custody and through-out this whole process, there appears to have been a lack of appreciation on behalf of the police, as to how autism can impact on a person in ways that are directly relevant to criminal activity and responsiblity. Alison Molloy from Autism NZ says that Arie\u2019s case is just \u201c the tip of the iceberg \u201c; that she has since received many reports about negative experiences had by autistic individuals with the New Zealand police. It must be pointed out  that police are trained at the beginning and through-out their career , to identify and handle people with intellectual impairment, and that they are made familiar with relevant legislation such as the Mental Health Act. Also, the police insist that they followed procedure through-out Arie\u2019s case. If this is the case though, clearly the problem is systemic, because what Arie was put through was un-necessary and remarkably cruel considering his mental condition. So what is going wrong here, does more need to be done than is currently done, and will things change? Reading  this report from the 5th of August , you\u2019d be led to think the police were willing to up their awareness of autism in ways relevant to their policing tasks. (If you are interested in more detail on how autism is relevant to interactions with the police, and consequences of bad interactions, I have written previous posts on such issues: \u201c Autism in Prisons \u201d and \u201c Autism and the Law .\u201d) But  this report out today  gives a different impression: That the New Zealand police attitude is that more training and awareness about autism is not necessary. That expecting such a thing of police lifts them more into the role of judge and jury; it is up to the court to make determinations about responsibility and mental assessments. Considering the current problems around police dealing with autistic individuals, and that higher awareness can impact on police duties in a wide variety of ways (including deciding whether to press charges, allow diversion, and other tasks such as taking statements, dealing with witnesses and understanding questionable behaviours at the scene of a crime), it seems to me a bad call to shift all responsibility to the courts. Furthermore, police are expected to use judgment; not every situation belongs before the courts. Surely \u2013 considering the high levels of psychological damage that can result from not responding to a situation involving an autistic person appropriately \u2013 the police should be keen to investigate their current practices, particularly in light of Arie\u2019s case. What goes wrong when autism is not taken into account, are the sorts of stories that scare parents like myself, and make us fearful for the future of our children (as if we didn\u2019t have enough to worry about with our special needs children). A local well-known example is that of  the autistic man accused of rape , where it appears that the police were absolutely determined to hold the wrong man to account, resulting is some highly questionable practices that had consequences for the police involved. There are a number of even scarier high-profile international stories too, such as the  autistic man un-necessarily shot by police , and  autistic children taken from their parents , based on misunderstandings of autism by those with the power to act under the law. Raising awareness and changing police behaviour to better match the population they are working with, is surely not asking too much ( here\u2019s a great piece  written by and for emergency personnel overseas, which attempts to do so and does it well). At the very  least , there needs to be the  impression  that the police are interested in understanding such relevant circumstances, but that impression is not forth-coming. I don\u2019t expect police to know every single mental condition they might interact with, but I expect them to care, and not to appear to be acting on some sort of vendetta when autistic people are involved. (It is not at all hard to see why police might form excessively negative views towards autistic people, because they rub police instincts the wrong way by behaviours such as avoiding eye contact and serious communication problems which get in the way of police investigations; those are just two of many examples showing why animosity may arise.) Autistic people are particularly vulnerable, and their disabilities particularly invisible, in ways that lead people to think they\u2019re just misbehaving, or affected by drugs, or guilty, when really they are law-abiding citizens doing their best to fit in with society. Autistic people can and do commit crimes; I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t. But even when they have done so, their autism must be taken into account to make sure their rights are protected and properly exercised, and that the punishment they suffer as a consequence of their crimes, is not hugely disproportionate considering their mental state. \u201c Those with developmental disabilities are seven times more likely to have confrontations with law enforcement \u201d according to overseas statistics, so issues like these can\u2019t be swept under the rug. They will keep coming up. I am glad Arie\u2019s case brought these issues to light, though he shouldn\u2019t have had to pay that price. I am sad that the light thus shined hasn\u2019t led to an improvement in police attitudes towards autistic individuals. And I am hopeful that will change; that police will come to appreciate that better understanding autism will make their jobs easier and avoid a lot of un-necessary suffering by an already vulnerable population. A population that needs their protection too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iceberg.jpg", "http://courtnews.co.nz/story.php?id=3724", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10746713", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10746713", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10746713", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/crime/news/article.cfm?c_id=30&objectid=10738772", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5437835/TV-show-cleared-for-looter-report", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/autism-group-reiterates-plea-better-police-training-4361250", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/police-need-training-autistic-people-4340439", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/police-need-training-autistic-people-4340439", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/autism-group-reiterates-plea-better-police-training-4361250", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10719459", "http://www.disaboom.com/disability-rights-and-advocacy-general/mother-of-slain-autistic-man-files-suit-against-lapd", "http://www.care2.com/causes/what-happened-to-ayn-could-happen-to-any-autistic-child.html", "http://www.firerescue1.com/Firefighter-Training/articles/1087393-Autism-awareness-Response-tips-for-firefighters/", "http://www.disaboom.com/disability-rights-and-advocacy-general/mother-of-slain-autistic-man-files-suit-against-lapd"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/the-tip-of-the-iceberg-police-and-autism-in-nz-questions-raised-by-aries-case/", "title": "\u201cThe tip of the iceberg\u201d?

Leading up the fateful day, various political parties and candidates will of course be sharing their views and policies on pretty much everything, including issues directly relevant to autism. That particularly includes education (special education, including support for special needs post-secondary schooling), and health (disability supports and services). There are of course other areas affected by government attitudes and priorities (eg employment, justice) that also impact on families living with autism. I will be keeping an eye on such policies over the next few months. I shall attempt to access and explain the autism-relevant views of at least every major political party, and the minor ones as time and information allows, in posts on this blog. (Investigations into their policies will no doubt also spin-off into further more general discussions.) If I can\u2019t find their views on such issues (via their own news releases, advertising, websites, interviews etc), I will try to contact them directly for answers. Because the answers matter to me, and there\u2019s a good chance the answers matter to a fair few of my readers. (Don\u2019t worry out-of-town readers, I\u2019m not going to get election-obsessed; this is just an (important) side project.) I am hopeful at least that by seeking out and sharing such answers from the parties and candidates, I will bring more attention to the importance and impact of such views. I don\u2019t see the election as a lolly-scramble; caring for autistic people is not just a money issue. It is also about attitudes and awareness. A party that promises huge spending on everything \u2013 including autism relevant issues \u2013 but doesn\u2019t understand how the system operates and impacts on our families and the lives of autistic people, is still missing a huge piece of the puzzle. In the same vein, nice attitudes and high levels of awareness, without structure and resources to make them turn into real results, is also only so-helpful. In my investigations of the policies I will focus the most on bringing together and explaining the parties\u2019 / candidates\u2019 views.

{"date": "August 30, 2011", "body": "\n Image by my_new_wintercoat via Flickr \n One of the hot topics in education over the past few years, is that of National Standards; introduced into New Zealand schools as of 2010. Or, at least, it was meant to be introduced in 2010;  many schools continue to refuse to implement it, even though they are required to do so by law . There are many reasons for the non-compliance by these schools. One oft-repeated concern, is that the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach of National Standards, is detrimental and distorting of the learning of special needs students. Autistic children are held up as a classic example of the different learning styles and achievements that will not (or can not) be acknowledged by National Standards. ( Select Committee report  March 23rd 2011, \u201c Briefing on Autism and National Standards .\u201d) There is concern that austistic children \u2013 in being compared to their same-age peers \u2013 will be identified and labeled as \u201cfailures\u201d since they don\u2019t meet the standards; standards that are made with \u201cnormal\u201d children in mind, rather than with consideration of how well the child has improved over time and taking into account the specific challenges they face. However, such concerns have been  down-played : with others pointing out that National Standards don\u2019t mean a child is labeled a failure (\u201c The undesirable labeling of students is not an issue introduced by the standards. Teachers are professionals and as such know the importance of using appropriate language that motivates students \u201c); and that the  existence and use of National Standards is focused on the child\u2019s own improvement from earlier points in time , rather than a more simplistic comparison to their same-age peers. The fact that National Standards can identify how a child is performing compared to the expected norm for their age-group, is said to actually be  beneficial  to special needs children : That National Standards will  identify the students who need extra assistance, and allow better targeting of such assistance . Furthermore, for those special needs students who are at the more extreme end of need \u2013 children such as my son who receive ORS funding \u2013  meeting and measuring National Standards will be simply an aspect of the individualised IEP, and the statistics of such children can be given separately in school reports , thereby acknowledging that in would be inappropriate to throw them in and compare them with every other student. This separate consideration of the most extreme special needs students, does not placate all concerns; indeed, it raises further concerns. Specifically that it evidences an approach against inclusive education practices (involving special needs students in mainstream education rather than segregated off, particularly into special needs schools). I\u2019ve even come across some parents sharing intense fears that their children will be placed in those unspeakable educational institutions known as special needs schools, where they will pick up bad habits from other needy children and not be academically challenged. ( This piece and the comments  especially, are an example of such views). Such views are of course, misinformed, out-dated and frankly offensive. Special needs schools in modern New Zealand are not dumping grounds; they are challenging places of learning tightly tailored to individual needs and abilities. They are hard to get into, because the level of funding required to run the high ratios of teacher to student, and the specialists and specialist equipment, is a barrier to open-entry. Only those with the highest needs, and the attached government high levels of funding, can get access. I was lucky to have that option. The idea that children there all pick up each others bad habits, is an old idea with very little actual foundation, in fact our children can and often do pick up far worse habits in mainstream schools (see  my post on this and related claims, here ). I must also address the horror and shame such parents feel at the prospect of their children being around other high needs students in these schools. In the same breath that they say \u201cmy child deserves an inclusive education\u201d they shun and shame other children who (by their own philosophy) deserve the same inclusiveness. The only difference is they think their own child is a special example of a special needs child; leave everyone else\u2019s difficult children in that institution over there. Quite aside from such confused claims about how bad special needs schools are, National Standards have not been \u2013 and could not be \u2013 proposed as grounds for deciding who attends or doesn\u2019t attend a special needs school. These sorts of opinion pieces \u2013 and I have come across a few \u2013 who use the National Standards issue as a forum through which to paint special needs schools as a fearful consequence of low achievement, are distorting and deflecting the more meaningful debate that needs to occur. So if we can put aside such fears about what National Standards will mean for failing students in regards to placement at special needs schools, I can move onto other issues. The next issue is the idea that National Standards makes autistic children (or more generally, special needs children) look like they\u2019re performing poorly academically. This is, unfortunately, often a simple truth; special needs children \u2013 including autistic children \u2013 do frequently perform poorly in academics  as they are currently taught  at mainstream schools. If all that National Standards is doing, is pointing out this truth, it is surely misplaced anger to blame National Standards for bringing our attention to it. (In deed, I think it may be taken as an indictment on mainstream schools to a certain extent, that some children with strong intellects perform poorly because their special needs are not being recognised or accommodated in the mainstream environment.) If one was to take the further step and say \u201cthese performance results therefore also imply that our children aren\u2019t  trying \u201d \u2013 ie, that the child is not ultimately being compared to their former achievements and their achievements are not put in context of their abilities and challenges \u2013 then yes this would be particularly concerning, because such a conclusion would imprecise and often inaccurate. But whether National Standards is actually doing such a thing, is less clear. Its primary function is to supply standards; expectations for what a normal child at that stage in their education should be able to achieve. If those standards are inaccurate, or impossible (which is surely over-stating the case), then that is a broader question about the standards, quite apart (I suggest) from the more specific question of how they can and might impact on special needs students  qua  special needs students. The fact that autistic (and many other) children perform poorly in academic areas compared to their peers, is just one facet of the child, but the facet that is particularly relevant in a school context. And that is, afterall, the context under consideration. These are not \u201cpersonality standards\u201d or \u201csports standards\u201d even. They only measure what they purport to measure (reading, writing and maths). Much of the worry and outrage at National Standards appears to be due to concerns about them being taken to mean more than they actually do. Education about what National Standards measure (and don\u2019t measure), alongside other feedback about a student\u2019s strengths and weaknesses observed in a classroom situation, would hopefully help balance this out. The suggestion that the correct standards need to be applied to the correct students \u2013 standards adjusted to reflect the child\u2019s challenges, \u201cautistic standards\u201d if you will \u2013 is superficially attractive. But considering the incredible broadness across the autistic spectrum \u2013 from the very high functioning who leave their neurotypical peers in the dust, to the very low functioning who can\u2019t toilet themselves and are even a danger to themselves \u2013 you\u2019d then have to have a sub-standard within that autism standard. And so on, and so on. This suggestion, is rather an attack on having \u201cstandards\u201d at all; a preference  instead  for a highly individualised approach. Which I think, in itself, is admirable and quite attractive. But an individualised approach is not the contradictory of having National Standards. It can be had along-side; with there still a meaningful role to be played by having a reference point such as that represented by National Standards. In this post, I have dealt with concerns about how National Standards might affect special needs students, focusing on autistic students. I have only incidentally addressed the broader concerns about the very idea of National Standards. Though I do not think that National Standards are quite the monster-under-the-bed that many people suggest it is in regards to special needs students, I think there are quite legitimate independent issues, particularly with how this specific version of National Standards has been introduced; in what many see as an un-necessarily rushed manner, without appropriate consultation, and with much confusion over the administrative and operational specifics. There are also general concerns about the inadequacy of National Standards to deal with the low achievements levels that  they were introduced to address . And that the money spent introducing and implementing the National Standards would have been better directed at the students who have already been identified as needing of the extra help. There are too claims that the National Standards add nothing other than a layer of bureaucracy; that standards as such were already in place, just not as explicitly and universally as they are now (and that they were perhaps better before anyway). Though I have not gone into the specifics of these issues, in as far as autistic students are students at all, they are necessarily affected by such wider concerns. To reach a firm conclusion on whether National Standards are in the interests of our children \u2013 autistic or otherwise \u2013 I\u2019d have to speak to these wider issues, which is outside the focus of the current post (perhaps something for a future post). It will be interesting to see how the various parties fighting for a piece of the 2011 election pie, present and address such concerns. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/21543422@N00/415138363", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5481282/School-standards-stand-off-heats-up", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1103/S00232/select-committee-report-march-23.htm", "http://www.tstnz.com/Opinionforum/No_need_to_fear_National_Standards.html", "http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/National-Standards/Key-information/Questions-and-answers", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/2993226/New-education-standards-launched", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/standards-benefit-special-needs-students-3199289", "http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/education-minister-stands-firm-national-standards-4358740", "http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/National-Standards/Key-information/Fact-sheets/Special-education-needs", "http://www.nationalstandards.org.nz/forum/topics/national-standards-and-my-son", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/2993226/New-education-standards-launched"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/30/nz-national-standards-and-special-needs-with-a-particular-focus-on-autism/", "title": "NZ National Standards and Special Needs (with a particular focus on\u00a0Autism)"},
{"date": "August 29, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Auntie P via Flickr \n I regularly read forum posts on a local site where I have a trading account. The forum includes a parenting section, where parenting topics are discussed and parenting concerns are raised. I\u2019m used to seeing the occasional autism-related discussion and sharing my two cents worth (because \u2013 in case you haven\u2019t noticed \u2013 I sure do have a lot to say about autism). Every so often I encounter a discussion that makes me realise how deeply divided the gulf is between me and other parents, because of my experiences with my autistic son. Though sometimes you really must wonder if the divide isn\u2019t a more general one; one of compassion and respect that goes beyond our personal experiences. I\u2019m going to share a recent example with you (from earlier this month), I\u2019d be interested in hearing your take on it. The original poster is outraged because someone called her 17 month old \u201cslow.\u201d Specifically, \u201c \u2026someone i know has gone and told another friend (who i am close to) that my miss 17mths is slow \nshe does say the basics mum,dad whos that and what that \nthis is really upsetting for me that someone who i throught was a friend to go saying this crap behind me back \nwould you confront the person about his or let it go over your head \u201d Note that what she\u2019s upset about in her comment is not actually the fact her child appears to be struggling with language (that her 17 month old doesn\u2019t say many words, though their child is more advanced than my NT son at that age). She is upset because someone observed this fact and told others. As if being slow is a horrendous insult to one\u2019s child (and apparently to the parent too). As the mother of a remarkably slow child, I don\u2019t see such things as insults, I see it as a fact \u2013 correct or otherwise \u2013 about a child. Before I commented that I thought she was over-reacting (and being somewhat insulting in the process), I had to read my way through comment after comment replying to her that it was indeed a terrible thing to say about a child, and that they were sure her child would turn out normal. All reinforcing the attitude that saying a child is anything other than normal really is some deep insult. But right at the bottom of the discussion, just as I was ready to comment, I read something that turned my stomach. Here\u2019s the comment in full: \u201c it is sad when people make comments about your beloved child\u2026.my sister said one of my daughters was retarded\u2026cause she smiled to much..she was a very happy delightful child\u2026\u2026.i was heartbroken.  her daughter has aspergers, so i guess Karma got her big time lol bet your girl is just gorgeous, give her a kiss and cuddle!!!!!!!! \u201d Read it again if you like, and yes, that\u2019s a real comment from an established member of the site. She was heartbroken because someone pointed out that they thought her child was slow too. She uses the word retarded but it is very unclear if that was the word actually used by her sister; my guess by the entire tone of the comment and all preceding comments is that \u201cretarded\u201d is her own word of choice for \u201cslow\u201d \u2013 developmental delayed or intellectually disabled \u2013 children. Her outrage appears directed at the sister\u2019s accusation, rather than the use of the word \u201cretarded.\u201d But that\u2019s not the main bit that turned my stomach, as you\u2019ve probably guessed. Apparently, \u201caccusing\u201d (pointing out) that you think someone else\u2019s child has issues, leads to the karma of having a truly challenged child yourself. That, according to this parent, is justice at work. Furthermore, not only is it justice, it is something to laugh about; to take glee in. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach you for showing concern for my child, now you have a child with serious issues, roll on the floor laughing why don\u2019t we all\u2026\u201d And then finish off with the proposition \u201cbet your girl is just gorgeous,\u201d as if that sits in juxtaposition to the claim that their child is otherwise slow. Now maybe I\u2019m reading too much into her pointing out that she thinks the girl in question might be gorgeous, but considering the tone of the entire comment, I doubt it. As is, there was enough there for me to be astounded. Even worse, not one of the preceding 30 or so commenters had any reply to this last person\u2019s thoughts, even though that last comment came mere minutes after the preceding one, the whole thread had been quite active through-out. That comment just sits there, on a very public and popular forum, no one saying boo or oi or what the f*ck. I discovered the conversation two days later and replied of course. Thankfully another person came along after me and shared my sentiments. But that was it. Clearly, slow children like mine are seen as something to be ashamed of by many people. Pointing out that a child is developmentally behind other children, is apparently a deep insult, to both the child and the parent. Being normal and developing normally, isn\u2019t just something to want for the well-being of your child, and a concern when it doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s some sort of moral statement and judgment that deserves a counter-attack of this sort of ferocity. With attitudes like these still buzzing around, and going unchallenged, it is no wonder that parents often don\u2019t seek an explanation of their child\u2019s challenges, or dismiss them when others bring them up. This makes the parents who do seek help, even stronger in my eyes; because they put their child\u2019s wellbeing and figuring out if their child needs help, beyond the category of mere gossip and insults. Clearly, there is a long way to go in raising awareness about developmental disabilities, and the fact that they are not something to be ashamed of \u2013 for anyone. The silence in response to that person\u2019s comment was itself \u2013 to me \u2013 a statement of its apparent acceptability. The real insult here, is the ignorance and lack of compassion of that last commenter. They \u2013 not slow children or their parents \u2013 have something to be ashamed of. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/32625013@N00/217209738"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/parenting-worlds-apart-the-insult-of-the-slow-child/", "title": "Parenting worlds apart; the insult of the \u201cslow\u00a0child\u201d"},
{"date": "August 4, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Because the awareness and (arguably accordingly) the numbers of autism, are on the rise, and yet it still remains mysterious and misunderstood, \u201cautism\u201d is an easy term to toss around when you want to sensationalize your latest cause. Whether its cell-phone towers or immunizations, polluted environments or plastic food containers, why not scare everyone by saying it causes autism, then dare them to disprove it when you haven\u2019t provided proof of your claim in the first place. What a fun game for us all to play. Such a popular game. So I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see someone claiming \u2013 without any research or explanation to back it up \u2013  that autism might be caused by the internet  too. It\u2019s an easy claim for me (or you, or anyone with a few brain cells to rub together), to attack. You could try to point out that the rise in autism numbers has a rather vast number of other far-better-documented-and-explained causes. You could point out that newborns and toddlers with autism haven\u2019t had internet access. You could talk about how autism is present in Amish populations too, and that there are many known genetic causes of autism. No doubt all such claims can be (will be) met with the reply that \u201cah, but you see, at least  some  of autism is being caused by the internet\u2026\u201d (That should sound familiar; you\u2019ll hear the same claims about some autism is being caused by cell-phone towers, plastics exposure, etc blah etc.) You still need proof though. Can they show you a single case where someone who clearly did not have autism, came to have autism after the thing in question, and explain scientifically how that change came about (controlling for correlation versus causation for instance). Anyway, I thought about writing a lengthy post attacking the claim properly \u2013 lots of reading lots of opinions and research \u2013 and began with your typical Google search. I waded my way through various off-topic and silly pieces, and then came across  something  very long, but also very beautiful, about the relationship between autism and the internet. It shared some things I was already aware of, such as how the internet can help autistic people express themselves without the challenges and confusions of facial expressions and body language. But it went well beyond that. It made the eye-opening connection between the way we understand the internet, and the way an autistic mind interacts with and makes sense of the world. It explained how the internet can be viewed like Braille for an autistic person. It shared the wonder and acceptance of many autistic people when they can use the internet to finally connect with others like themselves, gaining a sense of community and enhanced sense of self-worth. It is a wonderful piece of writing. And I wouldn\u2019t have discovered it if I hadn\u2019t been motivated to do a general search with the aim of exploring the (apparently completely unfounded) claim that the internet can cause autism. And so, though I don\u2019t have time to do a properly researched and better written post about autism and the internet, I can at least direct you towards someone who understands and celebrates \u2013 rather than attacks \u2013 the beautiful relationship between the internet and autism. *** The something rotten:  Susan Greenfield: Living online is changing our brains The something beautiful:  \u201cAutism and the Internet\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s the Wiring, Stupid\u201d , by Harvey Blume. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Internet_map_1024.jpg", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128236.400-susan-greenfield-living-online-is-changing-our-brains.html", "http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/blume.html", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128236.400-susan-greenfield-living-online-is-changing-our-brains.html", "http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/blume.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/a-quicky-on-the-internet-and-asd-how-something-rotten-lead-me-to-something-beautiful/", "title": "A quicky on the internet and ASD; how something rotten lead me to something\u00a0beautiful."},
{"date": "August 6, 2011", "body": "\n Image by natalia & gabriel via Flickr \n Neurodiversity. The better part of a year since I first heard the word, and I still can\u2019t tell you what it means. It\u2019s not for lack of trying: I\u2019ve been reading posts by people who label themselves as part of the movement; I\u2019ve read opinions by those from outside trying to define or critique the movement; I\u2019ve put plenty of my own time into trying to figure out an internally-consistent definition of it too. In one breath, it speaks to an open-minded attitude and acceptance of the various lives we choose to live (particularly of the value of different lives lived by disabled people). But in the next breath it excludes and invalidates any divergent opinions from the very people it purports to represent. For example, if an autistic individual should choose to speak out about the objective hardships of their condition and how they would prefer to live without autism, their opinions are likely to be attacked, ridiculed or dismissed as distorted, by the very people arguing that diversity is a good thing. But of course, not just any diversity;  their  diversity. Because neurodiversity is ironically often about seeing the world in one way; their way. It\u2019s very much like those who argue that the top value in this world is tolerance, and then attack people who are intolerant; tolerating anything as long as it\u2019s not intolerance. Letting anyone speak their minds unless their minds speak something different. To place tolerance \u2013 or in turn, diversity \u2013 as your top value, from which to attack other people, sets you up for a fast road to confusion and eventual contradiction. There are higher values than acceptance  for the sake of  acceptance. It needs to be \u201cwe want diversity / tolerance / acceptance  because \u2026\u201d.  Because  it leads to happier or fuller lives.  Because  it allows more personal / economic freedom. Etc. If the diversity being exalted actually ends up in more misery and objectively worse off lives \u2013 lives of restricted movement and interactions when the person dearly desires such things \u2013 then something has surely gone very wrong. There is an important further potential contradiction within the movement, that appears overlooked: If you see neurodiversity as a good in itself, then why is it inherently bad for someone to choose \u2013 if they indeed have that choice \u2013 to seek another neuro-way-of-being? To clarify, if someone with autism, would rather and actively chooses to go to another point on the rich and diverse neuro-diversity of mankind, then why is that something to be attacked? How is choosing to be  less  autistic by seeking treatment and a cure, worse than choosing to be  more  autistic, by completely giving in to autistic ways-of-being? The obvious reply is going to be one of authenticity or truth-to-self; that being autistic is a particular way of being that should not be fought but embraced and accepted. But that presupposes truths that the core of neurodiversity would seem to deny: That human beings can be always neatly pigeon-holed into one category or another. That we\u2019re not all on a spectrum (in the normal usage of the term) of existence where the lines of difference and disability are arbitrary and un-necessary. If it is true that the line between one type of mind and the next is arbitrarily and culturally (though those are not the same thing) defined, then who is to decree that someone can not of their own volition choose to slip towards one end or the other? Often the neurodiversity movement will not be this intense though; some (not all) accept that there is some defined grouping called \u201cautism\u201d (despite its historically and ever shifting parameters), which means a person is pre-determined to function, and perceive the world, in a particular way; and that denying that instinctual functioning and perception is somehow inauthentic, wrong, or ill-informed. But to take this holier-than-thou line denies the experiences and perceptions of many others who have the same condition; supposedly the same mind-iness. If there can be \u2013 is \u2013 this division, within a defined population group, then who gets to choose the correct voice? Who speaks the truth over the other\u2019s truth..? If one wants to speak  beyond  personal truths, then it seems the answer has to lie in science and objective evidence. If one side is claiming acceptance will remove all obstacles that autistic people face, and the other is claiming acceptance will still leave objective and severe challenges in those same lives, either someone is wrong, or they are both partially right. I personally see partial and co-existing truths here: Acceptance would help a lot, but it will not eradicate the objective problems faced by many autistic people; sometimes life-threatening problems. However, what is the point of all that discussion, if we can\u2019t pin down neurodiversity? Does it mean acceptance of an individual\u2019s choice to live exactly as they are; autistic or otherwise? Does it means broadening the perspectives and acceptance of others; to see disability and difference as natural variation when it doesn\u2019t objectively hurt anyone? Does it mean accommodation and encouragement of all and any mental diversity? It cannot be all of those things, but depending on who is speaking, it is. So \u2013 it would seem \u2013 there is diversity within neurodiversity, and some of that diversity explicitly  attacks  diversity. You may be noticing that subtle shift, if you didn\u2019t pick up on it earlier; as I move between \u201cdiversity\u201d re neuro, and diversity re beliefs and values. It\u2019s not fatal to what I\u2019m saying \u2013 it depends as always on what neurodiversity even means \u2013 but if it disturbs you and you dig deeper, you\u2019ll find it doesn\u2019t disappear quite so easily as that: You may be tempted to reply, that neurodiversity welcomes neurodiversity, just not diversity of  beliefs  about neurodiversity; that neurodiversity is valuing and acceptance  of  neurodiversity. Whereby the \u201ccorrect\u201d attitude and belief system is supposedly built into the word itself. The word is a value judgment. So the disagreement \u2013 the seeming lack of diversity / tolerance / acceptance \u2013 is at the level of the value placed on neuro-diversity. Claiming then, an authority on perception; an access to truth higher than those who don\u2019t place the same value on it. But on what grounds? Science? Science will show you things but not tell you how to value them. It may reveal the slippery slopes between one mental state and the \u201cnext,\u201d it may reveal an unrecognised history of a condition, but it will still  show  you the differences and the existence of the condition; the closeness of L to M does not deny the existence of A and Z. (I have written before about the  common folly of thinking penumbras ruin all meaningful categorization .) Maybe the grounds of cultural and anthropological awareness; difference is treated differently in different societies. But do they still recognise difference? Yes, even if only to show that someone of a certain ability and temperament is better suited to a particular role within the community than another. Is there a way to perhaps stand outside of culture and make an objective statement about what you\u2019ve observed? If you fully appreciate the complexities and deeply developmentally-ingrained ways in which we perceive the world, you\u2019re going to have to be very suspicious of your own claims to then be able to transcend what you\u2019re observing; to think you have  the  correct way to make sense of the observed variation. Which is all to say that sooner or later, as you travel the neurodiversity road, you\u2019ll have to admit that you\u2019ve added in a value judgment that claims an objectivity that supposedly gives you the right to drown out and deny the voices of those choosing a different perception  of neurodiversity . It is  that  value judgement \u2013 that neurodiversity is  itself  a good thing, an intrinsically and always good thing, and above other competing values of what is good \u2013 that remains a tripping stone even  if  one chooses to argue that diversity in a broader sense is not at the heart of the movement (and I have already outlined that that\u2019s not self-evidently the case). So where does this leave us? Mostly where we started. Nowhere. Because without a clear non-self-contradictory definition of neurodiversity, it\u2019s hard to either praise or attack it; to draw conclusions about its value or correctness. Better to openly state one\u2019s belief, than hop on the neurodiversity band-wagon, because that wagon is over-loaded and the wheels look wobbly from where I sit. I used to think I knew what neurodiversity meant, and I hated it. Then I thought it meant something else and I loved it. Then I thought about it further and wrote a post called \u201c Acceptance of Diversity within Neurodiversity .\u201d (And if you can appreciate the circuitousness of that link, then you\u2019re starting to get my point.) \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/87718749@N00/273867675"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/acceptance-of-diversity-within-neurodiversity/", "title": "Acceptance of Diversity within Neurodiversity\u00a0(?)"},

Indeed, not just irrelevant, but also potentially harmful; the autistic child experiences and understands the world in a way remarkably different from a neurotypical child. Those differences impact on almost every aspect of parenting: Discipline; parental expectations; developmental milestones; age-appropriate behaviours; peer relationships; education, etc. If you try to apply completely \u201cnormal\u201d parenting practices to autistic children, without adapting them to directly take into account autism, you risk worsening autism symptoms and unnecessarily upsetting your child, without any gain to show for it. \u201c NurtureShock \u201d does fit into the genre of a parenting book about \u201cnormal\u201d children (as opposed to special needs, or specifically, autistic children). It is a parenting book with an important difference though. It isn\u2019t following the latest parenting trends; it is analysing and deconstructing them. It isn\u2019t proposing the \u201cnew, correct and only\u201d way to parent; it gives you the research and helps you navigate the minefield of half-truths and mixed messages. And though I was drawn to it out of a more general interest in psychology and the science of parenting, it did share some important insights that relate to parenting an autistic child. I\u2019m going to share a few of them. The book contains ten chapters that investigate common misconceptions seen in modern parenting practices, and in children\u2019s education more generally. I\u2019ll specifically be touching on parts from three chapters. Everything I mention will be merely introductory; I would rather encourage you to read the book for yourself to get a full understanding of the issues and the research. Chapter 3: \u201cWhy white parents don\u2019t talk about race.\u201d  This chapter investigates the popular wisdom that merely being around people different from themselves, will encourage and teach children to realise that those differences (the writers focus on race) are arbitrary or unimportant. However, children have a very natural tendency to see difference, and to align themselves with similarity. You can even introduce manufactured similarity (such as wearing the same coloured t-shirts) and overtime children will start to attach meaning to it. The meaning they attach isn\u2019t just \u201cthis is the same as me\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cand therefore it is better than what is different from me.\u201d The important point then is that simply integrating children with difference, is not enough to teach them the irrelevance of those differences (in fact, it can worsen prejudices among children, since children are highly perceptive of difference); you need to specifically and consciously teach the fact that such differences are irrelevant, eg, that the colour of someone\u2019s skin doesn\u2019t matter. You can see how this might impact on the questions of inclusion for disabilities. It is one thing to advance and encourage inclusion, it is a further question though whether to draw attention to and explain those differences. It would seem that mere inclusion (if we extrapolate from the discussion in the chapter; these are my thoughts, not the writers\u2019), is insufficient. Yes it would be nice to not have to discuss why our children talk and behave differently, in an ideal world it shouldn\u2019t matter (the same way that we\u2019d love race to not be noticed too). But (and my personal experience very strongly supports this view), children will quickly notice that our sons and daughters are different in some important ways, all by themselves. If we don\u2019t want our children bullied or ostracised, we need to find ways to communicate an understanding of those differences. Their presence in and of itself, does not remove the problem in the eyes of other children. Children are not a blank slate in this way; they are pre-programmed to notice and respond to difference. Chapter 4: \u201cWhy kids lie.\u201d  Lying is one of the most disliked traits in children, at least that\u2019s what we tell them. But our own behaviour as adults, and the way we act when our children start lying, sends a different message. The particularly interesting point here from the perspective of a parent of an autistic child, is an understanding of what lying means from a developmental and skills perspective. It\u2019s quite classic to hear parents of autistic children proudly stating their children are better than neurotypical children, because autistic children have a strong (often irresistible) tendency to tell the truth rather than lie. But the ability to lie can grant huge social advantage, and represents the skill of being able to see the world from another\u2019s perspective. It \u201c demands both advanced cognitive development and social skills that honesty simply doesn\u2019t require .\u201d Contemplating this makes me less inclined to think highly of the fact that many autistic children are so consistently and deeply honest: It is one thing to be honest because you had the ability to lie and chose not to; it is another thing to be honest because you lacked the skills others have to even attempt dishonesty. I don\u2019t think \u201clack of skill\u201d is something to be proud of in this way. (It would be arguably akin to celebrating that a child who can\u2019t see doesn\u2019t care what your skin colour is.) I am more interested in the teaching of the abilities and skills that (consequently / incidentally) lead to the ability to lie, followed by the further teaching to reinforce and encourage truthfulness. (Though the chapter really does open your eyes to the true frequency and realities of children\u2019s lies.) My own son is currently going through a phase of greatly enjoying deceit. He has figured out how to lie and trick people (long after his same-age peers figured out the same). He doesn\u2019t do it with malice per se, he does it because he finds amusement in incongruence and others\u2019 reactions. We are in the drawn-out and frustrating process of teaching him when it\u2019s OK to be silly (because there is value to the \u201clying\u201d he uses during pretend play, the book does explain the value of pretend play), and when he must give correct answers and tell the truth. It is a hard lesson to teach, but I am very glad he is in the position to learn it. Chapter 10, \u201cWhy Hannah talks and Alyssa doesn\u2019t\u201d  was a sad reminder of the depth of difference between an autistic child\u2019s verbal abilities, and those of a \u201cnormally\u201d developing child. Even though the chapter stresses the wider range of \u201cnormal\u201d, in doing so, it even more strongly accented for me that my son was never within the normal range, even at its extremes. In some ways this is reassuring because you realise the tactics that research has found to be helpful for developing and enhancing a child\u2019s speech, can\u2019t really be used with the \u201caverage\u201d autistic child; it\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t do something you should have or did something you shouldn\u2019t have. The joint-attention, the vocalizing, the play and interactions required for normal speech development are typically things you must first actively and laboriously teach an autistic child, whereas they are building blocks ready for use with a normal child. And the resulting emergence of speech and apparent ease with which a normal child can organise their vocabulary, reminds you to adjust your expectations with an autistic child; it doesn\u2019t come naturally for them. Don\u2019t get upset at the child or yourself, and don\u2019t compare them to other children; the only valid comparison \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 is to themselves. If they are improving, that\u2019s wonderful. If they aren\u2019t, you need to seek out new methods to either help them develop speech or find alternate ways to enrich and assist their communication. There are other very good chapters and discussions in the book too (and I\u2019ll take this chance just to remind you that the extrapolations to how this applies to autism are my own, though the writers to very briefly mention autism at one point). It\u2019s a well written, well researched, thought-provoking book. I recommend it for anyone particularly interested in child development, modern parenting practices, and education policies and practices more generally. It\u2019s not your average parenting book, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s worth reading. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/nurture.jpg", "http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Nurtureshock-Po-Bronson-Ashley-Merryman/9780091933784?cf=3&rid=1688509785&i=1&keywords=nurtureshock"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/nurtureshock-book-review-from-the-perspective-of-a-parent-of-an-autistic-child/", "title": "\u201cNurtureShock\u201d: Book review from the perspective of a parent of an autistic\u00a0child"},
{"date": "August 4, 2011", "body": "\n Image by mattbeckwith via Flickr \n Please note, this post is just the result of personally driven research over the past couple of days. It is not the informed opinion of someone who works with or lives with children who have either Fragile X or Rett syndrome. I am very open to being corrected if I have made any factual errors. I saw researching, writing and sharing this post as an educational opportunity. Please feel free to accordingly further my education. The criteria for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refer to symptoms rather than cause. So there are a variety of causes (some known, many unknown), that will lead to an ASD diagnosis. With the looming changes to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5), there has been increased awareness and discussion of how known genetic causes \u2013 such as Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome \u2013 affect the accuracy of an ASD diagnosis. The proposals in DSM-5, recommend the removal of Retts from the diagnostic manual, and therefore, out of its current position as one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) that form the \u201cautism spectrum.\u201d However, Fragile X, which is the leading known genetic cause of autism, would not be excluded from the spectrum in the DSM-5. Understanding why these two genetic conditions which lead to autism, will be treated differently in regards to autism in the DSM-5, sheds some light on the broader relationship between genetic causes of autism, and autism as a symptom-defined condition. Like ASD, Rett syndrome can be diagnosed purely on symptom criteria. Unlike autism (in the broadest sense; the spectrum as a whole), the specific genetic mutation causing the symptoms of Retts, is known and can be identified in the individual. The rationale for the removal of Retts from the DSM-5 turns not strictly on the fact that the cause of the autism is known (otherwise, Fragile X and other genetic causes would also exclude an autism diagnosis). The  rationale includes  the fact that Rett patients often only have autistic symptoms for a brief period in early in childhood, so inclusion in the autism spectrum is not appropriate for most of these patients. The diagnosis of autism is usually highly stable, with  only 7% falling off the spectrum  on follow-up. (As a side point, it is interesting to note too that Retts almost exclusively affects girls, whereas autism is usually found in a male to female ratio of 4:1.) Fragile X syndrome is not so closely tied to the symptoms that match autism, as Retts is. Whereas Retts syndrome is considered part of the autism spectrum, many people with Fragile X syndrome are not autistic, can exhibit other and distinct (sometimes severe) outcomes of the syndrome, and can be carriers (not exhibiting symptoms at all). About a third of children with Fragile X syndrome meet the criteria for ASD (though only between 2% and 6% of autistic children have Fragile X syndrome). The proposed DSM-5 recommends clearly identifying if there is a known genetic cause of a person\u2019s autism; explicitly including Fragile X as an example of such a cause. There are good reasons for this. Not just because the family and extended family need to know they might be carriers and how this can affect future children. But also because particular treatments and therapies better suit children with Fragile X (or other conditions), than the wider autistic population. There is ongoing research also specifically directed at Fragile X, which could specifically benefit those people whose autism is caused by it (it\u2019s worth noting too that breakthroughs in  such research may indeed also end up benefitting those with autism not caused by Fragile X ). So Fragile X and autism are separate diagnoses, which may also occur together. In the same way that a vast variety of other conditions can make it more likely a child exhibits autistic behaviours, yet falls short of meeting the criteria for autism. Other than Rett syndrome, there are no other genetic conditions that automatically and explicitly fall under the autism spectrum umbrella in the DSM-IV. That is to say, there is no single and known genetic (or as yet, environmental) cause for the other categories; CDD, PDD-NOS, Aspergers, and (classic) autism. (Those four remaining categories of autism spectrum disorder, would be essentially  folded into the single reference term of \u201cautism spectrum disorder\u201d rather than \u201cPDD\u201d  as they are currently know in the DSM-IV-TR. The criteria for that new all-encompassing category will be changed to accommodate and clarify what falls under its umbrella, and what does not. The exact details of that are far wider ranging that what I am covering in this post, though I have previously  shared my personal opinion on the matter  if you\u2019re interested.) As autism and its range of causes become better understood, it will be interesting to see what goes the way of Rett (as a separate, genetic condition that often presents differently from the majority of people on the spectrum), and what goes the way of Fragile X (an underlying condition that mostly does not present itself as autism). There are going to be (and already are) a raft of conditions that fall between and beyond those two genetic examples, but they are instructive in trying to get your head around the ongoing discourse about the relevance of autism causes, and about the future of the autism diagnostic category more generally. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/90058596@N00/4485330575", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=95#", "http://www.dsm5.org/research/pages/autismandotherpervasivedevelopmentaldisordersconference%28february3-5,2008%29.aspx", "https://sfari.org/news-and-commentary/open-article/-/asset_publisher/6Tog/content/drug-trials-for-fragile-x-syndrome-lead-the-way-for-autism-therapies", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94#"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/genetic-origins-of-autism-when-is-autism-not-autism-fragile-x-and-rett-syndrome/", "title": "Genetic origins of Autism; when is autism, not autism?

{"date": "August 8, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n In an attempt to defend herself against growing outrage at  her suggested link between autism and internet use , Baroness Susan Greenfield has stated the following: \u201cI have never claimed new technologies are causing autism. Rather, I\u2019ve said that the increase in lack of empathy, that is documented scientifically, may be leading to behaviours like that and this should be explored.\u201d (From the  Daily Mail .) So, if I am reading that correctly, she is equating \u201can increase in lack of empathy\u201d with autistic behaviours. (Do let me know if you read her statement differently, but the rest of this post takes her words as they are, and is based on her previous statement clearly linking the rise of autism with internet use.) Autistic behaviours are those defined in the DSM-IV-TR , as qualitative impairment in social interactions, communication, and restricted or sterotyped patterns of behaviour. When you broaden autistic behaviours to include the other four pervasive developmental disorders that make up the autism spectrum (as it\u2019s come to be known), you don\u2019t need all three areas of impairment (sometimes two is enough, and Retts and CDD have somewhat different criteria). If any of those three areas of impairment include or suggest a \u201clack of empathy,\u201d it would come under the head of \u201csocial interactions.\u201d But empathy is not mentioned nor necessarily implied, in the description of those impairments. Specifically, the mentioned social interaction problems are as follows: impairment in the use of non-verbal behaviours, failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to level of development, a lack of spontaneously seeking shared enjoyment, and a lack of social or emotional reciprocity. An autism diagnosis (though for not all conditions on the spectrum) requires only two of those social impairments to be present. If someone with autism had every single one of those social impairment criteria (my son, for instance, had everything on that list when he was diagnosed), that would not mean they lacked empathy. It might mean they are very withdrawn, which is often the case. But having immense trouble interacting with and understanding other people, is not the same thing as lacking empathy. Indeed, there has been growing understanding that autistic people often suffer from too much awareness of others emotions and feel overwhelmed by facial expressions (again, my son has become such a person). Even if an autistic person cannot read another person\u2019s body language and facial expressions, and struggles to understand what another person means, that is a very different claim from the idea that they don\u2019t  care  what the other person feels and thinks. Being able to understand what someone else feels and thinks and  not caring  about it, is something else entirely. A very nasty something else, and incidentally, the same something-else that is often linked to internet use; the trolling, cyber-bullying, griefing behaviours that concern parents and society more generally. It has been argued that internet time \u2013 particularly the time spent on an internet by a\u00a0 parent when the should be interacting with a child \u2013 can reduce a child\u2019s ability to learn from and about body cues and facial expressions. But the internet time would have to be extraordinarily extreme to actually give rise to anything like autistic behaviours, and the child would have to be excluded from interactions with other human beings too, who would otherwise have passed along this non-verbal information. Furthermore, in addition to this extremely deprived situation, the child would have to somehow pick up repetitive / stereotyped behaviours, and have marked communication problems or abnormalities, for an actual diagnosis of autism. The idea that abuse or neglect on this sort of scale, could lead to autism, is an old and fully debunked theory. There is no connection  at all  between parental abuse or neglect of a child, and a child getting autism. There are entire cultures that do what we in the West would consider extremely neglectful behaviour when bringing up their young children, and yet they do not have higher rates of autism (anyone not familiar with such cultures and the fact that there is no connection between abuse and autism, would be well recommended to read \u201cUnstrange Minds\u201d by Richard Grinker). Autism is, by definition, a\u00a0 pervasive developmental  disorder; both those words \u2013 pervasive, and developmental \u2013 are essential to appreciating the nature of the condition. What of the older age groups then \u2013 the teenagers who are face-down in the internet and technology, and thereby take on \u201cautistic behaviours.\u201d Considering that autism isn\u2019t something you suddenly get as a teenager, this is a very misguided approach. Autism is present from very early on in life; usually evident before the third birthday, and often by 12 months old. Less severe forms of autism may go un-diagnosed until the teen (or even later) years, but there is no evidence linking such diagnoses with increased internet use. None. (If you know of some, do share, I\u2019d be very interested to have a look.) Again, you would have to also account for such things as repetitive behaviours; even if internet use lead to lower social skills and communication skills, and even if we labeled this \u201cempathy\u201d, where did the autistic stereotyped behaviours come from? But there\u2019s a great big elephant in the room that I haven\u2019t even pointed out yet. It\u2019s got a great big sign on it that points out that internet use has also been linked with  higher levels of empathy  and  more real-world social interactions . So even if the internet was leading to lower levels of empathy that created more \u201cautistic behaviours,\u201d might it not \u2013 in the same breath and reasoning \u2013 be reversing autistic behaviours and tendencies? (Though I think the link to autism in either direction is weak and unconvincing.) There are some things we do know about autism and internet use. We know that the internet allows autistic people to get jobs, make friends, get a sense of belonging and self-worth, that might not have otherwise been possible.  If there is a link between autism and the internet, it would seem to be one that helps those who are already autistic , not turns non-autistic people into autistics. To demonize internet use, is to not helping autistic people, in fact it may harm them in some very real ways. There is one way to perhaps save the statement linking lack of empathy to autistic behaviours, as arguably represented by the social impairment criteria for autism. Which is to say that the behaviours at issue are only the social impairment ones, not autism as a whole (this is definitely a way someone might read Greenfield\u2019s statement). However, that makes the \u201cautism\u201d reference entirely redundant. Autism is not just social impairment, (even  if  social impairment there meant lack of empathy). If what she means is just social impairment, then she should say that. If what she means is just lack of empathy, then she should say that. Autism, on this reading, is in no way part of the picture, and is a meaningless tag-on word serving no obvious nor helpful function. In the meantime, the damage to understanding autism, its behaviours, and its causes, is already done. Headings like those at the top of the story by the Guardian on this matter, \u201c Research linking autism to internet use is criticised, \u201d makes it all the harder, since there is no such research (and in the piece itself they don\u2019t even suggest or refer to any such research; it is just a bad header). And just when I thought the story was bad enough, she had to throw in that suggested link to empathy, which is a widely-spread misunderstanding about autism already, and which particularly damages the public\u2019s willingness to interact with, and themselves empathise with, people on the autism spectrum. Autistic people are not unfeeling, uncaring monsters. Struggling with non-verbal and verbal language, doesn\u2019t make you a  sociopath  nor a  psychopath . Lack of empathy is not part of the definition or description of autism. Suggesting it is, is not only wrong, it is harmful. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autismawareness.png", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128236.400-susan-greenfield-living-online-is-changing-our-brains.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2023535/Battle-dons-internet-link-autism-scientists-claim-PCs-shorten-attention-span.html?ito=feeds-newsxml", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/born-love/201007/the-internets-long-memory-and-empathy", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2023535/Battle-dons-internet-link-autism-scientists-claim-PCs-shorten-attention-span.html?ito=feeds-newsxml", "http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/blume.html", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/06/research-autism-internet-susan-greenfield?CMP=twt_fd", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociopathy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopath#Characteristics"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/does-loss-of-empathy-make-you-autistic-continuance-of-the-internet-asd-debacle/", "title": "Does Loss of Empathy make you Autistic?

{"date": "August 13, 2011", "body": "\n Image by natalia & gabriel via Flickr \n I  wrote a post  a week ago about the problems with defining \u201cNeurodiversity.\u201d The questions I posed in that piece remain un-answered (and perhaps that is because there are no answers; I will discuss that and its consequences later in this post). I was given to think that I could expect some answers from the particularly articulate and thoughtful Mark Stairwalt, from  Shift Journal , which directly and proudly links itself to neurodiversity. What I got instead , was repetition of the central problem I pointed out in the first place; but this time the problems I\u2019d identified were presented as something to be proud of; that the lack of definition and answers about the neurodiversity movement and neurodiversity itself, is a strength rather than a weakness. I \u2013 perhaps not surprisingly \u2013 think this is neither enlightened nor helpful. I regularly encounter these types of arguments with my students, and have had to explain why it is so important to attempt definitions, and why the claim that there is no definition is itself a definition. This might not be obvious, and the importance of it might not be obvious either. So, for the sake of clarity \u2013 and with the aim of trying to elicit some answers to my original and serious questions \u2013 I shall endeavour to explain. To say that something \u2013 such as neurodiversity \u2013 lacks a fixed definition is  itself  a claim. A disputable, and disputed, claim. It is not a \u201cmeta-claim\u201d, by which I mean, a claim that absorbs or explains every other attempt to define neurodiversity. It does not sit  above  other definitions or attempts at definitions, it sits  along-side  them. It can be wrong; the question remains: Is it? It\u2019s like me claiming a bike is a vehicle, and you claim it isn\u2019t, and a third person claims the definitions of bike and vehicles are ever-changing and unfixed (concluding that there is no one definition for \u201cbike\u201d or \u201cvehicle\u201d). The person who makes that last statement is not outside of the contest for definitional clarity, they are  part  of the contest, just as much asserting their view-point and rightness as the other two. The search for definitions and clarity is not a fool\u2019s game, made up of people who do not understand the flux of the world and the fuzzy edges of certainty. There are some people who are over-fixated with certainty, to the point that they sacrifice accuracy by ignoring the fuzzy edges and flux. But there are also people at the other extreme (and Mark would seem to be one, and proudly so), who sees truth and reality as always changing, always referential, and never absolute. Both extremes make error. They are doing what I have referred to before as either ignoring or fixating on the penumbra, which is just a fancy word for the fuzzy edges of words, categories and \u201ctruths:\u201d If you ignore the edges you make the error of over-simplifying matters to the point of overall inaccuracy. But if you focus too intently on the edges, you make the error of thinking there  is no  centre. Relevant to our purposes, that would be like saying there is no core definition or purpose of neurodiversity (or the neurodiversity movement) just because there is some disagreement around the edges about its precise application or wording. For example, we can identify a car when it has four wheels, and is newly off the construction line, but at what point does it stop being a car? When it has no wheels and is rusted by the side of the road? When it has all its parts but it is squashed into a scrap heap cube? And we know a car is a vehicle, but is a bike, is a skateboard? When people say these confusions mean we can\u2019t define \u201ccar\u201d or \u201cvehicle\u201d they are over-focusing on the penumbra and ignoring the truth and relevance of the central instances. (If you\u2019re interested in reading further my thoughts about such issues, I direct you to two previous posts: \u201c Language and Autism: The impact of penumbra and generalized instances, on debates about the existence of, and functioning levels within,\u00a0ASD \u201d and \u201c Law, Science, Burdens of Proof and Contextual Truth .\u201d) This is not pretty word play and pointless philosophical musings. This has consequences. Especially for the neurodiversity movement, and indeed any movement or terminology linked to an effort to change behaviour, attitudes and beliefs. If a term becomes attached to a rights movement \u2013 like neurodiversity is \u2013 then the term can (and has) quickly become short-hand for a particular (more complicated) viewpoint and ideas. As that happens \u2013 and if they term is not defined well \u2013 it can in turn be easily misrepresented and attacked. That\u2019s called a strawman argument, and it can be particularly effective and powerful in this context: If a term is redefined by people who want to stop a movement for what ever reasons (they perhaps want to stop the accomplishment of a particular aim of the movement which counters their own aims), they can claim it stands for something it doesn\u2019t, then attack the latter. Let me give you a very clear and common example directly in point. The neurodiversity movement is often linked to efforts to extend acceptance and accommodation of autistic people. But others want autism to be fought and wiped out, not embraced. So it suits their purposes to cast the neurodiversity movement as extreme; as accepting of all mental abnormalities no matter how devastating to the affected individual, and as anti any treatment to lessen the impact of autism itself. If the neurodiversity movement is indeed in favour of these views (and it is not at all clear that they are, as I discussed in my original post), then the attack is valid. But if this is a distortion of the movement and its aims, then the attack is a dangerous and misleading strawman which undercuts the other aims of the movement in the process. If neurodiversity remains undefined in the face of such challenges, then it cannot fight them off, and its aims and achievements are in danger. So my questions are only pretty and pointless philosophical musings if you don\u2019t care about the real world consequences of changes in actions, attitudes and beliefs. It is precisely  because of reality  that these philosophical musings matter. It seems to me that there is a way forward from the mess. The start, is to separate out the definition of the word neurodiversity from the Neurodiversity movement (capital N). The second, is to declare if there is a central, or many, neurodiversity movements. The next would be to be very clear about the aims and beliefs of any  particular  Neurodiversity movement. Since there are such extremes within what a movement could be aiming for \u2013 from general awareness, to full on acceptance, to extensive accommodation, denial of treatment or criminality of treatment \u2013 it appears to me that it would be best to be extremely clear about what you\u2019re trying to achieve and why, instead of simply adopting the term \u201cneurodiversity\u201d (which is the general conclusion of my original post). However, it is clear that there are some people and organisations which claim to be  the  neurodiversity movement, despite the fact that they are in contention with others who claim the same. It is a mess. An unhelpful one. And thereby my call for clarity and pointing out the specific confusions in order to aid the road towards that clarity. So, while I do genuinely appreciate Mark\u2019s valiant (and beautifully expressed) effort to answer my questions \u2013 by effectively saying they didn\u2019t need answers \u2013 I remain unconvinced. I think the answers are worth seeking, and I think they matter. If the truth is there are no definitions here \u2013 that it is ever-changing flux as he suggests \u2013 then the term \u201cneurodiversity\u201d loses much of its force for change (though not all of it), and remains an easy target for straw-man attacks aiming to undercut even its most widely-acceptable and agreeable aims. If the aims and beliefs of neurodiversity matter, then defining neurodiversity (and Neurodiversity) also matters. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/87718749@N00/273867675", "http://www.shiftjournal.com/", "http://www.shiftjournal.com/2011/08/12/cornering-slim-shady-in-the-round-barn-on-pinning-down-neurodiversity/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/08/13/reply-to-cornering-slim-shady-in-the-round-barn-re-the-definition-of-neurodiversity/", "title": "Reply to \u201cCornering Slim Shady in the Round Barn\u201d re the definition of\u00a0Neurodiversity"},
{"date": "December 7, 2010", "body": "\n Image by Dea Bee via Flickr \n Yesterday, I had a beautiful thought. Right after I\u2019d had it I realised how amazing it was, considering everything I\u2019ve been through with my son. Before I tell you what the thought was, I just want to say a little about what\u2019s been so great lately, that lead up to it. My autistic son is coming up to his last week of kindergarten. His first week there, so long ago, was all tears and biting and screaming, with me unable to leave his side week after week. Now when I drop him off at kindy he is all smiles and hugs and confidence, and yesterday was no exception. Next week he will be having two \u201ctransition visits\u201d to the primary school he will be attending next year. There was a time that I was sure he\u2019d never fit into the school system and I\u2019d have to home-school him. But we\u2019ve found the perfect school, and teacher, for him, and in the place of my usual worries about his future education, is hopefulness and happiness. After his morning kindy session, it was time to try his first ever haircut. This is a huge deal for a child like mine, who has a big array of sensory issues that come up at a hairdresser\u2019s, including the major one of water being sprayed on his head (see my  Water Wars post  about my son and water). But due to careful planning, lots of management of anxieties, and me counting down from 100 twice in a row while he sat in the chair, we managed to get his haircut! I was so ecstatic I had to stop myself from hugging the hairdresser. The proud mummy in me wanted to tell everyone in the store \u201chey look, my son just had a haircut!\u201d We went next door to The Warehouse, he chose two little cars as his treat, and we went home. That would have been enough of wonderful for me, but there was more to come. As the day continued at home (with my eldest telling me over and over that he now had short-hair, and even trying to tell me that this meant he was now a man), my two boys laughed and played together. Enjoying each other as brothers in a way that we could have only dreamed of when we first made the long thought-out and hard decision to have a second child (see my post about that decision  here ). And as I sat there, watching them giggle, seeing my eldest with his new haircut, and feeling full of pride for mastering a new experience that could have so easily ended in an endless meltdown, I had a simple thought, that just floated into this often exhausted and worried mind of mine: How truly lucky I am, to be the mother of these two amazing boys.

{"date": "December 5, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I\u2019m going to defend the indefensible: According to modern  study  after modern  study , I am an evil lazy mum for leaving my television on from dusk till dawn. I am ruining my children\u2019s eyes, their imaginations, and making them fat in the process. All day, every day, our television is on TVNZ 6, otherwise known as \u201c Kidzone \u201c. The channel is non-stop kids programs \u2013 no advertisements. The programs repeat every four hours, so they potentially see each show three times a day. My kids are so used to the television being on, that it means little to them. Both get up and do lots of other indoors and outdoors activities; the television being on is nothing special or worthy of attention most of the time. Sometimes a favourite show will come on ( The Wiggles  or  Fireman Sam ), and one or the other will pay attention for a while. When the television does capture my autistic son\u2019s attention I use that opportunity to teach him how to follow story lines and comment and elaborate on what he sees. If it\u2019s something like  The Wiggles  we do the dances together, because that\u2019s just plain fun, but also because it helps his co-ordination. Because the shows repeat three times a day, he gets the chance to become familiar with a show he may be liking that day \u2013 by the third time it comes around he starts to understand and enjoy what most kids would have picked up the first time round. There are times every day when my son\u2019s autism makes him have to seek refuge from human interaction \u2013 the world becomes overwhelming, and if he doesn\u2019t go off and do something passive and non-challenging for a while, he will have a meltdown. When those times come he climbs onto the couch, goes into a self-pressure pose to relax his body and watches the television quietly, until he\u2019s ready to engage with other humans and the world around him again. The television is also background noise. My son has a wide range of sensory issues due to his autism. One of his issues is needing a steady stream of background noise. This need developed prior to the television being on so much through-out the day \u2013 I used to have to satisfy it with computer noise or talking to him non-stop, I\u2019d get a sore throat from trying to meet his needs and still he\u2019d need me to talk through my croaky pain. The television fills this role beautifully. There are days when he won\u2019t want the television on, and those times he will turn it off himself, and that\u2019s fine too. The television is on for him, not us. Both my children get out of the house a lot too. In particular my five-year old attends about two hours of kindergarten a day, visits his grandma and great-grandma each weekend, and has various other shop visits and outings through-out the week and weekend. But when you add up the time the kids spend at home, with that television going in the background, it\u2019s a lot of hours every single day. So is my five-year-old autistic son fat due to all this television? No, if anything he\u2019s slightly on the skinny side. Is he physically inactive? Anything but \u2013 he\u2019s a non-stop bustle of noise and movement most of any given day. Does he stay inside all day \u2013 no. Do his eyes have issues with focus or movement \u2013 no (his eyes have been tested). Are there any bad side-effects that I have seen with his television watching? No, in fact I\u2019ve seen a wide variety of very positive effects it has had on him. Every day we do art and games and reading and writing and work on his skills and language, the television has never got in the way of that, only helped it \u2013 by leveling out his sensory issues, or giving him down time, or inspiring us both with new activities and interests we can do together. My eleven month old is largely indifferent to the television unless something particularly engaging is on, he just trots around and laughs and plays. At this very moment he is playing with the patterns the sunlight is casting on the carpet. I\u2019ve seen how children react when they\u2019re usually deprived of television, and then get the chance to see it at someone else\u2019s house \u2013 as will inevitably happen. They act like it\u2019s a big deal, can barely pull their eyes away, and trying to interrupt their laser focus on this wonderful (and it is wonderful) thing, is almost futile. It is that sort of intense television watching that appears potentially damaging to me; not the way in which I use it. I just see the television as a valuable resource, which I am using to full effect. I still feel guilty when people come around and the television is on, but only because of the modern parenting \u201cwisdom\u201d against showing children television. In case you haven\u2019t noticed in my blog yet, I\u2019m not too enamoured with modern parenting wisdom; I prefer to think for myself, to apply my research and common-sense to the specific situations my children are in. My autistic five-year old has advanced this past year in ways that astound his therapists and my family and friends, and my eleven month old is one amazingly happy and healthy little man, he\u2019s ticking off those developmental milestones at an impressive pace. So clearly, this evil lazy mummy is doing something right. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TV_highquality.jpg", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10642485", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10662945", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10685690"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/05/dont-touch-that-dial/", "title": "Don\u2019t Touch That\u00a0Dial\u2026"},
{"date": "December 7, 2010", "body": "\n Image by midiman via Flickr \n I\u2019ve often thought how much easier it would have been over the past two years, to be dealing with a single expert on autism, instead of a wide range of therapies and therapists. There are some organisations and movements which offer up a complete service; purporting to have a one-size-fits-all therapy for autism, but they are all controversial in their own ways. The current government approach is to have a team of therapists, each with their own areas of expertise, who can be made available as needed for each child\u2019s issues. As a family we also chose to seek out private help. There is a lot to be said on this topic, as to what therapies work, and whether any single therapy is best. This is just an introductory post to the range of therapies we have tried. Speech Therapy  was provided by the government. It is absolutely vital for an autistic child to have access to someone who understand the language challenges they face, and in particular to educate the parents on how to understand and improve the child\u2019s efforts to communicate. Occupational Therapy  was provided by the government. For autistic children it\u2019s particularly to do with figuring out and learning to cope with sensory issues. It also provides ways to teach them basic life skills that they may struggle with, such as drinking from a cup and getting dressed. Physiotherapy , provided by the government. Autistic children often have low muscle tone and restrictive activities. The physiotherapist helped gradually extend the range of activities our son was willing to take part in \u2013 such as going up ramps, on swings, and throwing balls. These sessions were usually in a gym, and done with the occupational therapist present. Educational Psychology , also provided by the government. The main task of the educational psychologist has been to find ways to deal with behavioural issues, such as tantrums and repetitive behaviours. We\u2019ve had two educational psychologists work with us over the past two years. The times they were most useful to us were when they aided us to find our own understanding of our son\u2019s behaviour, and come up with our own solutions that specifically fit our family. Music Therapy . Not provided by the government, sought out privately. The therapy had a lot of potential, but the specific therapist we saw really upset our son, and the whole experience was frankly a disaster. I did learn and use some good music therapy techniques from my friend who works overseas as a music therapist though. ABA Therapy . Not provided by the government. Experienced via a charity-run group for autistic preschoolers, and by some one-on-one in-home carers. In some ways ABA is insightful, practical and inspiring. In other ways it appears harmful, impersonal, and ignorant. We took the best parts of it, and left the rest, which again is a useful approach to therapies in general, especially when you\u2019re exposed to therapies in a piecemeal and mutually inconsistent way; this mutual inconsistency happened even between the various government provided therapies. The list above is of the main therapies we were exposed to and tried. There were a few other bits and bobs along the way; pieces from other theories, therapies and approaches that we\u2019d study and apply, or meet people who would try therapies with our son for a while. Such as Montessori and  RDI . Something you have to learn early on is to not simply \u201ctrust the experts\u201d. Not least of all because they contradict each other, so you have to make some judgment calls about what is the most valuable for your child. You have to hold on to your parental instincts and rights at all times, and sometimes you have to fight to hold on to them. Just remember, being an expert on autism is never enough. For any therapy to work, they also have to be an expert on your individual child, and no one can do that better than you as a parent. You have to do constant research and thinking and unfortunately, experimenting, to try to get it right. Getting it wrong can make things so very much worse, so there\u2019s a lot at stake. Yet you can\u2019t let yourself get paralysed into non-action by being overwhelmed by the options available. It\u2019s a long hard journey, but so is everything that is worth doing. And the potential rewards are beyond any measure. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/41611970@N00/103909417", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_Development_Intervention"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/autism-therapies/", "title": "Autism Therapies"},
{"date": "December 10, 2010", "body": "\n Image by Josep Ma. Rosell via Flickr \n A few years ago, when everyone else\u2019s two and three-year old\u2019s were seeking out cuddles and tickles, my son was often going into meltdowns at the slightest touch. Now, at the age of five, he requires and seeks out intensive physical contact each day, such as us strongly squashing him with pillows, or hugs that literally take his breath away with their force. This might look like an extreme change in my son\u2019s sensitivities, but it\u2019s not. He still typically finds light touches or gentle cuddles quite unsettling, and if he\u2019s already in an anxious mood, they can tip into meltdown territory. His issues relate to the pressure of the touch, not touch itself. This is quite a common issue for autistic people. Temple Grandin\u2019s squeeze machine is a well-known example of how it can be addressed. She provides a good  explanation  of the sensory issues involved, for those of you interested in the finer details of the cerebellar abnormalities. As a family, we were introduced to the explanation of the issue \u2013 and techniques to address it \u2013 by our son\u2019s occupational therapist. Well-meaning family and friends see us give our son these energetic hugs and squeezes and seem to take them as evidence of him now liking being touched, whereas once they had to totally avoid it. I often see him squirm away from them when they gently touch his shoulder, or give him a swift hug, or attempt a light tickle session. He does his best to cope with the unpleasant sensations, it\u2019s something he\u2019s just going to have to get used to anyway; we can\u2019t always step in right before a touch-interaction and warn people for him that whatever they\u2019re about to do, it better be done firmly. I\u2019ve seen his attempts to cope with this issue at kindergarten. Early on he\u2019d just completely avoid any contact with the other children. Typically he would back up to get away from them, making his body as compact as possible. I watched one incident when a boisterous boy kept tripping his way over my son, even when my son had backed himself as far as he could into a corner. At one stage the boy was just standing with his back to my son, his bottom in my son\u2019s face, oblivious as children that age frequently are. I kept trying to tell the boy to move, get out-of-the-way; then sure enough, my son leant forward and bit the boy\u2019s shorts (not his skin thankfully). To anyone else this would have looked like aggressive un-provoked behaviour by my son. To me it was a predictable outcome of an autistic child under stress. My son\u2019s coping strategies have evolved since then. Now if the other children are climbing all over him or getting in his face, he just goes very quiet and still and waits for them to stop it. Sometimes he even manages to smile and quietly enjoy the social interaction; he\u2019s come a long way. I don\u2019t know whether he will ever overcome this sensitivity to light touch, and the need for deep pressure, but it seems highly unlikely. He is more likely to learn to hide and control his reactions, and to find ways to subtly provide himself with deep pressure when it\u2019s most needed (he needs the pressure most when he is anxious, but it is also a good method to stop him getting too anxious to begin with). Our methods of squashing him with pillows can\u2019t be a long-term solution, and definitely not a public one! The intense breath-taking hug however, is something I will always volunteer to give him when and wherever he wants it. And sometimes even when he doesn\u2019t want it, because that\u2019s what mothers do. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/10488545@N05/1865482908", "http://www.grandin.com/inc/squeeze.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/a-tender-squash/", "title": "A Tender Squash"},
{"date": "December 13, 2010", "body": "\n Image by merfam via Flickr \n Instead of using the cumbersome phrase of \u201cautism spectrum disorder\u201d, or having to constantly explain it\u2019s abbreviation of ASD, most people refer to this spectrum of conditions simply as \u201cautism\u201d. This simplification in terminology can be deceiving, and even harmful; setting suffering families at logger-heads with each other. Many times over the past couple of years, I have wished people would stop \u201cusing our label\u201d\u2026 The ways in which ASD affects people, and the severity of how it affects them, differs drastically. In turn, the way in which you can and should deal with an affected person, will also differ. So when someone purports to speak for all people suffering from autism \u2013 whether they think they have the treatment, the correct attitude, or the cure \u2013 you should be very wary. One of the first times we became aware of this issue as a family was when we started coming up against people who claimed autism was beautiful, special, and to be celebrated. This is often said of and by people who have Aspergers, high-functioning autism, or in reference to  savantism . They extend their message to encompass lower-functioning autistic people who can\u2019t, and maybe never will, be able to speak for themselves. That anyone could have found time to celebrate while suffering minute by minute through the meltdowns and violence that we often endured, through our son\u2019s evident misery and constant anxieties, seemed ridiculous in the extreme. But our son had moderate / severe \u201cclassic\u201d autism; not one of the more advanced or \u201cspecial\u201d ASD variations listed above. Since the public \u2013 as a general rule \u2013 doesn\u2019t grasp the huge variation in types and severity of ASD, they tend to generalise from the one or two incidents they have been exposed to. So, for example, autism becomes synonymous with  genius  or severe retardation. It\u2019s not just the general public, some professionals make errors or false generalisations too (such as  thinking sensitive ears is a requirement for diagnosis !). When these attitudes become those of policy makers or those who make funding or resource allocations, they can impact significantly on needy families like our own. Similarly, the treatments and cures offered up for \u201cautism\u201d, might only be useful and applicable to particular varieties and causes of ASD. (And of course, many of those treatments are completely  unproven  and  useless ). Causes of ASD vary, such as  random genetic mutations  prior to birth, or known genetic conditions that run in families like  Fragile X . Some of the known genetic causes of ASD come with specific types of problems that need to be addressed, such as special dietary considerations for  Rett Syndrome , but again, this is not true of all ASD people. Sometimes the symptoms of ASD can be apparently wiped out \u2013 such as for  about 20% of Aspergers\u2019 sufferers  \u2013 other times hope of any \u201crecovery\u201d is depressingly futile ( such as for CDD ). Because of the huge variation and conflicting accounts of how devastating autism can be, people sometimes assume that it is a made-up condition; that there are no objective reference points with which someone can be diagnosed as autistic or not autistic. The name of one of the conditions on the spectrum \u2013 \u201cpervasive developmental disorder \u2013 not otherwise specified\u201d ( PDD-NOS ) \u2013 doesn\u2019t help the problem. You might as well call a condition \u201cit\u2019s kind of like x but it isn\u2019t\u201d. PDD-NOS can still be a very seriously debilitating disorder, and belongs on the spectrum. Because professionals don\u2019t always have a good working knowledge of autism, or parents go to the wrong specialists to get a diagnosis (such as simply relying on your family doctor\u2019s opinion when you should make sure you see a developmental pediatrician too), some parents end up sharing their woeful stories of endlessly searching for someone who will give them a diagnosis. This comes across like they will keep paying someone until they hear what they want to hear. This sort of perceived desperation to find a medical reason for anti-social behaviour, feeds a public view that autism is really just another word for  bad parenting . More often than not these children turn out to have PDD-NOS or Aspergers (in my experience). What these families are looking for when they share their stories is support and advice, when what they often get instead is criticism and ridicule. A lot of these confusions could be addressed by only referring to classic autism as \u201cautism\u201d, and calling the other conditions by their specific diagnoses. Of course, classic autism also ranges from severe to mild, so there would still be plenty of opportunity for people to make incorrect and confused generalisations. Also, because of the similar and multiple challenges that all people with ASD face, it often makes sense to speak of them grouped together as ASD. So a much better but harder option, is educating people to be more aware of all conditions which come under the ASD umbrella. The change must also happen within the ASD affected community: Recognition that one autistic person cannot speak on behalf of all autistic people, is a good and important starting point. I always speak about autism with reference to my own son, and where I generalise I always try to do so carefully and with enough research behind my statements to know I\u2019m not performing a disservice. What it comes down to is we\u2019re all individuals. It\u2019s an age-old adage, to the point of being trite. But it became age-old for a reason. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/74288833@N00/3802935238", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_savant", "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/early-autism-recognition-hope", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10688116", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/11/before-you-buy-woo-primer-for-parents.html", "http://autism.lovetoknow.com/Is_Autism_a_Genetic_Disorder", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome#Prognosis", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/does-john-elder-robison-understand.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDD-NOS"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/autism-and-autisms-defining-a-label/", "title": "Autism and Autisms: Defining a\u00a0Label"},
{"date": "December 15, 2010", "body": "\n Image by Jason.Hudson via Flickr \n Once we got our son\u2019s autism diagnosis, our family was entitled to a wide variety of government-funded help and services. One of those entitlements was to funding for us to spend on the services that we chose as a family \u2013 whether it was in-home help to care for my son, or attending activities outside the home. The express purpose of this funding is to give the carer a break and some help. In order to access this special funding, we had to first get a \u201cneeds assessment\u201d from the local organisation responsible for deciding how much money we should have access to each year. I\u2019ll call that organisation, \u201corgX\u201d. It is not a government organisation, but it is government-funded and passes out their money. (If you\u2019re following me so far you\u2019re doing really well; it is a ridiculously convoluted system which just adds extra stress and confusion to an already stressed and confused family.) My son tried to push the needs assessor from orgX, out the door the moment she arrived, tried to push her off the couch when she sat down, and generally screamed and cried a lot at her presence. This was back when my son was receiving no therapies yet, and his behaviour was aggressive and frightening. The assessor was used to seeing this from autistic children though and took it in her stride. Eventually my son went off to his room for some self-enforced time-out and passed out from exhaustion. We managed to get through all her questions. She noted how incredibly hard it was for us to have any visitors to the home, though I did tell her that he wasn\u2019t as extreme with people he\u2019d previously met. She also noted how hard it was for us to take our son anywhere new; that it often lead to lengthy meltdowns. I know now that these are classic problems with autistic children, but it all had to be noted down to make sure we got the level of funding we were entitled to; the worse our situation was, the higher the level of funding. She marked the application as \u201curgent\u201d, and told me orgX would get back to me within a couple of weeks. A couple of weeks later, with no contact, I rang orgX to follow-up, as the needs assessor had told me to do. The person who answered the phone assured me the quickest orgX ever got through an application was at least a month, sometimes two. I said it had been marked urgent and they said that made no difference. But all the waiting was going to be worth it, I told myself as I continued through each nightmarish hour and day with my son; I was finally going to get the help we needed. Finally, orgX processed my application. I was now entitled to\u2026 nothing! No, really. OrgX told me that they could provide funding for me to have people help me at home, or for us to go out to do activities with our son, but because he wouldn\u2019t let people in the home and he hated going out, they couldn\u2019t help me. I kid you not. I was confused, and upset, and frankly incredulous. I argued that he could get used to people over time, that he could get used to new experiences, but they just quoted back to me the information in front of them about his recorded difficulties. If I had been a more experienced mother of an autistic child, I would have pointed out that with the right help, my son wouldn\u2019t panic at new people and situations. That he would learn to adjust to anything given enough time and preparation. And that the condition is not a static one; that just because a child had those issues at one point in time, didn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t have improved or changed later. Because I didn\u2019t know all that, I thought they were telling me something I just had to come to terms with; that it would never be easy to get my son help, and he wouldn\u2019t get better. As was though, all I could do was pretty much beg orgX for their help, ask them to reconsider. And that was what I did. The person on the other end of the phone eventually agreed to keep searching for someone or something which would be useful to easing the care of our son. Weeks went by, and orgX couldn\u2019t find anyone to help us, and we weren\u2019t given any funding. Every so often I would call them or they would call me, for an update. They\u2019d suggest an organisation who would help, I\u2019d call the suggested organisation and be told they don\u2019t work with kids my son\u2019s age. Or orgX would tell me to try to find someone who would be willing to work with our son through a specific charity, that charity wouldn\u2019t have anyone available at the moment, and so on. Finally I was told that orgX decided to leave it to me to find someone or something for my son to do, since they couldn\u2019t. They told me I had a certain level of funding now granted to me \u2013 and let me tell you, how the funding is grouped and handed out is ridiculously hard to figure out, some parents find it so confusing they choose to never use the funding even though they badly need it. Again, I am not kidding. Well guess what, I did find people and groups who were able and willing to help my son. It took me a little while to figure out where to look for them, but it was a lot easier than orgX had made it out to be. It was a matter of placing free adverts online, and calling the local charities, and getting to know other parents who told me how they used their funding. There are ways in which I\u2019ve been told I can use the funding which I really want to do, but the places I want to use the funding with are confused by orgX\u2019s forms they have to fill out and tend to say \u201cno\u201d rather than \u201clet\u2019s see if we can figure this out\u201d. I\u2019m glad I persisted with getting the funding we were entitled to from orgX, though fighting for the correct level of funding rather than the tiny amount orgX originally allocated us was a battle that I\u2019ll write about another day. These sorts of experiences are far too common in the area of special needs assistance, particularly government-funded assistance; charities and private organisations are much better to work with where-ever possible. It should have been as simple as taking the word of my son\u2019s developmental pediatrician; that our son had autism and our family needed help. Instead they make you jump through hoops for a pittance, the money needed to keep those hoops in business would be obviously better spent on the needy families. The whole system needs an over-haul, but it\u2019s notorious for families in my position to not demand change because they\u2019re afraid organisations like orgX who currently hold the power, will punish them for the public criticism, by making them lose what little assistance they\u2019ve already been granted. And from having spoken to individuals working for orgX, the fear is not unfounded. Even when I write these posts I worry about organisations coming down on me for sharing what they\u2019ve put me through, so I avoid naming names.

{"date": "December 19, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I stopped breastfeeding my son at 14 months, after multiple futile efforts to stop him biting. It\u2019s possible that the enormous difficulty I had, was related to his autism, since he couldn\u2019t  read my face : My tears and cries of pain meant nothing to him. He\u2019d just give me a little smile if I received any reaction from him at all. Years later I keep encountering  studies  telling me my breastfeeding reduced the chances of him getting autism, or the severity of his autism. Then I  read  that it actually made it more likely he would get autism, being a key environmental trigger for the genetic predisposition. Perhaps people stop breastfeeding their children  because  their child shows autistic traits that make it hard to otherwise continue (such as discussed in  this  comments section). As usual, I\u2019m damned if I do, damned if I don\u2019t. I take these things with a grain of salt, and get on with my life. But sometimes the message is delivered in a way that makes you sick to your stomach. Such as  this  \u201cwell-meaning expert\u201d who advises, with a smile on her face, that the best thing to do is breastfeed your first baby then (and I quote) \u201cthrow that first baby out\u201d, because you have now cleared your body of autism-causing toxins. She says she knows that throwing out a baby sounds horrible\u2026 hell  yes  it sounds horrible! Who could say such a thing, knowing her audience will include mothers who breast-fed first-borns who turned out to have autism? Oh and that\u2019s not some harmless isolated video on the internet. It\u2019s actually embedded on a local autism charity\u2019s blog, where new families are directed for help. Where  I  was directed for help. Great, thanks. But what if she\u2019s correct? Just a strong way to make an important point, right? How can we decide who is correct in the great battle of population statistical studies which prove one thing today and the opposite tomorrow. You can start by remembering the difference between correlation and causation, as  this piece  beautifully illustrates, in regards to the effects of mobile phone masts. But surely something like mobile phone masts would never be added to the  endless list of evils that cause autism , right, a line gets drawn somewhere! Surely\u2026? Spoke too soon . As a parent of a child with autism, you have to learn to recognise the difference between a scientific study, and a sensationalist piece that makes good headlines. When in doubt, fall back on what has been scientifically proven and stood the test of time, such as the undisputed and huge array of benefits of breastfeeding \u2013 both for baby and mother. Whether you\u2019re willing and able to breastfeed your baby is an individual matter that differs mother to mother, but don\u2019t let fear of causing autism be something you take into account. Until science \u2013 and not just statistics\u00a0 \u2013 prove otherwise. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Veneto_0029.jpg", "http://www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com/content/1/1/16", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper6362.html", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/09/breastfeeding-and-efas.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWA7phVS_Jk", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/dec/17/mobile-phone-masts-birth-rate", "http://www.mastsanity.org/index.php?start=90"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/19/breastfeeding-autism-and-mobile-phone-masts/", "title": "Breastfeeding, Autism, and Mobile Phone\u00a0Masts"},

He has only really started using sentences this year; he has come a very long way from when he was three years-old, largely non-verbal, and his speech therapist told us she couldn\u2019t say whether he\u2019d ever be able to speak a sentence. Here\u2019s to you, kid \ud83d\ude42 \n Randomly said from the back seat of the car, with no lead up or explanation: \u201cI am a storm.\u201d (I have no idea where he picked that piece of echolalia up, I\u2019m guessing kindergarten though.) \n \n  Said in frustration to the TV, as he turns it to face the right direction (after his younger brother had moved it): \u201cDon\u2019t get lost, OK?\u201d \n \n Said in wonderment as he watches a snail chomping on a leaf, \u201cplant is eating the snail!\u201d \n \n Said in regards to a little boo-boo on his foot, \u201ctoe\u2019s not happy.\u201d \n \n Said with joy after the rain stopped, \u201crain has stopped, time for puddles!\u201d \n \n Said in response to my explanation that his younger brother has a pee-pee (penis) just like him and his father, \u201cso silly, lots of pee-pees!\u201d \n \n And my favourite needs a bit of explanation: When something is incorrect or not allowed, my son says it\u2019s \u201cnot available\u201d. We were spelling words and he spelt \u201cdog\u201d backwards. I said \u201cthat\u2019s not dog, that\u2019s god\u201d, to which he replied, \u201cgod not available!\u201d \n I hope you all found reasons to smile this past year too \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/68187942@N00/3818869144"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/29/my-sons-most-amusing-sentences-of-2010/", "title": "My son\u2019s most amusing sentences of\u00a02010"},
{"date": "June 6, 2012", "body": "\u201cORS\u201d is the acronym for a special type of education funding, allocated to children with special needs by the New Zealand Government. It stands for \u201cOngoing Resourcing Scheme.\u201d The funding is allocated to individual students based on their level of need; they are either \u201chigh needs\u201d or \u201cvery high needs.\u201d ORS funding is a highly sought after thing, which carries a sort of mysterious quality within the special needs community; especially within the autism community, as parents try to figure out why one student got it but another child \u2013 seemingly the same or worse off \u2013 doesn\u2019t receive it. Because of its desirability and \u201cmysteriousness,\u201d a fair few myths have built up around what is required to get ORS and what getting ORS actually means. In this post I\u2019m going to share some of the ORS myths I\u2019ve encountered over the years, and try to explain why they are myths. As much as possible I have taken the exact wording of the myth from conversations, forum discussions, etc. Some of the myths I\u2019ve had to summarise more generally, to capture the point more clearly or succinctly. If you want to find out more about the ORS scheme generally, I have done  a previous post introducing the scheme and what we went through to get our son\u2019s application approved , that you may find useful (including links to helpful resources, I\u2019ve noticed some of those links are now broken, I\u2019ll fix those asap!). Myth 1 :  An autistic child must know less than 12 words to qualify for ORS . This is quite simply, incorrect. It is true that communication issues are part of an ORS application for an autistic child (hardly surprising), but there are no such tight guidelines as to word numbers (neither officially nor informally). Submitting the number of words that an autistic child knows \u2013 whilst it may be relevant to the application \u2013 is not definitive of whether the application will be successful. The ORS applications are much more intensive and involved than this myth implies, and do not have simple cut-off points. This theme is repeated in the second myth: Myth 2 :  An autistic child won\u2019t receive ORS if they are toilet-trained at the time of the application . Again, this will be a relevant consideration to include on an ORS application, but it is not the magical cut-off point that some claim. Myths like Myth 1 and Myth 2 sadly feed the third myth, which is perhaps the most concerning one for me: Myth 3 :  ORS funding is so important that an autistic child is better off not being taught skills early-on, so that they remain severe enough to qualify for ORS when they reach the age of 5 . This is plain disturbing, and very messed-up reasoning. With adequate early intervention, it may indeed become the case that the child is so improved that they no longer require ORS. This is not a sad thing, it is an amazing achievement that should be celebrated. Many children cannot improve at that rate, no matter what interventions are attempted, and it is for those most needy of cases that ORS is required. More-over, the \u201cmyth\u201d part of this claim is the notion that a child would be  better off  accessing ORS by remaining limited in skills, than they would be had the parents made every effort with the child from an early age. ORS is great, but it is not more important than a child\u2019s actual and possible development. Neither is ORS the be-all-end-all of special needs education funding, which will bring me to Myth 4 in a second. I just want to add about Myth 3 that I like to think no parent would ever hold back their child\u2019s skills and development in the hope of getting more funding (quite putting aside the fact that funding rules might change before the child even reaches the relevant age anyway). As much as I want to believe a parent would never do such a thing, the serious tone and manner in which I have seen this myth appear time and again, in a variety of forums, does leave me concerned that at least some parents take it seriously as a suggestion and a possibility. Myth 4 :  If your child doesn\u2019t have a successful ORS application, they are unable to access any special needs funding through the school . ORS is a generous funding option, but it is not the only support system in place for special needs children in schools. Schools receive other pools of funding that they can allocate to children with special needs too, and from quick further research I can see other types of individualised funding that appear to be available to students in addition to that more general school funding. Since my son does receive ORS within a special needs school environment, I am not as familiar with these alternative funding options, other than the fact that they  do  exist outside of ORS.  This web-page  is a good starting place for research into those options. (If anyone reading this knows more about those alternatives, I would love to hear about your knowledge and experiences with them.) This brings us to the next myth, also about the significance of ORS funding: Myth 5 :  No child can attend a special needs school without ORS funding . ORS funding does make it possible to attend a special needs school, but it is not true that every child who attends such a school, has had a successful ORS application. This is a myth I used to labour under personally, until speaking to a Board member at one such school. Apparently the Board can \u2013 and does \u2013 make exceptions sometimes so that high needs children who haven\u2019t qualified for ORS, may still attend and benefit from the pooled funding and services available via a special needs school. Myth 6 :  The condition of autism is not enough to receive ORS, an autistic child must have multiple medical conditions . Again, though this would raise the likelihood of a successful ORS application, it is  not necessary : Language and social communication problems present in autism, can suffice. Myth 7 :  A child must have a confirmed diagnosis to receive ORS funding . This is incorrect; indeed under Criterion 8 in the 2012 ORS guidelines (the criterion best suited to autistic children applying for ORS), it expressly states: \u201cMost students who meet this criterion have a diagnosis of autism but some have another, or no, medical diagnosis.\u201d Myth 8 :  Only children with \u201cvery severe\u201d autism qualify for ORS . I suppose the truth of this depends on what is meant by \u201cvery severe.\u201d In most people\u2019s minds that wording is going to conjure up the corner-rocking, self-harming, non-verbal autistic child (or something similar). In which case the myth is incorrect, as a brief meeting with my son and some of his autistic classmates, would quickly make clear. Myth 9 :  An ORS application must be as negative as possible about the child\u2019s abilities, and must only be negative . ORS applications are far more complex than that; they need to address the relevant criteria, but they should also express the ways in which the student can and does benefit from appropriate assistance. A wholly negative application is not only un-necessary, it is also potentially going to fall short of what the application is meant to achieve, and therefore be more likely to fail since it hasn\u2019t provided all the information the assessors require. This may sound counter-intuitive since you\u2019re meant to be presenting a case as to why your child so badly needs assistance, but it was advice I was given by the main person in charge of my son\u2019s application, and our successful application was most definitely not wholly negative. There are a few other confusions about ORS that fall short of what I\u2019d call \u201cmyths.\u201d Such as the idea that ORS can be taken away from a child who has already been receiving it for years (this was true until last year), and the idea that ORS funding comes in multiple tiers, the highest of which is known as \u201chigh\u201d funding (in fact ORS comes in two tiers; high and very high, so the \u201chigh\u201d funding category is actually the lowest of the two levels). These are easy mistakes to make, and haven\u2019t gained the same sort of chinese-whispers momentum as the nine myths above. I must make it clear that I am no expert on ORS and autism ORS applications. I have read the publicly available official documents and guides to ORS, I have spoken to various professionals in the area, and know a group of autistic children (including my own son) who have successfully applied for and received ORS. I am open as always to corrections if I have made any errors. I would also be interested to hear if you know of other myths that I haven\u2019t covered; this could not possibly be an exhaustive list. Yes, ORS is important. Yes, ORS is hard to get for many families of autistic children, and yes I do believe it should be more widely available. But it does not help if parents are faced with myths that further complicate (or often, pretend to simplify) the ORS process. I hope this post helps reduce the impact of those myths, for at least some New Zealand parents. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/ServicesAndSupport.aspx"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/nine-autism-ors-myths/", "title": "Nine Autism ORS\u00a0Myths"},
{"date": "November 9, 2011", "body": "As the 2011 New Zealand General Election moves ever closer (under three weeks to go), I\u2019m still struggling to access all the Parties\u2019 policies on \u2013 or relevant to \u2013 disability (with my particular focus on how those policies impact on autism families like my own). Some Parties haven\u2019t released those policies yet, and some simply don\u2019t have disability policies; either because it is not an area of focal interest for their Party, or because they have intentionally distributed the issue of disability amongst the rest of their policies. The ACT Party is one of the Parties which doesn\u2019t have an express disability policy, but there are still facts about their aims and attitudes towards disabled people and their families, which you can gleam from related information and other sources. This post is my attempt to bring that information together. Image via Wikipedia The ACT Party has held the portfolio that oversees special education this past parliamentary term, which has provided plenty of opportunities to get a feel for how the Party has viewed special needs students and special schools. From my research into the Party\u2019s most current policies, I can see no contradictions, and can see plenty of support, for their views expressed about special education over the past few years. So I\u2019m going to begin with the highlights from their outspoken views on special education. A review of special education last year, found that about 50% of schools are fully inclusive of students with special needs. The  government aims for this figure to reach 80% by 2014 . This 80% aim is part of ACT\u2019s policy, as brought up and reaffirmed in  a recent public meeting discussing the disability policies  of six major Parties running in this election. At that same meeting, ACT confirmed other aims expressed in the 2010 governmental special education review; including the desire to increase financial support for special education (which has been shown so far for example, by an increase in  ORS funding ). They also want to maintain a variety of education options rather than restrict the types and availability of schools, that includes the continued support of the existence of special needs schools. ACT has also been supportive of other support services for special needs children,  such as outreach services  to aid teachers and these students in the mainstream setting. (Here\u2019s  a link to ACT\u2019s education policy  in general.) ACT\u2019s general approach to issues of increasing the quality of life and choices available to those who live with a disability, is that a better economy, more choice and more freedom, benefits everyone, including those with disabilities. Though the details and understanding as to how the needs of those with disabilities might require particular attention in order for that freedom and choice to be effective,  appears sketchy at best . ACT\u2019s  welfare policy  places emphasis on ensuring \u201cstrong, adequate support for the genuinely needy.\u201d This needy group of people expressly includes those with \u201cmental health issues and serious disabilities.\u201d So whilst they clearly intend to crack down on benefit fraud and benefit dependence, that crack-down does not appear to be aimed at those with disabilities. Overall, there\u2019s not a lot of detail to be gleamed about ACT\u2019s attitudes towards disability, or autism more specifically, though there is a clear interest in maintaining a range of education options open for special needs children, and in continuing and improving the supports available through welfare to individuals / families who live with disability. I shall end with my standard disclaimer for these posts: Please note, I\u2019m not endorsing voting for ACT, and I am not a member of ACT, or indeed any other political party. No one has asked me, or paid me, to write these posts.

{"date": "November 1, 2011", "body": "Trying to figure out how much my son understands and what he is capable of, is a challenge in itself. I see people \u2013 both strangers and those who know him well \u2013 regularly and significantly over and under-estimate his abilities. So I\u2019ve had plenty of opportunities to observe and attempt to understand his reactions to situations where people get it wrong. Seeing the effect it has on him \u2013 and in turn on others\u2019 attitudes towards and understanding of my son \u2013 has made me very careful and deliberate in my interactions with him; assessing what he knows and how he knows things, prior to attempting to build on that knowledge. \n Image by Urban Gazelle via Flickr \n When people overestimate my son, he tends to withdraw. He\u2019ll avoid eye contact or seemingly lose interest. He\u2019ll try to move onto another activity without spoken explanation or warning. He might use brief words or phrases that make it appear he has taken the information on board (\u201cyeah\u201d with his eyes averted is a classic response), but he won\u2019t follow-up with his usual thoughtful facial expressions or by adding to or re-phrasing what he\u2019s just learnt. This creates the impression in others, that he is not interested or not very smart. Those adults who don\u2019t realise the \u201cyeah\u201d doesn\u2019t hold real meaning, or think they are getting through to him, may continue to push ahead, which risks causing an anxiety response in him, born of frustration and confusion. Which in turn can lead to the impression that he is naughty, not paying attention, or has inexplicably gone off the deep-end. Underestimating my son creates an annoying monster. When people talk down to my son or put blindingly obvious or boring questions to him, he thinks they\u2019re being silly on purpose. He puts on a silly voice (which is irritating) and purposefully provides incorrect answers. He\u2019ll repeat those silly answers he makes up (sometimes not even being real words) ad nauseam; not because he\u2019s having an anxiety response or because he\u2019s dropped into echolalia, but because he really does think this is some silly game. People treat him like a fool, he acts a fool. This creates the impression in others that he is mentally \u201climited\u201d (can\u2019t think of a better term), as he talks in this silly voice repeating himself. There is also an extremely good chance that they get annoyed at his put-on voice and repetition (god knows I do). Trying to break him out of this mode and back into serious mode, can be quite trying. So he ends up looking disobedient too (and he actually is at that stage, but only because he thinks everyone is being silly around him). By the time you get through to him that he\u2019s to stop, he often looks confused and can get quite upset; not quite understanding what he\u2019s done wrong. That can also lead to crying and anxiety. So when I want to ask my son a question to get novel information, or when I want to teach him something new, I first ascertain what he knows without labouring the point, and I do so with a very straight face, so he doesn\u2019t get caught up in silly mode. Once I have a general idea of where to start with him, I break the teaching task or question into chunks, which allows me to evaluate as I go along, what he\u2019s understanding and what is going beyond him. I evaluate the progress and whether he\u2019s taking meaning from the interaction, by testing him gently and in an enjoyable way; asking him questions that allow him to feedback his understanding, or giving him tasks that allow him to evidence what he\u2019s picking up. I keep these interactions serious but up-beat; I don\u2019t use silly voices or over-the-top reactions, but I do give genuine praise and show real interest in him and the topic. If I see him starting to lose interest \u2013 maybe the eye-contact has gone or he\u2019s shifting uncomfortably \u2013 I take it as a cue to either go back a step or to give it a break. Pushing through can upset him or put him off the task for the future. I always try to leave on an up-beat note; with success as the end-point rather than frustration and failure. My son is a remarkably eager learner, and a quite intelligent boy. If I hit his level just right, this amazing, highly interactive and interested child shines through. It\u2019s the boy that his wonderful teachers get to see quite regularly. It\u2019s the boy I wish I could get others to see more too. I don\u2019t expect joe-public, or even the extended family, to get the over-estimate / underestimate thing, just right. They don\u2019t know him as well as I do, nor do they understand the consequences of getting it wrong. I try to facilitate clarity; to explain his reactions and help speed up or slow down the interaction they\u2019re attempting, to the level that he can fully and meaningfully engage with them. One of the sad side effects of other people constantly over and under estimating him, is this diverse and inaccurate perspectives and understanding many people get (and hold onto) about my son. That he\u2019s always disobedient, or always playing the fool, or a withdrawn anxious child, reluctant to learn or socialize. My son does react to what people expect of him. Indeed, in some ways he is hyper-aware of social expectations, since he is constantly observing and trying to take on \u201crules\u201d about how adults and children are meant to behave. (Part of the challenge we face with him is having to explain that not everything he sees is a well-practiced rule, and that when there are social rules as such, that there are almost always exceptions.) I don\u2019t have any quick and easy solutions to helping people better find the correct \u201cestimation\u201d of my son, besides me trying to facilitate the interactions. I tend to think that as his communication improves, this problem will somewhat lessen; as he finds ways to let people know and to show people just by his communication, where he is at. Perhaps the best advice I could generally give is that they let him lead the way if they are unsure of what he knows and understands; don\u2019t dominate the interaction. And be aware; if he\u2019s lost interest or is being overly silly, don\u2019t just dismiss it as \u201cthe autism,\u201d consider instead that maybe it\u2019s the reaction of a child to someone talking to them at the wrong level. Autism makes these things harder, particularly because of the impact on communication and behaviour, but autism does not predetermine everything about my son. He is an amazing little boy, who wants to be part of this world; just give him the chance to shine through. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/7829256@N05/3692725642"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/consequences-of-underestimating-and-overestimating-my-autistic-son/", "title": "Consequences of underestimating and overestimating my autistic\u00a0son"},
{"date": "December 26, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n It should hardly be surprising that I don\u2019t like it when other people laugh at my son\u2019s attempts to communicate and interact with the world; they are effectively making fun of his disability when they use his  echolalia  to amuse themselves, mimic his  happy-dance , or encourage him to  copy  highly inappropriate behaviour. Fighting the consequences \u2013 as we try to un-teach and explain to him why his new or reinforced behaviours are wrong \u2013 can take weeks or even months. It\u2019s hard to laugh at autism when you\u2019re living the effects of it everyday. But it\u2019s not impossible, you just tend to do it in a dark way and in private. My husband and I regularly make (rather un-repeatable) joking comments to each other, about what we have to put up with each day due to our son\u2019s autism; the sort of comments that we would be horrified to hear from other people talking about our son. We can make similar comments in front of other parents going through the same struggles though, because we\u2019re all in this together. The material is plentiful \u2013 stimming, echolalia, wheels and train obsessions, routines. The chances to laugh while you\u2019re going through the problems are as good as non-existent, but you snatch them when you can. Mostly the chances arise when the kids are finally in bed or off playing for a brief while. And the laughter often seems to carry a sort of desperate exhaustion. Cause, let\u2019s face it, the parents of these kids are almost always desperate and exhausted. I am amazed at the opportunities for laughter with a  neurotypical  child. They are beautifully hilarious. Everyday my one year-old has me laughing at his antics and facial expressions. We never had those laughs with our autistic first-born; it\u2019s simply not funny when your child is largely non-responsive and frequently tantrums, and you can\u2019t figure out why. (It\u2019s not funny when you figure out why either.) Humour itself is a problem for people on the  spectrum . They are very literal and visual, and humour is classically far more subtle than that. Understanding humour often requires reference to innuendo, social norms, and frankly norms in general. Autistic people aren\u2019t that huge on the norms. If you do an internet search for humour and autism it becomes clear that the dialogue is mostly about these types of problems, and not about how gosh-darn hilarious autism is. My own taste in humour has changed since having to deal with a special-needs child. Jokes about friends acting as if they\u2019re intellectually disabled or have had brain damage, used to seem like harmless fun, now they cut too close to the bone and make me cringe. The person telling the joke or making the comment does seem to matter; I suppose it\u2019s like a Jew making a Jewish joke, you know they don\u2019t mean any harm and are just laughing at themselves. But it can feel quite insidious coming from someone without personal experience and understanding of what they\u2019re laughing at. The longer you are in the autism world, the more specific the humour gets, and the more confusing it becomes to \u201coutsiders\u201d. Even when you are \u201cin the know\u201d, what one faction within autism finds hilarious, another group might find deeply offensive, such as those on two sides of the vaccine debate. Those who believe vaccines cause autism and are strong believer\u2019s in  Jenny McCarthy\u2019s cause , won\u2019t find  this  (with linked explanations  here ) or  this,  particularly amusing. All parents might be able to smile at the quotes in  this piece  though. Then again, when has any single type of humour appealed to everyone? (Having actually done a university course on  Philosophy of Humour , I\u2019m going to tell you \u201cnever\u201d.) I encourage anyone reading this to add in the comments any links they might have to online articles or videos, or books, that allowed them to laugh at little (or a lot) at autism. At the end of the day, and the end of every day, we all need to find a  reason to laugh to help keep us sane \u2013 and give ourselves permission to  have those laughs, even if only in the privacy of our own families and homes. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Behind_the_Laughter.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echolalia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_spectrum", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_mccarthy#Activism_and_autism_controversy", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRZHOhXvtHU&feature=player_embedded", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/utter_defeat_and_devastation_at_the_hand.php", "http://www.themompetition.com/2010/11/interview-with-starkravingmadmommy.html", "http://www.thescavenger.net/health/gallows-humour-and-autism-38657.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/humorless-and-humorous-autism/", "title": "Humorless and Humorous\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "June 11, 2012", "body": "Today, I found myself reading yet another attack on the scientists in charge of the changes to the criteria for autism, that are due to come in with the DSM-5. And again, the attacks were made on the scientists because of the consequences of the changes to the services received by autistics. Specifically, the possibility that fewer people with a current diagnosis of autism, would be entitled to much-needed services that are funded by the government and insurance companies. There are various reasons one might attack the new criteria (such as not liking the removal of Aspergers, or thinking the severity criteria is flawed), but it is this particular and highly popular line of attack \u2013 targeting DSM scientists because of consequent changes to services \u2013 that I want to critique in this post. It\u2019s easy to target the scientists, because they are the ones creating the change; the service funding providers are just going about business-as-usual. So when you see an upsetting change coming, you don\u2019t naturally aim at those maintaining the status quo, you target those who are rocking the boat. But you must always ask why the boat is being rocked: What is the purported and actual aims of the scientists? At its core, they are trying to improve and clarify this thing called \u201cautism.\u201d Theirs is a search for accuracy and truth. Which is why attacks on whether they are improving the accuracy of the diagnosis, are always going to be relevant. Yes, the decisions of such scientists can and will impact on service provision, and people might legitimately expect that to be part of their reasoning and decision-making (and my understanding is that they are aware of their role in this). But they are not the actual service funding providers, and the impact of the changes to the DSM-5 go much wider than the country of origin and their specific funding issues. The changes to the DSM-5 will impact on and are relevant to a world-wide audience, they are meant to reflect the  universal truths  of autism, not some sort of American-only version; autism should look the same in New Zealand as it does in America. Even if I was an American, I wouldn\u2019t be fighting the scientists to change their criteria based on an argument about service funding provision; I would be targeting the service providers themselves. For a couple of stark reasons as least: First off, services and funding for those services should be supplied on objective need, regardless of confirmed diagnosis. This is particularly true for a condition like autism where a blood test or brain scan (or whatever) is not yet available to rule-out or rule-in a diagnosis. The diagnosis \u2013 and the need for services \u2013 depends on the symptoms and their severity. A diagnosis of autism  from one clinic may not have been granted from another , and a diagnosis of \u201cautism\u201d doesn\u2019t itself (currently) explain the level of need of the individual: There is clearly a need to respond to the individual, taking the confirmed diagnosis into account where there is one (since a diagnosis in this case is like a short-cut to figuring out how to best help the child, it is not a box ticked to then be able to get a cure). Of course this is more difficult for an insurance company or government to respond to than a simple tick-the-box diagnosis approach. More difficult, but not impossible. More difficult, but best (in my opinion). The fact is autism is such a diverse and complicated condition, that to truly respond to an individual with autism, requires a somewhat diverse and complicated system. If there is a problem with the service provision, then the people who should be in the public\u2019s firing line are those who provide and fund the services, for using inaccurate or unhelpful approaches to who should receive help. The service providers are not driven by some higher ideal of a search for universal truths, they choose how to  respond  to truths. These companies and governments are run by  people  who make decisions or laws; people who can be (at least in theory!) reasoned with and influenced. It may seem easier to publicly attack a group of scientists than a seemingly faceless company or government organisation, but it is still people you are dealing with, and only one of those groups is motivated by a search for objective and accurate truths. Why attack those with the pure(r) motives? There are other problems with attacking the DSM scientists instead of targeting the service providers too. One of the common outcries is that the autism criteria changes will move those at the higher functioning end of the spectrum (such as Aspergers, or PDD-NOS), out of the autism spectrum altogether, and therefore they won\u2019t be able to access the services provided for those with an autism diagnosis. However, my understanding is that this \u201chigh functioning\u201d group of people already classically struggle to receive any or appropriate services. So they\u2019d just  continue  to not receive adequate services, rather than necessarily be in a worse off position. That\u2019s if it\u2019s true that they won\u2019t fit the new autism criteria in the first place. Most parents haven\u2019t actually looked at the new criteria (a fair chunk don\u2019t even know the changes are on the way, obviously that doesn\u2019t include us bloggers). In so many news items and posts I see people using the very worst alarmist figures about who will drop off the spectrum, completely ignoring and not citing the far more conservative estimates that are also out there. Even accepting that some will inevitably \u201cfall off\u201d the spectrum, one has to surely take into account the creation of new diagnostic criteria which are likely to capture those who were once at the higher end of the spectrum, such as Social Communication Disorder. The fact that we don\u2019t know how the service providers will respond to this new category \u2013 or if they will respond at all \u2013 is not the fault of the DSM scientists. Again, that is the service and funding providers who should be targeted. I am yet to read a single piece asking for the service providers to publicly respond to what services and funding they are contemplating bringing in, in response to that new diagnostic category. Perhaps the service providers are sitting on their hands, waiting to see what the DSM-5 will actually be. But that is not a reason for the public to also sit on its hands: For the same reason that parents are attacking the DSM scientists, they should be attacking the service providers (only more so); the parents are concerned about uncertainty and what services will remain available for their child. Doesn\u2019t it make sense to shout these concerns at those who must react (and must do so quickly) to the changes once they take place? It strikes me that the problems the public seems most concerned about, are problems already existing in the service provision sector: Problems with the amount of funding and services available, and the lack of flexibility and responsiveness of the existing system. It makes little sense to argue for a change in \u201creality\u201d (the effort to figure out what autism is and what autism isn\u2019t), instead of arguing for a change in the  responses  to that reality. I\u2019m obviously not as familiar with the system in America (I only know what I have read over the years in news pieces and posts), as I am with that in New Zealand. But it seems to me that the changes need not scare the pants off New Zealanders, since our system doesn\u2019t require a confirmed diagnosis at every point, to be able to access much-needed services (though of course it can and does help). If there are things that need changing here in New Zealand, it is in the overall funding and provision of services as they already exist. A change in the criteria for autism under the DSM-5 won\u2019t make that better or worse; the underlying problem will remain. I would like to think all the public outcry over how this will impact on services, will not influence those who make decisions about the criteria for autism, though I know full well that they are aware of and also concerned about the impact on services too. The search to accurately define and identify autism should not just be a local and time-specific issue (say, \u201cmost States in America, in the service provision of the year 2013\u201d). It is bigger than that. It is more important than that. It is about research and understanding, about autism  in itself . Of course services and everyday reality of our families, matters, and it is because those service and everyday realities matter, that we should make sure we\u2019re correctly targeting those who are failing us. Don\u2019t accept the status quo, if it screws you over today or will screw you over in 2013: Fight so that no matter how the scientists label your children\u2019s challenges, there will always be adequate and responsive provision to help the individuals that need it most. *** Some of my other posts on the DSM-5 changes to autism criteria: \n A Few Good Reasons to like the DSM-5 Autism Criteria Changes \n The 4 main DSM-5 Autism Controversies \n Autism by any other name\u2026 \n Distinguishing Aspergers from Giftedness; will the DSM-5 help? \n Drastic Drop in ASD Diagnostic Variations, from DSM-IV (2027+) to DSM-5 (just 11!) \n Intent vs Effect in the Exclusion of General Developmental Delay under ASD in the DSM-5 \n Genetic origins of autism; when is autism not autism?

{"date": "June 7, 2012", "body": "The idealized \u201cmother\u201d is a self-contradictory creature: I am, at all times, the perfect and deeply flawed mother, depending on what ideology and latest-guru you consult. It is quite simply impossible to be the perfect mother from all perspectives, and trying to be such a thing will only lead to exhaustion, guilt, and a sense that this motherhood thing has passed you by, since you were so busy trying to live up to something impossible instead of living and loving. This feeling of constantly being judged and found-wanting, is heightened of course with a special-needs child, because the scrutiny and the ideologies are that much more intense, and the notion that you will never have done enough for your child (or done too much even) weighs that much more heavily. Over the years my body had started to show the strain; bent over more at the shoulders, avoiding others\u2019 eyes, a sort of defensive exhaustedness that comes from getting used to a world that judges your child \u2013 and you \u2013 because they have a diagnosis (the mere act of seeking or achieving a diagnosis being a reason in itself for others\u2019 superiority). I noticed this a while back and made a conscious effort to change my body to better reflect the strength and pride I have for my son and myself; a strength and pride that came with a better understanding of my son, and that I\u2019m not to blame for his autism \u2013 to not even see autism as a \u201cblameworthy\u201d thing. But going through motherhood under this much pressure \u2013 trying to live up to the ideals of other mothers and other mothers of special needs children \u2013 does more than leave you burnt out and bent over. It depersonalizes you, as a human being, in a number of ways. It depersonalizes you because you spend a lot of time externally observing and judging yourself, \u201chave I done enough, did I do it right, will she think I did it right\u2026\u201d It also depersonalizes you because your own identity can melt away; your own interests and desires and passions are forgotten and moth-balled. The only thing you can not feel guilty about, is the passion for your child. The only social activities you can engage in, are those directed at your child\u2019s well-being and development. Your existence becomes referential; to the child. You are not \u201cEmma\u201d anymore, you are \u201cmother of Sam.\u201d This secondary, referential existence is one of the few ideals that carry through most mothering ideologies: The good mother is the one that holds every personal action up to question, \u201cis this the best thing for my child?\u201d The good mother always follows the child\u2019s lead and never specifically encourages the child towards the mother\u2019s own interests; that would be called \u201cliving through the child\u201d otherwise (as opposed to, say, calling it engaging the child in what you are best able to teach them). The good mother puts her life on hold for at least the first three years of a child\u2019s life, since the child is so dependent and easily influenced by the powerful figure of \u201cmother\u201d during those years. But what happens when it\u2019s not the first three years? Or five years? Or 18? What happens when the child is highly dependent all their life, and there is no point at which a mother is free to \u201crediscover\u201d her friends and her own interests? She\u2019s not allowed to be resentful about this of course \u2013 who is there to be resentful towards anyway, the child who had no choice in the matter either? No, you just keep mothering, under high scrutiny, and conflicting ideals. Listening to strangers and family alike tell you that you\u2019re still doing too much for the child, or not enough, and knowing that you best never ask \u201cwhat about me?\u201d The longer you survive in this high-stress and self-denying state, the more it becomes  who  you truly are. You don\u2019t need others to judge you because you\u2019ve internalized the conflicting judgments. You don\u2019t need the disapproving looks and scowls because your biggest critic is yourself, and you\u2019ll beat yourself up worse than anyone else would dare to. You become so wrapped up in your child that you realise one day that your non-existent free time would be wasted on you anyway, because your friends aren\u2019t around anymore and the things you used to take pleasure in seem pointless and selfish now. There are ways to avoid this of course; there\u2019s nothing inevitable about such a depersonalized motherhood. You can find and stick to a particular parenting ideology and be prepared to defend it against the attackers (or to ignore the attacks, potentially by immersing yourself in the relevant community of agree-ers). You can take time through-out motherhood, and from early on in motherhood, to indulge yourself and maintain your friendships. You can remind yourself that \u201cthe perfect is the enemy of the good,\u201d and just do your best while enjoying your child for who they are, while letting them see who you are too; an enriched two-way relationship between mother and child, rather than the sacrificial martyr one-way model. And if you can\u2019t step back from the attack that to care for yourself would be selfish, then remind yourself that the consequence of losing yourself completely to the role of \u201cmother\u201d \u2013 particularly in the special needs world where that role will take everything you have and then some \u2013 is a burnt-out person who may be no good to anyone anymore. Mental and physical break-downs will just make you a burden on the people you love anyway. There\u2019s a lesson in the burn-out that I never truly knew until I first had one as a university student who pushed myself too hard, too long, too often: Once you burn-out, it is incredibly hard to re-find that specific past passion. It\u2019s like a piece of you is broken, and that even when it seems healed, that it\u2019s a weak point that can\u2019t take too much pressure or it\u2019ll break again very easily. I think we need to remind ourselves \u2013 in society and as mothers \u2013 that \u201cparents are people too.\u201d Though we love our children and value them higher than our own lives \u2013 that there is nothing we wouldn\u2019t sacrifice for them \u2013 their well-being requires us to be well too, mentally and physically. The more dependent they are on us, the even more important it is that we look after ourselves so we can be there for them. I know, it\u2019s easier said than done. We get told to take more time for ourselves, but who then follows through with the support to make it happen? Or we\u2019re given that chance to step-back, and we don\u2019t take it because for so long we\u2019ve been the voice and aid of our child that it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine someone else doing what needs to be done, or as well as it needs to be done. I have no easy answers. I\u2019m stuck in this conundrum myself. But maybe it helps to say it out-loud sometimes, and know we\u2019re not the only ones. Maybe that in itself is important, particularly in a world where speaking out about such things is so often itself attacked, as evidence that we are falling short as mothers. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/stathis1980/4979286934/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/a-depersonalized-motherhood-aka-parents-are-people-too/", "title": "A Depersonalized Motherhood (aka, Parents are People\u00a0Too)."},
{"date": "December 30, 2010", "body": "\n Cover of A Friend Like Henry \n I\u2019ve often wondered about whether it\u2019s healthy for me to be so immersed in my son\u2019s autism, and in autism in general. I write and follow blog posts about it, read books and talk about it, and live it whenever I interact with or think about my son. I know there is a point at which it is pathological; particularly when it means you\u2019re not doing everyday things that need to be done, such as spending time with your spouse, getting outdoors or doing something nice just for yourself. Soon after the diagnosis I did do this pathological version of immersion, and I didn\u2019t learn a lot about my son or autism during it either. I didn\u2019t know what books to buy, and I didn\u2019t want to throw precious money at the wrong things, so I used the internet instead. Not a good idea. Not to say there\u2019s anything magically good about using books either; there are poorly researched and potentially dangerous books out there about autism too. I thought I had good researching skills due to my academic background (and I do), but I was so desperate for answers that I wasn\u2019t being as objective as I should and could have been. A turning point in my (pathological) immersion was reading a book that had been recommended by my son\u2019s developmental pediatrician, called \u201c A Friend Like Henry \u201c. She chose to recommend it based on my son\u2019s type of autism; it\u2019s not overly helpful reading all about Aspergers (at least to begin with) if your child has severe autism, even though they are both on the spectrum. I think that is key to where any parent with a newly-diagnosed child should start; ask the professionals in your child\u2019s life what you should read. Then actually read it. She also warned us not to get caught up in the idea that having a dog (like the boy in the book) was necessary for improving our son\u2019s condition. That might sound like a silly warning, but like I said, as desperate parents you can get quickly caught up in the search for answers and solutions; grabbing onto anything that floats when you\u2019re swept up in flood waters. The book gave me understanding and hope, two things in too-short supply when it comes to autism. But not false hope, which is an important distinction. Autism cannot be cured, the child will always \u201cbe\u201d autistic, but you can make their life and your own life easier. It also warned me of what continues to be a very widespread truth; that you have to become a very active and determined advocate in order for your child to get the services and resources they need to do the best they can in life. I also found that reading about an individual\u2019s experiences with autism, rather than a generic \u201cthis is autism\u201d book, was important. I\u2019ve read plenty of material about what autism is and how you can make it better, but part of the struggle as a parent of these children is the isolation and feeling like no one understands that nightmare you\u2019re living. Reading about someone else\u2019s personal account can help you feel not so alone. That too, is why all the autism immersive behaviour I do these days, is not unhealthy, but vital and important for my mental health: Blogging my experiences allows me to share my troubles. Every time someone shares their similar experiences in comments, or a friend or family member says they had no idea how hard it had been for me, I feel more understood and less alone. The research I do for my posts, and reading others posts and material, enhances my understanding of autism, and indeed of my son. I am experienced enough now to know how to wade through the information so it doesn\u2019t add to that sinking feeling. I have learnt to actually go all the way back and read original scientific studies where there are conflicting accounts of what they establish. Rather than making me feel like I am breathing autism day-in, day-out, it is instead helping me to find new ways to cope with what I have to deal with anyway. I know my son is more than autism, I know my life is more than my son\u2019s autism, but it is nevertheless a huge and important part of my life. I keep an eye out to make sure I don\u2019t cross the line between research and growth, and pathology, and I think that is key here too: Awareness of the potential to sink into it too far. The advocate we have to be for our children, is helped by knowing our way through the mis/information. The sane individual in us, is helped by knowing where to draw the line. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/A-Friend-Like-Henry/dp/0340934026%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0340934026", "http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Fiction_Literature/General/9780340934029/?cf=3&rid=1890983792&i=1&keywords=a+friend+like+henry"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/autism-immersion-reading-the-write-stuff/", "title": "Autism Immersion; Reading the WRite\u00a0Stuff"},

{"date": "December 6, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve spent far too much time lately fighting with those who have no understanding of what is required for an autism diagnosis. The arguments and myths I\u2019ve encountered are at times upsetting, and other times absurdly ridiculous. So I\u2019ve decided to pull together the most common \u201cdiagnostic criteria\u201d that I\u2019ve encountered, into a brand-new public-opinion-approved autism diagnosis: **** Autism and Aspergers Diagnosis  (note:  Rett\u2019s ,  PDD-NOS  and  CDD  are not part of the Autism Spectrum. Anyone who mentions these terms must be met with a stony confused silence. Aspergers may be mis-spelt as \u201c Assburgers \u201d in order to provide a sense of personal superiority, and the illusion of cleverness, as required.) The person being diagnosed must be no younger than three years old. Any diagnosis prior to age three is necessarily an incorrect diagnosis and is evidence of a paranoid parent seeking attention. A diagnosis after the age of three is too late for any meaningful intervention and is evidence of inattentive parenting. Diagnosis on the third birthday is the ideal. An autistic person must not be able to lie or empathise with others. If you can catch your child out in a lie, teach them to lie, or to care what you feel, then your child was never autistic. All autistic children are extraordinarily beautiful in physical appearance; if your child is beautiful, and they don\u2019t lie to you, they might have the autism. It is important to call your local naturopath as soon as possible. All autistic people have ears that are ultra-sensitive to touch. To rule out a diagnosis, touch the ear. If the person doesn\u2019t cry or rage, it isn\u2019t autism. Autistic people walk on their tip-toes. If your child walks on their tip-toes at all as a preschooler, they are probably autistic. Avoid ballet class. Lots of extraordinarily beautiful people can be found in a ballet class too; the coincidence of tip-toe walking and physical beauty in ballet classes, is a growing area of research. Autistic people are all exceptionally talented in at least one of the following ways. They can: \n Solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube. If you meet an autistic person, give them a Rubik\u2019s Cube. (Or just throw a bunch of toothpicks at their feet; they like counting those too.) \n Perform astounding mathematical feats. No autistic person requires a calculator. \n Hack a major computer system, or \n Write a major computer system (then hack it). \n If a child is intellectually gifted, they have Aspergers. If they are shy, they have Aspergers. If they are intellectually gifted and shy, they have severe Aspergers. In regards to cause, autism either has  (a)  no known cause; no one has ever figured out a single cause, genetic or otherwise, or  (b)  is known to be caused by immunizations, bad parenting and excessive computer use. The causes listed under  (b)  can also be generally categorized as \u201c shitty parenting decisions \u201d as an overall category. The \u201c shitty parenting decisions \u201d can take the general form of either  (a)  active abuse, or  (b)  neglect, and often both. The parent is to blame. Even when you know the genetic cause, the parent is to blame. If the parent isn\u2019t to blame, it\u2019s not autism. Autism can be completely cured by a change in diet or by chelation. If the treatment is ineffective, then you are not doing enough of it and must do it more. Autism never improves with age, so if you were using a treatment and the child improved at all, the only possibility is the treatment has worked. The plural of anecdotal evidence, is \u201cdata.\u201d The more emotional the anecdote, the better the data. In summary, if your child looks extraordinarily beautiful, is exactly three years old, tip-toes, counts toothpicks, cries when you touch their ears, and has horrible parents, you should treat them for heavy metal poisoning. **** Or, you could just look up the  actual diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum conditions . \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.firstsigns.org/screening/DSM4.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/if-public-opinion-penned-an-autism-diagnosis/", "title": "If Public Opinion Penned an Autism Diagnosis\u2026"},
{"date": "January 8, 2012", "body": "There was a time that I thought I\u2019d never have to deal with the question, of when and how to tell my son he is autistic, since his autism was so severe that it got in the way of meaningful communication. But his language and comprehension have advanced to the point that the question is inevitable, and I find myself thinking it over on almost a daily basis. Every adult in his life \u2013 and a few children too I suspect \u2013 know that he is autistic. So I cannot control whether and when he hears the word, not for lack of trying though. I\u2019m so mindful of him potentially asking about it that I\u2019ve personally stopped using the words \u201cautism\u201d and \u201cautistic\u201d around him; he listens closely to those who talk around him and frequently interrupts with questions. I haven\u2019t stopped using it because I think it is a bad word, or because I don\u2019t want him to know he is autistic. Rather, I want to make sure that when he asks and when I answer, that both him and I are capable of making that conversation go well. I\u2019ve been slowly preparing him for the conversation by simple consequence of answering his questions about people in wheelchairs and blind people, diabetics, asthmatics, etc. Even when we talk about the fact that I wear glasses. Those conversations always take the track of me saying that some people are born with these challenges (or \u201cproblems\u201d being the term he uses and understands), and some have accidents, and some get them as they age. That most people have \u201cproblems\u201d of some sort, but that\u2019s OK, because we\u2019re all different anyway. That even twins are actually different, even though they look almost the same. So it won\u2019t be long before he asks if he \u201chas a problem\u201d too, and what it is. But I\u2019m not sure yet how I\u2019m going to explain it to him, though I have a general idea. I\u2019d remind him that everyone has special challenges they face \u2013 like mummy\u2019s eyesight and great grandma\u2019s knees \u2013 and that his challenge is called autism. That autism makes it harder for him to do things like talk and makes him do different things like hum and flap when he\u2019s happy, but that it also has given him a great memory and has made him very good with details. Already though I have a problem with that explanation, because I am worried he will think having autism means he has an excuse for not trying hard to improve his speech, or to modify his behaviour (for example, we\u2019ve been working hard to get him to stop humming so loudly when others are trying to watch TV, and we\u2019ve been trying to stop him doing a weird and annoying thing he purposefully does with his speech sometimes that he thinks is hilarious but is really irritating for others). He\u2019s smart enough to see and use autism in this way. I need to find a way to convey that autism is an explanation not an excuse in this manner, and I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to convey that subtle but important difference to a young boy. It would be easier to do it when he\u2019s older. So if it was more under my control \u2013 if I could have him not ask until he is older \u2013 what is the right age? I\u2019ve read that you should have the conversation before puberty, since the child goes through a lot of personal changes mentally and physically at that point, and they need answers to why they are so different than their peers. But I think the driving force needs to be the individual child\u2019s developmental stage; are they individually ready to understand what autism means (and doesn\u2019t mean) in their life. Surely this won\u2019t simply be \u201cthe age of puberty\u201d for every autistic child.. or will it? I don\u2019t see not telling him as an option, because someone will tell him sooner or later, or he\u2019ll figure it out, and I want to make sure the \u201crevelation\u201d is delivered in a kind and accurate way. I also don\u2019t want him thinking that I held something back from him that he should have been told years before. The fact that he attends a special needs school is helpful in some ways. He is surrounded by difference \u2013 by children with various challenges \u2013 making it easier to explain strengths and weaknesses and the normality (as such) of those differences in the world around him. In some ways being in a special class will, I think, hold the question of autism off for a while, since his difference from \u201ceveryone else\u201d (a normal classroom full of NT children) is obviously less pronounced. However my son has figured out that he appears to attend two schools (the consequence of attending a satellite class) and that there\u2019s something a bit different about his classroom compared to the other classrooms, which might also speed up the eventual more general question as to why his schooling is so different. I don\u2019t want my son to think of himself as significantly different, but I need him to eventually understand that he is; it will be important for his interactions with and expectations of others, and his understanding of himself. I want him to grow up unencumbered with these questions; I just want him to live a happy life with little in the way of limitations of what he can aspire to do with his life. The fact is that there are limitations, but I think him knowing that too soon or thinking about it in the wrong way, will hold him back from what he might have otherwise achieved and become. And so these issues go round and round in my mind. I don\u2019t know the answers, but I know I need to find them if they exist. Maybe there are no \u201crules\u201d here; it\u2019s just what works best for my own child whenever he\u2019s ready to find out. But if you have answers or insights, or just some reassuring words, do share them. Maybe they will help me be ready at the same time as him. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/when-and-how-to-tell-him-hes-autistic/", "title": "When and how to tell him he\u2019s\u00a0autistic?"},
{"date": "January 16, 2012", "body": "I\u2019ve had two blogsters that I greatly respect, decide that I deserve the Liebster Award (insert icon thusly:) The award is a way for bloggers to recognise and bring attention to other newish / underappreciated bloggers (as defined by having less than 200 followers. I have 5o much-loved followers; it\u2019s quality, not quantity, people! And each and every one of you are quality, yes you are). Anywho, I have to first acknowledge who gave me this award, so a big yay to Jim from  Just a Lil Blog  (who said some truly lovely things about my blog), and to the most wonderful \u201cMe\u201d from  The Tumultuous Truth . After I have answered various questions that come as part of this meme, I shall be selecting five other worthy recipients, who I hope you will check out. So, to the questions: Favourite Colour?  Maybe a purply, reddy, rich bluey concoction. With a hint of deep green. And a pinch of cinnamon. Favourite Animal?  Pretty much lizards. And cats. Except when the cats fight outside your children\u2019s windows at 1am, in which case, only lizards. Except that lizard that bit me that time after I saved it from the pool, ungrateful little sod. I\u2019d named it and everything, I\u2019d called it something long beginning with G from my favourite kid\u2019s cartoon at the time (apparently not something very memorable). Favourite Number?  7 or 9. I\u2019ve long thought my favourite number should be 4 \u2013 something to do with the universe and the balance of the elements and the sides of a pyramid and the dimensions of being \u2013 but I could never quite love 4 the way I should. Favourite Drink?  Back when I drunk alcohol (I simply don\u2019t anymore and haven\u2019t for years), my favourite drinks had rude names that would get my blog black-listed, so let\u2019s just say I was also fond of the Bloody Mary (wait, can I say \u201cbloody\u201d?). Facebook or Twitter?  Meh. I suppose Facebook. I\u2019m not a big fan of social media type platforms as a general rule. My Passion?  Education; reading (science and fantasy genres); Joss Whedon creations; the early Playstation Final Fantasy series; vampire themed stuff of all sorts, and of course my kiddy-winks. (Just pretend there was an \u201cs\u201d on the end of \u201cpassion\u201d, k?) Giving or Getting Presents?  Definitely giving, and not just because I\u2019m a nice person (though I totally am). I like giving rather than getting because I feel really awkward and upset when I find out someone has spent their time and money selecting a gift for me that I will never use or enjoy. I always tell them how great it is, but I hate been put in the position of lying or hurting them, ugh. Giving is so much more fun in general; then other people have to pretend to like my presents instead! \ud83d\ude00 Favourite Day?  Whatever day I and my family are happy and well and together. That doesn\u2019t tend to fall on any particular day of the week or year, but it does seem to occur more often in Summer. Favourite Flower?  A strong-smelling rose, maybe like this one grown in my mother\u2019s garden, called Compassion. Isn\u2019t that a lovely name? She gave me some to take home and I took this photo of them, which reminds me that I should have included \u201ctaking photos of random stuff I adore\u201d in that \u201cpassions\u201d question above. \nNow for five fellow bloggers who also deserve it, and meet the criteria (as best I can tell, not everyone provides how many followers they have on their blogs): \n Autism Jungle \n Out of the Fog \n The Simple Life \n The Fragile X Files \n OK, so that\u2019s four.

{"date": "January 15, 2012", "body": "Doing something for the first time with my son can require a lot of preparation and planning; this is particularly true for something I plan to do with him in a couple of weeks: Take him to his first movie. Attending a movie in a movie theatre requires conforming to a lot of social expectations, that run directly counter to my son\u2019s natural behaviours. When my son is happy, he flaps his hands up and down, hums loudly, wriggles in his chair, and sometimes full-out bounces in his seat or stands up and runs back and forth if the moment really takes him. Not exactly good movie-going behaviour. In fact, exactly bad movie-going behaviour. I can\u2019t reasonably expect others to adjust to his behaviour in that situation either, since it directly causes significant upset to what they paid good money to come there to do. The simple fact is that if my son cannot or will not control himself \u2013 conform to the social expectations of a movie-goer \u2013 we will have to leave, even if it means me physically dragging my six year old out while he cries and screams. So I\u2019m doing what I can to explain and prepare him for what he needs to do, and what will happen if he can\u2019t do it. I\u2019ve told him that if he hums and flaps and bounces, we will have to leave. I\u2019ve tried to soften this potential blow by saying we can try again though another day if that happens. I\u2019ve asked him to show me how he sits nice and still and makes no noise; he practices it beautifully. I\u2019ve told him if he needs to ask me a question or has a problem, that he can get my attention and whisper in my ear, so he practices that too. And then he thinks of something that hadn\u2019t crossed my mind. He says to me \u201cCan I laugh like this\u2026?\u201d And does a practice laugh. Then he says \u201cor like this?\u201d and does a different louder one. He wants to know how loud he should laugh and what it should sound like, in advance. I try to answer as best I can, that he can laugh when something is funny, but he shouldn\u2019t just laugh when something isn\u2019t funny. The conversation gets progressively more awkward as we discuss back and forwards how loud and how long he can laugh, and I\u2019m still not convinced that he understands my point about only laughing either way when something makes him want to laugh. Still, it shows me he is thinking about what is acceptable and wants to do what is right. He\u2019s even practiced how he will whisper to me to ask whether he is allowed to laugh during the movie. I\u2019m not convinced he\u2019s ready for the whole movie experience, but he\u2019s been obsessing about the new movie Hugo \u2013 with its trains and clocks featuring so prominently in the ads almost every time he watches TV \u2013 so maybe his love of the movie subject matter will be enough to motivate him to control his natural urges. That\u2019s the hope anyway. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. I\u2019ve already given a lot of thought to best seating position; near aisles and far from other people, and am choosing a day and time that I\u2019m hoping attendance will be low (I\u2019ve even chosen the 2D version of the movie, to limit the new experiences and in the hope more people will choose the 3D version). No matter how it goes down on the day, I\u2019ll be proud of him for trying, because I know he will try, and it won\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m hoping that his occasional hum and flap will be forgiven by the audience, and not be met with the same hostility that is otherwise deserved by those who answer their cellphones in a theatre or shine a lazer at the screen; he wouldn\u2019t be the first to break social expectations at the movies. And I\u2019m hoping that he\u2019ll enjoy it so much that he won\u2019t remember to ask me if it\u2019s OK to laugh. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/can-i-laugh-like-this/", "title": "\u201cCan I laugh like\u00a0this..?\u201d"},
{"date": "September 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image by gingerbeardman via Flickr \n You\u2019ll remember (or  can look up ) the initial confrontation I had with a local mainstream school teacher on Friday, who decided she was the enforcer of the road rules against the driver of my son\u2019s special needs school van. Essentially, the taxi driver is forced to park \u2013 very briefly \u2013 on yellow dotted lines outside our home, for the safety of my own son and the other special needs children he takes to and from school. This local teacher was on the crossing guard that day and took it upon herself to threaten me and the taxi driver with police intervention (and she did so in an exceedingly and un-necessarily rude and inconsiderate way). This morning the taxi driver tells me a teacher from that school (he thinks it may have been the principal), confronted him and told him he was not to stop outside our home. He tried to explain why he does, and went further to make a very important point: If he did what he is legally entitled to do \u2013 which is pull into the footpath area of our drive-way \u2013 he would be an objective and serious hazard to their own mainstream students. Stopping on the footpath portion of our driveway not only places him in the direct path of their students, it also requires him to back into the very crossing they are so concerned about. But this is what they force him to do if they continue to threaten him with police action for stopping on yellow lines outside our own home. So I sent an email to the principal this morning (who \u2013 completely incidentally \u2013 happens to be a friend of my parents), explaining why the driver stops where he must, going into detail about the safety concerns for the special needs children including my own son (I outlined most of those in  that original post  on Friday). I haven\u2019t heard back from him, as drop-off time rolled around. Drop-off time, 20 minutes after the local school has finished, and my son\u2019s taxi van pulls up. There is only one student from the local school still present; everyone else, as usual, has left for home. That student is across the road, standing beside someone who suspiciously looks like the teacher Claire who started this whole situation (over something which has been going on since the start of the year, but wasn\u2019t an issue until she decided she was the local enforcement officer). I figure I\u2019m been paranoid \u2013 why would she wait 20 minutes after school ends just to watch for our son\u2019s taxi van? As the van pulls up though \u2013 away from the yellow lines since it is a Wednesday and the taxi driver never parks on the yellow lines on Wednesday since the rubbish bins block the van door (again, because he puts safety first at all times) \u2013 and this suspiciously familiar lady watches us, then walks away. The taxi driver himself tells me that he thinks that\u2019s the lady who harassed him last time, and also noticed she left only after he pulled up. I tell him to keep doing what he always does \u2013 parking on the yellow lines everyday that\u2019s not Wednesday \u2013 since both him and I know that is the absolute safest practice for both the special needs children and the mainstream kids. I want to say this is just a lone woman, who thinks the letter of the law is more important than the purpose of the law \u2013 which is specifically to keep our school children safe. I want to say this is not about my son having special needs. But both I and the taxi driver feel under attack here. We have tried to explain that these are special needs kids with special needs (obviously), that require a bit of understanding, compassion and leniency. We\u2019ve been forced to explain this to this woman who has no right or power to change our actions but continues to threaten and intimate us. But the special needs are irrelevant to her. She doesn\u2019t understand, or she doesn\u2019t care, and either way she has dedicated herself to enforcing a rule that endangers children. This from a teacher at a mainstream school. From the  same school  I have written about a few times before; the school that made us feel unwelcome and unwanted when we took our autistic son there at the start of the year to investigate whether he would fit into a mainstream school setting. I\u2019m still waiting on that reply from the principal. The taxi driver (who is a very compassionate and thoughtful man) doesn\u2019t want to be put in the position where he endangers the local mainstream school kids by pulling onto the footpath area of our driveway. But his contractual (and moral) responsibility is to keep the special needs children in that van \u2013 including my own son \u2013 safe. And I will not ask him to de-prioritize that primary responsibility for the sake of one woman on a mission, a teacher \u2013 with seemingly the backing of that school \u2013 dedicated to making sure our family and my child are treated as second-class citizens outside our very own home. I have enough to worry about without being under attack by Claire. She, on the other-hand, clearly has nothing better to do. Our lives are worlds apart. She clearly doesn\u2019t have to deal with children like my son, and frankly I\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m reinforced in my impression that the local mainstream school was not the best place for my autistic son. And I shall not be sending my second born there either; I don\u2019t want  either  of my children around people like that. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/45699499@N00/232598860"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/when-mainstream-teachers-attack-the-crossing-guard-part-two/", "title": "When mainstream teachers attack: The crossing-guard, part\u00a0two"},
{"date": "March 6, 2012", "body": "There are a variety of rhetorics that can be used to exclude our special needs children from being accepted in and taking part in society. The function of these rhetorics \u2013 these ways of referring to and marking out our children (and indeed, disabled adults too) \u2013 is to keep the \u201cunpleasantness\u201d of disabled existence away from the tidy, safe mainstream world. It takes something people recognise as different and undesirable in a more general context, attaches it to the disabled population, then draws the conclusion that there is good and moral reason to exclude the disabled, whilst not appearing to be saying the less palatable statement that different bodies and different minds are unacceptable merely because they  are  different. For example, there\u2019s  dehumanizing language , that operates by assigning a lack to our children otherwise required for membership to humanity (eg empathy); sometimes the dehumanizing language is more direct \u201c..it\u2019s like the child isn\u2019t there at all.\u201d Another example is language that denigrates our children as something deserving of ridicule (and used to make \u201cnormal\u201d people feel better about themselves and their abilities);  the word \u201cretarded\u201d  is an example of this. But one that I hadn\u2019t much come across or given real though to until recently, appears to be becoming more popular. It\u2019s another way to separate out our children as \u201cother\u201d, as unwanted, as undesirable within society: To mark their very existence, and their nature, as \u201c criminal .\u201d(I\u2019ll be making my comments most directly about autism since that\u2019s the disability I\u2019m most familiar with due to my son, but the points clearly extend beyond autism, to other disabilities.) The association between autism and criminal behaviour got a very public airing thanks to Assange, in his opinion that  all hackers are a little bit autistic . An idea seemingly (and superficially) supported by the large number of media stories both here and overseas that almost inevitably refer to a hacker\u2019s autism (or more often, Aspergers). Another too-loud voice was added to this criminal association by the astounding ignorance of a strongly anti-vaccine individual, who publicly states that  \u201cAll the school shootings by the children in the USA are by autistic children.\u201d  Locally too, there was a lot of talk about the autistic criminal mind, surrounding the case of  Arie and the lightbulb he attempted to steal post the Christchurch Earthquake . It should be obvious that in every one of these instances broadly linking autism and crime, that there are serious problems with over-reaching, unsupported generalizations, ignorance of how the law operates, or out-right factual error. But it doesn\u2019t take much for new anti-disability rhetoric to start-up and take hold. And while the word \u201cretarded\u201d and more obvious dehumanizing language is under attack, the unfounded labeling of autistic people as inherently \u201ccriminal\u201d allows another avenue for attack and separation. Another way in which the disabled are linked to the word \u201ccriminal,\u201d is arguably even more disturbing, because it goes to their very existence. It is quite typically expressed by this statement I came across only today on  a discussion I was following on facebook :  \u201cThe money to help the \u201cspecial needs\u201d children doesn\u2019t just come from the Min Education \u2013 it comes from us (you, me, next door neighbour \u2013 usually real people paying tax). If Janet and John  [randomly chosen names]  have a special needs child that is terrible, if they continue to breed and have another, that is criminal. My \u201cnormal\u201d children didn\u2019t get any special breaks\u2026\u201d So the very fact of having our children \u2013 their very existence \u2013 is deserving of the label \u201ccriminal;\u201d as in evil, thoughtless, deserving of social condemnation. The parents who allowed the child to come into the world, have done something horrible, and the parent should feel ashamed and blameworthy. By that reasoning, I should have been sterilised after my first child turned out \u201cwrong.\u201d The commenter is saying more directly, that it\u2019s expensive for society to look after high needs individuals, so having such children is irresponsible and deserving of blame. Note that this isn\u2019t seen by the commenter as a reason to critique the funding priorities of society or government, and neither is it seen as reason to encourage people to give more time and money to charity. No, it\u2019s just a failure by the parents of such children, that\u2019s a much easier problem to identify and \u201cfix.\u201d Similarly the equation of autistic people with crime: It would be more complicated to point out that the disabled are far more likely to be easy victims of crime than to commit crimes, and that crimes committed against them will often go un-noticed and / or unpunished due to their inability to understand what has been done to them or to speak out about it; or that they are frequently poorly represented and poorly understood within  the legal and criminal system  which again makes them easy to \u201ccatch\u201d and easy scape-goats ( sometimes of crimes they didn\u2019t even commit ). No, it\u2019s much easier and tidier to label them as \u201cother\u201d, as \u201ccriminals\u201d; abhorrent and negative things we\u2019re better off without in society, things that drag down the \u201cnormal\u201d law-abiding people. And it\u2019s easier not to treat them as individuals, but as representative of  all  those given the label of \u201cautistic\u201d (for example). This rhetoric lets \u201cnormal\u201d people feel superior, by accident of birth. It makes \u201cnormal\u201d people feel safer too: \u201call we have to do is identify the disabled and keep them away from us or stop them existing at all, and normal people\u2019s lives will be that much better.\u201d The disabled are an easy group of people to identify and blame when things go wrong, not least of all because their ability to fight back with actions and words is much less than other targets in society. It is easy to group them together in the first place \u2013 either by label or by appearance \u2013 and to emphasize how different they are from the \u201cnorm\u201d, rather than how much the same we are. The word \u201ccriminal\u201d comes loaded with both legal and moral implications; it packs a punch. When used to group together and separate out the disabled, so that the disabled can be treated as unwanted by mere fact of their existence, the punch it packs is itself\u2026 criminal. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/kryzb/1413181245/", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/julian-assange-i-am-ndash-like-all-hackers-ndash-a-little-bit-autistic-2358654.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/02/11038/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "http://www.facebook.com/BreakfastonONE/posts/10150648818032719", "http://www.3news.co.nz/Man-wrongly-imprisoned-for-rape-compensated-350000/tabid/1384/articleID/206941/Default.aspx"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/its-criminal-that-they-exist-and-they-exist-as-criminals-more-language-of-exclusion/", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s criminal that they exist, and they exist as criminals\u2026\u201d; More Language of\u00a0Exclusion"},
{"date": "February 6, 2012", "body": "Concerns about the up-coming changes to the autism criteria in DSM-5, have now seeped their way into the wider autism community, and indeed into the broader public consciousness. The most popular critiques were originally directed at the loss of existing divisons within the autism spectrum; most especially of the separate category of \u201cAspergers\u201d (to be folded into autism more generally in the DSM-5). More recently, the focus has turned to the (supposedly high) number of people who may lose an autism diagnosis altogether under the new criteria, and in turn concern over consequent loss of access to government-paid-therapies, special schools, and insurance cover. (Those numbers are highly debatable and hotly contested though, see for example  this blogger\u2019s post  looking at the recent news stories and issues, and this  press release from the APA  (pdf).) I\u2019ve written a few posts already (which I will provide links to where relevant in this post too), looking at and musing over the changes to the criteria. I\u2019m not alarmed by the changes on the whole, in fact I think they\u2019re important and much-needed. So in the face of the recent (and rather alarmist) reactions to the changes, I\u2019ve decided to compile some of my already covered points about why the DSM-5 might actually be awesome, and add in some new ones too. I don\u2019t expect whole-hearted agreement on their goodness, but I think it is important to introduce and consider these points in the face of the current outcry against the changes. (1)  The changes should make it easier to accurately distinguish between giftedness and\u00a0 (what is currently known as) Aspergers. Currently there is some understandable confusion about the line between the two, and the relationship between the two, which has important implications for treatment and the understanding of autism. See  my previous post  for more detail about how the DSM-IV creates this confusion, and how the DSM-5 may clarify the issue. (2)  The DSM-5 shifts Retts off the autism spectrum (and out of the DSM altogether), and suggests including reference to the cause of autism where known (for example, if it is caused by Fragile X). In both regards, this adds some much needed clarity to the relationship between various conditions and autism. See my previous post expanding on this point: \u201c Genetic origins of Autism; when is autism, not autism? Fragile X and Rett\u00a0Syndrome. \u201d (3)  Educational services on offer for those with a PDD-NOS or Aspergers diagnosis, are often lesser than those on offer for someone with a classic autism diagnosis, despite that the challenges faced by those with PDD-NOS and Aspergers can be just as challenging as those with classic autism. Bringing all \u201ctypes\u201d of autism under the same head, would make it harder to continue to give those with Aspergers and PDD-NOS fewer services  merely  because of that different diagnosis category. (See further: \u201c Understanding the DSM-5 Autism Criteria \u201c) (4)  There is evidently much inconsistency in the way that Aspergers, PDD-NOS and autism are currently diagnosed, across different practices and by different clinicians (see, for example,  A Multisite Study of the Clinical Diagnosis of Different Autism Spectrum Disorders ). The new criteria is aimed at providing that currently missing clarity and consistency, which would in turn make for more consistent and accurate research findings about autism. (For more detail, see the DSM-5  rationale for removing Aspergers .) (5)  The DSM-5 introduces an express  severity scale , which should help clarify the currently much argued about and misused notions of \u201chigh functioning\u201d and \u201clow functioning\u201d autism. It could become a much more consistently used means by which to acknowledge the different ways in which autism impacts on lives, and in turn tailor services to how much autism is negatively impacting on one\u2019s life, rather than more simplistically to whether they have PDD-NOS (for example) rather than autism. (This ties back into point (3) above.) (6)  The express introduction of reference to \u201c unusual sensory behaviours \u201c. These sensory issues are a significant part of the challenges faced by autistic people; it arguably makes the diagnosis more accurate and complete by having them present as one of the options under  criteria B , and it\u2019s important to have them directly referenced within the criteria for the understanding of the disorder and provision of services. (7)  The  drastic drop in ASD diagnosis variations from DSM-IV (2027+) to the proposed DSM-5 (just\u00a011) , will arguably/conceivably make is easier for researchers to study and draw meaningful conclusions about autism, and for service providers to create and tailor services to those with a diagnosis. This is obviously not an exhaustive list of benefits \u2013 whether actual or expected \u2013 of changes to the DSM criteria for autism. Of course the DSM-5 faces many legitimate challenges from those concerned about the changes to the autism criteria; I am aware of those concerns, and have written previous posts addressing some of them (see for example, \u201c Intent vs Effect re the Exclusion of General Developmental Delay under ASD in the\u00a0DSM-5 \u201d and \u201c The 4 Main DSM-5 Autism\u00a0Controversies \u201c). I think that it is important though to consider why the changes to the autism criteria are being introduced in the first place, and whether the benefit of those changes outweigh the negatives (I find it difficult to imagine a change to the criteria that would ever make everyone happy when it comes to autism). On balance, I am of the opinion that these changes are largely beneficial and heading in the right direction, though some of the chosen language in the DSM-5 and the communication of the changes to the general public, have left something to be desired. The criteria have not been finalised yet; if you\u2019re interested in the DSM-5 process, timeframe, and opportunities to comment on the changes, have a good wander around the  official site  (particularly see the links under \u201c About DSM-5 \u201c). \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.co.nz/2012/01/new-york-times-dsm-5-autism-coverage.html", "http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/12-03%20Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorders%20-%20DSM5.pdf", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/child-development-central/201201/understanding-the-dsm-5-autism-criteria", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/02/a-multisite-study-of-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-different-autism-spectrum-disorders/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=97#", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94#", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94#", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94#", "http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx", "http://www.dsm5.org/about/Pages/Default.aspx"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/a-few-good-reasons-to-like-the-dsm-5-autism-criteria-changes/", "title": "A Few Good Reasons to Like the DSM-5 Autism Criteria\u00a0Changes"},
{"date": "September 5, 2011", "body": "\n Image by K. Sawyer Photography via Flickr \n Discussions of intelligence and autism get heated very quickly. There are passionately divergent views; some seeing astoundingly high intellect as part-in-parcel with the autistic mind, with others claiming low intelligence levels almost always come hand-in-hand with an autism diagnosis. These debates have only got more heated with the proposed changes in the DSM-5 (a key diagnostic manual for identifying such conditions as autism), since it moves to make a separation between autism and various intellectual disabilities. I\u2019ve only recently become aware of a vital difference in how people use particular terminology, that I think requires clarification. From what I can gather, much of the different terminology use reflects country of origin; particularly of people in the United States, where  rhetoric and political movements around the use of the word \u201cretarded\u201d have gained significant momentum and received wide-spread coverage . This is particularly relevant to the use of the terminology \u201cintellectual disability.\u201d There is another grouping of directly related words which also cause confusion and disagreement where often the disagreement is not actually substantive. That is around the use of the words \u201cintelligence,\u201d and \u201cintellect.\u201d In this post I will attempt to explain the broadly different uses of those terms, and how their different uses affect the rhetoric about the relationship between ASD and intellectual disability in particular. I\u2019ll start by saying that under one meaning, my son is intellectually disabled. And under another meaning, he is not. But that under both meanings, the substance of my claim is directly related to and impacted by his autism. The first meaning of intellectual disability, is that as a replacement word for \u201cmentally retarded;\u201d often used to refer to those of notably limited intelligence when measured as an IQ of 70 or below. With the discriminatory and derogatory use of the term \u201cretarded,\u201d \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d has increasingly taken its place as a kinder and less-loaded terminology. There is a second, very different use of the term. That is to refer to people who have intellectual disabilities  as opposed to  physical disabilities. Whereby the word \u201cintellectual\u201d is just a descriptor that the disability primarily affects the mind, rather than the physical body. Some disabilities are both intellectual and physical, and sometimes the line between the two is less clear. But in terms of such activities as charities, services, support, and meeting education needs, it is frequently helpful and highly relevant to be able to differentiate between whether the person you will be dealing with has a physical, intellectual, or both types of disability. So when I say my son is intellectually disabled, what I mean is he has an intellectual rather than a physical disability in this sense. Specifically, that autism has affected his intellect. But not necessarily his intelligence, and therefore, he is not intellectually disabled in the first sense I discussed. Already, you can see why I now have to discuss the difference between \u201cintellect\u201d and \u201cintelligence.\u201d \u201cIntellect\u201d is always affected by autism, since autism affects learning, it also usually impacts on reasoning and the ability to think abstractly (particularly when autistic children are compared to \u201cnormally\u201d developing peers). \u201cIntelligence\u201d however, is a more controversial thing than \u201cthe intellect,\u201d and is notoriously difficult to measure in autistic people (and indeed in the average population; I recently read  a very good book  that explains the bad educational practices based on unsound and disproven theories about how intelligence develops in children.) Because of the clear and predictable difficulties assessing the intelligence of children who face challenges with social interactions and language use, using an IQ test to reach a\u00a0 conclusion about either the current intelligence levels or the child\u2019s potential intelligence levels, is often unhelpful (though there are certain intelligence tests which can perform the task better than others). Even if one could get a read on the intelligence of a given autistic individual, intelligence itself continues to be a rather elusive and poorly understood thing, with many theories still being developed (for example) about the nature versus nurture of intelligence levels. For all such difficulties, there are times of course when we can meaningfully say \u201cthis person has very low intelligence and for medical reasons we can expect that not to change\u201d or \u201cthis person has remarkably high intelligence and is functioning significantly above their age-peers and even the average adult.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, the professionals that have worked with my son, and my family members who have spent significant amounts of time with my son, have all commented that \u2013 despite the serious challenges affecting my son\u2019s  intellect  \u2013 he is clearly quite intelligent. Over the years \u2013 as his language and social interactions have significantly improved \u2013 that intelligence has become more obvious. I suspect in the past I have not been 100% consistent with my use of terminology, since I was not as aware as I am now of the difference (and importance of the differences) in uses. I will no doubt in the future too, make occasional slips into using the word \u201cintellect\u201d when I mean \u201cintelligence,\u201d or use the term \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d when I mean \u201clow intelligence.\u201d I will make a particular effort to be clear with my uses; if my use is ever unclear please do ask for me to clarify. I would encourage you too \u2013 if you find someone else using such terms in a way that leads to conclusions you hold to be false or outlandish \u2013 to first clarify in your mind what they are really trying to say, and thereby make sure your reply is relevant. They may not even realise their own confusing use (and perhaps multiple uses) of such terms. This post is not meant to be definitive in the debate about uses \u2013 chance are there are other uses or dominant uses that I have not addressed or given too much / too little weight \u2013 but I think it is at least important to be cognizant of the varying terminologies and how they impact our ASD / intellectual disability debates. *** A selection of my previous posts on intelligence and ASD, relevant to issues discussed in this post: \n Bold Intelligence; how shyness and anxiety can impact on measuring a child\u2019s intelligence \n Intelligence, Autism, and Genius \n Humour in Intentional Error; why my autistic son will fail your test \n Distinguishing Giftedness from Aspergers; will the DSM-5 help? \n The 4 Main DSM-5 Autism Controversies \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/34698905@N00/3472116296", "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704865104575588273153838564.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/hes-not-intellectually-disabled-hes-just-intellectually-disabled-asd-id/", "title": "\u201cHe\u2019s not intellectually disabled; he\u2019s just intellectually disabled,\u201d ASD &\u00a0ID"},
{"date": "September 6, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I\u2019ve done a lot of hunting through the policies of the Parties running in the upcoming New Zealand General Election; trying to find their express views on disability, particularly as they impact on autism families. The difficulty of finding their express views, has surprised and disappointed me. I realise it is a couple of months out from the election \u2013 and certain Parties are in turmoil due to changes in leadership for instance \u2013 but it should be easier than it has been to figure out (at the very least their existing) views relevant to disability. So it is noteworthy that United Future is one of the few parties that have made it easy to access these policies. This gives a favourable impression of how much they have considered, and taken seriously, the issues surrounding disability. There are a number of places in United Future\u2019s policies where they directly address disability concerns, including their  Disability Policy ,  Special Education policy , and  Children with Disabilities  Policy. I\u2019m going to go through their key points relevant to the autism community. I\u2019ll begin by pointing out that United Future \u2013 much like  the Green Party  \u2013 is concerned about the gap between existing disability policy and actual practice. I was interested to see that United Future wants to \u201c establish Community-based advocacy services to ensure that every disabled person and their family have a case manager who ensures that clients are given every support they are entitled to and want. \u201d Our family rather accidentally ended up with someone performing this function; a social worker who was proactive in getting various organisations to do what they were meant to be doing for us without the delay and fuss, and who helped to co-ordinate the bewildering number of people and groups we were interacting with. Our family reached the point where we no longer needed his services (and in fact found his a tad too intrusive), but it was valuable to have his expertise, dedication and support in this capacity, and I know many other families have struggled without someone like this in place. I think formalizing such a position for each family, is a worthy idea. I found it particularly insightful when they said they would \u201c establish advocacy services so that parents have more energy to give to parenting rather than chasing entitlements .\u201d Well said. In the meantime, in the absence of such helpful advocacy services, United Future wants to streamline applications for assistance to the numerous organisations that frequently interact with families like ours (health, education, income support, etc). Another great idea proposed by United Future, is \u201c the development of \u201cfamily governance groups\u201d to oversee life-long care arrangements for individuals with disabilities .\u201d This is an issue that worries families like ours, a lot. It is comforting, to say the least, to see recognition of such concerns. I would be interested to see the details of such a suggestion (I was unable to find those details). Like the Green Party, United Future is also keen to see a Disability Commission set up. Considering our own family\u2019s struggles with accessing and then utilising carer hours, I was interested to see their policy state that \u201c more accountability is needed to track where the money from unfilled carer hours goes and is spent. \u201d I have heard (and experienced) some very dodgy tales about the allocation of carer hours, so I\u2019d be keen to see this scrutiny occur. Also related to such service providers, it was good to see the policy state that \u201c the sector needs to be client-driven not provider-driven. Better collaboration between what clients want and what services are available will require a change in funding and contracting. Where possible the client should determine the contract. \u201d United Future wants to see more acknowledgment and support for the carers of those with disabilities, including the introduction of a \u201cCaregivers Allowance\u201d and making respite care widely available. Again, like the Green Party, United Future wants to see disability training become a compulsory part of teacher training. They want to increase ORS funding (small error that through-out their policy they use the out-dated acronym of ORRS). They note that ORS is only given to 1% of students, but that 1 in 5 students have disabilities of some sort. United Future wants to see a shuffling of the allocation of funds within the education sector, to address some wide-spread issues of special needs money not going where it is most needed (details are numerous, and can be found  here ), and wants to \u201c promote an increase of funding for early identification of children with special needs and disabilities with targeted systematic, intensive and high quality interventions. \u201d In my further research, I have found that United Future is very aware of the disparity between disability care (for people such as those with autism), and care for disability caused by accidents as covered by ACC; that ACC is a very generous scheme but does not extend to those born with their condition, even though their lives may be ultimately affected in the exact same ways as those who arrive at their problems via \u201caccident.\u201d This concern is reflected in their policy: They would like to \u201c establish a health levy (or National Insurance Scheme) to provide a designated fund to address the disparity between trauma-based (ACC) and non-trauma based impairment. \u201d There are many others aspects of United Future\u2019s policies that will also variously impact on autism families, but I think I\u2019ve managed to capture the main areas.

{"date": "September 24, 2011", "body": "\n Image by alles-schlumpf via Flickr \n My five year-old autistic son makes full use of his developing language to ask some very interesting questions about the world. It used to be so rare to have him put a meaningful sentence together that I\u2019d write it down each time he made one; now I\u2019d need paper and pen at the ready the whole day to keep track. His language is still unusual and limited, but he does something quite remarkable when I tell him I don\u2019t understand him: Instead of getting upset or just walking away, or requiring me to rephrase it for him, he\u2019ll make a thoughtful face and come back to me with a rewording so I can answer his query. Just this morning, seemingly out of the blue, he asked me if the elephant at the zoo can see our house. I told him no because the zoo is very far away and there are things like walls in the way anyway. So he asked if the elephant could see our house if there were no walls in the way. I told him no because we\u2019re still too far away. He turned thoughtful and hit me with another out-of-left-field. He asked whether the chickens at Poppa\u2019s farm can see Poppa\u2019s house. I decided the answer to that was yes, which seemed to make him quite happy, and we went his merry way. Other people \u2013 non-immediate family people \u2013 often hear him asking interesting or unusual questions, and tell us what a thoughtful enquiry that was. Unfortunately, it\u2019s usually the same question he asks us every day many times a day; so unusual, yes, but novel or unique for him, no. A classic example is the enquiry as to whether each house he visits has a smoke alarm, and where the light switches are. The elephant and chicken enquiries definitely counted as novel and unique though. He makes interesting observations that make people look at him sideways. Particularly in regards to his life and death questions. He understands that life is the opposite of death, as he puts it. And he likes to figure out who was alive or dead at various people\u2019s births. For example, on the visit to his great grandmother\u2019s house today he worked \u2013 with our help where he needed it \u2013 on figuring out who she is related to that were alive or dead at the time of her birth. Often his questions are so unexpected that people take a while to figure out how to respond, or dismiss the enquiry as lacking real meaning. But my son will persist and reword his question if necessary, to find the answers he seeks. He does it calmly and patiently, only rarely getting upset these days when people can\u2019t figure out what he\u2019s asking of them. Hardly any of his language is random nonsense now, and when it is he seems to understand that those words lack meaning. Language has gone from confusing and distressing noise in his life \u2013  noise that he forced others to not use in his presence, with the consequence of violence and meltdowns  \u2013 to a tool that he is actively and constantly using to explore the world and others in the world. Even when those others are large-eared\u00a0pachyderms. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/29487767@N02/3497676527"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/can-the-elephant-see-our-house/", "title": "Can the elephant see our\u00a0house?"},

{"date": "September 16, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Simon Owen Design via Flickr \n Autism is often referred to in ways that dehumanize autistic people: That autism leaves a child seemingly soul-less; that the person once present in that body and mind is now missing or unreachable. That autism robs something from the person which otherwise makes them part of the human race; such as social intelligence or empathy more broadly. Or that autistic people are robots; more interested in calculations and computers than people. To a limited extent, these sorts of statements are responding to the very real and important challenges that autism poses. Autism does indeed affect expected social interactions, \u201cmind-reading\u201d, eye contact, and the sorts of interests that become fixations / passions for autistic people. But the dehumanizing language used to convey these problems \u2013 talk of robots and lost souls \u2013 goes beyond observation of the challenges and expressions of concern. Rather, that sort of language deeply stigmatises and damagingly misrepresents the experiences and capacities of autistic people as a whole. Often the most heated rhetoric comes hand-in-hand with efforts to stimulate government and public interest and concern in autism; to encourage funding into causes and cures, but also to raise awareness more generally. When parents in particular, try to make others understand how hard their lives and the lives of their children are, it is understandable that they turn to emotive metaphors. Metaphors that shock, and capture the imagination. But with autism still being so poorly understood by the general public, such metaphors seem to have taken on a life of their own, so that autism is now more than the definition you find in professional manuals used to identify autistic people. So much so that I have read of people with Aspergers being told that their diagnosis must be mistaken because they care what other people think of them; that there is something inherent in autism that not just makes it less likely, but makes it impossible for them to experience empathy (for example). Fighting these sorts of attitudes and opinions on autism, puts autistic people and their families in the position of having to defend their very humanity in the eyes of others. As if their starting point is \u201cless than human\u201d and they must prove their humanity; that is it not a given. That they are less equal and less deserving of equal respect, because they lack something vital that the rest of us never had to prove in ourselves. Essentially, you end up with a war between those inciting fear and concern about what autism \u201cdoes\u201d to a person, and those trying to defend their humanity in the eyes of society. In such a war, both \u201csides\u201d tend to over-state their claims, as they try to out-voice the other. Absolutes and universals about autistic people, get stated with little or no grounding, (or mis-stated in the case of misrepresenting an opponent\u2019s view-point). Both sides have something to fight for and something to lose; these are not small philosophical matters of little import or practical relevance. They matter to questions of law, relationships, support services, funding, research, etc. Besides the actual criteria required for an autism diagnosis, there is a limit to what you can claim about all autistic people (and even then, it is complicated since there are so many varieties and different groupings of symptoms for autism). You can make generalisations, and common observations; \u201cmost autistic people do behaviour X or many autistic people have a problem with Y even though it\u2019s not required for a diagnosis.\u201d But all too often people leave out the word \u201cmost\u201d or \u201cmany\u201d and jump straight to \u201cautistic people.\u201d And as I\u2019ve said, the chosen wording to convey those commonalities \u2013 even when they are supposed restatements of elements in the criteria for autism (such as social communication difficulties restated as \u201crobots\u201d) \u2013 can have a far wider reaching impact than that intended. (Supposing here that the intention is not to isolate and demonize autistic people.) It can be hard to connect with some autistic person \u2013 to touch them, talk to them, even be in the same room as them (for reasons such an anxiety and violence) \u2013 particularly if you have no experience with or knowledge of autism. But to take those challenges and mark them out as failures of their humanity \u2013 rather than as reasons to try to better understand the presentation of the problems \u2013 is arguably a failure of humanity itself. These are not easy issues, with easy answers. But a way forward from this point, would seem to be more care with the colourful and emotive language used to describe the problems faced by autistic people, and more care around the use of universal statements that distort the experiences and realities of autism. Fighting to prove humanity, is just one more fight autistic people shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cwin\u201d in the first place. I realise this topic can touch a lot of raw nerves. I don\u2019t mean to insult anyone, or to downplay the challenges faced by autistic people. I am publicly sharing what I\u2019ve observed, and trying to organise my thoughts as I wade through these debates and try to make sense of the disagreements and emotions involved. To that end I openly invite you to share your own views, and in doing so to help me better understand these issues.

{"date": "September 21, 2011", "body": "Today is the  United Nations International Day of Peace . I\u2019m taking part in the \u201c Blog for  Peace \u201d by sharing what peace means to me, from the role of parenting an autistic child. I knew becoming a parent would mean I would be my child\u2019s primary advocate, at least until he became an adult. As a parent of an autistic child, that advocacy role becomes even more important and longer lasting. But it\u2019s not just because our children need so much more from us, and have sometimes extreme challenges when it comes to the simplest communication.\u00a0 More than that; autism parents have to become Battle Parents. We have to learn to fight, and keep up the fight, just so our children can access their basic rights and entitlements, and to allow them to be accepted as part of society. We fight for our children to be able to take part in education. The simple act of being accepted into a local school, becomes a battle ground when schools learn that our children will need extra support. Once you\u2019re in that door, you have to fight for your child to remain on the school roll; it\u2019s easier to say \u201cthis child is too difficult, we think he belongs somewhere else\u201d than \u201clet\u2019s find ways to make sure this child flourishes here.\u201d If you\u2019re a parent like me \u2013 lucky enough to have the funding to send your child to a special needs school \u2013 you have to keep up the fight to have those schools remain open, as government policies and funding changes put them under threat. We fight for the supports we\u2019re told we are entitled to. Like a cruel taunt, you\u2019re told you\u2019re entitled to services that will make your life and your child\u2019s life easier and better, but little comes of it unless you constantly make a fuss. You have to make phone calls, send emails, wait months for replies and action, then face constant reviews and reapplications just to hold on to what your child desperately needs. Services end up allocated according to who has the most time and energy to fight for them, rather than according to need. And those most in need have the least time and energy to do the fighting. Arbitrary factors like who is assigned to your case or which part of the city you live in, can make enormous difference to what government services your family gets, if they get them at all. Every part of life can be a battle when your child has autism, even the comments and disapproving looks you get out in public as you try to contain a tantrum of a child who lacks verbal skills, or try to get your son to calm down from an anxiety attack because he heard or saw a fan on the roof. Where there should be help and understanding from those around us, there is judgment and isolation. So peace, to me, in my daily world, would be no more Battle Parents for autistic children. A world where our time and energy and passions are poured into parenting and caring for our children, instead of fighting bureaucracy and public condemnation. A world where I don\u2019t have stories to tell about people and organisations that treat my son \u2013 and children like my son \u2013 as something unwanted and even something inhuman. A life where my communications with others are \u201cthank you for your help and understanding\u201d instead of pleading for that help and understanding, and being made to feel like a failure for even reaching out for that help. So that\u2019s the thought I\u2019m adding to this Day of Peace. A thought that goes beyond just autism, and even beyond children with special needs; the hope that the services and rights promised to our families and our children can be met without having to be a Battle Parent. So we can spend less time fighting for basic entitlements, more time caring and parenting. And be one step closer to Peace. *** Join in the Blog for Peace this Wednesday September 21st, by writing your own post too: \u201c Now tell us what peace means to you.

{"date": "September 29, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My son sits at a frontier of discrimination, because of his autism. People know they shouldn\u2019t be judging him based on his genitalia or sexual orientation, his skin colour, his religion (or lack thereof), country of birth, or even his physical limitations (if he was wheelchair bound or had lost an arm). (Whether people actually act in accordance with that knowledge is an important but separate question). But when it comes to his autism \u2013 to his mental disability and the myriad of ways that it manifests \u2013 people don\u2019t think that belongs in the same category as a discriminatory issue. They see his autism as a real reason to treat him worse or judge him in advance. I\u2019ve known this for a while, but have struggled to find explanations of why this is the frontier of discrimination. I\u2019ve seen plenty of pieces point out that this discrimination is happening, and that its consequences are severe. I\u2019ve seen pieces talking about the change that needs to occur (such as affirmative action programs). But I haven\u2019t seen explanations of why this is the current frontier. Over time I have developed some personal views about this. I do not think mental disabilities are just \u201cthe next step\u201d in fighting discrimination; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental and not meaningful that the next major discrimination issue appears to be mental disability. In fact, I think that mental disabilities sit at the frontier of discrimination, partially because of the very ways in which discrimination against other aspects of a person have been fought. Which is to say, the rhetoric used to fight sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc, is what has helped to create this stumbling block for mental disabilities. There are two major lines of rhetoric that have been used to reinforce human equality, and to distinguish when we should be ready to treat people as lesser than the rest of humanity. The first is the idea that no matter the skin, sex, etc, of someone, their minds are the same as our own in vital ways. For example, that a woman or a black man has the same ability to reason and feel as the white man. The second is that when looking to judge someone\u2019s morality or worthiness, we cannot take into account that which the person cannot control and had no say over. (The same notion that is reflected in much of law.) So we mustn\u2019t think less of people because of their skin, sex etc; they had no say or control over that. Instead we must turn our attention to their words and actions, from which we can truly gleam their character and humanity. Someone with a mental disability \u2013 such as my autistic son \u2013 is going to fall foul of both approaches of combatting discriminatory words and actions. Under the first type of rhetoric, it actually looks like his mind and his emotions operate differently than the \u201cnorm,\u201d those differences marking him out as something \u201cother\u201d in some important ways. (It is under this line of thought that attacks on autistic capacity for empathy equates with attacks on equality and humanity, an issue  I wrote about recently .) Under the second line of rhetoric, he (and people like him) also fall out of favour, since the very words and actions which people are meant to judge him by \u2013 the things which, unlike skin colour or gender, he has control over\u00a0 \u2013 are hard to access or interpret because of his autism. And at times those words and actions do not have the level of control behind them that we normally presuppose people to have (think of stimming and echolalia, particularly in young autistic children). When it comes to physical disabilities \u2013 as opposed to purely or primarily mental disabilities \u2013 the cause of the different actions or communications is usually highly visible. So it is easier for people to observe and comprehend that certain behaviours are beyond the individual\u2019s control (so if they knock you while waiting in line you\u2019re not going to harangue them for being rude). But autism is often called an invisible disability, for a good reason. Though it does affect an individual in a wide range of ways, the cause is not written on their body or in their faces. My son looks just like anyone else (only immensely cuter of course, cause hello, he\u2019s my son). There are two paths forward then, if I am right about these rhetorics being problematic for assessing and understanding people like my son, in ways that otherwise lead to unjust discrimination. The first is to keep the rhetoric \u2013 that the things that bind us in humanity is our reason and emotions for example, and that we should judge people by their words and actions rather than things they have no control over \u2013 and educate people to better understand how conditions like autism affect the  presentation  of these things. Which is to say, that what looks like an inability to reason or feel, is a misinterpretation or over-simplification of someone with autism. Or that the actions and words that confuse and upset other people (the tantrums, seeming rudeness etc) are not as fully in control as you may presuppose for others, or again are being misinterpreted. The other approach you could take is to change the rhetoric. So that the focus is not on the mind and emotions of humans, or on the blameworthiness of people (only judging and holding them responsible for things they control), but instead something perhaps more universal. Such as the mere fact of being a human, regardless of what form that humanity takes. This sounds attractive and enlightened but is a problematic solution since the focus on reason and emotion actually fits into a wider rhetoric of respect and good treatment of animals (which feel pain, and certain animals like primates being able to reason in ways that we recognise and value as humans). Also, the focus of judgment linked to what we can \u201ccontrol\u201d does ground the understanding and treatment of those who break the laws set in place to allow us to live together in societies (think of theft and murder). The question of control also affects us in our everyday interactions in relevant ways, as we actively (and should) choose to have people in our lives who treat us well and care about what happens to us. So I think there remain (at least some) good reasons to focus on reason, emotion and what we have control over, as factors in the explanation of why and when we shouldn\u2019t discriminate against others; the better option would seem to be educating people about the complexities of mental disabilities and the different ways in which humanity in all its forms expresses itself and experiences the world. This approach would also lend itself towards a shift in rhetoric away from \u201cdisability\u201d and more towards \u201cdifference,\u201d as a natural corollary of an enhanced understanding of there being more than one way to be in and take part in society. I do think there is still room there for understanding that disability still exists \u2013 that there are certain aspects of being a human that are severely affected and usually for the negative in various physical and mental conditions \u2013 but they would be shifted away from grounds for discrimination, towards grounds for compassion, accomodation, assistance and support. I want to conclude by saying that this is simply what the title says \u2013 an attempt to understand \u2013 I do not think I have figured it all out or got all the answers (far from it). I\u2019m just trying to make sense of what my son and my family has gone through, and place it within the rhetorics I have heard across my life-time about why and when discrimination is unjust. Even as I pause pre hitting \u201cpublish\u201d I can see certain little changes or refinements I\u2019d make if I were to tackle this topic again, but I\u2019ll be hitting \u201cpublish\u201d all the same because I see this post as a good starting point towards what I\u2019m trying to figure out.

{"date": "January 21, 2012", "body": "Just  two weeks ago I was publicly agonizing  over the questions of when and how to tell my six-year-old son that he has autism. The great outcome of my public agonizing (the private agonizing had been going on for many a month), was the outpouring of advice and reassurance from my blog readers; not only in the comments section, some contacted me privately too. The upshot was that I decided to tell my son sooner rather than later; particularly that the next time the conversation about people\u2019s differences naturally arose, I would take the opportunity to expand the discussion to talk about his own \u201cspecial difference.\u201d That day was today. I\u2019m splitting this story into two parts. This first part is about \u201cthe book that couldn\u2019t be found\u201d. The second part will be about how the eventual \u201crevelation of autism\u201d actually went. I was determined to have visual supports for the conversation; my son learns well from, and responds well to, visuals, particularly in book form. And so began the endless and fruitless search for the appropriate book. Despite numerous suggestions from well-meaning people, and hours spent trawling through long lists of books on charity and blog sites, no book was appropriate. They all fell short. The vast majority of the books were aimed at those in the life of the autistic person, rather than the actual autistic person. Book after book aimed at siblings and classmates, where the autistic person is the \u201cother\u201d. My son is very literal and would have found this approach somewhat confusing, and I didn\u2019t want a book told so strongly from that \u201cotherness\u201d point of view. Most of the books aimed at the actual autistic individual, were specifically about Aspergers, and used that term too. My son does not have Aspergers, that would have added confusion, not clarity. Just to make things worse, almost every book I was able to get more information on, spent time explaining that autistic people like to be left alone or don\u2019t have many friends. My son is a highly sociable boy; yes he struggles with it, but he sure does not like to be alone, and neither do I want him to see himself as someone destined for aloneness. The very few books that came close to being appropriate in content, were all aimed at a much higher age range. Frankly some of the books were plain ridiculous or offensive, with aspects or wording that made me cringe. Like the one entitled \u201c Little Rainman .\u201d And yes, that\u2019s really its title. After many hours trying to track down the right book, I decided to do a social story myself. I evolved the idea into doing a personalised home-made book, with my own art-work. Then a more professional one, using free-to-use images from the net to support the words. Eventually I went with using photos of himself, his own experiences, and the people in his life, put together in a properly bound photo book that I made and ordered online, using a standard photo ordering website (\u201c Snapfish \u201d is my regular). I was very pleased with the end product, and the two people I showed it to in advance were so impressed that they said I should mass-produce it, or something very much like it. I\u2019m still thinking over whether I can or should, but for now I had made something that suited my purposes. The overall message of the book is that everyone has differences, and his difference is called autism. That autism comes with good aspects, and not so good aspects, but that he\u2019ll get lots of help to learn those things that are harder for him to do. I supported the words with examples and images that mean the most to him. I wanted the overall tone to be up-beat but also realistic, and personalised to his autism and the challenges (and advantages) that autism has brought into his specific life. The book arrived in the mail today. I put the it away in a drawer in the house where my son wouldn\u2019t stumble across it, and felt far more settled; knowing I was now (more) ready for the day whenever it may come. I suggested to my husband that I actively might choose to raise the issue next Wednesday if our son hadn\u2019t raised it before then. I didn\u2019t want to try sooner than that, because my son has a few big things planned over the next three days (including his first movie-experience!). But I also wanted to deal with the topic before he returned to school in February, so he had time to adjust and absorb the new information (without raising awkward discussion issues for his fellow classmates, many who also have autism and might don\u2019t know it yet; let their parents tell them when they want to.) I was down in the lounge going over \u201cthe right time\u201d in my mind; what time of day would be best, even what room would be best for the conversation\u2026 and then the moment had arrived.

{"date": "September 22, 2011", "body": "\n Image by millicent_bystander via Flickr \n I find myself in agreement with diverse attitudes towards autism, because I\u2019ve lived with autism\u2019s diversities. I have spent years with a severely autistic child who was a danger to himself and myself; who faced a largely non-verbal future with a low chance of employment or independence. And now I am moving into years of having a moderately autistic child who is verbal, clearly quite intelligent, and constantly surpassing everyone\u2019s expectations. The diverse attitudes towards autism, respond to and reflect the diverse experiences of autism. Sometimes it really is a life-long horrendous disability that drains everyone involved. And sometimes it appears as if a gift; seemingly enhancing the individual and those close to them. In the same way that there are many autisms (or \u201cpervasive developmental disorders\u201d if you prefer), there are also many understandable and legitimate attitudes towards autism. I am yet to reach the view that a single one of those attitudes accurately captures the entire range of autism, and I expect the changes to the category and types of autism in coming decades will reinforce the legitimacy of the diverse attitudes. I am still to get my head around how that diversity relates to and captures a situation like my son, who like so many others on the spectrum, has gradually progressed away from such scary severity (particularly over the past year). It is tempting to forget and rewrite the horror of those early years (particularly from his ages of two to four); to instead focus exclusively on the amazing little almost-six-year-old I have blossoming now. To  only  look forward and be hopeful, and recast autism in the light of who he is now and who I hope he will become. But I fight that temptation for some very good reasons. First off, what I went through \u2013 what my son went through \u2013 is what thousands of other families are still going through, and might go through until the day they die. Just because my son improved so much, doesn\u2019t mean every autistic child does (neither, by the way, does it mean my own son will continue at such rates of improvement). If I turn my back on that reality, I feel that it would be turning my back on those families. They need to be acknowledged, understood, and helped. Telling them everything might turn out fine, doesn\u2019t help them manage dangerous behaviours or teach their child to talk or to be social. Focusing only on those who have come through (or never had) the worst of it, shifts the focus from those most in need. If autism help was a zero-sum game \u2013 if there was only so much help to go around \u2013 I would always put the majority of it into helping the most severely affected. I don\u2019t personally see autism help (funding, research, attention, services) as a zero-sum game, but I know many do, and so I understand why they get so upset when their harsh realities are painted over by stories that make autism seem benign or mere difference; because it detracts from and undercuts those who most need that help. So that\u2019s the first reason that I won\u2019t forget the horror; because I think it does a disservice to those still living it. The second reason I will not forget, is because I never want to go through it again. I am scared of having another child because the child might be autistic, and I barely made it through the first autistic child. Even with everything I\u2019ve learnt \u2013 with everything I now know about autism and how to handle an autistic child \u2013 I personally wouldn\u2019t do it again. It\u2019s like a dark hole I\u2019ve almost crawled out of, and someone asking whether I\u2019d like to hop back in again, not knowing how deep it might be the next time, or whether I\u2019d ever get out again. We took that risk with our second child, and I\u2019m glad we did. Raising him has been a world of smiles and laughter and relative ease, and his existence has enhanced the life of my first-born too (and a child with very mild autism might have been much the same). I would raise many children like my second son if I had such guarantees. But there are no guarantees, and statistics say we\u2019re at a fairly high risk of having another autistic child, of unknown severity of course. I will not be throwing that dice again. That, by the way, does  not  mean I would abort a child if there was some magical way to tell if it was going to be autistic. It also does  not  mean that I would un-wish the existence of my son, or any other autistic individual. Anyone who jumps to such conclusions is making an unwarranted and far too simplistic leap. I am saying only what I am saying; that I personally don\u2019t wish to risk having another autistic child, not that I wouldn\u2019t lovingly raise one if another autistic child came into my life. (Anyone who claims that my views equate to aborting or eradicating all autistic people, is being alarmist, ridiculous and distorting my words and concerns; I know that sadly won\u2019t stop people making such claims though. Many people choose to only have one child because they found the first too hard to care for, that doesn\u2019t mean they hate all children nor wish they hadn\u2019t had one at all. Many people don\u2019t want to have any more daughters / sons because of bad experiences with the first lot, that doesn\u2019t make them sexist either.) So that is my second reason for not forgetting the horror; because I need to remember that I couldn\u2019t face going through that all again. The fact that I don\u2019t think I could cope with it, isn\u2019t just about me either; I am the mother in this family \u2013 my mental and physical health impacts on the whole family, including my two current children. The third and final reason I\u2019m sharing for why I won\u2019t forget, is that I need to remember how far my son has come. Some days, his autism makes him so very hard to manage. It is mentally and physically exhausting, and can leave him unhappy and confused as he tries to navigate this world. Some days I worry so much for his future \u2013 his education, relationships, employment \u2013 that it\u2019s like a dark cloud tinting everything I see and think about. But I remind myself not to forget how bad it once was because (a) it could have been so much worse than it is right now if he hadn\u2019t improved, and (b) if he continues to improve at even a fraction of the rate he has been, his future might turn out to be a good one. I try not to get too caught up in that hope, because I need to always respond to the child and the challenges that child has at this point in time; and hope can be distracting, frustrating and cruel. I just take each day and do my best with it; remembering how far we\u2019ve come already does help raise my spirits and put my son\u2019s current challenges in perspective. So that\u2019s my three reasons why I won\u2019t forget the horror, and why I won\u2019t soften that word \u201chorror\u201d either. It\u2019s important for people to know what families like mine went through. To realise that autism is hard going and those families and individuals need real help and not just pretty words. Though I feel like I walk between two autism worlds \u2013 in terms of experiences, hopes and attitudes \u2013 I will always keep a careful and understanding eye on the way autism can impact so negatively on so many lives; even as I look to the bright future that would be all the brighter with more acceptance and accommodation of autism. I do not see a contradiction there, I just see the diverse realities of living with autism. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/14853452@N00/376000264"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/why-i-refuse-to-forget-the-horror-of-autism-aka-between-two-autism-worlds/", "title": "Why I Refuse to Forget the Horror of Autism, aka, Between Two Autism\u00a0Worlds"},
{"date": "January 22, 2012", "body": "(Continued from  Part One ) Sesame Street happened. They were doing a lovely segment about the variations between families, which lead to a discussion between my son and I about his own family and extended family, and how we differ from other family combinations. Then he asked if anyone was the same, or everyone was different in the world. I told him everyone is different, even twins; no one has the exact same body and brain. And I realised a perfect moment had presented itself. I asked whether he wanted to see a new book about how everyone is different, and about his own special difference. This received an enthused \u201cyes\u201d. We went upstairs to sit on his bed to read his new book. My heart was pounding; I really felt the gravity of the moment. This was something I\u2019d been thinking about and worrying about for so long, and here it was, happening. He asked me to read it so I did. He had questions about various words (\u201cwhat does \u2018example\u2019 mean?\u201d), and wanted to tell me some things about the photos in his book, and then the magic word appeared in the text. \u201cAutism.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop to ask me what it meant, just let me keep reading. We got to the end of his book. He said he wanted to read it himself this time. I\u2019d aimed the reading level at where he currently is, so he coped quite well with most of the text. And then he reached the word \u201cautism\u201d and paused just a while, before reading it as \u201cawesome.\u201d Which I thought was just so sweet and perfect. I corrected him, he kept going, but this time he stopped to ask lots of questions about what the book was telling him. He was soaking in the messages of the book to such an extent that he started showing me how he was everything the book said he was. (This reinforced for me that I made the right decision to avoid the books which gave off the wrong information or tone about autism, as it affects my son.) For example, the book told him he has a wonderful memory and great eye for detail, so he started commenting extensively about details in the photos and what he remembered about what was happening at those times. The book told him that in some ways his brain works better than other people who don\u2019t have autism, so he asked me if his brain is better than mine. I told him it was in some ways; this pleased him mightily. He\u2019s been talking a lot lately about how he will be taller and stronger than me when he\u2019s a man, and he was quite happy to add \u201cbetter brain in some ways\u201d to that list of superiorities. In fact, he took that so much to heart, that after he\u2019d read the book he took it upon himself to actively teach me how to draw a clock. He showed me, then told me to practice it too. This made him very happy. There was even a rather condescending tone to his voice as he talked me through it! At that point it did cross my mind that maybe I pushed the \u201cyou\u2019re great\u201d bit too much of autism. But the book did gently explain the extra difficulties he faces, and he did spend time also talking about those challenges mentioned in the book (his difficulty with language and tendency towards repetition in particular), so I think it was even-handed and realistic. And if he walks away with a focus on his strengths and a more positive self-identity, then that is even better that I\u2019d hoped for. I think it\u2019s fair to call the whole discussion and book, a success. After that the day continued as normal, as I\u2019d so hoped it would. He was particularly well-behaved the rest of the day, and otherwise his usual awesome self. Just more self-aware now I guess, which is a wonderful thought. I gave him the words and some of the answers to questions that were going unsaid, but clearly surfacing in his mind and in various discussions. Sometimes you know there\u2019s something you need to know, but don\u2019t know how to ask about it; that\u2019s the point I believe my son had reached. Finding the right words is even harder for someone with autism, so he needed me to help him along that path. Autism was part of him yesterday, and will be tomorrow, from the day he was born to the day he dies. Knowing there\u2019s a word for it doesn\u2019t change who he is; it just aides better understanding for him, of himself and of others. Now that that first conversation about autism is out-of-the-way, I am better equipped for dealing with future discussions, which can now arise more naturally. If something happens in his life related to his autism (as it will), we can address it without having to start from scratch; the words and ideas are already there to build on. I particularly like that I controlled the way in which he first meaningfully encountered the word; that he didn\u2019t hear it used as a slur or an attack on him by some bully in a\u00a0 playground or a thoughtless adult, and then have to ask me to explain it. Autism is a large part of who he is and what he does and how he thinks; it would have been quite horrible if someone else had originally shaped it as something to be ashamed of, that I\u2019d then had to counter or undo if I could. I know there will be times when people will try to hurt him via his diagnosis, but he will have a positive and honest foundation from which to stand tall. This whole experience has solidified for me the difference between how we as parents needs-must approach and respond to autism, compared to how our autistic children need to be able to see it. As parents, we must be prepared to see and work with the very worst that comes with autism, we can\u2019t let ourselves be complacent about our children\u2019s abilities and well-being. We challenge them, help them, guide them, as all parents must. But our children are going to have a harder time of meeting those challenges if they see themselves as doomed or lesser beings; it is also our duty to make sure they grow up loving and accepting themselves. That doesn\u2019t mean lying to them or not extending them, it means being honest but also reassuring; letting them know there\u2019s a lot of work ahead of them but that it can be done and they won\u2019t have to do it alone. So yes, my son has autism, a truth that he needed to be told. He also has awesome, a truth that he lives and that he needs to know I see in him too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/the-day-i-told-him-he-has-awesome-part-two-revelations/", "title": "The day I told him he has \u201cawesome.\u201d Part Two:\u00a0Revelations."},
{"date": "March 19, 2012", "body": "The word \u201cnormal\u201d gets a bad rap these days. The idea of normalcy is attacked and undermined with the aim of leaving it toothless; supposedly also then removing the sting in the tail of identifying someone as \u201cabnormal\u201d and (thereby) worthy of being singled out as \u201cwrong\u201d or to be ostracised from general society. However, just because \u201cnormal\u201d is a relative, contextual (and sometimes elusive) concept, doesn\u2019t mean it lacks importance or function (any more than the word \u201cbig\u201d lacks function and meaning). My son is abnormal when compared to other children the same age as him, which is helpful in identifying that he needs more support and a different approach than the average child, but it doesn\u2019t tell me much until I find  his  normal; his normal is autism. Once I found his normal \u2013 the parameters within which his behaviour and abilities made sense and were even predictable \u2013 I also found meaningful guidance for myself dealing with him, and for helping him to find happiness and be able to make personal progress. Beyond that I also had to ascertain his even more specific normal; what is normal for my son  as an individual : Once you know someone well enough to say \u201cthis behaviour is normal for him\u201d or \u201cthis behaviour is completely abnormal\u201d again you have a reference point for figuring out whether what you\u2019re observing requires further exploration, explanation and help, or whether is nothing new or of particular concern. Even within this more conceptualised approach, \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 for autism and for my son \u2013 clearly still has wide and fuzzy edges. But that doesn\u2019t stop us being able to say \u201cthis is well outside the bounds of normal for X\u201d or \u201cthis is on the edges of normal\u201d and thereby deciding how (and whether to) proceed with addressing the issue we have noticed. The real problems arise \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 when we step beyond descriptive use of normal, into normative use. That is, when we go beyond \u201cthis is the way it is for most people\u201d to \u201cthis is the way it should be, or the only way it should be:\u201d When normal is used as \u201cgood\u201d and abnormal is used as synonym for \u201cbad.\u201d Again, context matters; it\u2019s true that it is \u201cbad\u201d \u2013 or harder \u2013 to live in a society structured for the normal majority, so that we might meaningfully say \u201ccondition X is a bad thing\u201d in this way. But to go further and say \u201cpeople who have condition X are bad and unwanted\u201d is a further and dangerous progression from the contextual observation. I want to be clear that I am not equating all struggles with disability (as an instance of \u201cabnormal\u201d) with societal attitudes and barriers; I am of the view that disability is identifiable objectively within the body as well (I\u2019ve previously  written more extensively on the social model of disability  for those interested in that point). Indeed, I don\u2019t think we should be afraid of saying \u201cthis is a notably abnormal body medically or physically\u201d; again, it is when people go further to add or imply \u201cand therefore it is bad or shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d that we should be more wary and concerned. Yes, body and mind abnormality can be objectively disadvantageous \u2013  beyond  just society and attitude issues \u2013 but it is what we do or think about that abnormality which is important; the mere recognition and identification of an abnormality, is not in itself evil or wrong. The upshot of all this: The word and concept of normal, is not the enemy. My son is generally thought of as \u201cabnormal,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s lesser or unwanted or doesn\u2019t belong in society. It just means he\u2019s significantly outside the usual functioning of other children his age, and of people other ages too; he\u2019s notably and importantly different. Calling him normal, or trying to redefine normal, wouldn\u2019t remove his differences or make those differences any less obvious to other people. He  is  normal in the autism world, and the world of disabilities more generally. And \u201cnormal\u201d for my son on an individual level, is a healthy, happy boy with an ever-brightening future ahead of him; his normal, is a beautiful thing. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/jvk/609245608/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/thoughts-on-being-your-normal/", "title": "Thoughts on Being Your\u00a0Normal"},
{"date": "March 9, 2012", "body": "There has been a lot of recent media attention and public debate over the barriers faced by parents attempting to enrol their special needs children at mainstream schools, here in New Zealand. The problem has been identified as primarily one of discriminatory and fearful attitudes on behalf of the mainstream schools. Issues of lack of funding and insufficient staff training and numbers to adequately support those students within the mainstream environment, have been treated as secondary issues. Much of the public discussion and media reports are being had without enough context to form meaningful and well-informed opinions; of course that doesn\u2019t stop those opinions being formed. It is easier to spot the missing information when your child is already part of the special education system, and when you personally know some of the situations being discussed in the media. One of the vital pieces of information being left out is whether the children at issue qualify for attendance (and full funding) at a special needs school. Most of the public cases under discussion are ones where the child  does  qualify because they have high needs, but the parent has  chosen  to pursue mainstream education instead. But the story gets presented and discussed as one about the child having no access to public education at all, and the public gets in an understandable uproar about the child being denied an education. These discussions are frequently accompanied by erroneous claims in comment sections (whether on facebook or in discussions below news pieces, or on forums like trademe) that the government has shut down \u2013 or is planning to shut down \u2013 all special needs schools to save money, and this is why we\u2019re facing this crisis of trying to fit special needs students into mainstream schools. This is said despite the fact that the government has recently reviewed the existence of special needs schools and made the active decision to continue to support them and increase special needs funding. Another large and almost always unmentioned detail \u2013 which if acknowledged would have a significant impact on discussions that otherwise follow \u2013 is that the cases at issue are ones where the student could  conceivably  attend either a special needs school or a mainstream school (with adequate support of course). There are though special needs students who comfortably fit within the mainstream setting (and in fact have  no option  to attend a public special needs school since they\u2019re not considered high needs enough to qualify). And there are children with such intensely high levels of need that the chance of them fitting within a mainstream setting is never seriously considered by their parents or specialists, because they function at such a minimal level or (for example) pose a significant danger to themselves and others that it would be counterproductive to put them alongside their \u201cpeers\u201d (\u201cpeers\u201d in age only, that word can be highly misleading in this discussion). Despite these diverse groupings of special needs children, the children with arguably the most options \u2013 ie the ones who have the funding to attend a special needs school but choose a mainstream instead, considering that a viable option \u2013 are the ones who are referred to and form the centre of the discussion that flows on to wider considerations. By which I mean, the discussion about whether special schools should exist at all, and the attitudes and (non)accepting nature of schools, is judged in the media and in the current public eye, on what is happening to these children in the \u201cmiddle\u201d: calls for all special schools to be shut down, or claims that mainstream schools are refusing to take on special needs students, are based on a specific subset of special needs children. It is this middle group \u2013 those who could conceivably fit into mainstream or special schools \u2013 who are more likely to face genuine uncertainty from schools as to whether they can cope with the child\u2019s needs. So it\u2019s quite understandable this sub-group is the one we\u2019ll hear about the most in such news pieces and cases. It is  because  these are borderline / middle subset cases, that they are difficult for the school to make a determination about whether the child really would be best educated at the mainstream school; whether they really do have the training, staff and resources to cope in a way that will be best for the individual child. These are hard cases, which is always cause problems, because the answers aren\u2019t obvious; \u201c hard cases make bad law \u201c. I consider it somewhat unfair and distorting to use genuinely hard cases, as evidence that mainstream schools are anti special needs students. Which brings me to the evident demonization of the school teachers and administrative staff; the people put in the position of making a decision about whether the student is best suited to their particular learning environment. The school staff have to balance the interests of all students, unlike the parent who is understandably focused on their own child (and there is nothing inhuman, unexpected or unfair about that parental focus). This balancing act can and has lead to thoughtless and cold statements like \u201cother parents would withdraw their child if we accepted your child\u201d. As a parent of a special needs child, if I was told this, my response would be outrage that children who could attend any normal school without difficulty, are being prioritized over my own, and that fear and ignorance on behalf of those other parents is valued over whatever the reality may turn out to be. I would be astounded by the lack of empathy in such a reply, and I would be left with the impression that my child was considered undesirable and not worth the effort. So of course I understand parental \u2013 and public \u2013 outrage at such responses by schools. However, the school which made such a statement \u2013 and other schools which are charged with similarly turning away special needs students on the basis of fear and ignorance \u2013 have defended themselves by pointing out that this was not  the  reason for turning down the enrolment; that the real problems they face are ones of funding or other administrative issues (such as full rolls for the year). (Either way though, I suggest that it is a poorly thought-out response to any parent to say other parents wouldn\u2019t want the child in the same classroom as their precious darlings; that does deserve some condemnation.) I think this fear from other parents about having their children in the same class as a high needs student, is an important issue; I have no doubt from personal experience with my son and from reading public forums, that my generation needs a lesson in the rights of the disabled to be involved in society and to be treated like human beings. While we\u2019ve come a long way with race relations and gender relations as a society, we seem to have a long way to go towards meaningful understanding about disability rights; for example, people know it\u2019s unacceptable and why it\u2019s unacceptable to use racial or gender slurs, but disability related slurs are still widely used without awareness or public condemnation. However, some organisations are (arguably) a bit extreme or unrealistic in their highly \u201coptimistic\u201d views about the disabled, which is a point I want to address now: Underpinning the current mainstreaming controversies is an ideology that separating out special needs children from other children, is a form of segregation, and that mainstreaming special needs children is always in their and society\u2019s best interests.\u00a0 Often built into this is a covert (or overt) attack on the very existence of special needs schools; viewing them as dumping grounds or as providing a substandard education. The national charity IHC which holds this view of special schools as a form of segregation \u2013 and expressly states it wants special needs schools shut down \u2013 has been actively pushing these stories into the public eye here for years. This is a topic I am passionate about, and have written on many aspects of it previously. If you believe all special needs schools should be abolished, or think the education provided by them is inevitably worse than that found at mainstream schools, then I would strongly encourage you to click-through on my previous posts which I\u2019ll list at the end of this post, and see if I can\u2019t change your mind. I\u2019d encourage you to point out why you disagree with my conclusions. As a brief introduction to what you\u2019ll find in those posts, I argue why it\u2019s not segregation to differently educate children with learning difficulties, I discuss the importance of maintaining parental choice about education options, and I address many of the myths and contradictory reasoning used to reach the view that special needs schools should be eradicated. I want to be clear that I fully support the aims of parents who have done their research and genuinely believe the local mainstream school is the  best  option for their child, and I absolutely sympathise with the parents who have met rude, ignorant and fearful barriers to attaining that access. I am in no doubt that some schools are breaching the government-provided rights of some students to attend their local schools on the grounds of the child\u2019s disability, and that some schools are placing far too much weight on the views and interests of other students to the real detriment of the neediest students. But I think that these stories and the discussions that flow from them, need to be kept in context, and that the errors and lacks of information presented in these stories are concerning and result in distorted and unhelpful views being formed in the public; views that endanger the existence of the special schooling many parents actively seek because it is the best option for their child\u2019s wellbeing, happiness and education (parents like me). To summarise my concerns over the current controversy in New Zealand: I think the hard cases are being erroneously presented as the norm, I believe the generalisations drawn from these cases are distorting and damaging; I believe schools are being demonized without enough focus on the challenges they face for getting adequate resources to adequately care for these children, and without enough focus being placed on the role played by the ignorance and fear of other parents; and I think the underlying ideology (sometimes overt) against the very existence of special needs school, is highly questionable and can have serious and unwanted consequences for high needs children. I think the discussions about mainstreaming special needs children are important, but that the way those discussions are currently being had, are concerning. *** My previous posts relevant to this discussion : \n \u201c A Right to the Wrong Education? \u201c \n \u201c Socialization as a reason to mainstream special needs children. \u201c \n \u201c Children are all on a spectrum \u2013 an argument for mainstream schooling. \u201c \n \u201cCommentary on the Campbell Live story about mainstreaming special needs kids .\u201d \n \u201c Fight, Move, Adapt?

{"date": "March 13, 2012", "body": "After my eldest son\u2019s autism diagnosis, he was placed on a waiting list for various government provided services, including speech therapy. Getting past all the gatekeepers to an actual speech therapist who is there to help my child, was a long drawn-out process that kept us as parents largely in the dark. We had to go through our local doctor, referred on to the developmental pediatrician, then referred on to someone whose job is was to screen his speech again (though we weren\u2019t told this was what she was doing, we thought she was his actual speech therapist), to finally seeing a speech therapist who was there to help our son. The actual speech therapist told us we should have never been referred to a third screening; our son\u2019s diagnosis and speech clearly always qualified him for help. At the time I was just so grateful to finally be getting the help he needed, that I didn\u2019t hold onto any anger about being forced to jump through more un-necessary hoops and wait longer because of it, though by all rights I could have complained about the extra bother and wait associated with it.  But now they\u2019re messing with my second-born too, and the anger is back. My second-born has a speech delay; he doesn\u2019t talk as much or as well as other children his age, and the difference is quite obvious. It\u2019s not an extreme concern for us at this point; we think (hope) he\u2019ll be OK ultimately. But because of the family history and for peace of mind, we thought it best to see someone who could decide whether he is likely to need speech therapy. So I call Plunket and they agree I should meet with them, then I go to a Plunket nurse with my son and she agrees there\u2019s reason for concern and refers him onto the government speech therapy service for proper assessment and eventual help if need-be. Weeks go by, no letter arrives to confirm the referral has been received (I know the system well enough to know the paperwork involved is copious and we should have got a letter or two by now). Then comes the phone call from another gatekeeper. The caller identifies that she is from \u201cGroup Special Education\u201d (the government body responsible for special education needs for very young children). She tells me she needs to ask some questions about my son\u2019s speech development. I\u2019m thinking this is a bit odd, I\u2019ve already been screened twice (once during a phone call to see if Plunket thought it was worth setting up a meeting to discuss his speech delay, and once at Plunket itself with the nurse who agreed there was reason for concern); I was expecting any extra screening to happen in person with an actual speech therapist. So the lady on the phone asks me some more questions, which are largely repetition of what I\u2019ve already told everyone before her. But she also asks something which I consider irrelevant and really none of her business: \u201cwhy don\u2019t I send him to daycare?\u201d I tell her I do take him to playgroups, and what has happened at those playgroups, but she persists, with why don\u2019t I send him to daycare..? I pause thinking what is going on here, why is she asking me this? I don\u2019t send him to daycare because I chose to be a full-time mum to him instead of handing him over regularly to paid strangers, and because the studies I have read say there\u2019s no particular benefit to daycare before the age of three (in fact it can be detrimental). He sees extended family a lot, and plays with other children above and below his age, and is a highly sociable and happy child, so what\u2019s daycare got to do with it? But I don\u2019t voice all this, I just pause and say \u201che\u2019s just two!\u201d She doesn\u2019t bother to explain the daycare reference, and I\u2019m left with the clear impression that she\u2019s blaming my parenting decisions for his arguable speech delay. She doesn\u2019t bother to ask if I read to him and sing to him and deliberately use speech therapy tactics with him that I learnt from my first-born\u2019s speech therapist (all of which I do every day). She pauses for a while, like she\u2019s thinking something through, but I still have no idea why she\u2019s calling because she hasn\u2019t told me what the purpose of the call is in relation to him getting assessed. Why am I going through this all again, and why hadn\u2019t I received a letter confirming the referral? Finally she tells me that she\u2019s just made the decision that she will refer on his referral. If she\u2019s told me up-front at the start of the (highly confrontational and confusing) phone call, that she was deciding whether to refer on the referral, I would have given her the extra information that wasn\u2019t on the referral form but was discussed in person with the Plunket nurse; like the family history and the lack of independently-formed sentences. So now that she\u2019s finally told me the purpose of the call, I give her what extra information I can think of off the top of my head to make sure she won\u2019t change her precious mind, and she again (seemingly reluctantly) states that she\u2019ll refer it on. All this, just to access someone who can actually decide whether my son even  needs  speech therapy. Information is not passed on from one organisation to the next, second-guessing of the decisions of other organisations and in the process slowing down access to assessment and services, all adding quite un-necessary to the parents\u2019 stress and the child\u2019s waiting time. I understand that they need gatekeepers; that many parents worry about their child\u2019s speech and the government service providers have to figure out who actually needs services and how soon. But the layers of bureaucracy, and the lack of open communication between various agencies and with the parents, is ridiculous and avoidable. If I\u2019d gone private instead of public, I could have seen a speech therapist straight away; not gone through all these gatekeepers. Such a speech therapist could have just told me \u201chey, your son is fine, no need to worry, come back if he hasn\u2019t done X by age Y\u201d and we\u2019d all have got on with our lives. Or we\u2019d figure out what might be wrong and how to address it as early as possible to limit the impact on his further development. The reason we go public \u2013 besides saving money which of course matters \u2013 is because going through the public system from the start makes it a lot easier to access any related services and help further down the line that he may need; once you\u2019re \u201cin the system\u201d things are a lot easier and a heck of a lot cheaper. I don\u2019t see the point though of running a public service in a way that erects barriers to even getting assessed after a problem is identified. I could understand priotising services after assessment has confirmed if there is an obective problem and how severe it is, but barriers to even seeing a speech therapist to do that assessment when both parents and an organisation like Plunket has twice expressed concern, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Any money saved on therapists by not letting through the more questionable cases, is surely wasted many times over on having all these other publically paid, self-important, arrogant, ignorant gatekeepers. My husband wants me to lay a complaint about the rudeness and un-necessariness of the call I received, but again I find myself anxious about rocking the boat; just been pathetically grateful that we\u2019re on a waiting list and will get to see a specialist to determine what \u2013 if anything \u2013 is going on with my son. I had a meeting with my eldest\u2019s head teacher today to discuss his own IEP, and my concern\u2019s about my youngest\u2019s speech came up in passing. Her response was to congratulate me for being so aware, for picking up on the potential issue so early, and for doing something about it.  This  should be the attitude from those who are supposedly there to help you, rather than the barriers and belittling that seems to come part-and-parcel with the government\u2019s current approach to children with (potential or confirmed) special needs, and their parents. I went through all this rubbish with my first-born, even when the problems were far more obvious and severe, I\u2019d hoped access to services and had improved in the intervening years. But change requires more than hope, so maybe my husband is right; a little boat-rocking is in order. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/orb9220/6911648881/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/speech-therapy-gatekeepers/", "title": "Speech Therapy Gatekeepers"},
{"date": "February 12, 2012", "body": "Adam Feinsteins book,  \u201cA History of Autism: Conversations with the Pioneers\u201d , is reminiscent of the better known book of two years prior,  \u201cUnstrange Minds\u201d by Roy Richard Grinker . (Feinstein\u2019s book was published in 2010, Grinker\u2019s in 2008.) Both books consider the progress of autism from its \u201cdiscovery,\u201d to the modern-day perspectives; both consider the changes in the diagnostic categories; and look at differences in the response to autism from different cultures and societies. But the information, focus and perspective is different enough that both these books have a lot to teach people about the nature of autism, particularly about how understanding the emergence of \u201cautism\u201d as a label sheds light on modern attitudes and approaches to the condition. Feinstein\u2019s book is valuable for its historical explanation of the changing diagnostic criteria for autism, which is particularly relevant and current with the DSM-5 criteria changes looming. He even shares information about some of those DSM-5 key changes, and has some interesting dialogues with some of the key figures involved in the formation of past and present diagnostic manuals. The book talks as much about Aspergers as it does about \u201cclassic autism\u201d, and provides some interesting insights on the differences, similarities and possible future relationship of the two conditions. Feinstein also discusses the emergence of charities and organisations set up across the world to help those with autism and their families, and relates how the emergence and focus of those groups reflects different government and cultural attitudes towards autism. Through-out the book he shares the changing scientific theories and interviews with the personalities behind the science (which is already a little dated now in 2012). He has made the effort to track down key players in the field of autism from through-out history, so that the book is very much a who\u2019s-who (including photos giving faces to the names). But the part that I found most intriguing, and that was largely new and eye-opening for me, was how much and in what ways Nazi Germany impacted on the history of autism. In particular, it affected those involved with the origins of autism, views of their research, and the early treatments of autism. For example, the popularity of the psychoanalytical approach towards autism \u2013 which still remains strong in some pockets of the modern world \u2013 can in part be understood as a reaction against the eugenics of Nazi Germany: It was seen as far more savory to blame the coldness and incompetence of parents (especially mothers) for their child\u2019s condition (therefore making autism avoidable and treatable), than to concede to the notion of the predetermined, unchangeable, irredeemable subnormality that the Nazi culture wanted to eradicate from humanity. Here, Bettelheim makes his appearance; a man who is both threatening, and ironically perverse. I was appalled by the rather unscientific (and frequently absurd) psychoanalytic approach to autism, and the associated cruel practices, such as \u201cparentectomies\u201d and \u201cpacking\u201d, supported by people like Bettelheim; yet Feinstein helped me to sympathetically understand how such a man and personality was formed. Bettelheim was himself a victim of Nazi Germany, and was sympathetically received as a man who intimately understood the suffering of the withdrawn and scared autistics, and was passionate about protecting them from their mothers. Of course, the result of this passion would be further preventable suffering; for mothers and their autistic children. I find it somewhat amazing that after years of reading about and discussing autism, it wasn\u2019t until I picked up this book that I came to understand the links between Nazi Germany and the history of autism: It is not just an interesting piece of history that ran alongside the emergence of autism; it is part of the story of autism. I found the writing of the book itself somewhat jilted or unpolished, and awkwardly put together in places; like Feinstein didn\u2019t know quite how to stay on top of all the people he interviewed and researched, and struggled to balance the conflicting accounts of personalities alongside a historical account of autism. But the insights and rather remarkable amount of research that has gone into the book, makes it a valuable resource, that I found both enlightening and educational. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/History-of-Autism-Adam-Feinstein/9781405186537?cf=3&rid=673143735&i=1&keywords=a+history+of+autism"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/review-of-adam-feinsteins-a-history-of-autism-conversations-with-the-pioneers/", "title": "Review of Adam Feinstein\u2019s \u201cA History of Autism: Conversations with the\u00a0Pioneers\u201d"},
{"date": "February 24, 2012", "body": "I was one of those super-mums-to-be who promised herself that she wouldn\u2019t complain about the endless questions of childhood. Instead I would embrace the opportunity to teach my child. This determination became even more resolute when I was told my son\u2019s autism would have a serious impact on his language abilities; if he ever developed language to the point that he could ask me questions at all \u2013 form meaningful sentences and use them to seek knowledge \u2013 I would never let myself take such a joyous ability for granted. And I don\u2019t. I answer his questions, and I am ever glad he is capable of asking questions. But autism has a way of twisting \u201cnormal milestones\u201d \u2013 like the endless question-asking of childhood \u2013 into something so utterly different and challenging. My son\u2019s latest and growing obsession, is vehicles; specifically their logos and licenses. He wants to know the names attached to every logo he sees (Mazda, Toyota, Mercedes etc), but if he can\u2019t see the logo on a vehicle or we didn\u2019t see it in time to tell him what it was as we drive past, he\u2019ll get quite anxious about wanting us to turn the car around so he can get a second look at it. At times there is no visible logo \u2013 such as on many local buses and in a good many of his vehicle books \u2013 which leads to lots of questions about what the logo is and why it\u2019s been removed. He also wants to know if Hino makes cars as well as trucks, does Mazda make cement mixers, etc. He wants to know how many licenses (learners, restricted, full, truck, heavy truck, passenger carrier etc) are required for each kind of vehicle; how long it takes to get each type of license; how old he has to be to get each stage of license. If it was just the unusual questioning, I could handle it (Google gets a good work out in this house). But it\u2019s not that simple. Hardly any question gets asked once. He\u2019ll ask the exact same question time after time, even when he\u2019s been given a full and clear answer; like he\u2019s forgotten that he asked or what the answer was, moments after he\u2019s been given it. And woe if we don\u2019t know the answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is not an acceptable reply; not only will he keep asking but he will get progressively more upset each time he asks and doesn\u2019t get a full reply. He often counters with a pleading and anxious \u201cyou can know, you can know!\u201d There are still times we can\u2019t quite decipher what he is actually asking because of his odd sentence structure and choice of words. Sometimes he can\u2019t form the sentence he wants or remember the question he was going to ask, which makes him considerably upset as he tries to convey both the question itself and the fact that he can\u2019t get it out. He\u2019ll even ask us to ask his question for him \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s my question?\u201d \u2013 and get upset that we don\u2019t know his question before he\u2019s even said it aloud. We do our best to answer the endless, repetitive questions and to deal kindly and patiently with the consequences of not being able to quite understand or reply to his queries. Both my husband and I have learnt a large amount now about the New Zealand licensing scheme for vehicles we\u2019d never contemplated before, we know most vehicle logos and can even spot some of the differences in earlier versus later model logos, we\u2019ve learnt some of the history of vehicle companies so we are better equipped to answer questions about who makes what, and so on. I\u2019ve had plenty of experience dealing with the \u201cnormal\u201d questions from his same-age peers; the endless questions that I often hear normal parents complain about. Those questions I can understand and answer; questions that would leave me feeling like the knowledgeable and helpful parent I thought I would be when it came to this stage of his childhood. And if the child doesn\u2019t get an answer, they don\u2019t cry and have an anxiety response. And when they get an answer, they don\u2019t ask the exact same question straight away, or next time I see them. Instead of passing on what I know to my son, I\u2019ve had to change and grow my knowledge in order to pass along completely new information about things I never had to know and got by just fine without knowing all my life. I\u2019m up to that challenge; in some ways it\u2019s a wonderful challenge. So this isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d childhood questioning per se, but it is normal in the autism-parenting world, where we strategize to lower anxiety responses and address verbal language deficits, and become experts alongside our children in such un-noticed world-details as logos and licenses. A world where the very act of forming sentences and actively seeking knowledge about the world, is not the stuff of parental complaints, but the stuff of long-fought and hard-won celebration. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/of-logos-licenses-and-the-endless-questions-of-childhood/", "title": "Of Logos, Licenses, and the Endless Questions of\u00a0Childhood"},
{"date": "March 20, 2012", "body": "\u201cPassing\u201d in the autism world, is a word typically used to discuss the experience of an autistic person being expected or being successful in the endeavour to present themself as \u201cnormal\u201d (or as \u201cneurotypical\u201d if you prefer). It is a mindful and frequently draining task that can leave the autistic person worse off than if they\u2019d just \u201cbeen themselves.\u201d (I\u2019ll leave the wonderful Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg to expand on this important point in her thought-provoking post \u201c On Passing, Overcompensating, and Disability .\u201d) Yet \u201cpassing\u201d was the word that came immediately to mind in relation to my clearly-autistic son during a recent conversation. I was meeting up with a family friend who happens to be a judge on special needs education cases in the USA. She knew my son was autistic, but when she met him she said to me \u201che must be high-functioning.\u201d I was somewhat stunned; I don\u2019t think of my son as a high-functioning autistic: When he was diagnosed he was really quite severe. After years of therapy and interventions he has come an amazingly long way in his development. He no longer self-harms, he\u2019s no longer violent to others and property, he can now speak in sentences and was finally toilet trained at four and a half. He attends a special needs school, but it has recently been decided to trial him in some mainstream classes because he is doing so well in a couple of topics, and his behaviour has advanced so beautifully. But because of his severe beginnings, and because I\u2019m so used to working so hard with him for so many years, I\u2019ve been a little blinded perhaps to how he now appears to others. I know his social and communication challenges will be more obvious when he enters dreaded puberty \u2013 when these things begin to \u201cmatter more\u201d (to his peers and to general public expectations; people tend to be more \u201cforgiving\u201d with young children\u2019s oddities) \u2013 but as of this point in his life, it appears that to some people he can \u201cpass\u201d as high-functioning. I don\u2019t just use the word \u201cpassing\u201d because of how I personally think (and have thought) of him; I also mean that he works extra hard to appear the way that he does to appear apparently \u201chigh-functioning\u201d. He works hard to control his anxieties and to express himself meaningfully. He actively works on his social skills too; watching others and trying out what they do and then using our guidance as to whether it is appropriate or not. What might look like high-functioning autism in any other person (for example, someone who is simply being themself), is actually a product of amazing levels of hard work for my son. I suppose for some people this is simply an improvement in his autism, and yes that\u2019s obviously a large part of what is going on here. But I think to simply refer to it as an \u201cimprovement\u201d (or lessening of severity of his autism) is to discount and not realise how much work he still puts in daily, hourly, into what others see when they look at and talk to him. I want to be very clear that this \u201cpassing\u201d (or more precisely, passing plus improvement) is not a result of us forcing our son to be someone he is not. He is a much happier person now than when he was severely autistic, he communicates his own mind, and is an incredibly loving (and loved) little boy. All we\u2019ve done is equipped him to express his own voice, and enabled him to find more independence in his world (such as dressing, feeding, and toileting himself, rather than the stationary and repetitive behaviours that once sat in the way of even the simplest development. We have not \u201cwiped out\u201d his stims before someone accuses me of that \u2013 he still flaps and happy-dances, expressing himself as comes naturally \u2013 but we have \u201climited\u201d them so they no longer consume such extraordinary amounts of his time and attention.) That\u2019s the problem with the word \u201cpassing\u201d in this rhetoric in some ways; it incorporates an inherently negative view of what the person becomes (\u201cother\u201d) when to a certain extent what has happened is objective improvements in the person\u2019s abilities and life skills. Perhaps there is (or needs to be) a better word for conveying that hard and unseen work is going on with the individual \u2013 work the rest of us typically don\u2019t engage in or need to engage in \u2013 that needs to be known to really appreciate the achievements and get a deeper understanding of the individual. Perhaps what we need is both the word \u201cpassing\u201d (to capture the harsh reality many autistics live) alongside a more celebratory word for the effort autistic\u2019s make in the face of very real and under-acknowledged challenges. So yes, I guess at some level, in a certain way, my son is now \u201cpassing\u201d for a high-functioning autistic; because of how much work he puts into what he currently appears to be. But that word doesn\u2019t truly capture the wonderful achievement and amazing work that also deserve celebration and recognition. I\u2019m glad some people can now think of him as \u201chigh-functioning\u201d but it still matters to me that they realise what it took to get here and how far we still have to go, in the positive sense of opening doors that once looked forever closed to him. No matter what words you use to convey these realities, the underlying truth remains the same: My son has amazed me, my son  is  amazing. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2012/02/12/on-passing-overcompensating-and-disability/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/exfordy/128576390/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/passing-for-a-high-functioning-autistic-a-cause-for-celebration/", "title": "Passing for A High-Functioning Autistic; A Cause for\u00a0Celebration..?"},
{"date": "December 16, 2011", "body": "I\u2019m increasingly encountering reference to the Social Model of Disability, in autism rhetoric. It is most strongly associated with the Neurodiversity movement, and related groups (like ASAN). Without fail, every time I have seen the Social Model of Disability being used to discuss autism, I have seen quick and concerned responses from others who are outraged that something as serious and real (as opposed to mild or entirely socially constructed) as autism, could be referenced and re-framed in this way. Image via Wikipedia In this post I am going to try to make sense of those concerns, where they come from, and whether they are well-placed. First some introductory points about the Model itself. The Social Model of Disability can be seen as a response to the more individualised and \u201cnormative\u201d Medical Model of Disability. The Social Model shifts the focus from reshaping the impaired individual, to reshaping society (in terms of things like society\u2019s response, attitudes and accommodation of those impaired persons). It defines disability in reference to how much society is accommodating the affected individuals, rather than as something defined by the condition the person has. It does not  necessarily  come hand-in-hand with a complete reframing of the impairment carried by the individual, by which I mean, you can still identify an objective and serious impairment held by the individual, yet use a Social Model approach to what to do about it and how to talk about it. It  may do  though; various movements will and do deny existing definitions \u2013 and even existence \u2013 of the impairments that lead to disability, completely denying current terms and groupings and diagnostic criteria used to identify the conditions affecting people in the first place. This line of thinking will also challenge uses of the terms like \u201cimpairment\u201d at all, choosing instead to completely redefine the condition as one only created by societal attitudes towards these people as \u201cother\u201d and unwanted. Similarly, the Social Model of Disability doesn\u2019t  necessarily  come hand-in-hand with saying the only correct response to a challenged person is to alter society and everyone else rather than the individual themself (for example, they may say society must be more accommodating but also there must be medical and therapy interventions for the best of the affected individual). Again though, some do take that more extreme approach, saying that the affected individual should not have to change or be forced to change at all; that it is only society (everyone else) who must be expected to change, in attitudes and accommodation towards those seemingly affected by a disability. Basically, the Social Model of Disability then can be seen either as a guiding consideration that enhances our appreciation of the role society plays in the definition and actuality of disability, or it can be taken as a more extreme version that attacks the very definition of impairments (per se) and completely counters existing expectations that afflicted individuals do something to better fit into the world they exist in. In that first guise \u2013 as an enhanced consideration of the role society plays in making disability worse \u2013 there will not be much controversy, since it would be fair to say that most people understand that accommodation and better attitudes towards conditions like autism, can and do make a very real impact on how debilitating something like autism can be. But in this softer guise of the model, it doesn\u2019t tell us much we didn\u2019t already know, and isn\u2019t really a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d It is the more extreme version and uses of the model that raise hackles (and I will soon get to why that may be, particularly for autism). I think it is important though to recognise that not everyone who refers to the Social Model of Disability is conforming to this more extreme version, and are often using it to rather suggest a gentle paradigm shift  along-side  continuing medical definitions and interventions at the individual level. In order to understand why many in the autism community \u2013 most especially the daily carers of those with more severe forms of autism \u2013 take such exception to the more extreme Social Model of Disability, I think it is important to understand the rather common histories and daily struggles faced by these carers; pre-diagnosis, at the point of diagnosis and post-diagnosis. It is a common experience for parents of autistic children to go through months or years of being told there is nothing \u201cwrong with their child\u201d; that what they\u2019re worried about in their child is just a little slow development in their interests, abilities and speech. That better parenting or more socializing would fix the child right up. Eventually the child receives the diagnosis (which may take more than one professional, particularly if they see the wrong sort of professionals), and then those parents have to face family, friends and strangers sharing their wisdom that autism is not a real condition; it\u2019s just a fad diagnosis tailored to bad parents or poorly performing children. After diagnosis comes the eternal fight for services and funding that you\u2019re supposedly entitled to, so your child can get the help they need as soon as possible, to make the biggest difference possible for the brightest future possible. So when someone comes along after or during all these struggles and adds one more voice to the \u201cyour child\u2019s condition isn\u2019t really a disability\u201d barrage, it is completely understandable and predictable that there is going to be a backlash. When you fight to have your child\u2019s condition acknowledged in the first place by professionals and those around you, then fight to access services, to then have someone tell you \u201cit would all be OK if society just acted a bit differently towards your child\u201d or \u201cthere is nothing wrong with your child, just something wrong with society\u201d, it comes off like a threat to the very diagnosis and to the hard-won services. And in its more extreme form, that is exactly what the Social Model of Disability  is ; a threat. It tells you to get rid of the diagnosis category (in particular forms and places anyway), and to stop providing therapies to these people; to turn all funding and attention instead to the problems in society  instead . More than a threat though, it also comes across as (a) a complete and astounding denial of reality, and (b), an entirely unrealistic and arguably immoral response to impairment and disability. It comes across as a denial of reality because being around the most severely autistic (and disabled more generally) makes it impossible to say \u201cthere is nothing really wrong here.\u201d When basic self-care skills are missing to the extent that the person is dependent on others to change nappies well into their school years, or language is non-existent to the point that completely artificial modes of communication need to be intentionally (and often expensively) introduced in order to even figure out the simplest request, the notion that just changing society would make it all be fine, can appear ignorant and be quite upsetting. This would be a reaction to a more extreme form of the Social Model of Disability of course;  not  the form that accepts real and serious impairment (beyond the socially defined) and the need for interventions at the individual level. It can be seen as an unrealistic and immoral response too. Unrealistic, because making everyone else in society change when the alternative is working to help that individual find a way to function within society as it currently exists, is the far more mammoth task, and unlikely to help that individual here and now (though it may improve their life years or decades from now; there is arguably no reason social awareness can\u2019t be improved  along-side  an individual approach). The focus needs to be on helping the person now, in the world they find themselves in. Yes, lets work to make that a better world, but not at the expense of helping the person find their way in society as it currently works. The \u201cimmoral\u201d aspect of this approach comes in because the Social Model of Disability does not sit intuitively with highly valuing independence, which is a question of not just economics but a deeper set of (particular) moral beliefs. The moral concern here is that dependence on others \u2013 particularly on society at large (in terms of financial support, accommodation, positive discrimination etc) \u2013 is neither neutral nor something to be encouraged and celebrated. Rather, anything which encourages adults  towards  personal independence (self-care, financial independence, the ability to live one\u2019s own life the way one chooses, etc), is a positive value. However, it must be noted that the \u201coutcome\u201d (which is arguably unrealistic or impossible) of the ultimate implementation and realisation of the Social Model of Disability,  would  actually be heightened independence of those currently deemed disabled, since they would be more empowered to gain employment, and to move freely through society (both mentally and physically). Also, one could arguably question the meaning of independence in a society that taxes heavily already, where interdependence and dependence is already an oft-forgotten aspect of today\u2019s modern societies; that the Social Disability Model just seeks to extend that aspect. Again though, the increased independence arguably afforded by a Social Disability Model approach, can come along-side rather than instead of, an individualised approach to disability (where therapies and other interventions are also used to equip the affected individual). It is the \u201cinstead of\u201d approach \u2013 where some argue that therapies, definitions, and interventions at the individual level should be abandoned altogether \u2013 that upsets carers the most. From my own thoughts and understanding of these conflicts, a lot of confusion comes from inconsistent or unclear uses of the Social Model of Disability. At its extremes, the Model looks distorting, offensive, and dangerous to the wellbeing of the disabled. In its milder form it is a sort of paradigm shift \u2013 bringing attention to a different or rather additional way to view, understand and approach disability \u2013 and yet because it is milder, this form isn\u2019t as important or \u201cpowerful\u201d as its more extreme version (and is arguably redundant as a model per se, since it is downgraded to a \u201cconsideration\u201d or \u201cheightened awareness\u201d, that can sit (merely) along-side the existing supposed \u201cMedical Model\u201d). I do not have particular training or special insights (beyond Sociology being the Minor of my BA and my own experiences as a mother of an autistic child), that I brought into this post. This post is rather the result of thinking about others\u2019 reactions, and indeed my own reactions, to encountering the Social Model of Disability rhetoric, particularly in regards to the autism community. And so, as ever, I do openly encourage you to correct me if I\u2019ve got something wrong or misrepresented or misunderstood some aspect. But if I am incorrect, it is worth noting that those errors are made not just by me, and are symptoms of an oft poorly communicated rhetoric rather than ill-intent or lack of consideration on my behalf. *** Related and recommended reading: \n The Social Model of Disability: An Outdated Ideology?

{"date": "February 10, 2012", "body": "The New Zealand government is currently asking for submissions from the public, on the topic of vulnerable children. \u201cVulnerable children\u201d is a very broad grouping, which includes abused, neglected, and disadvantaged children; \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d includes children who are living in poverty, and living with disabilities. The charity Autism NZ is submitting their own response to what they consider to be the most relevant questions for autistic children, posed by this government \u201cGreen Paper on Vulnerable Children.\u201d You can find the Green Paper website, and all the questions they are seeking input on,  here . Autism NZ\u2019s response, can be found  here (pdf) . I found their own response was quite good and adequately covered a lot of my autism-relevant concerns, but I specifically wanted to add some thoughts to their answer to one particular question. Autism NZ has asked people to share their comments about their submission (information about how to do so can be found on Autism NZ\u2019s website,  here ). I have sent them my comments for their consideration, and thought I might as well share them on my blog too. If you would like to make a submission too, you have 18 days to make it  directly  (end of February), or if you want to forward comments to Autism NZ, you have  until Wednesday February the 22nd . My submission, sent to Autism NZ: I would like to submit further comments for your consideration, under the following Green Paper question: How much monitoring of vulnerable children should the Government allow? Who should monitor vulnerable children and under what circumstances? The monitoring of children with disabilities, must be  performed by people with relevant knowledge of, and experience with, the child\u2019s disability . For example, a condition like autism exhibits behaviours that have historically (and are still sometimes) mistaken for a simple lack of discipline on behalf of the parents. The exhaustion and desperation of the parents can also be mistaken as a problem wholly with the parent, rather a problem that has arisen out of lack of information and lack of support for that family. It is vital that any monitoring of families like those with autistic children, is performed by people who can identify the causes of problematic behaviours with a background knowledge of the condition, so they can identify what can help the child and parents, and not make the situation un-necessarily and avoidably worse for all members of that family. It is not uncommon for parents of autistic children to fear that the behaviours of their children will be misinterpreted in such a way as to not just leave them victims of unjustified condemnation and social isolation, but also fearful that their child will be removed from their care.  In order to encourage parents of vulnerable children to seek support and advice, it is vital that they not fear losing their child . It should be made clear that the priority is to keep the child with their own family, and that difficult behaviours will not be presumed to be the result of abuse and neglect. The parents of autistic children are well-known for being dedicated parents who will do anything and everything to help their child, financially and emotionally. This desperation can in fact leave the family even more vulnerable; open to abuse by those who offer unproven or false and expensive \u201ccures\u201d for the child\u2019s condition. This extra layer of vulnerability can be addressed by providing information and support as close to the time as diagnosis as possible. Merely monitoring a family \u2013 without the accompanying provision of information and support \u2013 is arguably unhelpful, and often anxiety-inducing. It needs to be understood that  the very act of monitoring an autistic child can be anxiety-inducing and extraordinarily upsetting for the child . Having someone new in the home, who perhaps says the wrong words or knocks the wrong item in the house, can set off meltdowns that it may take the parent literally hours to ameliorate after the visitor has left. In order to counter-act this, it would be well advised that anyone intending to visit the family to monitor or assess the situation, be informed beforehand of how best to come into the home, and be very mindful and respectful of the parent\u2019s instructions about how to be around the child. For the same reasons, frequent visits from a multitude of government departments, is unhelpful and can make the family\u2019s life more difficult than it already is; limiting the number of visitations required to assess needs, may be in a family\u2019s best interests. (This will obviously be relevant to the question of government inter-department co-ordination.) Thereafter, it may make sense for any monitoring or raising of concerns, to be done via the specialists and therapists that become part of the family\u2019s daily / weekly life. Again, this avoids a multitude of visitations and saves time and money for the government. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.childrensactionplan.govt.nz/", "http://www.wep.co.nz/wep/member-images/162/file/Green%20Paper%20on%20Vulnerable%20Children.pdf", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/Autism-New-Zealand/News.php#Green_Paper", "http://www.childrensactionplan.govt.nz/", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/Autism-New-Zealand/News.php#Green_Paper"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/the-green-paper-for-vulnerable-children-my-submission-via-autism-nz/", "title": "The Green Paper for Vulnerable Children; My Submission via Autism\u00a0NZ"},
{"date": "June 19, 2012", "body": "The dominant diagnostic instrument used to identify autism in New Zealand, is the  DSM-IV-TR  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Text Revision). The DSM-IV was published in 1994, and the text revision in 2000. (Those revisions did include  some changes to the autism spectrum disorders .) The DSM originates in the USA, from the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In New Zealand we also use and recognise the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, 1993), which comes from and has a comparatively more international focus than the DSM. The ICD is published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). I\u2019ve become somewhat familiar with the DSM and its proposed update \u2013 the DSM-5 \u2013 specifically because I\u2019ve been trying to get my head around the changes to autism and the rationale behind those changes. I\u2019ve largely neglected an understanding though of the ICD, and how it differs from the DSM. In my research to better understand the ICD, I\u2019ve gathered together enough information that I wanted to record it all in one place for personal future reference; so what better way than a post, whereby you readers can further refine my amateur understanding. It\u2019s not just the DSM-IV that is currently under review. The ICD-1o is due to be updated with the ICD-11, in 2015 (initial due date was apparently 2014). The due date for DSM-5 has also shifted back, from 2012 to 2013 (and some are speculating that it could \u2013 and should \u2013 shift even further back). Though there are differences between the DSM and ICD, these differences are not seen as necessarily undesirable. There are some ways in which having differing versions of various conditions are seen as a positive, for example it highlights that these are groupings of symptoms rather than definitive single-truth versions of disorders, and it allows researchers to choose which version best suits their purposes. As a general rule though, the distinctions between the two manuals are not seen as a good thing. There is professional recognition of the importance of the two manuals coinciding; there is a body set up with the aim of encouraging this co-ordination, the \u201cDSM\u2013ICD Harmonization Coordinating Group.\u201d This group includes people involved in the up-coming changes to both publications. One of the key factors standing in the way of the possible co-ordination of the two manuals, is the that the ICD works from conceptual definitions as a primary starting point, whereas the DSM starts from a researching point of view. Both defending and supporting their preferred focal starting point. Is there much difference between the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR\u2019s version of autism spectrum disorder? The short answer is: No, not substantially. The lengthier answer is, yes, there are differences in terminology, and in the groupings of people under the spectrum. But generally these differences are not seeing as significantly impacting on research findings. However, the proposed changes to the DSM will be a far more significant shift from the current closeness of the DSM-IV-TR to the ICD-10, so those interested in maintaining some coherency and closeness between the ICD and the DSM are understandably concerned about this shake-up and what those working on the ICD-11 will do in response. At this point it  appears that  the ICD team intends to hold on to the various divisions under the autism spectrum (including Aspergers), obviously this doesn\u2019t sit harmoniously alongside the  combined autism spectrum  proposed in the DSM-5. The ICD currently has  eight categories under autism, whereas the DSM-IV-TR has the five  most people are currently familiar with, but they align close enough to be meaningful for most purposes (as I understand it). The current publicly available version of the proposed ICD-11 has  nine  categories under autism, the new one being \u201csocial reciprocity disorder,\u201d which sounds (purely by the name and placement of it) like it\u2019s referencing the \u201c social communication disorder \u201d due to be introduced in the DSM-5. I\u2019ve had trouble finding anything else out about this new ninth category at this point. Obviously, with the DSM revision being due out sooner, there is more information currently available about the DSM-5 than the ICD-11. It is also clear that what the ICD-11 proposes for autism will take into account what the DSM-5 does (and how successfully it does it, one presumes). It is possible that the ICD-11 \u2013 despite hope for harmonisation \u2013 will ultimately not follow the lead of the DSM-5 in regards to autism, and it\u2019s conceivable that this could impact on the popularity and wide use of the DSM (Allen Frances for one, has shared concerns that the DSM may \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 drop in popular use, in the face of  ongoing issues with how it\u2019s currently constructed ). Though I did find out a lot in my research into this topic, there was a lot I couldn\u2019t quite isolate or get enough information on either. I was restricted to online research (and we all know how reliable that can be) but I tried to use official and reputable sources to counteract the limitation. To those with more personal and practical knowledge of the two manuals and their relationship, I would love to hear from you, so I can learn more about these very important, influential and often life-changing publications. *** Selective list of useful resources: \n Harmonisation of ICD-11 and DSM-V : Opportunities and Challenges.

{"date": "June 20, 2012", "body": "My son has many clothing quirks. Some of his earliest ones were refusing to ever wear socks or shoes, not wearing any fabric which wasn\u2019t the plainest of cottons, and an aversion to zips. His clothing issues never seem to really go away, they just evolve to various extremes and different intensities. For example, the  never  wearing socks at one stage became  always  wanting to wear socks (and being otherwise very upset and anxious). Whilst he still always wants to wear socks now, his reaction if he doesn\u2019t get to is less severe, though he will perseverate on the matter. Growing up, buttons appeared to be a non-issure. His style of clothing was the over-the-head cotton t-shirts, the sort that didn\u2019t typically sport even decorative buttons around the neck-line. But his school uniform and most of his shirts now, do have buttons at the neck-line, and along with the buttons has come the problem with the existence of buttons. He always wants them buttoned all the way up, even when it\u2019s very hard to do the buttons up (when they\u2019re intended to be decorative), and even when doing up the top-button makes the t-shirt uncomfortably tight around his throat. If I try to persuade him that they don\u2019t have to be done up every time, and don\u2019t have to be done up all the way to the top either, the reaction is upset and upsetting: He will desperately try to do them all up himself, while repeating over and over that he wants or needs them done up, and his eyes start to glisten with tears while his anxiety ostensibly builds. If he can\u2019t get them done up, it can end in him shaking and in tears, while he continues to blindly fumble at the buttons. The other day he\u2019d obviously had enough and declared he wanted the buttons cut off his shirt altogether. That\u2019s one way around the issue, but obviously an unhelpful long-term solution, especially when uniforms are required in his life. It usually helps in these situations if I can give him very clear-cut rules: Something along the lines of \u201calways do up your buttons when..\u201d and \u201cleave all the buttons undone when\u201d and also maybe \u201cbuttons can be left half-way done up when\u2026\u201d The problem is I can\u2019t seem to formulate the appropriate rules. Whether to do buttons up or not is somewhat to do with formality, but also to do with comfort, warmth, appearance and at the end of the day, personal preferences. Trying to piece all these considerations into some sort of universal button-rule has been un-successful so far. The rule would need to be simple to understand and to apply. Unfortunately the rule can\u2019t be \u201cwhen mummy tells you to do them up, you do them up,\u201d this never suffices for my son anymore. He does understand the importance of authority figures, but he is a \u201cwhy\u201d child, and passionately so. If he\u2019s told to do something (or not do something) he requires a clear explanation of why. Without it he gets upset and confused and is unsatisfied; he will not let the matter rest and it can escalate into an issue all its own, with its own attendant anxieties and obsessive behaviours, as he tries to sort his world into predictable and understandable pieces. Of course, it\u2019s never really  just  about buttons in themself. Or socks. Or zips. It\u2019s about providing my son with rules that help order his life, and about managing and controlling his anxiety levels, regardless of the cause of the anxiety. Unfortunately life will throw him unknowns and curve-balls, and he needs to be able to self-soothe (in appropriate ways), and to be able to adjust to circumstances as they change. One my roles in his life is to provide him with a growing body of rules that he can then apply through-out the rest of his life, since he doesn\u2019t simply pick up those rules by being around people and being part of society. But I don\u2019t know definitive \u201cbutton rules,\u201d and considering that this has become a daily and unavoidable issue, I really need to come up with some at this point. Perhaps someone reading this can suggest a simple rule; something that gets us out of the current two extremes on offer: Either the buttons are done all the way up, or they get cut off. I\u2019ve become pretty good at recognising, responding to, and problem-solving my son\u2019s various issues, but I am currently struggling with the problem with the existence of buttons. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/sred/433674856/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/the-problem-with-the-existence-of-buttons/", "title": "The Problem with the Existence of\u00a0Buttons"},
{"date": "June 12, 2012", "body": "\u201cAllen Frances\u201d is a name that doesn\u2019t come with positive connotations, in the autism world, principally because of his out-spoken views on the over-diagnosis of autism. Those who think autism is caused by environmental assault or vaccines, think he is trying to downplay the real autism increase and its causes. And those who think autism is actually under-diagnosed and recognise how essential it is to have the diagnosis to get much-needed services, see his \u201cover-diagnosis\u201d claims as inaccurate and as a threat to them getting (or maintaining) those services. Frances is not just a loud nut-job pointlessly irritating the masses though (god knows there\u2019s enough of those about). He was part of the DSM-IV team that introduced \u201cAspergers\u201d to the manual. They expected an increase in autism spectrum numbers after the introduction of Aspergers, but nothing like the soaring numbers that actually occurred. Frances has opinions about why the numbers soared in response to the introduction of Aspergers, and has general concerns about the impact of this increase (which I will expand on in this post). Yesterday I noticed the \u201cCoffee Klatch\u201d was doing an interview with Frances, about the DSM-5. I didn\u2019t have the chance until today to listen to it (it\u2019s over an hour-long, I rarely have that package of time free in a day), but got the chance today. And I\u2019m very glad I made the time. I know many other autism parents also won\u2019t have the chance \u2013 or won\u2019t want \u2013 to listen because of its length (or because of the man himself), but I think he makes some very important points that mustn\u2019t be drowned out and ignored by upset about his claims of over-diagnosis. Some of his most poignant points directly match the concerns I shared in  my post yesterday , on the importance and impact of tying services and funding too strictly to a confirmed diagnosis; so from my perspective it\u2019s well timed too. In this post I\u2019m going to summarise the key issues he addressed in that interview (and it definitely won\u2019t take an hour of your time to read my summary). Certain themes repeated through-out the interview, so I\u2019m going to do my best to package his points together. I\u2019m going to focus on what he had to say about autism (though he also spoke about ADHD, Childhood Bipolar Disorder, and TDD / DMD).\u00a0 I encourage you to listen to the whole interview if you get the chance. It was highly educational. Here we go: Frances expressed concerns about the DSM-5 process; pointing out that many think it is too secretive, too closed, and lacking in much-needed independent reviews. He thinks the wording chosen in the DSM can be incredibly powerful, and that not enough care is going into the subtle choices of wording, and not enough consideration into the likelihood of misuse and misinterpretation of the wording. Frances is worried too that the DSM is being used to \u201cput forward hypotheses\u201d rather than focused on only including conditions that have been tested and studied extensively prior to inclusion. The particular fear with this approach is the unintended consequences that flow from the diagnostic categories; that the DSM is actually a very powerful and influential tool that can and does change lives, so those constructing it should err on the side of conservative caution. Frances is concerned about how tightly funding and services is tied to diagnoses; he would like to see services and funding responding to an individual\u2019s needs rather than to a diagnosis category. He recognises that this would require a real restructuring of the current (American) system, but that it would be for the best, though he has no easy answers about how it could be achieved. Because funding, services, (and drug company profits) are bound to diagnoses, there are a lot of distorting influences at play, when it comes to what motivates people to give out diagnoses and what is done once a diagnosis is confirmed. Frances is concerned that the DSM is used too much like \u201ca bible\u201d when it comes to making these important life decisions, when really it is an imprecise instrument that has rather lost its way. It\u2019s lost its way because it expanded certain diagnoses (such as autism and ADHD) to such an extent, that the people who qualify for a diagnosis sit closer and closer to the line of \u201cnormal,\u201d rather than the diagnoses focusing on picking up the most severely affected individuals. He worries that this pathologizes difference, when difference is actually part of life and even desirable. He is concerned too that under the current (again, American) system, resources are a \u201czero-sum\u201d game: When those who are less affected by conditions also qualify for support, there is less support and resources available for the most severe cases who correspondingly require the most help. Frances believes that those who are instead mild, moderate, borderline, or atypical, are in fact better off without a diagnosis and without corresponding drug treatments. That the younger a child is, and the less classical their presentation of a condition, the less likely they will benefit from the diagnosis and drugs. He notes that it is not at all universal that having a diagnosis is seen as a good thing \u2013 whether by parents or by individuals who get the diagnosis: That the label is helpful to some, and actually harmful to others. All this doesn\u2019t mean he wants those with the milder version of conditions to be \u201cbumped off\u201d services. He\u2019d rather see the focus be on precise diagnoses, and that diagnoses are not so be-all-end-all of who will receive services. That \u201chelping someone\u201d is not equated with \u201cdiagnosing and medicating\u201d them. Those are the main points I took from the interview. I strongly agree with some of his points and concerns. I think at the very least, that it is important to be aware of the arguments he is making about the flaws with the DSM, and about the unintended consequences that come from treating the DSM like a bible (he has a lot to say in the interview about the use of drugs to address DSM conditions, that is worth listening to if that is a particular area of concern for you). I\u2019d be interested to hear your thoughts on his views as expressed in this interview.

{"date": "June 22, 2012", "body": "There has been a lot of autism blogging heat on Jenny McCarthy lately, for a rather offensive, inaccurate, and damaging stereotype she placed on an entire (and very large) grouping of autism parents. Jenny\u2019s idea is that the parents of autistic children who refuse to try every new-fangled miracle-cure that comes their way, have chosen to accept a victim role that gets them attention and pity, since they are in turn actively choosing to not help their child. That the parents who  do  try highly controversial cures, are the better mothers \u2013 the \u201cwarriors\u201d \u2013 who refuse to lie-down and accept the autistic fate of their child. ( This blog post at \u201cYeah. Good Times\u201d  does a fair job of conveying what Jenny says, and is a typically outraged response to Jenny). As much as I agree that Jenny is cruelly (and ignorantly) labeling a sizeable group of autism parents as taking and enjoying a victim role, I want to point out that she\u2019s not the only one using this lazy and under-handed tactic for attacking those who disagree with them; that some people in the very group she is attacking, also seem to take undue and self-righteous pleasure in labeling a large group of other autism mothers as accepting and wallowing in a victim role. There have been numerous studies documenting the excessively high stress levels of parents looking after autistic children (at least one such study claimed that our stress levels are even higher than parents of terminally ill children!). There are lots of reasons for such high stress levels, most of which are  objective  stressors, such as severe sleep loss over many years (or decades), and being in physical danger at the hands of a child who has frequent and violent out-bursts. It is also quite usual for us to lack a support system or any down-time; we can often be on call at all hours to meet the endless and repetitive needs of a child who is prone to very high levels of anxiety if we don\u2019t do exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. Months and years spent trying to teach basic skills that other children pick up seemingly effortlessly years in advance, might never be rewarded with results. There are also subjective stressors of course, such as personal attitudes towards autism in itself. But even someone of the sunniest and most positive of dispositions, will find their stress levels through the roof when they face the sort of objective stressors I listed above. This isn\u2019t a pretty picture of what autism can be like, but reality isn\u2019t always pretty, and sometimes you have to look at the ugly parts of life in order to get help to where it is most needed, and in order to understand the needs in the first place. Not all autism is doom-and-gloom, but for many parents, coping with an autistic child really is this bad (or worse, particularly when comorbid conditions make the child\u2019s autism even more challenging). But when autism parents speak out about the stressors, or speak out about what it\u2019s like to live with the worst autism has to offer, they are very often and promptly labeled as playing the victim role. Not by people like Jenny, but by the sorts of people Jenny attacks: Those who see autism as an inherent part of the person, which can\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 be cured. Those who prefer to use tried and tested therapies, and will avoid therapies which are seen as efforts to change the child (instead of changing the response of the rest of the world to the child). The stress levels of parents who struggle, get dismissed as \u201cattitude problems.\u201d The idea is that stressed out parents just need to be more accepting of their child and the child\u2019s autism, and that would take the stress away. That there is nothing  objectively  stressful about raising autistic children, it\u2019s just parents playing into a victim role. That much of the supposed stress involved with raising our children is also a result of  others\u2019  attitudes towards our children; that if everyone just learned to love and accept autistic people, we\u2019d all be fine. It\u2019s all in everyone\u2019s heads you see; autism isn\u2019t really a stressful and upsetting condition, it\u2019s just bad attitudes of everyone who d oesn\u2019t agree with those who aren\u2019t experiencing stress. Sound familiar? Denying other people\u2019s experiences, points of views, realities, knowledge, arguments, by simply painting them all as having a personal attitude problem. It\u2019s what Jenny did that got everyone so mad, and it\u2019s what these people do too. It\u2019s lazy, it\u2019s intellectually dishonest, and ironically enough, it is victimizing too: Taking a group of highly vulnerable people, and dismissing them and their experiences, with a personal attack. From my  personal  experience, dealing with a low functioning autistic child is so immensely stressful that it can make you physically sick, as your body struggles with the daily strain, and your own basic daily needs necessarily get side-lined. It can make you feel like you\u2019re surviving sometimes just minute by minute until the day ends. As my son moved up the functioning scale \u2013 learnt to use words, to manage his anxiety better, self-toileting, etc \u2013 my stress levels decreased in parallel. (By the way, If you don\u2019t like my reference to low and high functioning, and you think all such references are redundant and meaningless, I point you in the direction of  my previous post  on this point.) I\u2019m not saying that having a low functioning child is always going to be more stressful than a high functioning one, I think there is some truth in that but it\u2019s too simplistic too, since behavioural problems and anxiety levels (for example) can vary so much and independently of what a child is capable of doing for themselves. But I have noticed an unmistakable trend at least (again, just personal observations here) that those with comparatively independent autistic children, tend to be the ones criticizing the \u201cattitudes\u201d of those with highly dependent autistic children. I want to make a point at this stage, which I think is important and very misunderstood. When I (and others) say that raising an autistic child is very difficult, it does not mean we don\u2019t love our child or that our child will think we didn\u2019t love them when they read those \u201ctormented\u201d words of ours when they become adults.  Anymore than  I would be devastated to know that looking after me as a newborn / teenager (or whatever), was a real challenge and exhaustion for my own parents. As children we all pose serious challenges to our parents\u2019 mental and physical health at times \u2013 and often that\u2019s even more true of raising autistic children \u2013 but knowing we are hard for our parents to raise, does not equate with thinking we were unloved or unwanted. That is a separate claim, and should always be understood to be a separate claim. Just because something is hard and expensive and tiring, does not mean the goal \u2013 the child\u2019s happiness and wellbeing in this case \u2013 is therefore automatically declared something that is unwanted or not worth doing. Giving birth was horrendous for me and my life was in real danger after the birth of my first-born (I was taken straight to surgery), that doesn\u2019t mean I wish I\u2019d never done it. So I don\u2019t want to be reading any comments below, saying my harsh words about what it was like to raise my son, means I didn\u2019t or don\u2019t love him. Or, of course, that I am playing some sort of \u201cvictim\u201d card. Sharing my reality \u2013 what I went through and how hard it was \u2013 is not asking for pity or any such thing. My primary hope is quite simply, to be understood, for people to know and understand the challenges I \u2013 and other autism parents \u2013 faced and face on a daily basis. Many good things then flow from that too, such as not feeling so alone, a better public appreciation of what services we need and why, and the vain hope that maybe policy makers will hear us and actually make our (and our children\u2019s) lives, better. Declaring everyone who disagrees with you \u2013 who experienced a different reality than you \u2013 as having an attitude problem (or more specifically, as seeking pity since they supposedly like to be seen as a victim), is something that isn\u2019t just coming from the Jennys of this autism world. If we can understand why what she said was stupid and dishonest, I would hope we can see the same in claims from other people who we don\u2019t find so objectionable at the out-set. It\u2019s easy to target Jenny \u2013 and yes she deserves targeting \u2013 but how about others also lay off declaring other autism parents as lesser, just because they\u2019ve had a different experience of autism. Autism is a diverse condition \u2013 a spectrum \u2013 and in turn the experiences of it are also diverse. There is no one group of people with the monopoly on autism reality, when it comes to raising these amazing but also very challenging children. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.co.nz/2012/06/letter-to-jennymccarthy.html", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nualabugeye/2636448990/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/holier-than-thou-autism-parents-the-victim-group-tag-comes-from-both-directions/", "title": "Holier than thou autism parents; the \u201cvictim\u201d group tag comes from both\u00a0directions"},
{"date": "June 12, 2012", "body": "I\u2019m going to start off with a little story to establish my empathy and understanding. And then I\u2019m going to go on the attack. First, the story: Over the weekend, I wrote a rather lengthy treatise to my son\u2019s head teacher, outlining my concerns about a particular behavioural issue. I\u2019d gotten up at 3:30am to write it because I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. By the time I\u2019d finished I was looking at something that could have been a blog post. I showed it to my husband the next day (at a more godly hour) and he marveled that I\u2019d written something apparently coherent at such a ridiculous time of the night. Anyway, it passed the \u201cshow it to a sane person first\u201d test, and so I sent in the message via my son\u2019s school notebook on Monday. I was worried about what the head teacher\u2019s reply might be. I was concerned that she\u2019d see it as an attack on her or other people it referenced, so I was expecting a dismissive or aggressive reply. But I felt that it was worth the risk when I wrote my little novel to her, the concerns I wrote about had been robbing me of sleep for a while. So the reply comes back. I read it through once. I am not surprised at what I read: It has judgemental tones, and a touch of passive aggressiveness. I feel like a child been told off and been told to sit back down. I run through possible replies in my head; should I counter-confront her? Reiterate my concerns more strongly? Bring my own passive-aggressiveness out for a play..? Instead I remind myself that I was expecting a defensive reply from her, and to just take a step back. Read it again, with a clearer mind, see if my expectations have coloured what I\u2019ve read. This time I read it as a calming response from a head teacher to a concerned parent. A reassuring reply to show she hears my concerns, and to let me know that they\u2019re trying their best. She accepts some of my insights, and will implement them into her solutions for the behavioural problems. So instead of my rant back at her, I simply write one word in reply: \u201cThanks \ud83d\ude42 \u201d And I put the notebook down, and go back to looking after the kids for the afternoon. So yeah, I get it. I get when people sometimes read my posts and decide to colour it with their own ongoing concerns, that they come at them with their own agendas. I understand that people walk around everyday with their own pet projects in their minds, and that they will sometimes seek out posts just because they want one more public forum through which to make everyone think about what  they  can\u2019t stop thinking about. Even a bad day \u2013 or lack of sleep \u2013 can make us predisposed to seeing the calmest open-minded post, as an out-right and personal attack. At which point a commenter can be inclined to hop on their high horse and go off the deep end. I reserve the right to mix metaphors. But I\u2019ve reached the point where I\u2019ve really had enough. OK, to be honest, I\u2019ve hit that point many times since I started blogging, but it\u2019s happened again.  There have been times when people dedicate entire posts on their own blogs, to attacking me for something I neither said nor intended, even after I endlessly tried to explain to them that we\u2019re not even in disagreement. The same thing happens in my comments section; people bring along their own agendas and largely ignore my actual words, insisting I mean something else than what my words say; claiming I have hidden agendas (that just happen to be the opposite of their own agendas). There have been times that I\u2019m left doubting my own ability to write clearly, even though I have two honours degrees in fields that require extremely clear communication, and even though I have been employed for over a decade in roles that require me to mark other\u2019s essays. I\u2019m not a perfect communicator, no one is. But I am a careful and thoughtful one. I run the vast majority of my posts past my husband before hitting \u201cpublish\u201d just to make sure they make sense and convey what they\u2019re meant to convey. If I\u2019ve been misunderstood, I really don\u2019t mind clarifying my points. But there are clearly those who are solidly determined to turn posts into whatever they think it is or should be about; to twist words and meaning (or ignore them altogether) in order to justify themselves standing on their soap-box while they waste my time with off-topic and aggressive comments, that I then feel I must reply to. I have to let these ridiculous comments through, otherwise I look like I\u2019m censoring them. I really can\u2019t win. So I\u2019m writing this post, for future linking reference. If I have linked you to this post after you\u2019ve commented on my blog, then yes, you can be assured that indeed this post really  is  about you. If you want to comment on my posts, then actually comment  on my posts , not on some mysterious hidden message and agenda that you have read into it to suit your own unrelated ends. And next time, before you decide what you read is really an attack on you and your deepest values, just take a breath and remind yourself on the little story at the start of this post: Give people the benefit of the doubt, and take their words at face value, just the way you\u2019d like to be treated. It really does make for a much more pleasant daily existence. Communication is challenging enough, without building your own agendas into everyone else\u2019s words. Sometimes people really do  mean what they say . It\u2019s a novel idea for some, but give it some thought, and maybe you\u2019ll stop thinking the world \u2013 or I \u2013 am really out to get you. *** Edit: I just wanted to share this blog-response to my post, from Homestyle Mama:  \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d  It\u2019s wonderful to know that a post I was unsure whether to publish or not, could end up being a positive influence in someone else\u2019s life.

{"date": "March 29, 2012", "body": "World Autism Awareness Day (WAAD)  isn\u2019t far off, and always manages to attract a fair amount of both attention and controversy. One of the most controversial aspects of the day (for the Autism community at least) is the way that Autism Speaks has managed to somewhat hijack the day with its \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d campaign. If all the campaign did was raise awareness of autism \u2013 without importing a particular view about the nature or value of autism as a condition \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it would attract the same controversy; but the fact is that the campaign is strongly and clearly tied back to the specific charity and its views about autism, whereby the awareness being raised is about the \u201ccrisis\u201d of autism and the need for a cure. Here in New Zealand, there is awareness of the \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d campaign, but the main national autism charity \u2013  Autism New Zealand  \u2013 uses a different campaign and message for WAAD. It\u2019s called \u201cMulticoloured Mayhem Day\u201d, and comes with a much more positive message of highlighting the differences and abilities of autistic people. The campaign  is encouraged in schools, where children dress in colourful clothing; happily celebrating difference rather than mournfully reflecting on the existence of autism. There was a time that I found the Multicoloured Mayhem Day to be quite deceitful and even damaging; I felt that it unhelpfully \u2013 and too simplistically \u2013 highlighted the \u201cpositive\u201d (or at least, \u201cnon-negative\u201d) aspects of autism, without addressing and raising awareness about the very harsh realities faced by autistic people. I felt that the message was directed at and about the \u201chigh functioning,\u201d to the detriment of the lower (as my son very much was at the time). This is no longer my attitude towards Multicoloured Mayhem Day. On pondering the change in my attitude towards the day, I\u2019ve had further related thoughts about awareness raising and how (and whether) awareness arising efforts should change to reflect public opinion. In part my personal attitude towards raising awareness about autism, has changed alongside my son\u2019s abilities; the message of hope and encouraging people to see autistics like my son as capable and specially talented (if given the chance to shine), now sits closer to my concerns and hopes. Having said that, I still think the needs of the most severely affected individuals deserve the most resources and attention in  a world of limited and competing resources , and I\u2019m still very aware that my son will face serious challenges at the end of his school days (employment, self-care in independence,  driving , etc). So how does an \u201cawareness day\u201d deal with these seemingly conflicting messages of light hope and dark hardship? I think the answer for a condition like autism \u2013 with the word \u201cspectrum\u201d built right into the description \u2013 is obvious: First and foremost highlight the diverse realities and challenges of the condition. Indeed, this understanding of the huge diversity in abilities and outlooks for autistic people, is something very lacking in the public. I\u2019d love to see more awareness going into explaining what autism actually is, how it affects autistics (and their families), and how wide the spectrum is. That is to say, the role of  informing . This approach can obviously be seen though as diluting the message; when you\u2019re trying to make people pay attention to and care about autism, it can be hard when you\u2019re \u201cinstead\u201d focusing on just describing the condition, this will be particularly true if you see the point of your organisation as one of helping the worst affected, or alternately as giving a helping hand to those who just need that extra support and understanding. I would have thought the \u201cinforming\u201d role was prior and more important than the \u201cand this is how you should all feel about the condition\u201d bit (\u201cinforming\u201d the public, rather than focused on \u201cforming\u201d public opinion), but autism community politics is legendary, and those politics obviously show through on days like WAAD. I think there is another vital consideration which came up already in what I\u2019ve mentioned; the importance of  responding  to existing public opinion, and it is because of this particular consideration that I am coming down more so on the side of Multicoloured Mayhem (right now, and if forced to choose between the two campaigns). Lately the news about autism coming through the media is a heavily negative one, with references to crime, school shooting, hackers, and autistic children seriously hurting their siblings. Add that to  the recent discussions about euthanizing disabled children (and the somewhat frightening public response to the issue) , and it seems a good time to be highlighting the positive and \u201cdifference\u201d aspects of autism, over the more negative / \u201clets wipe out autism\u201d (to put it coarsely) aspects. It\u2019s easy to argue against this conclusion. For one, it can be pointed out that there are also many overly and distortingly optimistic stories out there about autism right now too; ones over-stating autistic talents for instance, alongside TV shows and movies that romanticise autism. A second argument against the idea is that if public awareness campaigns are always in \u201cresponse\u201d mode \u2013 reacting to current public sentiments \u2013 then they will have to change each year (or every few years if you prefer). This constant changing creates confusion in the public\u2019s mind, and lessens the impact generally of the approach taken any given year. Always shifting back and forth; the \u201ctruth\u201d as such, lying somewhere unspoken in-between and on both sides at the same time. And so ultimately I return to my previous point; that it would be rather preferable to have these awareness days focused on raising awareness of autism and its huge variations. Thus combating at a more basic level the public misunderstandings and lack of knowledge about the condition itself. In doing so, in-roads would surely be made on also combating whatever the public perceptions towards autism are at the time \u2013 whether overly negative or overly positive, understanding the diversity within the spectrum assists an understanding that both messages are (arguably) always accurate. Autism is a spectrum, of conditions and challenges and realities. Certain characteristics and issues bring together the grouping of autism, by definition; but just like the rest of humanity, people within the autism spectrum are still individuals. Individuals that can and do shift up and down the severity of the spectrum too. Autism is complicated; attempts to overly simplify the truths of autism \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 does everyone a disservice in the long run. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.un.org/en/events/autismday/", "http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-autism-awareness-day.jpg", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/rodney-times/4848396/School-celebrates-talents-of-autistic-people", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/the-challenge-of-driving-with-aspergers/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/", "http://www.lifesitenews.com/blog/disturbingly-one-sided-tv-show-promotes-euthansizing-children-with-disabili", "http://www.lightitupblue.org/Markslist/home.do"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/multicoloured-mayhem-vs-light-it-up-blue-informing-forming-and-responding-to-public-opinion/", "title": "Multicoloured Mayhem vs Light It Up Blue?

{"date": "June 25, 2012", "body": "[ Edit : Some of my views expressed in this post, have now changed, please see\u00a0 the post here \u00a0for clarification.] At the age of four \u2013 prior to starting school \u2013 every child in New Zealand is meant to have a \u201cB4 School Check.\u201d The B4 School Check is a 45 minute interview (though the actual time seems to vary a lot) designed to identify any problems the child has, that may affect their learning at school. This includes health, vision and hearing checks. But it also includes an increasingly controversial check for the child\u2019s \u201cstrengths and difficulties\u201d (the SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). A growing number of people are concerned that the SDQ is a stealthy and unhealthy, check for mental health. The SDQ has two parts to it: the questionnaire filled out by the parent (SDQ-P), and the questionnaire filled out by the \u201cteacher\u201d (SQD-T). (Though what and who counts as a \u201cteacher\u201d is reasonably broad, and can include other parents at a play-centre.) Officially, the SDQ is not used to diagnose or label a child; it is meant to identify concerns and determine whether a referral to a specialist might be required. On the surface this all looks fine, but how the health checks are being conducted and the actual outcome of the heath checks \u2013 specifically of the SDQ \u2013 have raised concerns. Whether those concerns are over-reactions, misunderstandings, or evidence of out-dated attitudes towards \u201cmental health\u201d issues, is what I want to consider in this and my next post. First off, the outcome of these health checks, in relation to the SDQ: They were introduced in 2008 (after a pilot run if 2007 to see how well they performed). There was a \u201c 140 per cent increase in antidepressant prescriptions for 0 to 4-year-olds between 2009 and 2010, and an average 10 per cent increase in mood-stabilising drug prescriptions in the last five years for children aged five and over. \u201d Whether we should be concerned about those increases or not ( here is just one example of someone very concerned about it ), depends on whether these checks are picking up conditions that were present and previously un dealt-with, or whether they were prescriptions for conditions that don\u2019t exist: If the checks are picking up on genuine conditions that need treatment, and the appropriate treatment is being put in place, then I think that\u2019s cause for celebration rather than alarm; a child and their family are receiving much-needed help. There are some who are at all times \u2013 regardless of genuine conditions \u2013 against the medication of young children in this manner. That is an important argument, but it can\u2019t be wrapped up in a critique of the B4 School Checks: If your view is that medicating children with condition X is always harmful, then you can\u2019t get angry at a Check which identifies a child as having condition X; the accurate target would be \u201cthe preferred treatment\u201d for  all  children with that condition, ie not just the ones identified thanks to a B4 School Check. The concerned writer I linked to above, adds that the  in effectiveness of interventions after preschool checks, has been well established; but she links to a 1987 study to support the point. I would have thought it particularly unconvincing to use a 20-year-old study, which used a different check and different treatments than are currently used with the children concerned, to reach the conclusion that the current B4 School Check \u2013 and the then following interventions \u2013 are pointless or harmful. The writer even states later in their piece that the government has used a Check based on the current DSM and ICD, both of which \u2013 I point out \u2013 were actually published  well after  1987. I would have thought updated checks and treatments would suggest the need to use updated studies. As I mentioned earlier, the government did run a pilot program for the B4 School Check, the year before it was widely introduced. The government shares some positive parental feedback from that trial, in the information it provides to teachers about the SDQ. Including very high levels of parental confidence and satisfaction in the checks (see the download  to the right on this page , under \u201cFAQ\u2026\u201d). This of course doesn\u2019t tell us about the accuracy and effectiveness of the outcomes from the Checks (and would have struggled to do so, I expect, after only one year). Furthermore, not all parental feedback was actually positive, some was quite critical. For example, \u201c The pilot showed strong resistance from parents to the rating scale used, the applicability of the questionnaire and specific questions about lying, cheating and stealing. \u201d It appears that these parental concerns were not made publicly available, they only came to light after an Official Information Act request. There is concern about the number of false-positives that arise from a B4 School check. The writer of the critical piece again points out that there are a high number of false positives, whereby children are sent along for diagnostic assessment despite having no condition (based on a 2000 study in England, of the SDQ). However, again, surely this would only be really concerning if those false positives were then inaccurately diagnosed and then given inappropriate treatment? If what is happening is children are being identified with potential problems that turn out to not be an actual condition, then doesn\u2019t it mean the B4 school checks are doing what they set out to do? That is, identifying potential problems and allowing professionals to then follow-up to determine if a causative condition actually exists? This makes me weary of the use of the term \u201cfalse positives\u201d in this context: A \u201cfalse positive\u201d result from a B4 School Check would be \u201cthere is something here that is concerning\u201d when in reality there is not something concerning. The B4 School Check is not a diagnostic instrument, and neither is it used or intended as such.  If  it was being used to diagnose a condition which later turned out to be false, then the term \u201cfalse positive\u201d would surely be more accurate. Of course there do remain other issues around these \u201cfalse positives\u201d (even once we distinguish that the B4 School Check is not a diagnosing instrument). That is the time, stress, and money involved in determining that a child does not have a condition, after the B4 Check identifies a potential issue. I do think this is a valid and important concern, and part of the reason why you wouldn\u2019t want the B4 School Check to be casting such a wide net. There are also concerns about the findings of a B4 Check remaining on the child\u2019s records for 10 years, and the impact this in itself might have on the way the child is dealt with by educators and other professionals. However, as long as it is understood that the B4 School Check is not a diagnostic instrument, I think much of that concern is ameliorated. It does though again argue in favour of having a more precise or targeted Check. Which brings me to what I think is another important concern about these B4 School Checks: They are not compulsory. A parent can choose too, to only take part in the hearing and vision checks (for instance) and not do the SDQ part. But neither of these points \u2013 that the entire thing is not compulsory and that a parent can choose to only take part in a portion of it \u2013 are emphasized for parents. Many parents apparently think and thought they were compulsory. When I was informed that my eldest (my autistic son) was of the age that he should have a B4 School Check, it was via a form that arrived in the mail. The form made it very clear that I could choose not to have the Check done. When I didn\u2019t return the form, they did follow-up with a phone call to remind me about the Check. I told them my son was already \u201cin the system;\u201d that he had already gone through full health checks, and had a confirmed diagnosis. This seemed to satisfy them and they thereafter left me alone. Even though I knew I didn\u2019t have to do the Check, and didn\u2019t want to do the Check, I did feel an uncomfortable amount of pressure to do so anyway, both via the form and during the follow-up phone call; like I was a negligent parent should I choose not to take part. It was very clear from the phone call that I was expected to justify why I wouldn\u2019t take part in the Check, which seems to move the Checks away from their supposedly \u201ccompletely voluntary\u201d nature. Indeed, notes made available by the Government to educators, tells them to strongly encourage parents to take part and to reassure parents so they will take part, rather than a focus on \u2013 say \u2013 informing parents more so about what the Check tests for and the parents\u2019 unhindered right to refuse the B4 School Check. There is one final and important aspect of the B4 School Check that I want to address, but this post is already very long, so I\u2019m going to split that off into a \u201cPart Two.\u201d In Part Two I intend to discuss issues around the  public\u2019s perceptions  of \u201cmental health\u201d issues that arise from the B4 School Checks. In particular, I\u2019ll be looking at the public\u2019s evident concerns about the stigma of diagnoses which arise from the B4 School Check outcomes, and the public\u2019s perception of \u201cepidemics\u201d like autism that can supposedly arise from such Checks. I\u2019ll also be considering the way in which the public has responded to the idea of checking young children  at all  for such conditions. *** Relevant and Useful links: \n \u201c Ministry \u2018hides test\u2019s real purpose'\u201d (stuff.co.nz, June 24th 2012) \n \u201c Universal Psychiatric Screening for NZ Pre-Schoolers \u201d (Bradshaw, March 15th, 2012) \n \u201c The mental health of New Zealand preschool children.

{"date": "June 24, 2012", "body": "A  recent comment  on the \u201cAbout\u201d section of my blog, prompted me to investigate the question of pain and autism. I was already familiar with the notion that autistic people frequently report higher thresholds of pain, and are less expressive of their pain (my son strongly appears to be someone who falls in both camps). But could it be true \u2013 as the comment suggested by reference to a  2004 study  \u2013 that autistic children do experience just as much if not more pain than their non-autistic peers, but the parents are failing to pick up on it? The study\u2019s researchers utilized a supposedly objective measure of pain \u2013 facial expressions \u2013 to reach their conclusion. I had some issues and concerns with the study straight away (besides the small sample size): For starters, is a facial expression of pain universal in a way relevant to autistic people? The experience of pain and its intensity is apparently individual and cultural (not universal), but what about the expression of that pain? If it is a universal expression, does that universality cross the issues that are present in autism? By which I mean, the expression of pain may be universal across all cultures and ages (ie on broad measures), but is it universal across all  minds  in their great variance, particularly when that mind variance explicitly includes issues around the identification and presentation of facial expressions. Does is not perhaps beg the question, to start off by saying that facial expressions of pain are objective and universal, and then use that measure to establish that those who explicitly struggle with facial expressions, experience pain in the same way as everyone else. Surely (I thought at the outset) pain is always going to be expressed in the same way; pain seems so fundamental, surely it is not a learned expression. The newborn baby has not \u201clearned\u201d how to screw up their face in pain. But one of the recognizable features of autism \u2013 according to the  DSM-IV-TR  and the  proposed DSM-5  \u2013 are impairment or even  total lack  of facial expression. The question is then not \u201cdo babies all show pain in the same way\u201d but rather \u201cdo  autistic  babies show pain in the exact same way as non-autistic babies.\u201d I tend to think the answer would be yes, but still, considering the challenges of autism it is surely an important question to ask. The answer would be hard to find without early video footage of children who are later diagnosed as autistic. The issue is further complicated by the fact that there are some forms of autism which appear to be late-onset varieties; whereby even a baby which exhibits pain in a universal, unlearned way, may change those expressions as autism becomes more pronounced. Let\u2019s presume that all babies \u2013 autistic ones included \u2013 express pain in the same way (it\u2019s easier to progress this way and I think it\u2019s the stronger assumption). If this is so (and if it isn\u2019t) you still have a factor you must control for in any study using facial expressions as an objective measure of emotion or sensitivity: The impact of the fact that autistic people do struggle to some extent, with identifying and understanding others facial expressions, and finding the correct response to those facial expressions. Moreover, that it is incredibly common for parents of autistic children to  intentionally and actively  teach their children (not always successfully) to recognise and respond appropriately to emotion, and not just to  others  emotions either; also understanding and presenting their  own  emotions in a form that neurotypcial people can access and understand. Teaching \u2013 or a child who has self-taught \u2013 to respond in a particular way, is likely to have a \u201cdistorted\u201d  presentation  or expression of emotions (please understand that I do not mean a lack of actual emotion, or a lack of care for others emotions, I am  solely  talking about the  outward expression  of them). So the way in which the pain is expressed may indeed be  intentionally  amplified because they child has been taught to actively identify and respond in the expected way to particular events and others cues. Did the person performing the procedure or the parent give a  verbal cue  that the child should expect pain to begin? Would it not have been arguably unethical for them  not  to appropriately warn the child? Was this major factor controlled for, if so, how..? There is a deeper question here too about the reasons that an autistic person might be \u201c experiencing \u201d the same levels of pain but not showing it (besides the question of learned emotion expression): If an autistic person experiences a bodily sensation (say, pain) but their brain struggles to identify and then express that experience, the sensation (the pain) is still of course there, but is less likely to actually impact on the felt reality of the autistic individual. It is theorised by some that this is why autistic adults very frequently share stories about having unusually high \u2013 dangerously high \u2013 thresholds to pain: Because it takes them longer to register and recognise the pain, which is not to say that the pain isn\u2019t there, but that it\u2019s been perceived and reacted to differently. I say this is \u201cdangerous\u201d because of the fact that pain is functional; it tells us that something is wrong and to seek help. This makes autistic people more  vulnerable in the health system , and requires more proactive measures to make sure they get the same care and attention that the rest of the population otherwise seeks out. This raises another concern I had with the originally cited study: Why were autistic children the sole focus? Or allow me to expand more relevantly on that point: Why were the experiences and opinions of autistic adults \u2013 who can verbally describe what is going on as well as have their faces observed \u2013 not taken into account of the question of whether pain experience was the same for autistic as for non-autistic individuals? The researchers recognise the problem with getting verbal accounts of pain experience from verbally challenged children, so why wouldn\u2019t it make sense to also try to overcome this issue by seeking out autistic individuals who  are  verbal (which could have included autistic children, not just adults)? I labour this point because in researching the issue of pain and autism, I have come across endless examples of autistic adults and teenagers talking about their high pain thresholds and that they find themselves much less likely (partly as a result) to exhibit pain on their faces either. I also found examples of unusual and severe pain reactions to what is experienced by most as harmless sensory stimuli. I think that is a vital consideration if one is attempting to draw conclusions about the actual pain levels experienced  as caused by a same medical procedure , by autistic versus non-autistic individuals. Pain caused by lights, sounds, mere touch of the skin, etc. The variance found in observed pain levels as measured by facial expression, may be picking up on independent factors, rather than proving the same pain levels to a fixed stimulus, of autistic individuals. All of this does not mean that autistic children (or adults) don\u2019t feel pain the same way and intensity as everyone else (though frankly the reports from autistic adults have got to hold some weight here!) But what it does mean is that I would have serious concerns about using facial expressions of pain, as a definitive objective measure of pain, in a population marked as having challenges in this very area. I must say that I am not impressed either than the conclusion of the study was not to rely on parental reports of children\u2019s pain. The fact is that many autism parents \u2013 like myself \u2013 frequently remind health professionals not to solely rely on perceived and self-reported pain when trying to help our children. I always tell my son\u2019s doctors after they ask if his ear hurts or his throat is sore, to please check it out for themselves too (have an actual look, don\u2019t dismiss a possible symptom on verbal answer alone). Not because my son\u2019s opinions and experiences don\u2019t matter \u2013 of course they do \u2013 but because experience as his mother has taught me that he frequently won\u2019t notice he has hurt himself or realise he is extremely sick. For example, he had a supposedly painful and large veruca on his foot that he hadn\u2019t noticed at all until my husband accidentally found it one night. My son has told me he feels good mere moments before and between bouts of vomiting. He doesn\u2019t know where or how he got bruises and cuts. But the tiniest bit of water on his face used to cause him immense and very obvious \u201cpain.\u201d As parents, we learn \u2013 and are always learning \u2013 about our children\u2019s under and over sensitivities and what causes them pain. Our input and knowledge about our children are absolutely  vital  to the health of our children. We are not  substitutes  for measuring our children\u2019s pain levels, but we are essential parts of an  accurate  measurement. I am not convinced that facial expressions of pain, established in reference to people who were  not  autistic, can replace or outweigh the experience and knowledge of parents of autistic children. The way forward to establish a relevant measure would be to  at least  start by talking to verbal autistics and measure their expressions of pain against their own reports of actual pain, rather than\u00a0 presupposing that a pained face model built around non-autistic facial expressions, is an accurate tool with which to draw wider conclusions on the experiences of pain for autistic children. But what do I know. I\u2019m just a parent. Which prompts me to end on this note: When it comes to the content of this post, I really am \u201cjust a parent;\u201d I have no scientific training. I did my best to work my way through the literature and grasp the concepts involved, but there\u2019s a fair chance I\u2019ve goofed up somewhere along the way. Sometimes my posts are efforts to simply make sense of something, and I rely on readers to point out errors or issues, so I can learn from them. This is one of those posts.  I also want to say that though I may come off quite annoyed about what I see to be the somewhat superficiality of the study I am primarily addressing in this post, I am not at all annoyed at the person who bought it to my attention; in fact I am grateful they presented the opportunity and impetus for me to look into and learn more about the issue.

{"date": "November 16, 2010", "body": "\n Image by moominmolly via Flickr \n I had intended to write a post on the autistic children who are expected to take part in intensive therapies when they are young, and then burnout (and thereby significantly regress) in later years. This debate is usually in regards to  ABA therapy . But as I did my background research it became clear that Autism Burnout effects everyone touched by autism: children, parents, therapists and teachers. No one gets away from the exhausting impact of dealing with the condition. There are plenty of  reasons   to think  that early intervention in the life of an autistic child, has strong and positive effects. It is therefore entirely understandable that some parents will take this to the \u201cnth degree\u201d and immerse their child in sometimes  40 hour a week  therapies \u2013 employing a full-time therapist to work with their child. It\u2019s an expensive option, but what would you not pay for the long-term well-being of your child..? I\u2019d heard  plenty of negative things  about doing this to an autistic child, including of course, burnout \u2013 where they will make progress but are likely to shut down and regress when they get older. Even if we could have afforded it I would have not chosen intensive daily therapy for him. It turns out though that the children are not the only ones facing burnout in such a situation. Therapists providing such intensive therapies, frequently face burnout . Not just because their work is hard and long, but because they often face the daily frustration of seeing little or no progress in the child. This is not to say they never make progress or what they are doing is futile (though that is a discussion for a future post). It will not be surprising from having read my previous posts, that the  parents face severe burnout  as par for the course of having these children \u2013 regardless of what therapies are employed. This is compounded by  how hard it is for these parents to ever take a break;  to maintain friends and a support system, or find someone who can understand their high-needs child well enough to take over their care for even a few hours. Once these children make it into the classroom, it\u2019s the  mainstream teacher\u2019s turn to experience the burnout . They are insufficiently trained or resourced to deal with the \u201ctypical\u201d autistic child. Because of the nature of the problems caused by autism, the issues surrounding support for the families, and no miracle cure to make it all better, it seems that \u2013 at least for the now and the foreseeable future \u2013 Autism Burnout will continue to be widespread, and for many people, inevitable. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/68378169@N00/291941454", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis", "http://autism.about.com/od/childrenandautism/a/EIImportant.htm", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/06/040616063622.htm", "http://autism.about.com/od/alllaboutaba/f/40hours.htm", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt128255.html", "http://www.child-psych.org/2009/04/who-supervises-your-aba-therapist-focus.html", "http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=life_fam_stress", "http://www.aspergerssyndrome.org.uk/family-burnout.html", "http://hubpages.com/hub/Autism-Are-The-Schools-Prepared-For-The-Autism-Epidemic"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/autism-burnout/", "title": "Autism Burnout"},
{"date": "November 18, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Autistic children struggle to identify other people\u2019s emotions. Not being able to figure out when someone else is happy, sad, afraid or angry, can lead to a mess of other problems with their social interactions and behaviour more generally. I\u2019m going to share some fun \u2013 and importantly, free \u2013 ways to try to get the message through, which I found effective for my son. They include verbal games, visual games, drawing games and even online games \u2013 something hopefully for everyone! Consider using favourite foods or stickers as rewards for when they get the answers right in these games, but using rewards in the \u201cright\u201d way with these children can be a learnt skill in itself \u2013 using them in the wrong way can just raise anxiety and lead to meltdowns. If you\u2019re not confident on using tangible rewards, try to stick to your own over-the-top social praise (\u201cwell done, good boy!\u201d, plus huge smiles) instead. The online games I mention at the end of this post have the reward (the sound effects and visuals) built into them, making it easier. It helps if you can get them started at matching the look of emotions to the name of the emotion, by labelling it every time they or someone near them shows an emotion. Many autistic children also struggle with pronouns, so early on it really helps to keep it as simple as possible. For example, use \u201cJames is sad\u201d, \u201cMummy is happy\u201d instead of \u201cyou are sad\u201d, \u201cI am happy\u201d. I also found that it helps to turn it into a fun game (when they are feeling settled \u2013 no good trying this is they are anxious). Tell them you are going to play a game, and say \u201clook, mummy is happy!\u201d and do an exaggerated huge smile. Then \u201clook, mummy is sad\u201d and really throw that pout out. If they look like they are catching on and are amused, you can try to get them to join in. \u201cJames\u2019 turn, show mummy happy\u201d and hopefully they\u2019ll try to copy what you showed them. Or show an emotion as you say \u201cMummy is.. (long pause to give them a chance to fill in the blank)\u2026 happy!\u201d There are heaps of other ideas you can try too \u2013 such as drawing very simple faces. Just a circle that you fill in with eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows (an important feature of emotion), for each emotion that you introduce. Keep it slow, simple and repetitive. Consider spelling the word under each face \u2013 my son loves letters and words and this extra aspect would always attract his attention. Once they get the idea, start filling in circles with just the eyes and nose and eyebrows, and let them try to add the mouth to fit the emotion. If they love computers, you can take them to a couple of helpful online games that particularly appeal to autistic children. It\u2019s OK if your child can\u2019t operate a mouse yet, just get them to point on the screen to what the answer is in the games. If they can\u2019t point, try to do the pointing for them \u201cis it this one\u2026 or this one..?\u201d. If you can\u2019t get them to respond verbally or physically but they are at least watching you play the game, go through it yourself and let them watch (and hopefully learn, or at the very least, be amused for a while!). The two games I\u2019ve found most useful for this are: \u201cRobbie the Robot\u201d from the  Whiz Kids  website \u2013 a website of games specifically created for autistic children. (I\u2019ll be reviewing the value of other games from this website in future posts.) \u201cRobbie the Robot\u201d is a nicely paced game that teaches the child to identify happy, sad and angry. If your child loves Thomas (or indeed, trains at all), then there\u2019s a good chance he will respond well to the  Emotions game , where he needs to identify who is happy, sad, surprised, angry and scared, from Thomas, Molly, Emily, Percy and James. Start with the Emotions game under the medium difficulty option (there is no \u201ceasy\u201d version of this game). You might also have a go at the memory version of the Emotions game under \u201cdifficult\u201d, but it really is that much harder. There are endless ways to teach emotion to autistic children, just remember to keep it slow, simple, and fun. Try to teach by only focusing on the face \u2013 the rest of the body language thrown in can be overwhelming. Tailor the teaching to their own strengths and weaknesses. And don\u2019t push them \u2013 if they aren\u2019t in the right frame of mind to learn, they won\u2019t, and you don\u2019t want them to rebel against the games just because they associate it with an anxious experience. Try to have fun along the way yourself too \u2013 if they see you having fun they\u2019ll be more likely to want to join in. Good luck! \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Child_01546_Nevit.jpg", "http://www.whizkidgames.com/", "http://www.thomasandfriends.com/au/Thomas.mvc/Games/Home"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/read-my-face/", "title": "Read my Face"},
{"date": "November 17, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My autistic son struggles with his fine motor skills, so art-work has never been something he particularly enjoys or excels at. As he learnt to hold and move a pen, he became a great little scribbler. It started out random, with no obvious or expressed intent behind the marks on the paper. But one day I\u2019d noticed he was particularly involved with his drawing, and decided to ask him after he had finished, \u201cwhat is that?\u201d Not really expecting an answer, I got one anyway, \u201ca wheel!\u201d And it did kind of look like wheel\u2026 it was circular at any rate. I decided this was such a great step forward, and quite symbolic of the hidden aspects of the autistic individual, so I\u2019ve kept that treasured picture. He doesn\u2019t do much art, and when he is in the mood he prefers to have other people draw things for him. I\u2019ve got into the habit of regularly asking him what he\u2019s drawn whenever he has made the effort. Sometimes he\u2019ll tell me a picture is of his brother, or similar, but most times I get no answer at all. On Monday I went to pick him up from kindergarten. He had drawn some colourful squiggle and I asked his support worker if she knew what the picture was of. She said no, and I assured her (in that confident way that us mothers have) that it was of something, and I\u2019d ask him what it was when I got home. He was far too busy making sand-cakes for the play-oven at the time to pay attention to such questions. So I got him home. I took out his kindergarten art-work, and sat down beside him on the couch. I made eye contact with him and I asked slowly and clearly, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d as I presented him with his picture. He paused, and looked at me sideways \u2013 like I must be crazy to have to ask.

{"date": "June 26, 2012", "body": "[ Edit : My views on this have since changed in some regards, please see  the post here  for clarification.] This is a continuation from  the previous post , looking at the controversies surrounding the use of the SDQ in New Zealand\u2019s \u201cB4 School Check.\u201d In this post, I am turning my attention to the issues around the public perception of \u201cmental health,\u201d that have come up in response to the SDQ portion of the B4 School Check. The issues and arguments I bring up here and in the next post, are all taken from talk-back radio, public forum discussions, or views of the public shared in national news stories (for links to some of those sources, see the previous post). I\u2019ll begin with one of the most popular responses to why the B4 School Checks should not include a check for \u201cmental health\u201d issues: Stigma. The argument goes like this: Children shouldn\u2019t be screened for mental issues, because receiving a mental health label (such as autism, ADHD, or childhood depression) is stigmatizing for the child. This argument is so clearly and deeply flawed that it\u2019s rather too easy to knock down (but I\u2019ll do it anyway). However, I will also give the arguers the benefit of the doubt \u2013 that they are using the stigma argument to make other points they\u2019re not expressly stating (and that some others do expressly state) \u2013 and run through those deeper arguments after I\u2019ve knocked down the main one. (Perhaps if you are someone who holds to the stigma argument, or can see the argument they\u2019re making is different than that I\u2019ll be addressing here, you could enlighten me via the comment section.) First off, the pure stigma point.  It is my view that issues to do with the mind \u2013 conditions that impact on \u201cintelligence\u201d for example \u2013 are one of the last ways in which society still thinks its OK to discriminate and treat people as less than human . I believe that this point is quite strongly reflected in the stigma argument (and in other arguments I\u2019ll be looking at too). If someone has a broken leg, impaired eyesight, or diabetes, we don\u2019t advise against diagnosing them with these conditions because of the stigma that will attach to the individual. Rather, we recognise the condition is a fact, that needs to be identified and addressed. Yet mental health issues are treated as something to be ashamed of, and that are better left unknown and unidentified. That the stigma that will attach to the child far outweighs the benefits that come from knowledge a child has a condition and the attending benefits of knowing specifically how best to help that child. If stigma does exist around such conditions \u2013 and sadly, it does \u2013 shouldn\u2019t the concern be about addressing and reducing that stigma, with better information and attitudes disseminated into the public sphere? To me, it\u2019s like saying \u201chey, racism exists, even though we don\u2019t like it, so let\u2019s just tell all the coloured people to paint their faces white.\u201d By using the existence of stigma as an argument against recognising the conditions (or rather, differences) that people have, all you\u2019re doing is surely reinforcing the status quo. There is one aspect of the stigma argument that I think holds water: Since the public doesn\u2019t understand mental issues well at this point, it would be best to make sure the information about diagnoses etc are confined to professionals who won\u2019t misunderstand and misapply the information to the detriment of the child. However, even this aspect of the argument isn\u2019t going to support the stigma argument here, since the B4 School Check  isn\u2019t a diagnostic instrument . It is used to identify whether a child should be further and professionally assessed for potential issues. Even if it  was  a diagnostic instrument, it\u2019s not like the mental health condition is then tattooed to the child\u2019s forehead. The child is the same child they\u2019d been before, there is no reason for their peers and other non-professional or non-related adults, to have access to the fact that the child has a diagnosed condition. Hidden deeper within the stigma argument, is the claim that the harms of a diagnosis (the stigma specifically) outweigh any benefits,  because  the conditions at issue \u2013 mental health issues in preschoolers \u2013 are themselves suspect, and furthermore that any therapies which follow from a confirmed diagnosis, are also either pointless or harmful. Some people expressly make these arguments, and they are very popular ones, particularly in relation to conditions like Aspergers and ADHD. In my next post, I will be specifically looking at these arguments as they have arisen in the public response to the B4 School Check: Do young children get mental health issues, what are the nature of those mental health issues, is it worth treating those issues, and what is normal anyway (the argument that these are just \u201cnormal\u201d kids being labeled with conditions that don\u2019t exist). Embedded in all of that too is the question of whether something like \u201cautism\u201d \u2013 one of the conditions that can be picked up as an issue by the SDQ \u2013 is really a \u201cmental health issue\u201d in the sense talked about by the public. *** EDIT : Due to a huge increase in my home work-load (while my husband is away on conference), it\u2019s looking very unlikely that I will get around to the third part of this series anytime soon. Or maybe ever. I\u2019d done all the research for it but it\u2019s been a few very busy days since then (and I\u2019m still incredibly snowed under), so it\u2019s no longer fresh in my mind enough to pull together a post, without re-reading the original sources all over again.

{"date": "November 17, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n How to discipline, and not discipline, your children, is a topic that every parent has had to think about and form an opinion on. It\u2019s been a very public topic throughout my adult years \u2013 with ongoing debates about laws around smacking, new books coming out in an endless stream, and quite a few TV series dedicated to the topic. As parents-to-be we had discussed how we wanted to discipline our children well in advance: We were going to be a united front to our child, we were going to be consistent, we were not going to use smacking (this was back when it wasn\u2019t essentially illegal). I\u2019d read parenting books and websites \u2013 I was all ready for that aspect of my parenting adventure\u2026 So let\u2019s take a classic piece of naughty behaviour from my son. Take one toy car. It gets accidentally knocked off a table (that pesky gravity thing \u2013 for a long time I found myself getting angry at gravity for what it did to my son!). Now begins the meltdown. That\u2019s naughty right? He\u2019s clearly overreacting to something he wanted his way, and is using inappropriate behaviours of screaming and violence to property and people at this point. Goodies, time to apply all those wonderful discipline ideas that all those other parents and parenting shows have been going on about for so long! First you make eye contact.. opps, that\u2019s just making things worse. OK, OK, how about I just try to tell him that his behaviour is not acceptable. But he\u2019s screaming and hitting \u2013 even if I could get close to him, he can\u2019t hear a word I\u2019m saying. Find a way to get a word in edge-wise, somehow, at some point. Great, he can\u2019t understand my words anyway \u2013 there\u2019s that damn autism again. Righto, I\u2019ll just put him somewhere safe until he calms down then. Where is safe for a child who scratches his skin so hard when he\u2019s irritated that he makes himself bleed..? Hope like crazy he won\u2019t do too much damage to himself, stick him in his bedroom, now wait. And wait. Watch the minutes turn into half an hour, into an hour\u2026 So this isn\u2019t working either, and I\u2019m worried he\u2019s hurting himself too much, he sounds like he\u2019s going to vomit with the force of his tantrum, can\u2019t take it anymore, mummy-mode kicks in. Get my boy our of his room, try to comfort him. But nothing I do or say is working. I can offer him all his favourite things, I can fix whatever went wrong, none of it registers. The screaming, the crying, will continue until maybe he falls asleep with exhaustion\u2026 but even then he tends to wake up and go straight into the tears and screaming again.. How fair is it to punish behaviour which is set off by sensory issues? It is not sensible to punish a child for something completely out of his control. So how do you figure out the difference between behaviours that represent intended naughtiness, versus what is a result of his autism? And then what to do about it either way, since words and actions don\u2019t mean the same thing to him as they would to a neurotypical (\u201cnon-autistic\u201d) child. We survived the only way we could early on, before we had the diagnosis and the help we desperately needed. And that was by avoiding whatever set him off by creating a predictable environment for him. In doing so we created a trap for ourselves \u2013 unable to leave the home, unable to have visitors, and living in constant anxiety of anyone or anything unexpected setting off the next endless meltdown. With help and information, we were eventually able to understand how to communicate with him effectively, and how to pick our battles with him. It\u2019s a constant mode of learning, and responding to him as he advances, and picking up on the real reasons behind seemingly irrational behaviours so our responses are correct for the situation at hand. Once you realise that autistic children crave predictability, and start to realise that they love and need rules in pretty much every area of their lives, it\u2019s a lot easier to understand how to deal with them and importantly, you come to understand something that is otherwise counterintuitive about these children: Their behaviour and meltdowns are worse than neurotypical children, but they are much less \u201cnaughty\u201d than neurotypical children are too. They can have cheeky streaks, they like to have fun, but if there is a rule in place and they know the rule, they don\u2019t want to break it. It gives their lives the predictability they crave, in a world which seems out of control. As parents, it is up to us to help him control that world, and to teach him how to cope with it when the world gets unpredictable again, as it always will. So next time you see a child tantruming, be careful before you jump on your high-horse and start offering out your latest and greatest discipline advice. Or give out that holier-than-thou stare. Offer help if you can, and if you can\u2019t, maybe give a kind sympathetic smile, and be glad it\u2019s not you in that position. For some of us discipline isn\u2019t as simple as a chapter in a parenting book. \u00a0 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Koerperstrafe-_MA_Birkenrute.png"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/discipline-and-autism/", "title": "Discipline and Autism"},
{"date": "November 20, 2010", "body": "\n Image by jonycunha via Flickr \n Autism affects almost every aspect of the person\u2019s life \u2013 their speech, movements, relationships, senses, their very thought-patterns. And so (the argument goes), to love a person with autism, is to love autism \u2013 the person and the condition cannot be separated. At first blush that may sound true, even profound, and some would say, beautiful. But it makes many errors in its reasoning, and leads to conclusions which  threaten progress for people who are affected by autism \u2013 particularly  those progresses that give them the right and ability to choose the life  they want to lead. Indeed those who think autism is part-and-parcel of the person\u2019s identity, often go further and say they prefer people who have autism: That their truthfulness, talents and diversity make them better than your average neurotypical (meaning a person who is not autistic). Again, that might look like a harmless and beautiful notion, and an interesting way to view the world. As lovely as it may sound, it has real impact on people\u2019s lives and futures; these are not simply pretty thoughts for philosophy students in ivory towers. This can only be an introductory post to the huge controversy; it will take many future posts to do the topic justice. I will though briefly introduce my own view: People are more than the sum of their abilities and disabilities. I love my son, and not  because  he has autism. The autism doesn\u2019t make him a better person, or a worse person, those are moral assessments which come from decisions individuals make in their lives. You cannot hold someone morally (or legally) responsible for things they did not choose. The importance of that capacity to choose \u2013 to make meaningful decisions about how they want to live their own lives, and then to take responsibility for those choices \u2013 is why we shouldn\u2019t simply love autism. Overcoming the daily challenges that autistic people face, would not remove the interesting ways in which the autistic mind works (which, contrary to some popular myths, does not designate that person as prone to genius). My son will always have autism, but I will not let it limit or dictate his life. It is my job as his parent to help him achieve independence \u2013 to help him be able to live the life he chooses even after I am gone. This is about more than public attitudes to autistic people, this is about something that objectively stands in the way of his freedom and independence, how could I love that..? \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/40279385@N08/4278434497"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/autism-choice-and-morality/", "title": "Autism, Choice, and\u00a0Morality."},
{"date": "November 21, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I am told that my son has  not only the right to a free education, but the right to an inclusive education : I am told that I may \u2013 and should \u2013 insist that he be educated within the mainstream framework, and not be \u201csegregated\u201d off into a special needs school. That this would be best for him, for other students, and for society as a whole. Indeed certain lobby groups for special needs individuals, go so far as to say  special needs schools should be shut down entirely . But before we all sit around the camp-fire and link hands to sing kumbaya, there is an important question to be asked. Is inclusive mainstream education really the best option going, or would I just be insisting on a right to the wrong education? The modern reality is that mainstream schools are not equipped to deal with special needs children. Their grounds are often not made with these students in mind, their staff are not trained to cope with these children, and the funding is insufficient to provide the extra support they need. The argument that these short-falls should be addressed so that children with special needs can be included in mainstream schooling, is superficially attractive, but does not bypass the fact that in the meantime these children will not be receiving a quality education. It\u2019s still common to encounter the out-dated notion that the main alternative for these children \u2013 special needs schools \u2013 are places where difficult students are put to be forgotten and ignored. But I suggest that the reality is the opposite \u2013 that it is the mainstream schools where the special needs children are often treated as too difficult and unwanted. The perception that special needs schools are filled with children left to rock or drool in corners, unchallenged and untaught, in no way matches the modern reality of a bustling institution of teachers and therapists trained and dedicated to improving the lives of very challenging children. Their aim is to teach these children what would in fact have been left untaught in a mainstream school \u2013 such as the most basic social and life skills, the things required for independent living which are largely taken for granted (and justifiably so) at mainstream schools. Because of the impressive teacher-child ratios at the special needs schools, no one is forgotten about or left to quietly drool away \u2013 ratios which are unseen in mainstream schools. It is at the mainstream schools that these children are far more likely to be swept under the carpet as too hard to deal with, or even worse \u2013 punished for behaviours outside of their control. It is not then surprising that figures show that high-needs children who start at mainstream schools, often end up later at special needs schools as the reality kicks in \u2013 both for the mainstream school which had been trying to cope with them, and for the parents who want the best for their child. And that is what this comes down to: What is best for that child? It is a wonderful thing to want an inclusive society where disabilities are treated as a normal part of the human mosaic. But I suggest that inclusiveness is often better served by giving these special needs children the high level of care and tailored attention that they need when they are children within the education system, which will give them the skills and knowledge to integrate as best they can as adults. There is too much of a modern emphasis on the idea that children are best served by being around many other children, who are of their same age. The focus needs to shift to one of\u00a0 developmental stage and quality (rather than quantity) of interactions. Various educational systems (which are not mainstream) already recognise the importance of this approach \u2013 such as Montessori, homeschooling, and of course special education where children can vary widely in age but are grouped according to actual ability. \u201cAge is just a number\u201d is more than\u00a0 just a platitude for defensive middle-aged women. The best approach is to give to each child, what is best for that child. Whether that be the intensive care at a special needs school, the intermediate stage of a satellite class in a mainstream setting, or a mix of classes at each level as suits the specific child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes homeschooling will be best, which is another under-appreciated and largely misunderstood education option. Sometimes what is best for a special needs child is a mainstream education. But grouping together all children in an educational institution, based on their age and not their developmental stage or actual needs, is not the best approach \u2013 for the special needs child, for children without special needs, nor for society. The right to choose what education is best for your child, is a better approach, than the right to mainstream your special needs child. For now at least this is somewhat recognised at a governmental level. It\u2019s a shame that some charitable organisations set up to advocate for these vulnerable people, don\u2019t think that the parents should have that right to choose. *** A couple of very good articles which deal with a variety of the issues discussed above: \u201c Every right to special help \u201d NZ Herald \u201c Special Needs Special Children \u201d Father & Child \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nh-students.JPG", "http://www.ihc.org.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=1567", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2470269/Call-to-scrap-special-schools", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/primary-education/news/article.cfm?c_id=288&objectid=10441837", "http://fatherandchild.org.nz/magazine/issue-41/special-needs-special-children/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/a-right-to-the-wrong-education/", "title": "A Right to the Wrong\u00a0Education?"},
{"date": "November 26, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My first son was frequently called a \u201cperfect baby\u201d. Within a couple of months, he\u2019d sleep a good eight hours in a row at night. He had many long day naps as he got older, and wouldn\u2019t wake easily. He was quite passive; he wouldn\u2019t crawl around to explore his environment even though he\u2019d learnt the skill. You could place him down somewhere and he\u2019d pretty much stay there, though he preferred to stay in his car seat than be held or put on the floor \u2013 all the easier, right..? So easy to care for, so placid, so quiet. What a lucky mummy. Well guess what; babies are meant to be hard work. They are meant to make your days and nights difficult, sleepless and noisy, with their desire to be up and experiencing everything and be a part of it all. I would have swapped that early \u201ceasy\u201d stage for all the normal difficulties in a heart-beat. Because the ease of those early times were a sign that something was very wrong \u2013 that our lives would gradually turn into an incomprehensible nightmare . Those who were praising me for being such a natural parent and cracking the sleeping routine so fast, should have been raising an eyebrow and raising some questions about my child\u2019s behaviour (or lack of behaviour) instead. It was all the more confusing and cruel then as I moved from being called a wonderful natural mother, to a negligent sub-standard one, as my son\u2019s developmental issues started to emerge. Those around us should have realised the possibility that the cause was inherent to my son, instead of variously blaming or praising my mothering skills for his unusual behaviours from such a young age. I relied on the expertise and experience of other people, letting it drown out that nagging motherly instinct that told me something simply wasn\u2019t right here. I love my autistic son without reservation, but autism is not something beautiful or wonderful, it is a cruel curse that can show signs from early in a baby\u2019s life (some instances of autism do appear later in a child\u2019s life, usually because of a known genetic condition which we don\u2019t suffer from as a family, I\u2019ll be discussing this in a future post). The differences from a \u201cnormal\u201d baby, are astoundingly obvious now that I have had a second son. My husband and I have weekly, and sometimes daily, \u201ceureka\u201d moments as we watch our second son grow up (and he\u2019s not even a year old yet); we frequently say to each other \u201cso that\u2019s what a baby is meant to do!\u201d. We are often worn-out by what our second son puts us through, but we also get all the laughter and satisfaction and triumphs that we missed out on with our autistic son as a baby. Milestones that are natural and easy progressions for my second born, are hard-fought achievements that have taken years for my first-born \u2013 some things my eleven month old has mastered, are still difficulties for my five-year old. So each night that I lose sleep to suit my baby\u2019s needs, the days I spend running after his non-stop crawling and exploring antics, I remind myself to smile through my exhaustion; because this is the beautiful price I am paying for a child without autism. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sleeping_baby_in_crib.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/26/the-perfect-little-autistic-baby/", "title": "The Perfect Little (Autistic)\u00a0Baby"},
{"date": "November 22, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I coloured my world all the shades of guilt during the months after my son\u2019s diagnosis. I used the classics (\u201cdid I do something wrong during my pregnancy, did I cause this with vaccines?\u201d) and threw in some extremes too (\u201cit\u2019s my fault he\u2019s alive, so it\u2019s my fault he\u2019s autistic\u201d). But the most enduring guilt I carried for a good year or so, was that I didn\u2019t get it diagnosed soon enough, and wasn\u2019t doing enough since getting the diagnosis. Specifically, I had taken seriously the idea that early intervention was absolutely critical and that if therapies weren\u2019t underway before he was three, then it was already too late. I knew something was wrong from much earlier than three years old, but I had done some research, narrowed it down to autism, and had read that autism wasn\u2019t typically diagnosed until three years old, and that attempts at doing so earlier could lead to an incorrect (or negative) diagnosis which could be a costly and time-consuming mistake. So I did what I thought was the right thing, and I waited. Turned out I was wrong. (Hey guess what, the internet is not your best guide to autism..!) Not only was I wrong about it not being able to be diagnosed until a child was three, turns out that leaving it that late was going to severely hurt his chances of a normal life (apparently). I kept reading about how  crucial   early   intervention  was \u2013 a message backed up by the therapists we worked with. Made all the worse by how many months it took between diagnosis and the therapists being free to take my son on as a client. Once the therapies were under way, the message of \u201cdo more, do it quicker, hurry it\u2019s really too late already\u201d drove me to push myself to my limits, and then feel all the more guilty for not being able to push myself further. So many times I sought reassurance that it wasn\u2019t too late for him to develop language or a bright future, and each time I just got the same repeated messages \u201cearly intervention, earlier the better, long-term prognosis dependent on earliest possible intervention\u201d. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. I would be exhausted, in tears, angry, sad, defeated from trying so hard to do so much, and all the time feeling guilty for feeling that way. Each day felt like a ticking time-bomb that I had to utilise as much as possible. Any time I stopped to take a break during the day, I soon forced myself get back into the fray. I\u2019d argue a lot with my husband that we shouldn\u2019t be taking breaks, each hour mattered. It put a rift in our marriage while he tried to stay sane, tried to help me stay sane, and I wouldn\u2019t let us take the breaks we needed so much. Turns out that early intervention is a nice idea, and can sure be helpful, but it is not the ultimate predictor of future success that I\u2019d been made to believe. It is essential that the parents look after themselves for the health of the marriage, the child, the family as a whole. I had been risking all of that, under the mistaken belief that I\u2019d done everything too late. Driven by guilt to try to catch up on the impossible. If there\u2019s a moral to the story it is this: It is never too late to improve the life and future of your child. You are very likely to experience guilt for not doing more, and doing it sooner, regardless of how soon you identify autism. Those feelings are perfectly natural. Don\u2019t feel guilty for feeling guilty (yes, that is possible)! Just remind yourself that a vital part of doing the best by your child, is looking after yourself in the process. You soon learn to not let autism rule your child\u2019s life, it\u2019s important to not let autism rule your life as a parent either. *** An excellent article pointing out that early intervention is not the be-all-end-all:  Early Intervention and Autism. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism-stacking-cans_2nd_edit.jpg", "http://www.autism-help.org/intervention-autism-aspergers-introduction.htm", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/06/040616063622.htm", "http://insciences.org/article.php?article_id=7748", "http://autism.about.com/od/childrenandautism/a/EIImportant.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/hurry-up-hes-three-already/", "title": "Hurry up, he\u2019s three\u00a0already..!"},
{"date": "November 28, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Intelligence is a tricky thing to measure, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and suggest my husband and I do pretty well \u2013 we both have postgraduate degrees, have both been lecturers, my IQ is around the mid 130\u2019s and my husband is about 145. So we had an expectation that our children would fare well in this area too. After we found out our eldest son was autistic, we\u2019d joke with each other that we\u2019d overshot the mark, since autism is often conflated with genius. But what was a passing joke between us as parents, is taken quite seriously by others, as a reason to see autism as a wonderful condition to be celebrated rather than \u201cfought\u201d. In fact some people appear to view autism as a requisite for genius, because it tends to mean the affected brain will focus (overly) intently on a particular subject, and will view the world in a different light than us \u201cnormal\u201d people do. It\u2019s common to attempt to characterise past and current geniuses as autistic ( Einstein ,  Bill Gates ). In turn, people who believe this often think we shouldn\u2019t try to fix or change autistic people, in part because doing so would deprive the world of their genius, and perhaps of genius in general. While it\u2019s true that being autistic doesn\u2019t automatically make you below average intelligence, neither does it make you a genius. Autistic people sit across the whole range of intelligence, and intelligence is a reliable marker for how well an autistic person will fare in their life. But neither is autism a requisite for being a genius \u2013 people who aren\u2019t afflicted can also have off-the-chart levels of intelligence, and create inventions and discover knowledge that makes the world a better place to live. The attempt that some people make to characterise all genius as containing some level of autism have made the error of thinking that intense focus is an exclusively autistic trait; that the lack of social skills and personal hygiene that often go along with dedication to a topic, are evidence of autism rather than just a supremely focused person who has chosen priorities for their life. Otherwise you might as well call every slob who would rather play computer games in their pyjamas all day, than go to work or school, autistic. These errors in reasoning about the link between autism and genius, in part comes about because of thinking about autism in terms of \u201cautistic traits\u201d, rather than as a clearly defined condition that some people have, and other people do not have. Tests like the  Autism Quotient test  lend people to think of autism as something totally normal people carry around to some extent \u2013 so blurring the boundaries of the condition that saying someone is diagnosed as being autistic gets treated as just an extreme type of personality rather than a seriously disabling condition. These errors are assisted by the fact that the typical autistic person looks just like anyone else \u2013 they don\u2019t have distinct facial or physical features such as children with Downs Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. It is not harmless musings when people are posthumously diagnosed as autistic due to their genius. It has the effect I\u2019ve referred to above of blurring the boundaries of a very serious condition, but it also can seriously offend the surviving family members who aren\u2019t exactly keen on their relative being used for other people\u2019s agendas. These posthumous diagnoses classically rely on choosing the traits that fit an autistic person, and totally ignoring those that don\u2019t, and are usually gleaned from biographies, which again are written second-hand\u00a0 and with a particular lean in mind: Biographers are more likely to include and group together outrageous behaviours of their subjects, than use and refer to the mundane things we all do and achieve everyday \u2013 the things that mark us out as less likely to be autistic. This can equally be true of autobiographies. While I understand the desire to make autistic people feel appreciated and wanted in society at large, I do not think this is best done by the means and poor reasoning used by people who run autism and genius together in the ways I\u2019ve spoken about in this post. Autism is a hugely varied condition \u2013 it is after all, called a spectrum disorder. To do all autistic people justice \u2013 to get each one the help they need to live as fulfilling lives as possible \u2013 we need to deal with the truths and realities of autism, which is often a seriously disabling condition. Autism is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for genius. *** Some excellent posts by other people touching on topics raised here: \u201c Undiagnosing Gates, Jefferson and Einstein \u201d by Jonathan Mitchell ( Autism\u2019s Gadfly ) \u201c Diagnosing Historical Figures: Biblical Autism \u201d and a good piece  about the Autism Quotient test , by  Autism Jabberwocky And a more recent example of posthumous diagnosis being controversial, disputed and harmful, here re  Janet Frame . \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Albert_Einstein_Head_cleaned.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_figures_sometimes_considered_autistic", "http://grandunifiedweekly.com/is-bill-gates-autistic-temple-grandin-thinks-so/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Quotient", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html", "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/11/diagnosing-historical-figures-biblical.html", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/10/think-you-have-autism-dont-take-quiz.html", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch/38315"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/intelligence-autism-and-genius/", "title": "Intelligence, Autism, and\u00a0Genius"},
{"date": "November 29, 2010", "body": "\n Image by Kables via Flickr \n One of the most obvious behaviours that sets my five-year old son apart from other children, is what we have always called his \u201chappy dance\u201d: When he is excited or very happy, instead of simply laughing or smiling, he will flap both of his forearms up and down very fast, stamp both of his feet as he rocks his body side to side, and hum. Sometimes he\u2019ll do this while he runs back and forwards, sometimes he\u2019ll just do it on the spot. The more excited he is, the more exaggerated the movements and louder the hum, and the longer it will go on. Since we\u2019d seen him growing up doing this dance, we thought nothing of it, except how wonderful it was that he was so happy. But as he got older it became obvious his peers weren\u2019t acting in anything like the same manner, and would stare at him and avoid him once he got into this state. I knew something was definitely wrong by the time other parents of the same aged children started to ask me what he was doing, and whether he was doing it because he was angry. At one stage I was smiling at my boy doing his happy dance, and suddenly realised every other child and parent in the area was staring in a confused or disapproving manner. Coming from an autistic child, this sort of behaviour is typically called \u201c stimming \u201c, or \u201cself-stimulation\u201d. How to deal with it, and whether to deal with it at all, is one of the controversies within the autistic community. Our initial feeling about it as parents, was that it was how he expressed his happiness, and it didn\u2019t hurt anyone, so it was fine. His therapists pointed out to us early on that his stimming would mark him out as different from his peers and therefore was a socially undesirable behaviour that would have to be eventually addressed and removed. The ways in which they thought this could be achieved varied from therapist to therapist. His speech therapist figured it would be corrected by providing words (we\u2019d tell him to say \u201cI am happy\u201d) to replace the stimming, since it was an attemp at communication. His occupational therapist figured it was a behaviour used to deal with sensory issues, so lots of deep pressure (essentially tight hugging across his whole body) would help reduce the stimming. Other methods of fixing the behaviour were proposed by other therapists too \u2013 such as using distraction when he started stimming to try to move him on from the behaviour (and consequently on from what was making him so happy at the time). \u201cReplacing\u201d the behaviour with words, works very briefly in the same way that giving him any distraction at the time works \u2013 because what it is doing is taking his attention off what is making him so happy, and therefore actually curtailing his happiness rather than \u201creplacing the behaviour\u201d. Those methods have never had an impact on his stimming beyond that interruption at that exact time; they didn\u2019t universalize to stop his stimming more generally. The deep pressure had no impact at all on his stimming, because it is based on what would appear to be a false understanding of the function of his happy dance \u2013 he\u2019s not stimming because he is having sensory issues at the time (though this appears to be true of the stimming of some autistic children), rather he is only stimming because he is happy. Deep pressure does work very well with my son when he is distraught or overwhelmed, but a happy dance does not fall into this category. The most upsetting attempt to curtail this socially undesirable behaviour happened at an  ABA  play-group for autistic preschoolers. ABA continues to be a controversial technique for dealing with autistic children, though it is gaining increasing mainstream acceptance. I found the ABA preschool group very useful in many ways, in particular it introduced me to other parents going through the same issues, it helped me better understand autism generally, and it gave me some useful methods for encouraging my son to interact with other people and his world. But their one main teaching that I could never feel OK about, was the efforts to completely stamp out my son\u2019s stimming: Once my son had relaxed enough to enjoy the group \u2013 he went from constant tantrums there to eventually actively enjoying the activities \u2013 he was happy enough to start stimming. For example, he would be listening to a book being read to everyone and he would start doing his happy dance in his chair. At the time I was so relieved to see him enjoying himself, and thought the ABA therapists there would be accepting of this typically autistic behaviour. Instead they would touch and hold him until he stopped stimming, and tell me to do the same. I was quite heart-broken and upset when it became clear what they intended to do each time, because he didn\u2019t like being touched, and it distracted from what had made him happy, so it would either make him sad or even lead to a meltdown. It felt like he was being punished for being happy. I told myself at the time that this was like the other aspects of what they had taught us \u2013 I just had to trust them and their experience. But it never felt right, and again my son never universalized it; it didn\u2019t reduce his stimming behaviour in general. We continued to not be able to control his stimming, despite trying the variety of methods taught to us by \u201cexperts\u201d. And I remained in two hearts and minds about whether it was the right thing to do, even if the methods we had been given to \u201cfix\u201d it  had  worked. It was also apparent that a lot of the advice we were receiving about how and why to stop his stimming, stemmed from theories that didn\u2019t seem to match the fact that he would only stim when he was happy. And then I came across something that made everything click into place. Finally we had the explanation which matched our experiences with our son, and made sense within the developmental delays that characterise autism. It\u2019s too long to repeat it all here, and I want to strongly encourage parents with children who stim, to read the entire piece for themselves. So here is  the link . Click it. Read it. It\u2019s important. Essentially it explains that the stimming my son is using, is a result of his developmental delays, and that they will reduce as he progresses \u2013 specifically as his neural connectivity matures. It also deals with other reasons for stimming, which apply to other behaviours my son displays besides his most obvious happy dance stim. I now better understand his stimming, and have real hope for its eventual cessation. I\u2019m left with the problem of helping him to fit into a classroom situation next year \u2013 his happy dance is likely to otherwise interfere with his and other students\u2019 learning. But already I know my son understands that different situations call for different behaviours, and that he is very likely to learn that you\u2019re not meant to happy dance at school. To reinforce this and still allow him the outlet for his excitement, I do intend to let him happy dance in the safe and accepting environment of his home. We all have socially undesirable behaviours (nose-picking, crotch-scratching, knuckle-cracking, horse-like laughs, a tendency to use fists instead of words), some of which we do in public, some of which we do only in our homes. If the principal socially undesirable behaviour my son exhibits is doing an energetic dance when he gets happy, well you know, I think that\u2019s one of the lesser evils of autism. It might even be a better world if we all did a little more happy dancing, and a little less trying to squash other people\u2019s expressions of joy. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/52232708@N00/9287614", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimming", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis", "http://autismtomorrows.blogspot.com/2010/03/self-stimulation-or-stimming-yet.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/a-dance-of-joy/", "title": "A Dance of\u00a0Joy"},
{"date": "November 9, 2011", "body": "Image via Wikipedia Tonight I stumbled upon  a brief story on the local current affairs show \u201cCampbell Live\u201d , about the mainstreaming of special needs children. The story was about some special needs classrooms shutting down, meaning that these children \u2013 some of whom had already been failed by mainstreaming \u2013 were being forced into mainstream classrooms. The moment the boy who primarily featured in the story appeared on-screen, violently lashing out at his father, I knew the word \u201cautism\u201d wasn\u2019t far behind; it was like watching my own son from a couple of years ago. A reminder of how far we\u2019ve come, and how hard it is for so many families out there. The story was about special needs children in general rather than just autistic children, but I was that much more emotionally invested in the story at the sight of this little boy so like my own. The story was too light on detail to really get a grasp on the cause of the issues and the entitlements of the children at issue. I\u2019m guessing that could have been clarified if the Minister for Education had agreed to appear to discuss the issue on the show. She declined. I would have liked to know if these children were under ORS or were relying on the school\u2019s own pool of funding (I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s ORS). I also got the impression the classrooms at issue were run within mainstream schools rather than as satellite classes through a special needs school (which is my son\u2019s situation). Leaving questions too of what alternative special needs education would be available to these children (is there perhaps a local special needs school they could enrol at instead?) The classroom set-up at issue appears to be a left-over of previous governmental approaches to special needs; John Campbell mentioned that ten years ago the Labour government decided to move towards mainstreaming all children, and that these classrooms were a remnant of that movement. Giving the impression that this is not a sign of things to come for other current set-ups, just the tidying up of a dated anomaly. Again, I\u2019m reaching here because I couldn\u2019t get enough details from the piece. The parents they interviewed were considering homeschooling as perhaps the only real alternative, since they knew mainstreaming had already failed their autistic son. I\u2019m not against homeschooling as an option for those parents who are actively interested and able to make the most of that option, but the impact of homeschooling on a family and its income are significant. The other alternative voiced was taking their family to a country that cares for their child. I was a little taken aback by that statement; New Zealand is incredibly generous and caring to my son, I adore the education set-up and support he receives. Maybe I\u2019m just in the \u201cright\u201d part of the country, but this family was at least in the same city as I am. Again, without knowing what alternatives exist in their area \u2013 such as whether their son is entitled to and could attend the local special needs school \u2013 it\u2019s hard to draw any well-(in)formed opinions and conclusions. The story decided to focus not just on the impact on the special needs children if they were mainstreamed. They also considered the extra time and stress it would place on the teachers left to deal with the children in the mainstream classes; the families\u2019 home-life (impact on marriages was an example); and the threat their children posed to the mainstream children. Unfortunately, in the discussion that followed on the  Campbell Live Facebook page , the vast majority of the comments focus on the exact sort of arguments and myths that I have been fighting since I started this blog, like those who think that special needs schools are black holes; dumping grounds where difficult children are forgotten and left uneducated (have these people ever even set a foot inside these schools?). The presumption that mainstream schools are actually better schools than special needs schools \u2013 with better teachers and providing a better education \u2013 sits at the base of a lot of such claims. The teacher-child ratios, knowledge and skills that go into educating my son at his special school, are astounding. I am honoured and happy they have accepted him; a special needs school was not my last option, it was my first, and I was lucky to have that choice. I also found myself getting rather annoyed at those who think the  primary  issue is how this affects the normal kiddies, not how this impacts on the actual education of special needs children; the people talking about how great it would be for them to learn to accept difference by having special children in class with them everyday \u2013 what a great life-learning opportunity it is for the normal kids. Oh great, so pleased to know my son is the means to the end of someone  else\u2019s  child becoming more tolerant; because that\u2019s the most important issue here, right? The social education of  everyone else\u2019s  child. And there\u2019s no way to learn this tolerance in any other situation either, aye, it\u2019s not like special needs children exist in general society or in extended family, and of course being around special needs children always turns out well for tolerance levels; there\u2019s no bullying or stereotypes, everything is sunshine and lollipops. Yeah. So the story has stirred up a confused little hornet\u2019s nest. It doesn\u2019t appear that more details would have stopped the sort of comments I\u2019ve been reading about the story, but it would have helped settle the nerves and concerns of those of us who are living a life intimately affected by these questions. It has been a chance to get a feel for the public sentiment on the issue, and the public attitude towards people like my son and the school he attends. I\u2019m hoping the Education Minister will change her mind and front up to discuss the issue properly. But I\u2019m not holding my breath. *** Edit: Since writing this post I\u2019ve found out more about the situation of these families. These children\u2019s needs are not severe enough to qualify them for the main special needs funding available in New Zealand ( ORS funding ). They have \u201cmoderate needs\u201d. The special units they were attending were funded in a way that is apparently not consistent with how the funding was meant to be used. The government is acting to return the funding to how it was originally intended, which is also meant to widen the availability of the specially trained teachers to other needy students who are currently missing out. The up-shot of this is the potential closure of these already existing (and apparently much-loved and well-run) special units. I\u2019ve gleamed this information from a variety of sources, including news stories, press releases, government websites, and particularly from  this website  run by the affected families themselves. This is obviously a complex issue, and my little paragraph summary above is just my effort to make sense of those complexities. Do feel free to enlighten me further or add to the picture if you perhaps are intimately affected by these changes, I\u2019d be happy to hear from you. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Campbell_Live.jpeg", "http://www.3news.co.nz/Special-needs-children-face-mainstreaming/tabid/367/articleID/232211/Default.aspx", "http://www.facebook.com/CampbellLiveNZ/posts/10150929184220226", "http://nzparentsfordedicatedrtlbs.wikispaces.com/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/commentary-on-the-campbell-live-story-about-mainstreaming-special-needs-children/", "title": "Commentary on the Campbell Live story about mainstreaming special needs\u00a0children"},
{"date": "November 17, 2011", "body": "Taking a break from looking after my autistic son was something I desperately needed, but couldn\u2019t get. Not because I couldn\u2019t find people willing to look after him; once I figured out where to look there were plenty of people willing to take my money. The problem was finding someone who was able to do it in a way that didn\u2019t back-fire on both my son and myself; making our lives harder rather than better. I became very adept at interviewing potential carers. And if I gave them enough talking space they would babble to the point of revealing what type of carer they were and how they thought about autistic people. Sometimes the problems with these candidates were obvious. There was a particular young man who told me boldly that he could handle my son; he looked after lots of autistic children and enjoyed it. Sounded like a good start. I explained that sometimes my son would need alone-time; when stimulation and interaction got too much, he had to pick up on the signs and step back. The young man\u2019s face lit up and he relaxed. He confidently told me that was the reason he so loved looking after autistic children; because you didn\u2019t have to do anything with them at all. You could just sit back and leave them to do whatever they liked, without having to interact in the slightest. Next please\u2026 There were the times I thought I\u2019d found someone great, who just ended up creating new anxieties and behavioural problems in my son. One (unknown to me at the time) frequently squeezed his cheeks and told him how cute he was (completely un-necessary, no matter how cute my son was), which became a hard-fought behaviour of my son digging his nails into either side of my mouth and squeezing until my cheeks were marked and I was in tears with the pain. One of his carer\u2019s English pronunciation was poor, so that my son\u2019s basic language ability reduced and we ended up with more tantrums on our hands because we couldn\u2019t understand the new words she\u2019d taught him. Little problems cropped up all the time and evolved into bigger problems, and were never easily overcome. Because I didn\u2019t always know where the problems came from, I didn\u2019t know what was going on or how to fix it. For example, I thought he was trying to hurt me when he grabbed and pinched my face because he had a previous  history of not letting me talk . It wasn\u2019t until I accidentally happened upon his carer squeezing his cheeks so gleefully that I figure out what was going on; it turned out he wasn\u2019t actually trying to hurt me or was angry at those times, he thought he was just using an acceptable way to interact with others. Sometimes the carers assumed he was stupid or unaware, thus creating problems too. Like the one who couldn\u2019t be bothered reading his story-book to him and would just flick through the pages making the words up to make it shorter. My son had memorized the words in that book and was quite upset and confused when she said them all wrong, but he lacked the communicative ability to let her know what she\u2019d done wrong. And this was how these carers were acting when I was around. Makes you wonder what you miss when your back is turned. While these carers looked after my son, I was still in the house. The care would go for an hour or two at the most, and I\u2019d use that time to do chores mostly. I couldn\u2019t just leave them alone with my son because he always had a tantrum or behaviour they either couldn\u2019t handle or didn\u2019t understand, so I was required like an on-call interpreter and a soother, to try to bring my son back into a manageable frame of mind for them. If I didn\u2019t intervene, and left them to try to sort it out themselves (which I tried many times), the tantrums typically escalated to the point that the rest of their caring session was spent trying to calm him down, and I\u2019d be left with an anxiety ridden child for the rest of the day after they left. Sometimes the carers would decide to try something they\u2019d heard about or tried with other autistic children. Like facilitated communication, or some other method of teaching my child that at times expressly went against what we were currently using with him or frankly just went against good science. Most of the time they would talk to me about it first, but some of the time they would just use their \u201cinitiative\u201d or automatically incorporate it into their time with him. Using multiple methods to deal with a specific problem with my son, often just confused him and wore him out, and would lead to further confusion as we as his parents and other people tried to make sense of what he was trying to communicate or achieve. There were times when having more than one method was intentional and helpful (like using sign language and PECS), but various methods undercut and undermine rather than support each other. Consistency across therapies is a tricky business, one that took a lot of time and effort on my behalf to balance between all his therapists and therapies. I was the one constant overseeing it all. Having a carer interject something new without thought or knowledge as to how it meshed with the rest of his therapies, introduced anolamies that helped no one. Many times I felt more exhausted and upset after the carer had left, than before they\u2019d arrived. I persisted with these carer hours though because people kept telling me how important it was to leave him in other people\u2019s care, and take the time for myself. But my son\u2019s needs were so high and so unique that it never really worked out well for anyone, except that person walking out the door with my cash. Thankfully \u2013 most of the time \u2013 that money was given back to me by a Trust that supplies funds for these carer hours, so I wasn\u2019t too out-of-pocket. (On a side note, there were some frustrating rules attached to that carer money from the Trust, such as I couldn\u2019t use it to pay any extended family members or to pay someone while I was working.) This is not to say he didn\u2019t have a couple of fantastic carers in his life in those early years. There were two who were dedicated to him and my family. So much so that I came to see them as personal friends, who I could trust alone with my son for a while, and who I could even confide in. I was very isolated during those early years, so having someone to talk to openly, who understood my son so well, was a rare and precious gift in my family\u2019s life. These days finding time for myself by passing my son onto carers, is largely not an issue anymore. My son is at school five days a week, under someone else\u2019s care that entire time, and I\u2019m fine with that. Because those people looking after him at school are especially trained to deal with his autism and his unique self, maintain consistency in his life, and are in regular contact with me through a daily notebook and IEPs. But especially because my son\u2019s communication has come so far that he can now let strangers know a fairly good idea of what he wants. That increase in communication has predictably come hand-in-hand with lowered anxieties and fewer tantrums. Obviously, if you can make yourself understood and can understand others, there are less triggers for those anxieties and tantrums, and more ways to deal with them when they do occur. His future is looking brighter than I thought possible. It sounds like an easy solution; to tell a mother of a special needs child that she should take time for herself, and let other people take over the care of her child for a while. But the reality and consequences of that aren\u2019t the same as for passing over a child who doesn\u2019t have special needs. Sometimes \u2013 as with my son \u2013 passing a high needs child on to someone else can make life harder. At those times, the focus instead needs to be on equipping that mother and that child with the skills and knowledge required to reach the independence from each other that most families take for granted. It\u2019s not about the mother being \u201cover-protective.\u201d It\u2019s not about \u201csmothering\u201d the child. It\u2019s about listening to the parent\u2019s concerns and realising that the simple solutions to a normal mother\u2019s burn-out (such as time away from the child), is not necessarily the best solution for all mothers. I did what I felt to be right for my son at the time, and it has turned out to be the right thing for him \u2013 and me \u2013 in the long-run too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/the-problem-with-carers/", "title": "The Problem with\u00a0Carers"},
{"date": "November 20, 2011", "body": "A  recent news story  about a violent seven-year old autistic boy who has been excluded from the mainstream school he was attending, has started a  passionate discussion  about whether the school or the parent is in the right: Has the school let the child down, and reacted wrongly by excluding the child, or has the parent insisted on the wrong education for their son and being the one to let the child down? Should the parent \u2013 could the parent \u2013 have done more to stop things reaching this point? And is the parent\u2019s response to the situation the correct response (she\u2019s protesting outside the school). Image by Whole Wheat Toast via Flickr As usual, it\u2019s hard to reach firm opinions on the precise case since news stories present only so many facts, and the information gaps are often crucial. But the story does raise wider questions about what we as parents should do when the education system has let our children down, either because it can\u2019t or won\u2019t deal with the challenges our autistic children present in a classroom. Do we fight to change the system by protesting, and refusing to place our children elsewhere than our preferred school (or fight the system in some other way while choosing alternative education options than our preferred option)? Do we move suburbs, cities, even countries to get our child closest to the best education option we can afford. Or do we supplement our child\u2019s education in every way possible to adapt them to the less-than-perfect situation they are forced into (for example, using behavioural therapies outside of class hours, and ourselves paying for extra support and training for the teachers). That\u2019s not an exhaustive list of reactions a parent might have to such situations, but it serves the purposes of launching my discussion here. When we moved house a couple of years ago, I was mindful of how our move would affect my son\u2019s education entitlements. We didn\u2019t move out of range of his service providers at the time, but we did shift into an area with a well-respected special needs school. Now that we\u2019re thinking about the best education for my youngest, we are carefully considering where the best place to live for his education will be, and balancing it against staying in zone for my eldest son\u2019s schooling. Which is to say, that like a very large number of other families, we will move into whatever area we can afford, that gives our children \u2013 whether they have special needs or not \u2013 the best education suited to their needs. Moving to find education is not an ideal, it would be nice to have a perfect school on every street corner, nevertheless it is a reality of being a parent and even an adult seeking tertiary education; you move if you have to, and if you possibly can. Of course moving is not possible for all, and in countries like this you\u2019re told you can expect a high standard of education no matter what region you live in; that education is meant to be standardised across the country, and is regularly audited and only staffed by those properly trained. So what happens when you\u2019re let down by what\u2019s on offer, and you were told it was meant to be better than it was? You can take your issues to the school board, the government, the press. You can write books, and blogs and tell anyone who will listen. You can also get involved at an administrative level to bring in the change you believe is required. However, surely all of those options come second to finding the best possible education for your child in the meantime. While you fight the good fight, you still need to find a place to educate your child, or must be willing to homeschool them yourself; not just because the law says so, but because it is the right thing for your child. If you don\u2019t have the time or can\u2019t afford to homeschool, and there really is no alternative education option, then you adapt. You make it right however you can, by supplementing the child\u2019s education or therapies, or by providing the school and teachers with what they need to do right by your child. You may think you shouldn\u2019t have to do this extra work and take on this extra expense, but life as a parent \u2013 especially a parent of a special needs child \u2013 is full of things we wish we didn\u2019t have to do and feel we shouldn\u2019t be required to do. But we do it anyway, because this is about our children. I think parents must be willing to question their own assumptions about the benefits of mainstream schooling and the supposed disbenefits of special needs schooling, when they find their child not working out in their preferred setting between the two. What matters always is what is in the best interests of that specific child, and at that time. There might be a fantastic local special needs school, with passionate and highly skilled teachers, which far exceeds the resources of the local mainstream school. Or the local mainstream school might be the worst in the country. Or swap it around; the local special needs school is the worst, and the local mainstream school is highly resourced and incredibly welcoming of all children regardless of their challenges. When our ideals for our child don\u2019t match the realities on offer, we have to respond to the reality first. Something I see a lot in these stories and hear from quite a few parents, is that autism makes it hard to swap schools because of the change in routine for the child. The fact is the best school for an autistic child at age 5, might not be the best school for them at age 7, or 14. The severity of autism can change over time, and even if it didn\u2019t, the school best suited to your child at the younger age might have an approach that simply doesn\u2019t match your older child. As hard as it is for our children to move schools\u00a0 \u2013 whether between two mainstream schools or shifting from a special needs to a mainstream school, etc \u2013 these hardships and nuisances are worth it if it is what is required for our children to get what they need and deserve. I know my son may not always be at the special needs school he is now, he may out-grow it or it may change in a way that no longer suits him. It\u2019s a nuisance, it stresses me out, and it will stress him out if and when it comes to that, but routine for the sake of routine \u2013 rather than routine formed alongside a quality education \u2013 cannot be the primary driving force. Again, these issues aren\u2019t just present for special needs children either; non-special needs children also get shifted between schools to avoid or seek out particular teachers, administrators, or programs on offer. That diversity between schools \u2013 the same diversity that pushes and pulls us towards one school rather than another \u2013 is not a bad thing. Teaching methods, teachers, children, family values, local values, all these and many other aspects of our lives and schools, mean a one-size-fits-all approach to how a school should be set up and who should get to attend it, is not necessarily in every child\u2019s (and family\u2019s) best interests. My primary school years were filled with religious teachings and attending religious locations and festivals. That would have been seen as a waste of time and money for other families who want the education to be focused on perhaps purely academic persuits. Similarly, my son has physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, social skills etc built into his daily schooling, much or all of that would be a waste of time for other children. My son still learns writing, reading, maths, music, even cooking; his education is rich and diverse. But it is tailored to him and his specific classmates, with specially trained experts whose expertise would have been wasted years of training for dealing with most other children. Again, diversity is not a bad thing. So here\u2019s the opinion I hold about what I\u2019m going to do when the local education system doesn\u2019t match my child\u2019s needs. I will move if I can to an area that has a school that does meet his needs. If I can\u2019t move, I will homeschool him (which used to be my first choice, and is the perfectly good first choice of many families. Homeschooling is generally misunderstand and under-appreciated by wider society.) If I can\u2019t do that, I will supplement his and his teacher\u2019s education as much as possible. And at all times, as long as things are less than perfect for my son and children like him, I will fight the system and make our voices heard; alongside not instead of getting him the education he needs. I do see myself as an idealist; I know what I want for my son and have strong views on the best way for him to get it. But I am always still a realist; responding to the realities of what\u2019s on offer at this point in time and making the most of it. I\u2019m just fortunate enough that my ideals and the reality for my son coincide at this point when it comes to his education. I do not \u2013 have never \u2013 taken that for granted. I hope never to be just one more news story about a mother whose autistic child has fallen not just through the gaps of the existing education system, but right off the grid, in a way that is tearing the family apart. Fight. Move. Adapt. Whatever it takes. We do it. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.starcanterbury.co.nz/news/kicked-out-school-seven/1177002/", "http://www.trademe.co.nz/Community/MessageBoard/Messages.aspx?id=880155&p=1&topic=23", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/15934794@N03/2174308376"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/fight-move-adapt-when-the-local-education-doesnt-match-your-autistic-child/", "title": "Fight, Move, Adapt?

{"date": "November 17, 2011", "body": "Image via Wikipedia One of the many minor political Parties running in the 2011 NZ General Elections, is the Libertarianz Party. Their disability policy can be found on their website,  here . It is the most confrontational disability policy I have encountered so far (but I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a bad thing). I do expect that merely reading the policy will upset \u2013 and indeed confuse \u2013 many potential voters. The policy begins by showing an awareness of the models of disability (that\u2019s a good start); specifically siding with the medical model of disability over the social model: \u201c Disabilities are real physical disorders; blaming \u2018society\u2019 and turning people into victims is completely unhelpful. \u201d They go on to say no one is entitled to disability services, and \u201c We are capable and intelligent; \u201cNanny state\u201d should stop treating people with disabilities like children and let us get on with the job of standing up to the challenges life has handed us. \u201d There seems to be a potential contradiction there. First, they acknowledge that disabilities are real; not mere creations of societal attitudes. And yet it goes on to state that disabled people are capable and intelligent (and so should not be treated like children). Yet the very real disabilities they began by acknowledging,  do  frequently leave the disabled \u2013 including some of those with autism \u2013 in child-like vulnerability; lacking the mental or physical abilities to fend for or care for themselves as \u201ccapable and intelligent\u201d individuals. Disabilities can and do affect both the capabilities and the intellect. This is surely just poor wording choice rather than an actual contradiction in their understanding of the realities of disability; with bold and passionate rhetoric, clarity and detail can get sidelined. Then comes the second seemingly contradictory claim, that \u201c It is your attitude to a disability that is the major determinant of how well you succeed. ..\u201d Note that the disability policy statement began by stating that medical truths  rather than  attitudes, define and create disability. So it seems then that the statement is that the attitudes that matter are not other people\u2019s (\u201csociety\u2019s\u201d), but your own (the disabled individual). I can see the relevance of the division between society\u2019s and personal attitudes, but it seems to be coming awfully close to undercutting the strong starting claim that disability is about actual restrictions and medical issues, not just restrictions created by attitudes. There is room for both ideas simultaneously of course; that disability is medical fact but that attitudes can affect the impact of disability. But this is at the heart of the social model of disability too; that the medical truths underlying disability are made worse by attitudes, though the social model places the emphasis on the attitudes of others, whereas the Libertarianz rhetoric places it on the attitude of the affected individual. Either approach takes note of the importance of attitudes to the reality of disability. I doubt the Libertarianz approach is actually trying to say that societal (or \u201cothers\u201d) attitudes actually have  no  impact on the lives of the disabled (of course they do); rather about what if anything should be  done  about that impact. Whereby their ultimate message is (I think), something like this: Disability is real rather than wholly a societal creation born of poor attitudes and other barriers (such as limited access to buildings). But the impact of disability can be lessened if individuals come to see themselves less as victims (which State support and State sanctioned views encourage) and take charge of their own successes (within the bounds that disability has created in their lives of course). Societal attitudes and barriers may make disabled lives more difficult, but that does not entitle disabled people to the financial and physical support and services from the taxpayer, which brings us to the upcoming point of who is then to provide that support where it is nevertheless needed, and the disabled person themself is unable to provide it through utterly no fault of their own. The Libertarianz disability policy goes on to state that private businesses shouldn\u2019t be forced to provide disability access, but that public institutions (such as courts) should be. That it is in the best interests though of private institutions to make their services available to the widest number of people, including the disabled. The Libertarianz Party holds the view that disability support should be coming from private insurance and charities, rather than the government. But they acknowledge that due to interference and taxes these providers have been hampered, and so special provision would have to be made for the \u201cseverely disabled.\u201d It\u2019s unclear who these severely disabled would be (examples and criteria are not provided, but examples and criteria are rare in political policy statements anyway). In a  recent press release  from the Party, it is again stated that there would be ongoing support for the \u201cpermanently disabled\u201d under a Libertarianz approach. However, there is a difference between being permanently disabled, and being severely disabled. The severely disabled may not be permanently disabled, or may be permanently disabled but not always at the same level of severity. The permanently disabled may be barely disabled. The difference is practical and important. Maybe the idea is that only the permanently and severely disabled would qualify for ongoing support. For autism, I guess this means the most severely autistic might qualify, but considering the ongoing debates about the nature (permanence included) of autism, and how much the severity can be affected with particular (sometimes highly controversial) therapies, I\u2019m not sure where autism would fall in such a scheme. The policy ends with an eye towards a brighter future for the disabled: \u201c Looking to the future, the prognosis is bright: as Western medical and prosthetic technology gets better and better, disabilities will get less and less disabling. \u201d I was left with rather more questions than answers after reading the policy, so I personally emailed the disability spokesman a while back (a couple of weeks or so), for clarification. I was particularly interested in hearing more about the meta-views of disability, since the social and medical model were introduced quite passionately in the policy. I haven\u2019t received a reply. Though the Libertarianz policies will look extreme and even upsetting to some, it is consistent with the other Parties I have looked at so far; in as far as it recognises special protections and exemptions would have to apply to the disabled as a particularly vulnerable group within society. The governmental support for the disabled under the Libertarianz though, is not seen as on ongoing or inherent right (as is often the langauge or intent of the other Parties) so much as a sad necessity of a system that has been affected so drastically by taxation and other interference. I\u2019ll give them this much: They sure do make you think. And so I\u2019m left to ask, what do  you  think..? Please note, I\u2019m not endorsing voting for Libertarianz, and I am not a member of Libertarianz, or indeed any other political party. No one has asked me, or paid me, to write these posts. If I become aware of Libertarianz introducing any major changes to their policy relevant to autism pre the election, I will add it as a dated edit under this paragraph.

{"date": "November 21, 2011", "body": "The Labour Party is one of the two major Political Parties running in this year\u2019s General Election in New Zealand. There\u2019s a lot of information about their disability / autism-relevant policies, drip-fed over the past few months. I\u2019m going to begin with a quick summary of the main sources I am using for this post, and then try to bring the information together, with a focus on autism as usual: \n Labour have only recently released their disability policy, which can be found in detail  here  (pdf), and can be found summarised more generally on their own website  here . \n \u00a0Labour took part in a public meeting about a month back, where Political Parties were invited to share their disability policies. At the time Labour han\u2019t released their policy but still managed to respond to various concerns raised about current disability issues. A summary of that meeting\u2019s discussion can be found  here . \n Labour was one of the few Parties to respond to Autism New Zealand\u2019s questions posed a month or two back, about autism specific issues heading into the election. Their responses can be found  here  (pdf). \n The Labour Party has adopted a motto for their view on disability services, that many of us in the autism community are already very familiar with: \u201cnothing about us without us.\u201d This rhetoric overseas has become associated with shutting out or downplaying the voices and concerns of those raising and caring for the disabled, and the interests of the disabled who are not able to advocate for themselves (usually the same group relying on those parents and carers), in preference for the perspectives of those who are less disabled. But the general emotion and intent behind the phrase is admirable, and the choice of phrasing doesn\u2019t seem to indicate the introduction of the same issues seen overseas. Indeed, the Labour Party expressly says it is interested in protecting the health and well-being of family carers, and support the family unit. In its main disability policy, the Labour Party does expressly mention autism. They are concerned that the current criteria for disability services and support, is written in such a way that often excludes those with autism. This is a well-known problem within the autism community, sometimes with dire consequences for the child and their entire family, so it is good to see the problem directly acknowledged. The Labour Party shows a high level of awareness of other concerns directly affecting the autism community too. Including the disparity of support between those who come under ACC and those who do not (the \u201cdo nots\u201d being the group autism falls under, and the comparatively less generously funded grouping); concerns about inadequate provision of carer support and respite care, and lack of payment to relatives who currently supply free respite care; and inadequate training of mainstream teachers for dealing with our children. Labour supports early intervention, and make the observation that health and education needs for our children, are often not coordinated (aint that the truth). Labour does strongly support \u201cinclusive\u201d education, but recognises that for this to be a reality there would have to be changes to the funding mechanisms currently in place in mainstream schools, and adequate support in meet the goals set forth in IEPs (turning \u201cit would be great if we could\u201d into \u201cwe actually have the resources to make this happen\u201d (my words, not theirs).) This favouring of inclusive education does not seem to go hand-in-hand with wanting special needs units or schools to shut down, since their spokesperson at the meeting mentioned earlier in this post, expressly said they support the special education units. Labour also says it will \u201creview\u201d the funding for physiotherapy and occupational therapy within schools. Labour also  rejects the National Standards  introduced by the current government, which have been  a real concern to many families with autistic children . Labour wants to redirect the resources associated with implementing National Standards, into supporting the students who are \u201cunder-achieving\u201d (which, depending on what precisely qualifies as under-achieving, probably encompasses special needs children). Labour also wants to support the disabled into work, which is another special area of concern in the autism community. There is a lot of rhetoric throughout the disability policy, about increasing the involvement of the disabled in the community, and supporting the independence of the disabled. On the whole, the policy shows a high level of awareness of the concerns that affect disabled families, including specifically autism families. The Labour Party clearly wants to increase the amount of people who qualify for government services and support in the disability sector, and increase the actual funding available to those who qualify too (often by redistributing, or reorganising the administrative structures that dole out, those funds). There really is a lot of material available on Labour\u2019s disability attitudes and policies (though, like most of the other Parties, not much in helpful detail). So I do encourage you to click-through on the links provided at the start of my post, if you want to get a fuller picture of where their priorities lie as a Party. As usual, I end with my standard disclaimer: Please note, I\u2019m not endorsing voting for Labour, and I am not a member of Labour, or indeed any other political party. No one has asked me, or paid me, to write these posts. If I become aware of Labour introducing any major changes to their policy relevant to autism pre the election, I will add it as a dated edit under this paragraph.

{"date": "November 6, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n We\u2019ve had contact with many different help groups over the past two years \u2013 some by referral through other (mostly government) organisations, some by direct contact. There was one we had been referred to, which took over a year to contact us. I\u2019d been told by the organisation which referred us, that this help group was in high demand and very useful, so I was optimistic they might actually be able to make our lives better when they finally made contact. They sent out two people to assess our needs and to explain their services. So far so good\u2026 The people they sent were clearly nervous and unsure of themselves. They spent the better part of an hour introducing themselves and their organisation, which was a very tiring experience since I was having to pay them attention while doing my usual looking after the two kids by myself through-out this meeting. Most of what they told me would have been better done via a brochure or similar (and indeed when they left they did give me brochures to further explain their operation). I waited patiently though, telling myself they would eventually get to the helping bit. They were running out of time so they said they better get on to the assessment part so they could provide me with the much needed services. Yay! They get out their notepads, looking like they mean business, and they ask me the first question they require an answer to: Why do you love your son? I was incredulous. I waited a year to see them, I waited an hour for them to finish talking at me, they finally get to the point where they are going to help me. And they ask me to explain my love for my son. Oh I knew the type of question it was \u2013 let\u2019s all feel good first, and find the positive things! Their job though was to help me with services to make my and my son\u2019s life easier, and especially to address the burn-out I was experiencing from having to constantly care for a high-needs child. We were not a problem family with abuse or neglect issues, and at no point would it have come across that I hated my son. I knew they were just going through their stock-standard questions, but their job was not to counsel me and that was never a service I\u2019d requested from them, I just wanted some support and had been told they could provide it. So I saw it as the final hoop I had to jump through before they could be useful to me, and I plastered a smile on my face to hide my utter exhaustion, and my frustration at them, and answered their unhelpful question. Maybe through this blog as well it is unclear why I love my son, since I discuss the hardships so much, so let me tell you what I told them: I love my son\u2019s sense of humour, and the wonderful sound of his laughter that always follows. I love his amazing desire to learn through all the challenges he faces \u2013 he just keeps trying to understand and achieve new things. I love the amazing skills he possesses \u2013 such as his precise memory, his awareness of direction that surpasses my own as an adult. I love him cause he\u2019s so damn good-looking. I love him cause he\u2019s mine. So now you know, what they know, what I always knew. You think they\u2019d get around to helping me \u2013 I\u2019d waited so long, I\u2019d jumped through their hoops. But they never did help, they only made my life harder by the end of it all (which will come up again in a future post). There was something achieved with my interactions with this help group though \u2013 of this I was sure: I made them feel good about themselves. I suppose that\u2019s a nice achievement, and I should have felt good about making them feel good \u2013 maybe after I\u2019d dealt with the next destructive tantrum I\u2019d find some time to stop and pat myself on the back for that\u2026 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heart-1.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/why-do-you-love-him/", "title": "Why do you love\u00a0him?"},
{"date": "November 22, 2011", "body": "The National Party has led the New Zealand Government over the past few years and, of course, are running in the elections (held this upcoming Saturday, yes that means these political posts will be finished soon!) to retain that leadership position. In this post I am going to summarise their  disability policies  (including  welfare ,  education  and other policies where relevant), with a particular focus on how they will impact autism families like my own. Image via Wikipedia One of the most attractive points I found in their policy, was a focus on giving disabled people the ability to choose for themselves how best to spend the funding they receive. Currently, the funding received is mostly pre-packaged, with not much in the way of choice about who helps you and how. National has been piloting programs over the past few years to change that set-up. One approach they\u2019re using, monitoring for success, and hoping to extend, is the increased freedom to spend that money, aided by the support of \u201cLocal Area Coordinators.\u201d Local Area Coordinators help the disabled figure out how best to meet their needs with the resources available to them. This makes the funding more personalised and flexible. 1000 people have been given access to personal budgets / individualised funding, so they can choose what\u2019s best for them. For those of us who have been ever-frustrated by the lack of coordination between the various branches of government involved in our families\u2019 lives when it comes to disability support, the National Party is developing a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d needs assessment agency approach, which brings together disability, health, welfare and housing; with the intention of creating better and more efficient services. National will be changing the welfare category for those who are permanently and severely disabled. They will also be changing its name, from the \u201cInvalids Benefit\u201d to \u201cThe Supported Living Payment.\u201d The new category comes with no expectations that the person will work, but comes with a financial incentive for those on it who decide to take up work. As to education, National supports special education, pointing out that it boosted it to the tune of $51 million, importantly creating an additional 2100 places for pupils in special education. There is always plenty of rhetoric about how arbitrarily limited the funding scheme is for special education, so extensions to those numbers is a relief for many desperate families. National wants to combat bullying; which also frequently affects autistic children, particularly in the mainstream schools. They\u2019ve put $60 million towards this goal. They\u2019re also providing $36 million to fund intervention for students who are identified as \u201cfalling behind\u201d (which, again, will frequently include our children). National also points out that it has put $100 million extra into disability services since 2008, and have dedicated an extra $130 million to these services for the next four years, including funding to help disabled people learn skills to assist independent living. This independent living theme is repeated in another area of their disability policy too: National intends to give up to 150 people who are currently living in residential care, the opportunity to live in the community with support, using a pilot scheme called \u201cChoice in Community Living.\u201d This program gives access to personal budgets so those involved can organise their own housing and living arrangements. I have often heard complaints that autistic adults end up at residential facilities when they could have and would have preferred to live independently or in more appropriate settings, if only they\u2019d been granted the proper support to do so. Hopefully this new scheme will make inroads on that issue. In general, National says it wants to encourage those with disabilities to be involved in their decision-making. This theme is pretty clear across their disability policy. National also supports better attitudes towards the disabled, with the establishment of a full-time Disability Rights Commissioner, and funding for the \u201cBe Accessible\u201d campaign (to the tune of $4 million), which promotes positive attitudes towards those with disabilities. For more information on their disability policies, I \u2013 as always \u2013 encourage you to click-through on the links I provided at the start of this post. National is the only Party I have found so far that actually provides examples, numbers, and monetary amounts alongside its policy (and not just the monetary amounts from their past term in parliament either; they provide projections and examples of how things would change too). So it\u2019s worth clicking through if you want to have a more detailed look. Overall I found National\u2019s Policy quite encouraging from the perspective of a mother currently raising an autistic child. I didn\u2019t get the impression that I\u2019m going to have a fight on my hands to retain the services and funding my son currently receives, and I liked the idea of increasingly individualised funding, and support towards independence. It actually made me feel much more positive about my son\u2019s future post-secondary-school. There is plenty there to upset families too of course: such as the continued existence of  National Standards and the view that this negatively impacts on the disabled ; and those currently concerned about  the closing of various special units that have been in the media lately , probably won\u2019t be comforted. But National doesn\u2019t appear to be stagnating or going backwards on the disability issues; it\u2019s bringing in new initiatives and appears to have a quite positive attitude towards the disabled and the support for the disabled. As usual, I end by saying: Please note, I\u2019m not endorsing voting for National, and I am not a member of National, or indeed any other political party. No one has asked me, or paid me, to write these posts. If I become aware of National introducing any major changes to their policy relevant to autism pre the election, I will add it as a dated edit under this paragraph.

{"date": "November 7, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Many people I have met do not know what Autism looks like, or what it is, some even deny it is an actual condition (as opposed to simply bad parenting). So I think it is important to provide an intimate instance of Autism: My son. I\u2019m going to start with an explanation of the official diagnostic criteria, then apply it, so you can see how it can manifest. Autism requires at least six symptoms \u2013 including two from the category of social impairment, one of impaired communication, and one of repetitive or restrictive behaviours. (There are other considerations, such as onset must happen prior to three years old, but this post is just an introduction to the sorts of behaviours you might find in an Autistic child, such as my own.) The following examples of my son\u2019s behaviour are just that \u2013 examples \u2013 they are by no means an exhaustive list of the challenges caused by his Autism. Social impairment: My son would avoid eye contact, and could get distraught if someone tried to maintain eye contact with him for more than a brief period of time. He would not respond to his name (or indeed to most language \u2013 ergo why some thought he was  deaf ). Heart-breakingly for me, he wouldn\u2019t hug or kiss \u2013 I spent the first couple of years of his life never having received an intended hug or kiss from him, beyond the necessitated \u201chug\u201d of holding on when I lifted him. And he was violent \u2013 biting, hitting, destroying property. It was common for me to have broken skin from his full-force biting. Communication: My son had delayed speech, and unsual speech when it did start up. He did not babble like other babies did \u2013 he was notably quiet. He started to slowly pick up some single words, and impressed us early on when he leant to count to ten before most kids could. But counting to ten was easy for him because it was a predictable and repeatable set of words. It was not intentional communication \u2013 he enjoyed and used random sounds more than he would actual words. Once words started up, he had strong echolalia \u2013 repeating back words without knowing what he\u2019s saying. He is an impressive mimic \u2013 he\u2019d not just repeat the word but also the precise inflection. Body language was usually completely ignored by him \u2013 if you\u2019d reach out to him he wouldn\u2019t put his arms up in response, if you pointed at something he would never look at the pointed-to object. Repetitive and restricted behaviour: My son would insist on rubbing his head against walls, to the extend that he developed two balding patches. He wouldn\u2019t play with any toys except cars, and even then only to line them up. Our house would be lines and lines of cars that we weren\u2019t allowed to touch or knock, else resulting in a long and uncontrollable tantrum. He would \u201ctoe-walk\u201d rather than down on his heels. He has a \u201chappy dance\u201d \u2013 when he is happy he hums and flaps his hands and rocks from foot to foot, for extended periods of time. He would run back and forth along the same path through the house, over and over. He insisted on sameness in almost every area of life \u2013 same clothes, same food, same routine \u2013 alterations from expectations again leading to meltdowns. He insisted on car-rides many times a day, especially when certain events happened like my husband came home from work. At it\u2019s peak we were having about five car-rides a day \u2013 car-rides that went nowhere except back home because if we tried to get out of the car at a beach or a park or a store, he would scream and cry. Even though that\u2019s just a taste of what he was like, I know it sounds pretty dreadful. And it was. He was at the moderate to severe end of the spectrum \u2013 it\u2019s important to understand that Autism ranges from severe to mild. And important to appreciate that with therapies, you can often (not always) help to shift your child down the spectrum. After two years of a large range of therapies, our son now sits at the mild to moderate end of the spectrum. His Autism is still obvious to most who meet him, especially when he is happy, or when people try to talk to him. We have had to teach him things that come naturally to other children, but he has managed to learn them \u2013 such as how to hug and to read emotion in other people\u2019s faces. He has learnt to put together simple (but always awkward) small sentences. He has come such a long way, which is not just testament to his therapists, or to us as parents, but also to his own remarkable desire to learn, despite all the hardships in the way of his progress. Sometimes, I am quite simply in awe of him. He is an instance of both the hardships and the hope to be found in Autism. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/an-instance-of-autism/", "title": "An Instance of\u00a0Autism."},
{"date": "November 24, 2011", "body": "Image via Wikipedia With only two days to go until the New Zealand General Election, I\u2019m not going to have enough time to do a post per minor Party for the ones I haven\u2019t covered yet. So I\u2019m going to combine all the rest into this single post, providing links and general summaries of each. As usual, I\u2019m looking at their disability / disability-relevant policies, with a particular focus on those policies that would affect autistic people and their families. The  Maori Party \u2018s main disability policy can be found about a third of the way down  this page . They attended a public meeting asking Parties to share their disability policies a while back (no doubt there were many such meetings, but I can only go by what I can find record of online); the main points from that meeting can be found  here . They were also one of only three Parties to respond to Autism New Zealand\u2019s questions about autism issues heading into the election. Their response to Autism New Zealand can be found  here  (pdf). A core focus of the Maori Party\u2019s disability policy, is on moving towards individualised funding. The Maori Party is also keen to allow and encourage the disabled to remain in the care of their own families, and want to resource caregivers in such a way as to promote this outcome. They want to review the work conditions, pay, and training opportunities of those in the disability sector. The Maori Party wants to encourage employers to develop part-time and flexible working arrangements (which would be of benefit to both the disabled and their families). They also want to hold an annual disability employment summit (they are the first Party I\u2019ve seen mention such a thing, seems like a good initiative). They will support school-leavers into employment, which sits well along-side their other employment / disability policy points already mentioned. The Maori Party wants to see special education as a part of all teacher training. And they support the \u201cnothing about us, without us\u201d approach to disability issues. It\u2019s also worth nothing that the Minister for Disability Issues this past government term, was the leader of the Maori Party. Overall, the Maori Party is supportive of the disability community and sector, and have some attractive and original ideas in their arsenal. The  Mana  Party\u2019s disability policy can be found on their website  here . They also attended the  aforementioned meeting . The Mana Party considers themselves to be a Party that stand up for the vulnerable, including the disabled. They accept the social definition / model of disability. The Mana Party support the right to full participation in society, including the right to be educated alongside peers. On the issue of the potential closure of some special education units, the Mana Party opposes those closures and want to see instead the creation of more such special units. The Mana Party wants to let the disabled control and influence policy and planning. They want to introduce a non means-tested benefit for the disabled, and see better financial support for carers and family, including the payment of whanau caregivers. They take an interest in all stages of life of the disabled, and understand that caring for the disabled means also supporting the carers of the disabled. Overall, the Mana Party show a clear interest in the lives of the disabled and their carers, and would evidently like to see a substantial increase in the funding provided to these people across the board. New Zealand First  (NZ First) don\u2019t appear to have a disability policy (here\u2019s their  website ). I had a look through their other policies and couldn\u2019t find a mention of the disabled or the carers of the disabled. I did find some relevant policy from them on  this page over at IHC , where NZ First argue that increased health spending and support of carers is vital. Overall, nothing particularly scary and nothing particularly exciting from NZ First on disability issues. Like some of the other minor Parties when it comes to disability, your main guidance on whether to vote for them when it comes to what\u2019s best for the disabled and their families, is going to be a broader approach to whether their overall values and general policies lead to a better New Zealand. The  Alliance   want  a Disability Commission to mostly be staffed by people with disabilities, repeating a theme found in most of the Parties this election; of including the disabled more in the policies and planning that directly affect them. They want to encourage \u201creal pay\u201d and \u201creal jobs\u201d for the disabled. Again, repeating ideas found commonly in other Parties, Alliance wants to see parent and family carers paid for the care they provide. They also want to see a closing of what is perceived to be an inequitable gap between those with disabilities covered by ACC, and those who don\u2019t fit under the more generous ACC scheme. Alliance wants travel subsidized for the disabled. In an original point, Alliance expressly states that it wants disabled people supported to artistically and culturally express themselves. In another original (and this time, particularly important) point, Alliance also says it wants to address the problem that though the disabled are especially vulnerable to violence and abuse, they often do not have real access to the support services in place for those who are subjected to violence and abuse. Another policy area where Alliance specifically mention the disabled, is under  education , where they state they\u2019d like to see smaller class sizes and better teacher/student ratios for those with special needs. They also want (again, an orginal policy by them) to reward schools who welcome special needs students, by linking funding to the number enrolled (sounds quite sensible I think). Under the topic of \u201csuspensions\u201d, Alliance says they want to support teachers who are facing challenging behaviours from students. Not much in specifics there, but nice to hear all the same; this directly affects many of our children in mainstream schools where the teachers are inadequately trained or resourced to cope. Alliance also wants the local public consulted before changes are made to the way a school is reorganised, again these sorts of issues often impact on our children (think of the special situations and units set up for our children). Overall, another Party clearly interested in serving the needs of the disabled, but this time with some more original ideas than what I\u2019ve been encountering in most Party\u2019s policies in my research. The  Conservative Party  of New Zealand wants to shift the focus from the government telling families what to do, to giving that power and responsibility back to the families. Beyond that, I couldn\u2019t find anything directly relevant to the disabled or families raising disabled children, even under education and welfare. Again, you\u2019d have to decide if they would support this Party as it impacts on the disabled, based on their broader policies, which can be found  here . The  Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party , has a \u201c Disability Issues\u201d link , but nothing written underneath it. There are those in the autism community who would like to see cannabis available (in properly controlled dosage and availability) to those with autism since it arguably addresses autism symptoms, or at least want to promote the further research needed to investigate those benefits ( link to my previous post  on the issue). So I suppose that is the tightest relationship I can see between this Party and disability / autism issues: Around the question of health. As usual, you can look at the rest of their policies to see if you think they would benefit the disabled in a broader / less direct sense. (Doing a quick summary of each minor Party in this post really doesn\u2019t allow me to go into that sort of detail, but feel free to discuss it in the comment section below if you like!) NZ Democrats for Social Credit  (DSC) are one of the Parties who want to bring support for all disabled, in line with the support received for the disabled covered by the more generous ACC scheme. DSC want to give employers interest-free loans to assist with modification to the workplace to assist the disabled. (As usual, more general policy points can be found on their  website disability policy page , do click-through if you want further details; most of their other points though are rather vague and unhelpfully general.) I had a look through their other policies too \u2013 particularly education and health \u2013 nothing specifically directed at the disabled / special needs was found. So that\u2019s my round-up of all the Parties running in the 2011 New Zealand General Election (phew!). I\u2019ve found the process of writing these posts quite informative, and it has helped me to decide who I\u2019ll be voting for (I was choosing between three Parties, this task made that decision easier); I hope it has helped and been informative for others too. Something I learnt along the way is that the Political Parties in New Zealand are frequently confused about disability discourse; many holding self-contradictory views on ideals and models of disability, that also conflict with their precise policy. Almost all the Parties failed to provide examples or details about their claims, which is perhaps something you\u2019d expect when it comes to general policy, but the lack of details and examples often made it hard to see exactly who they have in mind in their policies, and how they actually intended to help those people and change the current system. Many Parties just avoided the disability issue, and focused on their core constituency or focal issue instead (not surprising necessarily, but disappointingly unhelpful). Whichever way you want to vote, make sure you do vote, and make it an informed vote. This is a democracy after all. Bring on Saturday!

{"date": "November 28, 2011", "body": "To the multitude who have arrived at this post by searching for \u201cautism and violence\u201d in the wake of the mass shooting in the USA: Nothing in this post is relevant to those types of events. The sorts of people discussed in this post are the lower functioning autistic people who get frustrated from inability to communicate at all and who react suddenly and in an unplanned manner to painful sensory input. It is nothing to do with premeditated mass violence which couldn\u2019t be conceived of \u2013 let alone carried out \u2013 by the people talked about in this post. The post of mine that you should be reading about autism and mass murder, is here:  https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/autism-the-wrong-answer-to-the-question-of-mass-murder/ It is not hard to understand why autism and violence often come hand-in-hand, most especially for those at the more severe end of the autism spectrum. But how the family, carers, and the public react to and make sense of the relationship between violence and autism, is often highly emotive and confused; at times causing further and avoidable upset in an already highly-charged situation. Image via Wikipedia I want to begin my discussion with a brief introduction to some of the more obvious reasons for violence occurring quite often among autistic people; particularly the severely autistic and children. Violence is an understandable reaction to the frustration, confusion and anger that arises from difficulty in understanding others and making others understand you, as well as been a raw method of communication in itself in the face of a lack of other methods to make feelings and thoughts known. Violence is also a defensive reaction against excessive sensory input, particularly so when the result of the excessive input is akin to pain. Trying to discipline an autistic child to teach the inappropriateness of violence as a response in such situations, is also notoriously difficult, and can end up making things worse if not done well as it can lead to further anxieties and confusion. I\u2019ve written a previous post  about the relationship (and non-relationship) between autism and bad parenting . I have also done a post generally about the issues surrounding  discipline with our autistic children , so I won\u2019t repeat those views here. I would recommend reading them though if you want further background on the views I share in this post. What I specifically want to address in this post is the rhetoric that jumps out when these stories about autism and violence hit the media, as they so often do. Often the story at issue is about the disruptive violent autistic child in a mainstream classroom, and who\u2019s to blame and what\u2019s happened because of it. There are also plenty of stories about (often adult) autistic children hurting their parents in ways that require police involvement; those stories rarely end well. I\u2019ve watched the discussions that follow these stories, and they seem to follow a pattern of sorts: A public outcry that autism is being used as an excuse for violence, when \u201creally\u201d it\u2019s just bad parenting or bad personal decisions on behalf of the autistic person (this rhetoric often comes hand-in-hand with claims that autism isn\u2019t a real condition, or that it is a real condition but that it is caused only by poor discipline etc). The parent inevitably defends their child \u2013 on the same forums as the public or in the news article itself \u2013 but that defense by the parent can take various forms. It usually takes the form of what I will term \u201cexcuse.\u201d By which I mean, that the autism excuses the violence in such a way that the child (or adult) is not to blame for the violence and therefore should not be punished for it; that the autism itself is the cause, and you can\u2019t punish \u201cautism\u201d, so the correct response should be compassion and understanding. An alternative rhetoric from parents, and one I\u2019ve encountered many times from rather extremist carers of autistic children, is the notion that autism is not just an excuse for the violence, it is a  justification  for the violence. Let me explain that further because I think it is a vital point that is often confused together with \u201cexcuse\u201d (discussed above) and \u201cexplanation\u201d (which I will expand on soon). The \u201cjustification\u201d response is one that blames the person who has  been hurt  by the violence, usually attacking them for their ignorance. For example, that they have performed an action, used words, or exposed the autistic person to something that would be benign to the vast majority of the population, but which was excruciating or particularly upsetting to that specific autistic individual (and possibly to most autistic individuals). The upshot being that if the person who was hurt (the teacher, the carer, the parent, the police), had been more aware and made the effort to understand the autistic individual better, the violence would have never occurred. Whereby the victim of the violence, is relabeled as the perpetrator who got what they deserved; making the autistic person the true victim of the situation. This reaction (quite understandably) leads to out-rage from the general public and at times incredulity on behalf of the person who suffered the violence. Thereby escalating the situation and negative attitudes \u2013 even fear \u2013 towards autistic people. An alternative to the excuse or justification rhetoric, and in fact the basis of both before they become either excuse or justification, is \u201cexplanation.\u201d This is the approach that says the violence is predictable or understandable in light of the autism, but stops short of making a claim about the moral blameworthiness of the autistic individual or the person who suffered the violence. It says: \u201cautism, not bad parenting or ill-intent, has caused this violence to occur, and here is why\u2026\u201d Many times the \u201chere is why\u201d bit is left under-explained, which just feeds the public\u2019s fear and confusion about autism. Being able to explain why the autism has led to violence in that instance, fosters understanding, and potentially builds a path towards finding a way forward for that individual, and perhaps for all autistic people. For example, if sensory overload and lack of alternative means of communication are causing violence in a classroom, using autism as an excuse or justification for the violence does not fix the problem itself (and under more extreme uses of the excuse and justification rhetoric, can make things a lot worse for that individual and other autistic people). But explanation may suggest changing the classroom environment and new methods of communication (  PECS  for example) as ways forward; acknowledging that violence is not acceptable, but that when we know why it occurs, we are better equipped to stop it reoccurring, or at the very least, better equipped to see it about to happen and take action to manage it before it gets out of hand. Even though the excuse and justification approaches often come with words like \u201cI don\u2019t think violence is acceptable\u201d, the rest of the message can make it look like the person doing the defending thinks violence  is acceptable  in those instances (rather than merely understandable). Clearly, this \u201cviolence is OK in these circumstances\u201d line is going to occur more often in the justification rhetoric; in much the same way that we as a society say violence is unacceptable, but is OK in self-defence, when we talk about the legal justification of self-defence. In the same way, the autistic individual is the victim, not the true perpetrator, and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions. It should be pretty obvious by now, that I do not put much stock in the \u201cjustification\u201d rhetoric when it comes to autism and violence in these sorts of situations (which I\u2019ll say more about soon). I think we must always be careful to look situation to situation when it comes to the question of excuse; sometimes autism really is the reason for the violence and sometimes individual choice and / or bad influences and bad parenting, will be the decisive factors. That is to say, sometimes autism really should be seen as a sort of excuse, and sometimes it really isn\u2019t. Telling the difference won\u2019t always be straightforward, but an attempt to identify when the difference occurs is absolutely vital to figuring out the best and correct response to the situation as it has already occurred, and to its potential to re-occur. I want to briefly mention a particular instance of when I think we can legitimately use the \u201cjustification\u201d rhetoric for autism; but it is rare and is not the sort of situation normally found in these situations when they go public or get bandied about in forums. The times that \u201cjustification\u201d in regards to autism and violence makes sense, is going to be where someone who genuinely should have known better, did or said something that predictably upset or disturbed the autistic individual to the point of violence. For example, someone very familiar with the individual and with autism as a condition, doing something that wouldn\u2019t upset joe-average, but is a known trigger or breaking-point for the autistic individual. These would be those instances of intentional cruelty or indifference, that mirror the sort of issues that lead us to say violence in self-defence (under otherwise normal situations) is also justifiable. Again though, for even this approach to hold weight you\u2019d have to take into account the exact situation and individual; if the autistic person is an adult and quite high-functioning (for lack of a better phrase) and didn\u2019t lose control so much as got very annoyed or upset and lashed out, \u201cjustification\u201d isn\u2019t really the appropriate term. Anymore than a highly strung person being provoked by someone who knows just what to say to upset them, will justify a violent response. It would become a real question of self-control (did the autism over-rule any individual controlled choice to use violence, for stance). (Those familiar with the law will see this part of my discussion coming close to questions of provocation and issues generally of mens rea; I am borrowing from the law to organise my thoughts, but I\u2019m not trying to tie this discussion too tightly to how the law would view it, at least not without further consideration. This post is early thoughts, rather than refined and strongly developed ones.) The point of this post was to attempt to label and discuss in an introductory sense, those different types of rhetorics when people generally talk about the relationship between autism and violence. Whether I have done an adequate job of that, I leave to you to let me know; I would be very interested to hear your own views. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hands_in_a_fist.JPG"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/autism-and-violence-rhetoric-explanation-excuse-justification/", "title": "Autism and Violence Rhetoric: Explanation, Excuse,\u00a0Justification?"},
{"date": "November 10, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n As my son\u2019s developmental delays and behavioural issues became more obvious, I moved through changes in the way I would typically interact with other parents in public settings. Prior to the diagnosis I\u2019d deal with his problems in public by keeping a low profile. I\u2019d try to stay out of the way of other mothers and children, so they wouldn\u2019t stare at my son\u2019s unusual behaviours, or try to talk to me. Normally I\u2019m quite happy to have a good chat-chit, but when I had my son with me I had to keep my attention and eyes on him the entire time to try to stop, or deal with, the frequent meltdowns. When he did have a meltdown I\u2019d always take him back home instead of continuing to disturb others. People would never offer to help, they would just stare at my son, and stare at me in a critical way. When we received the diagnosis I was so relieved for having a way to explain his unusual behaviours, and was so preoccupied with getting my head around what it meant, that I\u2019d openly start conversations with people I\u2019d only just met, about him having Autism. His Autism was my life at the time, what else did I have to talk about? That was when I really started to encounter the prejudices and ignorances that the public has about the condition. Back then though I wasn\u2019t informed or experienced enough to deal with it. People would make comments such as \u201che doesn\u2019t look like he has Autism\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s caused by vaccinations isn\u2019t it\u201d. More often though people would just say something like \u201coh\u201d or nod, and move on. These days I don\u2019t try to hide myself and my son away, nor do I openly tell people my son has Autism. I do my best to let my son be himself, enjoy himself, and not to apologise for or explain his existence to others. When I have a rapport with someone I may eventually mention it, especially if my son\u2019s and my behaviour seems odd. I still come up against unusual comments, such as today at a local playground, where their reply was \u201cbut he talks\u201d. Her understanding of Autism was that the Autistic child can\u2019t talk, because she had a relation who had a son with Autism, who didn\u2019t talk. I\u2019m not sure what she expected my reaction to be \u201coh fancy that, he\u2019s cured!\u201d Or \u201cyeah, I was just making it up\u201d. But I\u2019m used to this now, and I just took the opportunity to inform her. I told her Autism was a spectrum disorder \u2013 from severe to mild. I told her sometimes Autism comes with other conditions too (such as Downs Syndrome) which make it less likely they\u2019ll ever talk because of the combined effect. I could have also explained to her that Autism comes with a wide range of intelligence levels, and the lower the intelligence, the poorer the prognosis, and that my son had often shown hints at a high level of intelligence, but I didn\u2019t want to make her get defensive about her relation\u2019s intellect. Instead I expanded by saying that two years of speech therapy had advanced his communication skills, that he used to only speak in single words when he was three. Of course that challenges the common conception that Autism is a static condition \u2013 the idea that someone can shift up the spectrum with the use of therapies is not widely known, let alone understood, and by some will be seen as evidence that the child was never Autistic to begin with. I don\u2019t expect everyone to know everything about Autism, and I\u2019m happy to educate those who want to better understand. But there do seem to be an awful lot of misconceptions out there. Autism continues to be a hot topic of public debate, especially because of its link to the anti-vaccination movement, and the growing numbers of diagnoses. It continues to be popular to dismiss it as a fake condition, or at the very least as over-diagnosed \u2013 which I shall discuss in a  future post . It is part of what you have to adjust to as a parent of these children \u2013 you have to become confident and proud and grow a strong back-bone, because the alternative is hiding yourself and your child in the shadows.

{"date": "November 8, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n As mentioned in a  previous post  about choosing between mainstream and special needs schooling, one of the arguments to support sending special needs children to mainstream schools, goes like this: All children belong on a spectrum of disabilities or problems \u2013 whether they be behavioural, physical, or learning difficulties. Some are just more severe than others (in our case, my son having Autism). Therefore special needs children belong with every other child at mainstream schools. I want to make clear at the outset that it is true that some special needs children do indeed fit in well to mainstream schools, such as those with physical limitations, where ramps and other accommodations can come close to eliminating the child\u2019s barriers to taking part in most of the school\u2019s education activities. I also recognise the value of exposing children to variations from the \u201cnorm\u201d \u2013 being part of a community that incorporates and respects the differences in humanity. The problem with the claim that all children belong on a spectrum of disabilities and challenges, and therefore should be schooled together even if they fall at the severe end of such spectrums, is that it has dropped context. The context is a learning environment. The comparison of ability that must be made is in regards to that central function of a school \u2013 learning. In the same way that you would not expect someone without legs to take part in a running race, neither should you expect someone with an extreme learning disability to take part in an environment where everyone\u2019s else\u2019s ability to learn meets minimum standards such as understanding basic verbal instructions. There are children with behavioural difficulties who may not do as they are told, but at least they understood the instructions that they are disobeying. There may be children with the inability to take part in certain activities due to sensory issues, or religious or cultural rules, but as long as they have the ability to convey their disagreement to the activity, and a reason for the \u201cdisobedience\u201d, the situation can be dealt with. But when a child, such as my own, can have unexpected meltdowns because his anxiety has been set off by the wrong words or actions of others, and he can\u2019t explain why he is upset, and he can\u2019t understand many simple instructions, and even struggles to perform what other children would treat as basic physical feats, then how is he going to perform the intended aim of that school \u2013 to learn? There is support for him in the form of teacher aides, though that is nowhere near full-time. He would always be the class\u2019s and school\u2019s problem child, and ultimately the bullied child. Even worse, the bullied child who is unable to defend himself physically or verbally, and unable to tell anyone what was done to him. Mainstream schools expect their children to have certain basic social and physical skills, or to be able to pick them up quickly within the first year as new entrants. This includes abilities such as recognising and responding (at least somewhat) correctly to emotions. It\u2019s not so straight-forward for children like mine. For example, he often gets up close and stares at children if they cry, then mimics the cry \u2013 not to be cruel, but because he is fascinated and loves mimicking. Obviously other students and teachers would see and treat this as teasing \u2013 I would have too before having my son. He also needs to be taught not to hum and rock and flap his hands when he is happy, we\u2019ve been trying to teach him that for years. Can you imagine how disruptive such behaviour would be in a classroom \u2013 to the teacher and other students? Because I don\u2019t want this post to be overly long, I will leave it there at this point though there is more to be said. I hope it is at least clear from what I have put forward that it is too simplistic to refer to the spectrum of issues all children suffer from, as an argument to put them all together in a mainstream teaching institution. Is is vital to remember that the point of a school is learning, and so a learning disability cannot be treated in the same category of, for example, a strictly physical disability, or a hearing disability where a sign-language interpreter could overcome the problem for a child who otherwise would learn perfectly fine. I realise that some of what I\u2019ve said here could be seen as controversial. It is said with respect and the aim to educate and explain. If you take issue with it, I strongly encourage comments \u2013 perhaps you could teach me something too. At least my own capacity to learn, faces no barriers. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Children_in_a_Primary_Education_School.JPG"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/children-are-all-on-a-spectrum-an-argument-for-mainstream-schooling/", "title": "Children are all on a spectrum \u2013 an argument for mainstream\u00a0schooling."},
{"date": "November 10, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Autism is considered by some to be a \u201cpopular\u201d disorder: The theory goes that there are parents who like labelling their child Autistic, because it is a cool diagnosis, or a handy excuse for bad parenting. In support of these substandard parents, there are \u201cprofessionals\u201d who grant the diagnosis, despite the condition not being present in that individual, or not being an actual condition at all. These professionals of course get paid \u2013 everyone wins. These theories explain the huge increase in diagnoses over the past couple of decades. It is therefore not an epidemic of Autism, but an epidemic of the current trend to give a label to any and every problem a child may have, and conspiring dodgy money-hungry doctors. I\u2019ll give you a second to digest that. Some of it looks right doesn\u2019t it, let\u2019s break it down: Autism has been on the increase\u2026 hasn\u2019t it? Well diagnoses have been increasing, but that doesn\u2019t mean Autism frequency has actually been increasing. It is an indication of an increased awareness and understanding of the condition. I have no doubt there is some over-diagnosis going on \u2013 I\u2019ve suspected it myself in a couple of children. But what is also happening is under-diagnosis. Under-diagnosis is occurring because of the sort of issues I faced with my son \u2013 shame and self-blame that drives parents to not seek help. I have also heard and seen instances of complete denial \u2013 where people have tried to desperately tell the parents that their child has classic Autism but the parents refuse to accept or do anything about it. OK, so the increase in Autism numbers is not so straight-forward, let\u2019s move on to it being a cool diagnosis then. It\u2019s cool right \u2013  Rain Man ,  Mercury Rising , hell even  Einstein , awesomely talented and interesting people, who wouldn\u2019t want their son (and it is usually boys) to be like that! Actually, only a small percentage of Autistic people are savants (about 0.5% to 10%), with special gifts that let them astound you with their counting, memory or musical talents. And even if that was a guaranteed aspect of the diagnosis, would you really want all the accompanying behavioural, social and language issues? Anyone who has ever met a child with Autism, wouldn\u2019t wish the condition on anyone. I love my son but I do not love his Autism. Well Autism is at least a handy label for parents who don\u2019t want to take responsibility for what their bad parenting has lead to, right? I don\u2019t know how this one even gets off the ground, yet it is very popular. How can bad parenting impact a child from birth, so that they don\u2019t learn to point? How can the parenting be so appalling that a child can\u2019t talk \u2013 even abused and neglected kiddies pick that skill up along the way, how severe must the abuse be by parents of Autistic kids! Yes Autistic children tantrum more than neurotypical kids, but look at what they tantrum over: A car was nudged in a line -up of twenty cars, or someone said the a word they don\u2019t like (such as \u201cproud\u201d \u2013 see  A Friend Like Henry ), or there\u2019s a button on their shirt.. how are these evidence of ill-disciplined or spoilt kids? I am sympathetic to some of the concerns that lead people to call Autism a popular disorder, especially the current trend to put a label on any problem a parent has with a\u00a0 child (some favourites are  Oppositional Defiant Disorder ,  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and  Pervasive Developmental Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified ). But it is important to judge each case on its merits, not dismiss every child and their parent because of a label they probably wished had never heard of, and would do anything to change.

{"date": "November 12, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n One of the consequences of having an autistic child, was being left with the feeling that I am less than his mother: That I am his babysitter, teacher, therapist. I am all these positions and carry the responsibilities that come with them \u2013 the success of my caring, teaching and therapies are assessed by external agencies and the results shared with me. I am given feedback on how to improve, or pats on the back for doing a good job. The feeling of constantly being assessed, and not having the freedom and rights of a mother, started prior to the diagnosis since I was initially  held responsible for my son\u2019s developmental delays  and  \u201cbehavioural problems\u201d . It was made all the harder to feel like a mother, when my son wouldn\u2019t  hug or kiss or say \u201cI love you\u201d when he reached the age that he  otherwise could have. It got worse once I had the diagnosis because suddenly there were three government ministries deeply involved with our lives, constantly sending along people to assess my son, and my successes (or failures) as his \u201cprimary caregiver\u201d. I should add that I have often received glowing reviews, and even received the praise that I am the most dedicated parent one of the government therapists had ever worked with.

This feeling of being less than a mother, is made worse by living in a time of abundant \u201coughtisms\u201d. I use that term to refer to the trend in the modern parenting world, where \u201cshoulds\u201d have seeped into every aspect of family life: where once there were many different and successful ways in which you might choose to raise your child \u2013 with your own common-sense, family values, motherly love and family support as all the guidance you needed (or wanted) to raise your child. Now instead you are expected and encouraged to do what you\u2019re told by external bodies for every decision \u2013 from breast-feeding to nappy-changing to discipline. And not following the advice isn\u2019t simply a \u201cchoice\u201d as a parent, it is a morally reprehensible act. It\u2019s not enough to use a legally safe car-seat, you have to use the rear-facing one with a 5-point harness until your child is four years old\u2026 The internet and the opening of our lives on forums and social groups, intensifies this effect. It allows both friends and strangers to comment and criticise on parenting decisions, even when (as is usually the case) not enough information is provided to make such criticisms. I am reminded of being on a forum where someone shared a photo of her son expecting everyone to say how cute he was. What she got instead was a barrage of criticism that she had her three-year old still in a highchair, as he was in the photo. She tried to explain that it wasn\u2019t a usual situation \u2013 that they were out in a restaurant at the time and other factors were going on, but she was so upset by all the comments that she took the photo down anyway. I eventually reached the stage where I took the power back in my parenting \u2013 blocking out the constant stream of oughts, both in regards to parenting in general, and to raising an autistic child. I still take in all the information that comes forward, but I don\u2019t let myself get emotionally blackmailed into going against my mothering instincts, and common-sense. Once I took that power back, I realised how all those \u201coughtisms\u201d were also standing in the way of me feeling free to simply love my son, and not just feel like an underpaid worker looking after my son on behalf of society. It has been much easier to feel like a mother to my second-born, because I\u2019ve gained the strength through all the experiences with my first-born. We raise our second son according to our own ideals \u2013 for example we try to follow the Montessori method for raising infants, rather than the over-protective and restrictive modern preferences. I still get the barrage of shoulds that I always did, though at least no one\u2019s attacking me this time around for delaying his development. I still have government agencies breathing down my neck for my first-born, with that unspoken threat of taking away my son if they see something they don\u2019t like, but I don\u2019t let that paralyse me with fear and the non-thinking compliance they seem to desire. I love both my sons, and always will. And that is the best and most important guide to doing the best by my boys \u2013 all the oughtisms in the world can\u2019t replace it. I am a mother, nothing less. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amormaterno.png"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/less-than-a-mother-i-the-world-of-oughtisms/", "title": "Less than a Mother, in the World of\u00a0Oughtisms"},
{"date": "November 10, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n (An introductory point on language through-out this post: I will refer mostly to autistic children as my example of a special needs child, since I am most familiar with autism. But most of my comments will apply equally well to other special needs conditions. I will use the term \u201cnormal\u201d to refer to children who do not have special needs \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to imply that every child who doesn\u2019t have special needs is otherwise completely normal, it is just a useful piece of terminology for the purposes of this discussion.) One of the arguments for mainstream schooling special needs children, is that they will pick up normal social skills and behaviour, from the other children. Autistic children need a lot of help in this area \u2013 social skills do not come naturally to them. In tandem with this argument, it is often said that these children would otherwise pick up bad social skills from the other children at special needs schools who are similarly challenged. The core claims here are (1) that normal children have good socialization skills, (2) that special needs children will learn from those normal children, and (3) that negative social skills will be picked up in a special needs environment. (1)  \u201cNormal children have good socialization skills .\u201d Kids without autism do have an easier time socializing and behaving correctly in given situations. But it is another claim altogether that they will always choose to act as they know they should. Screaming, swearing, disrespect, picking noses, hitting, teasing, are just some examples of the charming behaviour you\u2019ll find in every classroom and school-yard. If autistic children were social sponges, they would just as easily pick up these negative behaviours from the other children. In fact though it is worse than just some exposure to positive behaviour, and some exposure to negative behaviour, from the normal kids in the mainstream schools. Because the normal kids know the special needs children are different, and (kids being kids), find a way to amuse themselves at the expense of the different child. A common problem that occurs is the normal children realise the special needs child will copy them \u2013 it is a very basic way in which many autistic children attempt to interact. So the normal children go out of their way \u2013 sometimes maliciously, sometimes not, the result is the same regardless of motive \u2013 to get the autistic child to copy some inappropriate behaviours. The normal children will otherwise tend to avoid interacting with the special needs child. This is completely understandable \u2013 if someone can\u2019t understand you, and their behaviour is confusing and at times scary, you naturally tend to avoid them. So the chances to pick up normal and positive behaviours at a mainstream school, are not as great as you may expect. (2)  \u201cSpecial needs children will learn social skills from the normal children \u201c. Even if we accept that normal children will only teach special needs children good habits, it is highly questionable whether the special needs children will actually learn from them beyond the simplistic copying I\u2019ve mentioned above. The idea that special needs kids can then universalize those copied skills, so they can use them in the correct situations, is also assuming a lot. In fact, an autistic child needs to be explicitly taught social skills, and preferably by a very patient and observant adult, who can teach at the level the child is at, in a way that the child can understand. New skills need to be broken down into a step by step progression, and repeated \u2013 usually until rote-learned. It is expecting too much to think normal children can teach these skills to these special needs children, especially when you consider that many adults struggle to teach autistic children such skills. The teachers at mainstream school have not being trained how to achieve this with these special children, nor have the time required to do so. It is though built into the curriculum at a special needs school. (3)  \u201cNegative social skills will be picked up in a special needs environment.\u201d There is some truth to this \u2013 in the same way that there is some truth to the two claims above, but again, there are important factors that must be taken into account before each or any of these statements can be used as reasons to enrol a special needs child at a mainstream rather than a special needs class. Yes there are some very negative and incorrect social behaviours going on in special needs schools. But at the same time there is a much better teacher to child ratio in those schools, making it easier to intervene and correct those behaviours where they originate, and to be able to correct any copied instances as they occur. Furthermore, as pointed out above, it is assuming too much that special needs children will simply learn from what they see around them \u2013 regardless of whether what they see is negative or positive; you can spend years trying to teach an autistic child to respond in a particular way to a stimulus. There are also the aforementioned negative behaviours they can pick up in mainstream schools \u2013 in fact there are certain types of negative behaviours you\u2019re less likely to find in a special needs school than a mainstream school. For example, going out of one\u2019s way to bully someone requires a certain level of forethought and verbal and physical capacity that would be challenging for special needs children. An autistic child would sooner be left to their own devices and not interact with anyone \u2013 which of course is part of the socializing challenge. There are benefits to be gained from having special needs children interact with normal children, I have seen them myself while my son has been attending kindergarten over the past two years. But the socialization benefits must be weighed against the social harms. In and of itself, \u201csocialization\u201d is not a strong enough argument for sending a special needs child to a mainstream school. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teacher.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/socialization-as-a-reason-to-mainstream-special-needs-children/", "title": "Socialization as a reason to mainstream special needs\u00a0children"},
{"date": "November 13, 2010", "body": "\n Image by Ehsan Khakbaz via Flickr \n One of the most upsetting and isolating behaviours by my autistic son, was when he refused to let me talk to anyone except him. This went on in varying degrees, for over six months. It severely affected my relationship with my husband: Any time I wanted to talk to him, we had to sneak off to a different room and I\u2019d whisper my message very quickly, before my son discovered us conversing. Since I was \u201cpermitted\u201d to talk directly to my son, I tried to use this loop-hole to actually talk to my husband \u2013 directing my body language and tone at my son but using words for my husband. It fooled my son for maybe a day. Before I expand on how much this affected us and how we eventually resolved it, I should explain what my son would actually do when I spoke. He would scream and cry for starters, so even if I persisted in trying to talk, no one could hear me. He would hit my mouth if he could get close enough. If I refused to stop talking he would bite me too \u2013 only me, he wouldn\u2019t go to bite the person I was talking to. His tantrum would quickly escalate, so that it would take a lot of time and physically restraining him to get him to calm down. Even when he was somewhat calmed, his anxiety levels would stay high for hours, whereby the smallest thing could set him off again (such as someone touching one of his lined-up cars). Refusing to let me talk started in the car, but expanded over time so I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to people in my own home, in their homes, or out and about \u2013 such as at his kindergarten. When I\u2019d visit my mother with him, I had to whisper to her so he wouldn\u2019t notice, or I\u2019d resort to writing notes instead of speaking so I wouldn\u2019t set him off. At kindergarten I was in constant fear that an adult would try to talk to me \u2013 whether another parent or a teacher. As long as I didn\u2019t reply it would be fine, but if I attempted an answer (to avoid appearing horribly rude), the meltdown would start. I started carrying around a note in my bag so I could explain to people why I couldn\u2019t talk, without having to tell them verbally. My son let me talk to other children at the kindergarten though, which was an unusual exception, with no obvious explanation. And as you\u2019ll see at the end of this post, it would be part of the eventual overcoming of the behaviour. When therapists would visit us at home for my son\u2019s sessions (the speech therapist, occupational therapist, or educational psychologist), I couldn\u2019t reply to their questions and give them feedback on how things were going, without getting hit and bitten. Many times I was asked by various therapists, what methods had I used to try to stop his reactions. I told them I\u2019d tried everything \u2013 from talking through the tantrums (ignoring them), to methods of disciplining my son, to physical efforts of calm him, everything I could imagine, and everything they\u2019d suggested. It was affecting the therapy sessions so much that one day his speech therapist wanted to see what would happen if we just kept talking and ignored his tantrums. I warned her how bad it would get, but she either didn\u2019t believe me or wanted to see it for herself, and so we tried it. It was horrendous. My son screamed and cried, without breaks except to catch his breath. He turned tables and toys over, destroying what ever he could get his hands on. He pulled at my dress when I stood up so he couldn\u2019t reach my face, biting it and almost pulling it off me. I did what she told me and refused to meet his eyes, or make efforts to calm him. We kept turning away from him and continued talking, though neither of us could hear much at all of what the other said. He was deeply distraught, I was upset and near tears, even she was exhausted, by the time she agreed it wasn\u2019t going to work about half an hour later. To varying extremes, this behaviour continued from the age of three, to the age of four, and then we cracked it without knowing it was happening. My second son was born. I was so worried about how I was meant to be able to talk to my new child when my older one would tantrum each time I tried to talk to other people. But at our first outing from home as a family in the car, I went to speak to my new son in his carseat, and my older son let me. Wow. I pushed further, I tried to talk to my husband, and he let me do that too. Double wow. Over the next few weeks my son\u2019s tolerance for me talking to people other than himself, expanded, until it wasn\u2019t an issue ruining my life anymore. It still pops up now and then \u2013 he\u2019ll get anxious sometimes and try to order me by saying \u201cno talking\u201d. But we know where it will lead if we let him get into that habit again, and we come down hard and clear at those times that he cannot have control over other people in that way. It\u2019s easier now to make him understand that this is not something he can dictate \u2013 his comprehension has come a long way over the past year. As he takes more control over his autism and his world, he seems to need to take less control over me. I no longer have to suffer in silence. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/48253376@N00/279364315"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/13/a-silent-mother/", "title": "A Silent Mother"},
{"date": "November 15, 2010", "body": "\n Image by alancleaver_2000 via Flickr \n When you find out your child has autism (or indeed, any special needs condition), and are coming to terms with that new reality for yourself and your family, you are guaranteed to also find yourself wading through a sea of platitudes from well-meaning friends, family and strangers. I know it can be hard to know what to say when faced with someone upset because their child has severe problems, but I\u2019m going to suggest at the end of this piece some better responses than the following three platitudes: \u201cIt could have been worse\u201d / \u201cAt least your child isn\u2019t [insert seemingly worse condition]\u201d. You\u2019re effectively telling the parent to stop complaining, to stop sharing their troubles. You\u2019re telling them they are over-stating how bad it is, since there are so many worse things out there. The parent isn\u2019t going to now be OK since you\u2019ve pointed this out to them (and I guarantee they\u2019ve already thought it of their own accord), they\u2019re just going to realise that you don\u2019t understand, or want to understand, how hard it truly is. And just how hard is it, if you  must  compare it to other \u201cworse\u201d conditions? How\u2019s this:  \u201cSurveys have shown that parents of children with autism suffer the highest stress levels of any condition including terminal illness.\u201d  And here\u2019s a  list  of some of those stresses if you\u2019re not aware of where the problems lie. So be careful when you tell someone it could be worse, because it\u2019s quite possible that they think it really couldn\u2019t be. \u201cEvery child has issues / is special / is different.\u201d Again, it\u2019s going to come off as if you\u2019re not listening to the person who is talking to you. Of course they know every person is different and has their own challenges, but how is that helping them? I realise that, like the previous platitude, the effort is to put things \u201cin perspective\u201d for the suffering parent. But comments like these just tell them other people are hurting too, they don\u2019t do anything to alleviate the pain of the parent in front of you. Again, you\u2019re just going to make them think you either don\u2019t understand, or don\u2019t want to understand. \u201cYou got the child you were meant to get\u201d / \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d. I find this one the most upsetting. As a parent what you hear is \u201cyou deserve or can cope with the horror you are living, stop complaining about it\u201d. I\u2019ve had so many people tell me that I have my son because I have the inner strength and patience to cope with him. I do not! I have had breakdowns, I have had depression. I have had days where I watched every second tick by, waiting for the day and my nightmare to end, only to go to sleep eventually, not wanting to wake up because I have to do it all again the next day. I learnt to cover up how hard it was for me because all I got was unhelpful platitudes. I had to learn the patience I\u2019ve developed, I\u2019ve worked so very hard to become the best mum I can be to the child I have. I was not simply born with these capacities. I understand that people are trying to tell me how capable I am when  they say I got the child I was meant to have, but this would be better  conveyed in other ways \u2013 I would prefer recognition for that hard work rather than the notion that I was always meant for this life. So what do you say to parents like me, who find out their child has autism, or indeed any special needs? Let me suggest some ideas. Listen. Let the parent talk. Actively listen to how they feel and what they\u2019re going through. Avoid interrupting if they\u2019ve paused to gather their thoughts or take a breath. Ask questions. Show that you have heard them and are interested in what they are sharing, by asking questions about things you don\u2019t understand, or want to know more about. Offer help. Let them know that if you can help, you will. Is there some special skill you have which might make their lives easier \u2013 maybe you can help them with legal issues, or you have connections to certain people, or you like cooking or driving or other tasks they are struggling with. They may turn down your help \u2013 I did this a lot because I felt other people trying to help often just made things worse (which was at times true). But the offer of help, in and of itself, is a kind and appreciated thing. Comfort. Often best done physically considering how hard it can be to find the right words in this situation. Hug them, rub their back, hold their hand, let them know they are not as isolated as they feel. Praise. Let them know how great you think they\u2019re doing. Find something they\u2019re doing well in the situation and let them know you\u2019ve noticed it. Try not to let it come across as if how hard they\u2019re finding everything else is irrelevant or going un-noticed though \u2013 use the previous four suggestions to avoid that impression coming across. All this advice comes from personal experience, and from talking to other parents who have gone through the same thing. I do not hold myself out as a trained counsellor. What I\u2019ve gathered together here is particularly guided by the responses I\u2019ve seen from people who know first-hand what it\u2019s like to have a special needs child, when they meet someone else who is newly coming to terms with it; compared to those responses from people who mean well but don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. Thoughtful silence goes a lot further than a few easy platitudes. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/11121568@N06/4102645583", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0906/S00011.htm", "http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=life_fam_stress"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/platitudes/", "title": "Platitudes"},
{"date": "November 1, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n The government appointed therapists for my son (and gosh there have been a lot of them), have always strongly encouraged us to see mainstream schooling as the best option for him. Not because he was skilled enough to go to a mainstream school, but because of the following three reasons, each of which have come up in conversations with them over the past two years: (1)  That children all have their challenges; that mental and physical disabilities are all just a spectrum that all children suffer from to some degree . So my son\u2019s language, sensory and physical disabilities caused by his Autism, are just versions of issues all children suffer from anyway. (2)  That children with disabilities can learn a lot of positive things from the \u201cnormal\u201d children around them , such as social and language skills (have you noticed already how this second reason doesn\u2019t sit well with the first..?). (3)  That all children have a \u201cright to education\u201d, therefore my son has a right to be included and involved in mainstream education, and not to be shunted off to a special needs school. I\u2019m hoping that as you read through that list you can see some serious flaws with the premises or conclusions of each. To do each justice I\u2019ll be splitting their discussion into separate posts to come later (use the links that have been added above). Let me say at this point that we have decided as a family that the best place for our son to be is at a Special Needs School. We didn\u2019t just make that decision based on theories and arguments \u2013 though they were a central part of it of course. We also visited both our local mainstream and special needs schools to see with our own eyes. The best way to approach any child\u2019s education is to see them as an individual \u2013 not as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cAutistic\u201d or even as a \u201c5 year old\u201d. The central considerations have to be their individual developmental stage at the time. In this area at the least, mainstream schooling seems to be falling behind special needs schooling. The key is surely to have options in the education system.

{"date": "November 3, 2010", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n The first professional to identify my son as Autistic was his doctor, when my son was three. And the first piece of advice he gave me about this newly discovered fact was that I should consider not having any more children because the condition was known to have a strong genetic component. I was incredibly upset of course \u2013 I\u2019d only just found out my only child had this life-long disability which terrified me, and now I was been told that I shouldn\u2019t try for another child. Many months later, my son\u2019s pediatrician would confirm the genetic aspect, but gave us some more solid statistics to work with \u2013 we were facing between a one in five to one in twelve chance to having another child with Autism. We were lucky \u2013 some families who carry a specific known genetic cause of Autism face a 50% likelihood. We decided we liked our odds \u2013 an 80% chance of having a \u201cnormal\u201d child. Yes we were worse off than the rest of the population, where one in about 150 people have some degree of Autism, but it was still pretty good odds. We did a lot of research and hard thinking and decided to have a second child, for a huge range of reasons, including the well-being of our existing son \u2013 a companion through his childhood, and someone who could help look out for him after we were gone. It turned out better than we ever expected \u2013 our ten month old has actually taught our five year old already! The boys adore each other, laugh a lot together, and both constantly learn off the other. It\u2019s a beautiful thing. Plus of course it has had lots of benefits for my husband and I too \u2013 especially for our mental health. But it\u2019s damn hard work, which isn\u2019t surprising. You\u2019d think that after we\u2019d had the second child, and it turned out not to have Autism, that people would stop having the opinion that we shouldn\u2019t have had a second child. You\u2019d be wrong. There\u2019s an organisation than provides us with funding (provided by the government but administered by them) that is used specifically to give us a couple of hours each week when we don\u2019t have to look after our Autistic son \u2013 we\u2019re still in the house when the carer is here with him, but we\u2019re not hands-on the whole time having to deal with his anxieties and constant requests. It\u2019s an important service, that helps keep us sane. We were receiving less hours than we were entitled to, according to various professionals we deal with, and I was told I had to talk to the organisation to tell them how hard things were at home, so we\u2019d receive the funding we were entitled to receive. I was told not to play down how hard life was (which I tend to do); to just be honest. So I was: I rang them, told them I needed more hours allocated to my son, told them how hard things were, and the reply I received was that it was my fault for having another child. I was told that I can\u2019t legitimately complain about how hard my life is, when I made the (incorrect) decision to have another child, when I already had a special needs child on my hands. How\u2019s that for support? I found this understandably distressing, and ended up laying a complaint. They followed through to the point that we got the extra funding we were meant to have received in the first place, so at least it turned out well in the end. But what a lot of un-necessary drama and heart-ache! Yes it was our decision to have another child. Yes it makes our lives harder. But it also improves the quality of life for everyone in this little family of mine. It is too simplistic to tell people with special needs kids, that they shouldn\u2019t breed anymore, and that if they do then they shouldn\u2019t receive support since they brought it on themselves. Not just because it\u2019s a game of statistics \u2013 there was never certainty that the next child would suffer the same. And not just because there are benefits to having siblings in the family. But also because there is a lot of joy to be had with special needs children \u2013 they are not a life-sentence of hardship and horror (even though on the bad days it feels that way!); they are always individuals with hidden talents and potential, and with enough dedication and support, they can find their place in the world and make it better for others too.

My favourite tool for measuring both, is  this online ATEC  (\u201cAutism Treatment Evaluation Checklist\u201d). It\u2019s free, and you won\u2019t be breaching anyone\u2019s copyright by taking the test online (unlike some other tests you\u2019ll find online). The ATEC checklist gives you a baseline \u2013 a starting reference point for the your child\u2019s autism. It will tell you how  severe  their autism currently is, and what areas they are struggling or doing well in from speech; sociability; sensory / cognitive awareness; and health / physical / behaviour. It is also a very useful way to measure the efficacy of a new therapy: Before you start the therapy, do the checklist and note the score. After the therapy has been underway for a while (maybe a month \u2013 depending on how quickly the therapy claims to show progress), do the ATEC again and compare the scores. You\u2019ll notice that there is an extensive section at the top asking you to provide your name and a bunch of other details before you get further down to the actual checklist. I just ignore those bits and go straight to the checklist \u2013 I don\u2019t have the time to fill in lots of personal information and I don\u2019t want to give strangers that information either. Fill them in if you like, but be aware that you can do the checklist without having to; don\u2019t let that put you off the exercise. I do an ATEC score each month for my son, and keep a hard-copy spreadsheet to track his progress. By each new line of scores, I make a note of whatever therapies and activities he is currently undergoing. I take joy and pride in the areas he is improving in, and don\u2019t let myself get upset if something has gotten worse or isn\u2019t improving at the moment; it\u2019s important to remember that autism \u201ccycles\u201d \u2013 it can be two steps forward, one step backwards, and that\u2019s just the way it goes. As long as there\u2019s an over-all trend of improvement over time you\u2019re doing fine. I find it best if it\u2019s the same person taking the test each time, for the sake of consistency. The lower the score, the better. The top score is 180. A good guide to help you figure out the practical importance of the score is that under 30 is a high chance of a normal life, 30 to 50 is a good chance of a semi-independent life, and over 104 is severely autistic. The first time I took the ATEC test (in March 2009), my son\u2019s score was 65. He is now (October 2010) down to 38. I keep my eye on that magical 30 mark. I use the questions in the checklist to help to figure out what I should work on with him too, which can be quite insightful. It takes about ten minutes to fill out \u2013 maybe longer if it\u2019s your first time, shorter once you get used to the questions. Answer the questions in regards to the norm for their current age \u2013 for example, don\u2019t mark wetting diapers as a serious problem if they\u2019re at the age when they\u2019d be in diapers anyway. I\u2019d be really interested to hear what score your autistic child gets, and whether you found the checklist as useful as I have. I\u2019d also love to hear if you have some other system to fulfill the same purpose of assessing your child\u2019s progress. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Opening_a_window_to_the_autistic_brain.jpg", "http://www.autism.com/ind_atec_survey.asp", "http://www.autism.com/ind_atec_report.asp"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/assessing-severity-of-autism-therapies-and-progress/", "title": "Assessing severity of autism, therapies, and\u00a0progress."},
{"date": "November 4, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I had to listen to a lot of theories about what was wrong with my son \u2013 both before and after his diagnosis of Autism. The first one, and a frequent one I came up against those first few years, was that I was a complacent mother: I wasn\u2019t pushing him hard enough to hit his developmental milestones, wasn\u2019t encouraging him to develop the skills that every other child his age had achieved. One of the first people to voice this theory was his Plunket nurse \u2013 a free service provided for children under five, where they keep an eye on your kids height, weight and development. You\u2019d think this would be the first person to help identify that something was wrong with my child because of the significant developmental delays \u2013 in sitting, speech, walking etc. The Plunket nurse did note the delays, but blamed me for them, as a complacent mother who wasn\u2019t pushing her child hard enough. When I argued that I was and that it wasn\u2019t working, I was met with scepticism \u2013 making me a liar too. One day she decided to show me (as ignorant as I apparently was), how to encourage my son to develop properly. She showed me how my son must surely love slides as all other kids his age did, even though I\u2019d told her he didn\u2019t like climbing or sliding. She took him to the little play slide in her waiting room and forced him down the slide. He screamed, he cried, he was very distressed, and instead of picking up on those as signs that he might have some issues going on (which he did in regards to gravity and balance \u2013 sensory issues due to the Autism), she told us his reaction was because it was just new to him and keep pushing him to do it. So no matter what I said, or what my son did, she was always right and I was always wrong. She told us to force him to sit up, when he wasn\u2019t managing it by the time he should have been. I knew he didn\u2019t look ready for it physically, and that he lacked the skills to manage it, but again that was apparently just me not trying hard enough and not encouraging my son enough. So we did what she insisted we must \u2013 we put him in sitting position over and over again. He\u2019d fall forward straight onto his face, he\u2019d double-over unable to hold himself up. He\u2019d fall sideways. I was near tears watching my son being forced to do something he wasn\u2019t ready for \u2013 would you take a newborn and force it to sit..? Again, she didn\u2019t listen to our concerns, and treated me like a liar, and the signs were treated as symptoms of a complacent parent. I still find it odd that she (and she was not the only one), thought that such simple developmental steps hadn\u2019t occurred because I was doing something wrong. Abused and neglected children develop these skills, but mine \u2013 who was neither abused or neglected and with no evidence to ever suggest either \u2013 was apparently falling behind because of my parenting. The right thing to do would have been to take me as an honest parent, concerned for my son\u2019s delays, and not a lying lazy mother. The smart thing to do would have been to refer us on to a specialist even if such people did think it was all my fault \u2013 let them eliminate the other options. But it\u2019s easier to be all righteous and dismiss a new mother\u2019s fears. If she, and other judgemental mothers and family members, had done those right and smart things, we\u2019d have got the diagnosis and the help our son needed, much earlier than we did. Their attitudes also hurt me, as I started isolating myself to avoid the stares at my son and the criticisms I couldn\u2019t reply to. This was only the first though, of many theories to come\u2026 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Baby_mouth.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/theory-one-the-complacent-mother/", "title": "Theory One: The Complacent\u00a0Mother"},
{"date": "November 4, 2010", "body": "\n Image by easystand via Flickr \n My son\u2019s doctor once asked me which therapist I\u2019d found most useful. There were a lot to choose from \u2013 my son has had speech therapy, occupational therapy, an educational psychologist, music therapy, ABA therapy, physiotherapy, and a few other bits and bobs along the way. I answered quickly and quite confidently at the time: Occupational therapy. But as I tried to explain why it had been so useful, I found myself tripping over my explanation, and being unable to pin down exactly what about it had been so great. On later reflection I figured out why I had been so fond of occupational therapy. It wasn\u2019t just about the therapy itself (which often comes across as a lot of nonsense), it was the therapist. She had been the first therapist to engage with my son, after months of waiting between the confirmed diagnosis and the Ministry Of Health finally having people free to take up his case. I was so relieved at the time to have someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 come along and help me figure out how to cope with my son. She was also a very friendly and patient person, who genuinely cared about both my son, and myself. She helped me accept that for my son\u2019s well-being, I had to be cared for too \u2013 that having a therapist turn up once a week for one hour to give guidance on my son, is useless unless his primary caregiver was mentally and physically well enough to use what had been taught. This level of care and concern showed itself on many occasions. One of the first was when she came to our home for a therapy session with the speech therapist (they tag-teamed a lot), and my son was being particularly difficult, as he had been all the time of late. I was exhausted and depressed, in desperate need of a break from the tantrums, and no one in my life with both the desire and skills to take him off my hands for even an hour. I ended up in tears part way through the session, as he continually tried to hit my mouth and would scream whenever I tried to talk to them. The occupational therapist told me to go to my bedroom, take a break there and then, and that they would look after my son for the rest of the hour. I was reluctant to do so since it\u2019s not their job to babysit my kid, it was meant to be a teaching session as always. But she insisted and I gave in, and took the breather I desperately needed while they kept him amused. It was above and beyond her call of duty. I learnt after that incident to let my walls down around her. I tried very hard not to cry in front of people about my son \u2013 I always did my best to hold it together, scared that if people saw how hard it was for me that they\u2019d either think I was incompetent (a perception that I\u2019d suffered from earlier \u2013 see  Theory One ), or even worse \u2013 they\u2019d take my son away from me. But because of the occupational therapist\u2019s compassion and understanding, I often ended up in honest tears around her, and she always took it in her stride. Yes there was value in the work she did with my son, and in the methods and skills she taught me to use with him, but her real value to us was herself as a person. If she\u2019d have taught a different therapy, or if she\u2019d had no training at all, I\u2019d have still thought of her as one of the most valuable people in our lives at the time. It\u2019s like my son\u2019s educational support worker who goes to kindergarten with him five days a week \u2013 she has no specific tertiary qualification for dealing with the special needs children she works with, but she has the intelligence, patience and caring that makes me trust her with our son, and allows me to be completely honest with her each time we catch up. The support worker has to be able to implement whatever other therapies are going on in his life at the time. Similarly my son\u2019s occupational therapist had the intelligence and interest in implementing the other therapies used with him \u2013 sometimes to better effect than the actual therapist who\u2019s job it was. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s come up a lot in the news lately \u2013 as to  whether qualifications are necessary  for early childhood teachers. My experiences (more of which I shall share in future posts) have taught me that it\u2019s the person who always matters more than the qualification \u2013 the right person is harder to find than the right degree. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/25543254@N07/4921291306", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10647625"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/the-value-of-a-therapist/", "title": "The Value of a\u00a0Therapist"},
{"date": "November 4, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n A second theory about my son\u2019s disability, was that he was partially deaf. As the first years passed, and his language continued to be very limited and not functional (such as counting to ten and not saying much else), the theory became more popular. It was backed up by his non-responsiveness to people calling his name, and to how long and well he slept each day from a young age \u2013 undisturbed by the usual meaningful noises that wake babies. One particular incident when my son was about two and a half, sticks in the memory. I\u2019d taken my son to visit a neighbour I\u2019d met by chance, who had a child only a month or so older than my son. I tried to get the kids to play together, but the other child\u2019s physical skills and language were so advanced compared to my child that it wasn\u2019t working in the slightest. Eventually the boy said to me in all earnestness \u201che can\u2019t hear me\u201d. I tried to explain that he could, but even the boy\u2019s mother looked sceptical at my claim. At one stage her son climbed up into his treehouse out back and called over and over to my son for him to join him. It wasn\u2019t possible since my son couldn\u2019t climb, but beyond that my son also didn\u2019t understand the boy\u2019s words, and apparently wasn\u2019t paying full attention. He never even looked up to see the boy in the treehouse, calling out so loudly to get his attention. I didn\u2019t feel that we were welcome back after all that awkwardness, and never did go back. I knew my son could hear just fine. If you said the right words, like \u201ccar\u201d he always put his head up. If you made a meaningful sound like jingling car keys, he could hear it all the way across the house, no problem. I\u2019d try to tell people this but with all the other evidence against his hearing being OK, the theory remained. After he received the diagnosis of Autism, we were sent along to get his hearing tested anyway \u2013 for general health, but also to simply rule it out. As we knew it would be, his hearing was fine. We\u2019ve gone through therapies over the past years to improve his attentiveness and his understanding of the relevance and importance of language, but we still encounter people who think he has hearing difficulties. One of the saddest instances happened at kindergarten one day. I was at the kindergarten to pick up my son, I was talking at the time to his support worker who stays there with him through-out each session. It was tidy-up time, which my son usually loves taking part in, because it\u2019s a predictable part of the daily routine. But that day he was so enjoying the water and sand activities, that he wasn\u2019t registering the \u201ctidy-up time\u201d call, he was in his own world (as is typical of Autistic children). I watched as a child approached him and shouted \u201ctidy-up time\u201d at him, then kept shouting it, getting closer each time as my son continued to not acknowledge him in any way. Until he was literally shouting it straight into my son\u2019s ear, with still no response. Let\u2019s leave alone the fact that this (nasty) kid could and should have just got on with doing his own tidy-up, without having to shout it endlessly at my boy. I shouted back at the boy \u201coi, don\u2019t shout in his ear\u201d and raced to stop him, at which point the kid ran away quite sheepishly \u2013 no apologies of course. It won\u2019t be the last time someone tells me my son is deaf, or acts as if he is \u2013 a common theory for both adults and kids, though kids tend to be more vocal about it. It doesn\u2019t surprise me either, we all understand the idea of someone not being able to hear, it\u2019s so much harder to get your head around this controversial diagnosis called \u201cAutism\u201d. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Symbol_for_Deafness.svg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/theory-two-he-cant-hear-me/", "title": "Theory Two: \u201cHe can\u2019t hear\u00a0me.\u201d"},
{"date": "November 5, 2010", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n One of the most important and useful pieces of information that I was given after my son\u2019s diagnosis of Autism, came from a mother who been through it all herself. She worked for the local branch of a charity that helped families cope with Autism. She told me to expect to go through a grieving process, and to expect it to take a year. And it is a grieving process: As an adult (and even as a child) you contemplate what it will be like to one day have a child of your own. You have hopes and expectations for what they will be like and do. You find the partner you think will be a good parent one day, you marry, get pregnant, give birth, and through each step the hopes only intensify and become clearer, more real. And then you find out what you wanted for them \u2013 even the simplest things such as being able to have a conversation with you, to have a job, to have kids of their own \u2013 may never happen. You also find out that they might never leave home, that until the day you die you will be responsible for someone who may never be able to say \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cI love you\u201d. That most of your days you\u2019ll be dealing with often violent tantrums, and will be unable to go out to places like zoos or restaurants, as a family. You grieve the loss of your future-life, you grieve the loss of the child you thought you had when it was born. That might sound politically incorrect; to say you\u2019re grieving the loss of a child when you find out it\u2019s disabled. But it\u2019s true, and at times like that what a parent needs to hear more than anything else, is the truth. It was also vital that she had told me it would last a year. Months after the diagnosis I was telling myself to get over it \u2013 it could be worse, it might all turn out OK \u2013 all the platitudes I was hearing from those around me who hadn\u2019t been through this (which I will expand on a later post;  \u201cGet Over It\u201d Part Two: The Platitudes ). But I wasn\u2019t getting over it, and those words and thoughts were making things worse. It wasn\u2019t until I was told to expect a year-long grieving process that I stopped beating up on myself for how dreadful I was feeling about my son and my life. I realised I had to give it time, I had to live my new life in order to eventually accept and enjoy it again. I had to feel whatever I was feeling each day, each week, each month, knowing that it was all part of a long and necessary process. I passed this wisdom \u2013 about a year-long grieving process after the diagnosis \u2013 on to a new friend one day at the Autism Playgroup for preschoolers. She had only recently received the diagnosis about her son, and was struggling \u2013 as we all do \u2013 to come to terms with what it meant for her son and her life. After I told her what she was going through was OK \u2013 there was nothing wrong with admitting that it hurt like hell \u2013 she broke into tears. I let her say what she needed to say, share what she was going through, instead of interrupting with the same things I\u2019d been hearing from well-meaning family and strangers for the past many months about how she should instead be grateful and happy and hopeful. We became good friends. Autism is a bitch. Parenting an Autistic child is hard and exhausting and isolating. That\u2019s the truth, though it may be cruel, it is even crueller to deny it and make a parent feel guilt for feeling what they feel as they come to terms with it. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bertram_Mackennal_-_Grief.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/get-over-it-part-one-the-grieving/", "title": "\u201cGet Over It\u201d Part One: The\u00a0Grieving"},
{"date": "October 15, 2016", "body": "My children\u2019s dentist is a free dental clinic attached to a school that is about half an hour\u2019s drive from home. It\u2019s not close, it\u2019s not convenient, and I could get free dental care for the kids directly through their school. Yet I keep going back to this one place, even though my children never actually went to the school that the clinic is attached to. There\u2019s nothing special about the building, there\u2019s nothing special about the official range of services they offer. They aren\u2019t a special needs clinic and they don\u2019t offer to sedate my children in order to perform dentistry on them. But they do have something exceptional: a specific dentist. This dentist has no specific training for dealing with autistic children, what she does though is a perfect example of how inclusion can work, and how making inclusion work is in the best interests of everyone (not just the children). I remember an early visit to this clinic, when I saw a different dentist than the one we now see. It was the closest dental clinic to my home at the time. That dentist quickly lost patience with my eldest son, and told me that if he wouldn\u2019t comply with her instructions, she\u2019d have to make a referral to a place where he\u2019d have to be sedated in order for them to carry out dental care. I was shocked and upset, I said I\u2019d have to think about the option, and left feeling quite upset \u2013 both that she believed he required such an extreme approach, and that she hadn\u2019t persisted with a gentler approach. In those early years, I quickly learned that my eldest son had a strong fear of dental work, and that he was going to need me by his side for every dental appointment. So once he began school, I signed a form clearly saying he was not to attend the roving school dental nurse clinics, where he\u2019d have no relationship with the dentist and I couldn\u2019t be by his side. The school ignored the paperwork, and sent him along to the dental clinic anyway, even as he protested that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to go\u201d (because I\u2019d told him he didn\u2019t have to go to the school dental nurse). He was told \u201cyes you do\u201d and was forced to. His fear of dentists after that only got worse. (And yes, there was an enquiry \u2013 that went beyond the school and into the health sector \u2013 and an apology, for the incident.) I thought this was just going to be the way of things \u2013 stressful, largely redundant dental appointments, eventually ending up with sedation to carry out the simplest of dental care. Then I had yet another scheduled appointment at the initial clinic we\u2019d visited- I was dreading the appointment, thinking she\u2019d tell me me had no choice but to go with sedation. But it was a different dentist at the clinic this time. She was clam, she was reassuring, she was gentle and encouraging. She didn\u2019t say he\u2019d require sedation, but she did say we better come back again soon so she could keep a close eye on his dental health since she wasn\u2019t able to get him to accept the process for taking x-rays and he had a limited time during which he\u2019d allow her to work within his mouth. She also said it would be good for him to come back again soon so he could become more accustomed with the experience and grow to fear it less. I liked this woman, and I have chosen to only ever attend dental appointments when she is available ever since. And she only got better. So much better. Each time we see her she seems to come up with yet another way to help both my children become more compliant and less fearful of the dental experience. This is the current list of things she does, that has built up to this point over the years, of her own accord: She makes sure no other children are scheduled at the same time in adjacent rooms so there is no crying or screaming or distress from other rooms to add to my children\u2019s anxiety; she always advises them of what she is about to do and shows them what equipment she will be using, to reduce anxiety and unexpected events; she involves the children in each process, answering all their questions and teaching them about why she does what she does; she schedules six-monthly appointments so there is less danger involved in her not being able to gather full information from them through x-rays between otherwise yearly appointments (their teeth are in great condition with all this care, as you can imagine! One temporary filling for each child, but that\u2019s not too bad); she uses praise and rewards to keep them engaged and compliant as much as possible; she even specially reserves a parking spot for us so the children have less distance to travel. She always schedules my boys\u2019 appointments together, and uses what she does to one boy, to help the other \u2013 to encourage the other to give it a go too, and to show them they need not be afraid. She is aware of their sensory issues \u2013 she\u2019d learned, for instance, that both my boys panic when the x-ray tab is put in their mouths because they both get the sensation they\u2019re going to choke on it or accidentally swallow it. So she changed the positioning for the x-ray, and even managed to get my youngest to finally have an x-ray last time by sitting him forward to avoid the fear of choking. Little things; big progress. She is not specially trained to deal with autistic children or children with special needs, but she hasn\u2019t had to be, because she is so patient, so compassionate, and so thoughtful. She has built a relationship with both my children \u2013 and with me. I wish she was  my  dentist! Her success with my children, hasn\u2019t just benefited them through her ability to increasingly perform longer checks and more intensive care of their teeth; it hasn\u2019t just soothed and comforted me, as their parent. It has also saved the public purse a heck of a lot too \u2013 otherwise having to send my children along for sedation at a hospital facility, which would have involved a lot more resources and people (and expensive ones at that) than them just seeing her briefly every six months. She has also saved the public purse from having to pay out for more drastic damage to my children\u2019s teeth \u2013 because she sees them so regularly and is able to do more with them each time, there is less cost involved than had she not been able to get them to comply and their dental issues had got a lot worse than they are. I wish there was a way to have her acknowledged publicly for what she does. I want people to see how it can be, to know it is possible to work with kids like mine without having to necessarily sedate them. To build meaningful relationships that benefit everyone. I want people to know how awesome she is, and to learn from her. At least I can blog about it! The last time we visited her, which was only a few weeks ago, I was walking back to the car with both my boys, and my eldest turned to me and said: \u201cMum, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m so afraid of the dentists anymore.\u201d I gave him a big hug and told him how proud I was of him. I wanted to rush back and give the dentist a big hug too! I hope she knows what a difference she\u2019s made in our lives; I always do tell her how much I appreciate her care of my boys, and she turns the praise back on me and tells me what a great job I\u2019m doing with my boys! I\u2019d travel a lot more than half an hour to keep someone this special in my kids\u2019 lives. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2016/10/15/dental-fear-or-dental-care/", "title": "Dental Fear or Dental\u00a0Care"},
{"date": "October 18, 2016", "body": "Why is it so wrong for schools to use seclusion, how is it any different from time out, and is time out a good idea anyway \u2013 what are the alternatives? These are important questions, that have come to the fore in light of recent national controversies, and the anticipated policy from the government on seclusion and restraint practices in schools. I felt I couldn\u2019t adequately answer each question myself, so I set out to find the answers, and I want to share them in (what I hope to be) an accessible and simple way. I\u2019d love to get your feedback and your understanding of these issues too. Seclusion is not the same thing as time out (even though a room used for the purposes of secluding a misbehaving child may be called a \u201ctime out\u201d room). For the purposes of understanding disciplinary practices, seclusion is about keeping a child in an area they cannot leave. This inability to leave can be because the door is locked, or the child is physically or intellectually unable to leave by themselves. Compare this to time out, which is about removing a child from a situation or area, but not removing their ability to move. If you\u2019ve stopped them moving from an area, that would be seclusion; if you\u2019ve stopped them being able to move their body, that is restraint. Both\u00a0 seclusion and restraint are more serious interventions than time out, and are meant to serve a restricted purpose (which I\u2019ll get to below). Time out may be placing a child in the back of a room, or in a corridor, or somewhere else that removes them from where they were before, in a way that is meant to leave them un-engaged and quiet. Seclusion and restraint are only meant to be used for the child\u2019s own or others\u2019 safety \u2013 they are not meant to be used as a form of punishment. They are last-option measures for when other interventions have not worked and the situation is one of crisis. Because of the function of these interventions, it is very important that the child is monitored the entire time they are secluded, and that the seclusion or restraint ends once the danger has passed. Because time out is less extreme, it is usually used with a wider set of purposes than seclusion or restraint, though it is not a good way to discipline a child and is not recommended as a form of punishment. It is meant to be used as a way to remove a child from a situation where they are becoming distressed or causing distress to others, giving them a chance to calm down and reflect on their behaviour, before they rejoin the other children or the activity. However, time out is increasingly seen as an ineffective and even damaging way to discipline a child. It can cause further (and long-term) distress and social isolation, it can cause heightened anger and resentment, and it can leave a child in an extremely emotional state when what they require at the time is guidance and assistance to get themselves back under control. The child may struggle to understand what they have done wrong, how to do it differently next time, and how to calm themselves. (It\u2019s no good trying to get a child to understand and reflect on their actions, if they are in a heightened state of distress (which is what typically leads to a timeout scenario).) Since the purpose of time out is to achieve these ends, it\u2019s good to be aware of alternatives that do actually achieve these ends without the added ill-effects of time out. Alternatives to time out, include giving the child another activity that isn\u2019t causing such distress (draw a picture, for example), giving them choices alternate to their current actions thus still allowing them to feel in control and take responsibility for their actions, walking and talking them through a calming strategy, taking them outside, or taking them to a chill-out area (as opposed to the more tedious and upsetting \u201csit by yourself and do and say nothing\u201d option). If you\u2019re not meant to use time out for punishment, then what can you use to teach and alter a child\u2019s behaviour? That very much depends on first figuring out whether it is blame-worthy behaviour, and whether the child has control over what they have done. This first step is extremely important for childen who have special needs, because they typically have less control, less awareness, or less understanding than their peers; there is no point to punishing someone for something outside of their control or understanding. To do so would be cruel and pointless. Instead the child will need other interventions tailored to their ability and understanding, to help them adjust their behaviour over time in a meaningful and relevant way. If the behaviour is blame-worthy and was a controlled choice, then you can turn your mind to punishment, but even \u201cpunishment\u201d here is not going to be quite what you\u2019re after to change a child\u2019s behaviour; what you want is  consequences . Consequences link to the behaviour, in a way that makes the lesson meaningful, relevant, and memorable. Consequences might be natural \u2013 flowing from simply how the world works, and allowing the child to experience that consequence of not doing what they were meant to \u2013 or logical, where the authoritative figure has explained in advance what will happen if the person does not behave the way they should, and the consequent makes sense in light of what the child has done (or not done). This \u201cconsequences\u201d approach is more in line with the concept of  discipline , and less so with the less-helpful notion of punishment. Using consequences rather than punishment in a classroom setting, would make discipline more relevant and more effective, and should lead to improvements in behaviour over time (when you\u2019re constantly sending a child home from school or putting them in seclusion, clearly it is not working \u2013 for anyone involved). Using the suggested alternatives to time out may seem time-consuming, but once the child starts to master strategies for calming themselves, they can start to take real responsibility both for their reactions when under stress and for bringing themselves back down to a place where they can integrate with the group again. Going for a walk, chilling out in a calming area with a soothing activity, or talking through what you did and why and how to act differently next time, don\u2019t have to take a lot of time for the teacher, and would hopefully lead to less class disruption in the future \u2013 ultimately saving the class time. Of course matters are complicated when a child has sensory issues and communication problems, such as children with autism have, but those are matters to be taken into account in what approach you use with a specific child, they are not insurmountable barriers to behavioural change or to discipline. Also, the better a teacher \u2013 and classmates \u2013 understand what upsets or distresses a child, the easier it will be for everyone to avoid those triggers or to see them coming or to know that they need to expect a reaction soon. It\u2019s a matter of understanding, compassion, and problem-solving; it is the opposite of all of that when a child with special needs is placed in a seclusion room. I\u2019m no expert, I\u2019m not a teacher, I\u2019m just a mother trying to understand the issues, the terms, and the science behind the uses of types of discipline.

{"date": "October 8, 2011", "body": "\n Image by alyceobvious via Flickr \n I remember interesting conversations arising in my law and philosophy classes, over the limits and problems of causation. In law this problem often arose under the discussion of the \u201c but for \u201d test; in philosophy it often occurred in the context of discussing  determinism . I see the same types of discussions and issues arise in autism discussions, particularly in regards to genius, and other traits associated with \u2013 but arguably not caused by \u2013 autism. Would an autistic person had been a genius without the autism (or would their genius have been much more profound without the autism in the way)? Are sensory / gut / physiological (etc) issues caused by and part of the autism, or a sign of some other comorbid condition (or perhaps a sign of a hitherto un(der)recognised variety of autism)? To a significant extent of course these are medical questions, but they go beyond that too; to questions about attitudes, definitions, and individual identity. These issues become so heated and so messy for autism, since autism impacts so widely and deeply on the mind (and often body) of an autistic person from such a young age, that it can be nigh-impossible to imagine the child (or adult) without the autism. I have a lot of trouble imagining what my son would be like if he\u2019d never had autism; it so invades / informs his thoughts, reactions and interactions that it\u2019s like an inseparable part of his identity. I can ask whether he\u2019d have been this smart (or smarter) but for the autism. I can wonder whether his personality would have been this wonderful (or worse or better) without its impact. Asking those questions is easy, finding meaningful answers that aren\u2019t packed to the rim with other people\u2019s agendas and ulterior motives, is not. (Agendas such as shining the spot-light on a particular \u201cbrand\u201d or attitude towards autism, to encourage research and services in one direction rather than the other; to fight for a cure, or to fight for the end of the search for a cure.) I view the upcoming changes to the DSM, as moving in the right direction, because they tidy up the current mess as to what is and is not central to autism (such as recognising that  sensory issues  are common and directly related to autism, and changing the criteria in such a way that helps  separate out those who have Aspergers-qua-autism, from those who are (simply) gifted ). The task of deciding what is central and related, and what is perhaps incidental and caused by something separate from autism, is a controversial one to say the least (the clarifications around the  intellectual developmental disorders in the DSM-5 as they relate to autism , have definitely attracted this sort of controversy.) Under either DSMs though, my son nevertheless has autism, and no other comorbid conditions (that I am yet aware of, of course). It would be nice if I could say I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about my son. But I would love his communication to be stronger and come faster and more naturally. I would love it if his anxieties were not so many and varied and debilitating. If I could change such things \u2013 somehow \u2013 would it mean changing the rest of him; including the parts that I adore about him so much? If the magic pill was made to remove his autism, would I want him to take it? Personally, yes, because autism seems to have impacted  far  more negatively than positively on his life, and that is not a surprising statement surely,  considering the diagnostic criteria for autism . And so we go in circles again; whoever has the \u201cpower\u201d to define (and redefine) \u201cautism\u201d \u2013 what is and what is not truly a consequence of, or is part and parcel with autism \u2013 has obviously immense impact on our (my) attitudes towards whether it is a gift, a curse, or something in between (or indeed, both a gift and a curse). I love my son, completely. But I do not love his autism. If \u201cnot having autism\u201d meant he didn\u2019t have all those problems listed off in the diagnostic criteria, then yes I want it gone; it would be odd for me to say otherwise. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever see the day when that offer will be made to me, and I know that preferring he wasn\u2019t autistic doesn\u2019t make me love him any less (the love I have for him is beyond words, some days it simply overwhelms me). So though it crosses my mind at times, I don\u2019t dwell on it; on imagining what my son would have been like,  but for  his autism. This is who he is, and whether it was who he was \u201cmeant\u201d to be, or whether I could make him any different with a magic pill, are questions for round the philosophy table (or a bloggers\u2019 table if you prefer); in my everyday life \u2013 in my son\u2019s everyday life \u2013 we just do the best we can, and work towards him becoming the amazing man he is going to one day be. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/18316438@N00/4414494166", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/10/08/but-for-autism/", "title": "But For Autism"},
{"date": "October 14, 2016", "body": "What does it take, to justify putting a child in a small, empty, locked, dark \u201ctime-out\u201d room in a school, when they\u2019d otherwise be playing with their peers, or learning in the classroom? The answer you\u2019ll get most often, from those who have even the slightest understanding of how controversial this practice is, is \u201cthe child must be a danger to themselves, to others, or to property\u201d to be secluded in this manner. The answer  should be  \u201cnothing justifies it.\u201d Perhaps the best answer is, that it takes a lack of knowledge, lack of training, and a lack of basic empathy, to be able to justify the practice.  It\u2019s bad enough to use the practice on children who are capable of explaining themselves and who are able to regulate their behaviour in the response to threats of \u201ctime-out\u201d; it is so much worse to use such seclusion as a form of  punishment  for children who\u00a0 are suffering from anxiety and have genuine difficulty with self-control and self-regulation. All it achieves in this situation, is potentially more anxiety, fear, depression, and trauma. Reading the recently released 52-page  report by Terri Johnstone ,  for the Ministry of Education , on the use of just such a room at Miramar Central School in Wellington, you\u2019re given an excellent example of how to misuse and abuse seclusion in this way. Miramar Central School has become the poster-child of time-out abuse, and, in my opinion, it fully deserves all the bad press. It deserves to have a complete overhaul of top-level staff that have been aware of and allowing this to go on, and it deserves to have its student roll numbers collapse in the face of what it has done \u2013 and what it has not done. Miramar School has, evidently, been keeping incomplete and inconsistent records around use of this terrible time-out room and behaviour plans involving this time-out room. It has not been advising parents when the room has been used, and it has been going against its own written policies on when and how the room is to be used. There have been directly contradictory reports from staff on when and how it has been used. It\u2019s one thing to have such a room available in a school, it\u2019s a next-level thing to use it in the ways that it has; it has been used as a threat for non-compliant behaviour, it has been used as punishment, it has been used in many ways that fall short of the child being a danger to themselves, to others, or to property. It has been used for long stretches of time that would test the sanity of an adult. If I lock you in a small, dark, empty room for the next 25 minutes, would you emerge magically calm, or might you be angry you were locked away, more anxious than you were before, perhaps confused as it why it was done to you, unsure of when it was going to end or what you had to do to make it stop. All ways that a child who has intellectual disabilities might experience the situation, when they have trouble with sensory-input or communication difficulties which are classic of children with autism. When what had been happening at Miramar Central School came to light, instead of the school making clear expressions of shame and regret, we got excuses: The Ministry of Education knew and approved of the room\u2019s existence, they said (the Ministry isn\u2019t so convinced, and  Hekia Parata has strongly attacked the practice ); the room\u2019s use will be phased out now (instead of completely halted and never used again \u2013 though they\u2019ve finally removed the door and said they won\u2019t use the room anymore now that the report is out); it was used for when the child was a danger to themselves, others, or to property (except that their own teachers have admitted they were using it for a much wider range of behaviours and purposes). We\u2019re told in Johnstone\u2019s comprehensive report that the school staff believed they were acting in the best interests of the children when they used the room; I find this so sad. Were they really that deluded, would they  really  do this to their own children? If they were so positive it was done in childrens\u2019 best interests, why weren\u2019t they telling those children\u2019s parents when the room had been used, why weren\u2019t they keeping accurate and consistent records of it\u2019s use, and why didn\u2019t they seek prior approval for its use from the children\u2019s parents as they were meant to have done? I struggle with this, I really do. What alternative do teachers have, when faced with potentially and actually dangerous or disobedient behaviour, other than locking a kid in a room? What they could have done, and should have done, is also in-part outlined in the report. They could have and should have tried to understand antecedent behaviours and tried to address and minimise the triggers, they could and should have created and implemented behavioral plans for each child with such behaviours, in consultation and with the approval and sign-off of those children\u2019s parents. They could and should have been consulting experts in behaviour therapies and alternative positive behavioural approaches. They had options, they had not exhausted those options. Instead they used a locked room. A locked room does more than isolate a dangerous child. It embarrasses. It disempowers. It makes you feel unwanted, small, frustrated. It leaves you feeling forgotten. It excludes you from play, from friends, from the associated opportunities to create and build on social skills. It excludes you from  learning  \u2013 from the very reason they\u2019re at the school in the first place. But, thankfully, you get to go home, at the end of the day. Even if you lack the communication skills to tell your loved ones what has happened to you that day, you get to go home. Unless you grow up as an autistic adult in this lovely country of ours, and then \u201chome\u201d can become the new eternal locked seclusion, like for poor  Ashley Peacock . You see, if you have schools that don\u2019t care enough to understand and work meaningfully with our young autistic children, how can you magically expect the state services to care the way they can and should with our adult autistic children? And what happens when us parents, are no longer around to be their voices and fight their fights? We need to bring attention to this now, and loudly, and constantly, because the change needed to stop the seclusion, exclusion, and excuses, is needed across society and government services, and not just in our classrooms. On that point, I want to express my heart-felt gratitude that we have someone at the New Zealand Herald who has consistently and loudly been this voice for us, where and whenever she can. Notice that the reporter of these stories on Miramar Primary School that shoved this issue into the spotlight, and that the reporter giving us updates on Ashley Peacock, is Kirsty Johnston. Kirsty also allowed me to share my own experiences with special education and school services, with a national audience through the NZ Herald, last year. We are lucky to have such a compassionate and thorough reporter keeping an eye out for our concerns in the area of education, special education, and disabilities. The Ministry of Education is due to release its official recommendations on seclusion and restraint practices in schools, before the end of the year; I\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for that and adding it to the resources list below once it has been released too. *** Some Key Resources: \n \u201c Seclusion expert to investigate detention in New Zealand \u201d (re Ashley Peacock) NZ Herald, Jun 8, 2016 \n \u201c Family \u201cdismayed\u201d over Ashley Peacock cottage proposal \u201d NZ Herald, Sep 29, 2016 \n \u201c 11 year-old locked in \u201cdark cell\u201d 13 times in 9 days yelled \u201cI\u2019ll be good, I\u2019ll be good \u201d (the write-up of this story made me want to cry, so hard to read as a parent) NZ Herald, Oct 8, 2016 \n \u201c Angry parents demand accountability over school\u2019s \u201ctime-out\u201d room \u201d NZ Herald, Oct 10, 2016 \n \u201c Ministry to release Miramar school seclusion room investigation report \u201d (including links to radio interviews, and another shocking story of abuse of a seclusion room in 2012) stuff.co.nz, Oct 13, 2016 \n \u201c Ombudsman launches investigation of seclusion rooms in schools \u201d NZ Herald , Oct 14, 2016 \n Investigation into the use of seclusion at Miramar Central School , Ministry of Education page with link to the PDF report \u201c Investigation of Parent Complaint at Miramar Central School Wellington \u201d by Terri Johnstone, Sep 2016 \n New resources added since publishing this post: \n \u201c \u201cWe mucked up\u201d: Miramar Central School representative \u201d \u2013 an excellent interview by John Campbell, with a board spokesman from the school.

{"date": "November 8, 2016", "body": "There is a growing awareness in New Zealand that our education system is not delivering on basic obligations to a significant and vulnerable group of children. This failure of the system affects all of the country\u2019s children: When a child is not given necessary supports to access and take part in education, that affects not just that child and their family, it impacts on their teachers, on the other children in that classroom, and on wider society as the child has not been given the opportunity to meet their full potential. It reflects poorly on our country that we have allowed this situation to go on for as long as it has. It\u2019s so easy for those who don\u2019t know them, to point the finger of blame at the child, at the parent, at the teacher, but the problems being experienced are not isolated incidents that can be solved in a piecemeal fashion; the problems are clearly systemic. The stories that are increasingly coming to light are symptoms of an education system that is broken on many levels. Funding is inadequate and poorly allocated, while unwieldy bureaucratic forms and processes are very difficult for both parents and teachers to navigate. Once you\u2019ve ticked all the right boxes, and managed to fit your child into those tight criteria, they are still unlikely to receive enough of what they need to succeed in class. One of my children receives ORS funding, though it hasn\u2019t meant he has access to all the supports he requires to fully join in at school. My other child\u2014who in many ways faces more challenges than my first child does in the school setting\u2014had his ORS application denied. That denied application took a month to write, working alongside the school and therapists to compile the document. He has autism, dyspraxia, and suspected dyslexia. We now struggle from term to term to access the teacher aide support he desperately needs just to be in the classroom safely (he\u2019s a danger to himself, not others) and to learn alongside his peers. He falls increasingly further behind in his learning. Next year, as he enters Year 3, he also starts his  third  school\u2014we shift him from place to place trying to find somewhere adequately resourced to help him take part in the education that most children and families take for granted. This little 6 year-old boy has tested as having above-average intelligence\u2014the waste of his potential is enormous, and outrageous. The stories of seclusion rooms, children being excluded from school because of inadequate supports, and parents having to pay teacher aides themselves, are just the tip of the iceberg. If you want an insight to just how big this iceberg is, you need only talk to the parents and educators endlessly advocating for these children\u2019s right to access education in New Zealand. And you have an opportunity to do exactly that, this Saturday. On  Saturday November 12 th , there will be an Auckland rally following on from the very successful one that took place in Wellington in September. It will be a family-friendly event, held in front of the rotunda at Auckland Domain, from  midday to 1pm . (Picnics are welcome!) This is another vital opportunity for us to share our stories\u2014to be heard, to be seen, to be among others who have fought the fights we do every day, and who want to help end those exhausting fights. To share our vision of an education system that not only welcomes and includes all children, but that appreciates and celebrates what they are capable of if only the system was set up to help them succeed rather than watch them fail. What we want is not impossible, and it is necessary; to have an education system that delivers an education for all. Speakers will include: \n  Bernadette Macartney , an advocate, academic and educator, who will be the MC and will provide an introduction to the rally. \n Etta Bolinger , a self-advocate and academic, providing a disability perspective. \n  Huahana Hickey , an academic and advocate for disability and Maori rights, providing a Maori perspective. \n Antonia Hannah , a parent and advocate, and current co-convenor of the Inclusive Education Action Group, providing a whanau/family perspective. \n I\u2019ll be there too; not as a speaker, but as a member of the supportive crowd. Please join us. If you would like more information about how the current system is falling short of its obligations to our children, and what we\u2019d like to see changed, please see \u201c Education for all \u2013 Open Letter .\u201d That page also provides a link to videos from the last rally, a link to the petition for change, and a list of the organisations supporting this movement.

{"date": "October 12, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n This post is a more in-depth analysis of the issue identified in  an earlier post , in regards to the potential exclusion of those with intellectual disability from an autism diagnosis. This is a complex issue and I am open to alternate views and understandings; I openly encourage you to share such in the comments. \n The wording of the proposed fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, due May 2013) category for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), appears to begin with an exclusion of those with general developmental delays. It states that the\u00a0\u201cpersistent deficits in social communication and social interaction\u201d required for a diagnosis of ASD under criteria A, must be \u201c not accounted for by general developmental delays .\u201d \u201cGeneral developmental delays\u201d here appears to potentially encompass a range of disorders, including the new categories \u201c Intellectual or Global Developmental Delay Not Elsewhere Classified \u201d (IGDD) and  Intellectual Developmental Disorder.\u201d  (IDD). IGDD is used where symptoms are perhaps not yet clear enough to qualify for a more specific diagnosis, such as the child is as yet too young to be properly assessed. IDD generally replaces the old category of Mental Retardation, but specifically moves away from requiring a specific IQ score (of about 70). The concern is that the wording under the new criteria A for an ASD diagnosis, goes beyond the stated interests of those who have chosen (and are working on) the wording. From various sources (such as  here  and  here ), it is clear that there is not an express desire to  exclude  those with general developmental delays (largely including the intellectually disabled as a group), so much as a desire to  clarify  when ASD is comorbid with, and when it is different from, such conditions. There is clear appreciation of the fact that it can be and often is comorbid with intellectual disabilities (for example). However, the actual language in the proposed criteria, and the way in which is is then likely to be put into practice, seems to act as an  exclusion  rather than a differentiation or clarification. If the social communication and social interaction deficits are accounted for by general developmental delay, it looks like that \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 will exclude an ASD diagnosis. This would be regardless of the person meeting criteria B, C and D, since each and every criteria must itself be met; falling short of criteria A would exclude the ASD diagnosis. If the aim was to make sure a general developmental delay is not mistaken for ASD (and that does seem to be the guiding concern of the framers), then I would think there were two better options: (1) That there be included in the ASD category an explicit reminder to diagnosticians to consider whether the observed delays are perhaps  better  explained by some other condition (with listed examples of those alternatives), or (2) that the criteria be written in such a way that their very operation will serve to clarify when someone has ASD, so that there is no need to say anything about general developmental delays. I am sure these alternatives occurred to the writers, what is unclear thus far is why they decided slipping it into criteria A with that chosen wording, was their best option. If it is just poor wording \u2013 regardless of the best intentions behind it \u2013 it would not be the first time there has been a significant slip-up in the wording for an ASD diagnosis under the DSM. The DSM-IV, published in 1994, had an error under PDD-NOS (the largest autism grouping). Across the three areas of communication, behaviour and social interaction, someone with PDD-NOS was meant to have impairments in more than one area, but the final text used the wrong wording leading to a requirement of only needing one of the three criteria for a diagnosis of PDD-NOS. The error was corrected in the 2000 revised edition of the DSM-IV, but by then \u201cpsychiatrists, psychologists, and epidemiologists throughout the world had been following these extremely broad criteria for six years, during the period when the so-called \u2018[autism] epidemic\u2019 emerged.\u201d (Quote from  \u201cUnstrange Minds\u201d by Roy Richard Grinker .) So it is not inconceivable that another oversight with serious consequences, could occur, and take a while to fix. That is, if the chosen wording under the DSM-5 is an oversight at all. I can see how  one might view it more as an deliberate effort to remove the intellectually disabled from ASD altogether . My personal view on this though is that it\u2019s poorly chosen wording (particularly because it makes more sense to ascribe people honest and open intentions accompanied by poor wording arrangement, rather than assign a conspiracy theory model to their actions. Benefit of the doubt.) Though I am just a lay-person, I am not alone in my concerns about how the chosen wording might be implemented, and am equally not convinced by the  replies  to those concerns. It is perfectly possible that I (and others) have misunderstood the wording and potential application, but there is clearly room there for that confusion to blossom, and I would hope that the final version addresses such concerns. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DSM-IV-TR.jpg", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=447#", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=384#", "http://www.dsm5.org/research/pages/autismandotherpervasivedevelopmentaldisordersconference%28february3-5,2008%29.aspx", "http://autism.about.com/od/diagnosingautism/a/Will-Children-With-Intellectual-Delays-No-Longer-Be-Diagnosed-With-Autism.htm", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/07/autism-and-intellectual-disability-in.html", "http://autism.about.com/od/diagnosingautism/a/Will-Children-With-Intellectual-Delays-No-Longer-Be-Diagnosed-With-Autism.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/intent-vs-effect-re-the-exclusion-of-general-developmental-delay-under-asd-in-the-dsm-5/", "title": "Intent vs Effect re the Exclusion of General Developmental Delay under ASD in the\u00a0DSM-5"},
{"date": "October 26, 2011", "body": "One of my greatest fears as a mother, is that a stranger would take my son, and I wouldn\u2019t know where my son was or what was happening with him, or whether I\u2019d get him back. These fears are multiplied with a special needs child because of their special needs; the worry that they are even less able to fend for themselves, find their way home, and more likely to irritate and confuse whoever took them (with potentially horrid consequences). Yesterday morning I had a small taste of those fears coming true. My son is picked up each morning by the same taxi driver, hired by the special-needs school to ferry my son and most of his fellow class-mates to and from school everyday. Yesterday was the first day back at school for the term. His taxi driver from last term had left, and at the end of last term he had trained up his replacement; acquainting him with each child\u2019s special needs for getting on and off the taxi, and making sure us parents were familiar and comfortable with his replacement. But it wasn\u2019t his replacement who turned up yesterday morning, knocking on our door at 7:30am. It was some other man I\u2019d never met before, looking a bit lost, but he was from the right taxi company, knew my son\u2019s name, had the right looking taxi van. He was much earlier than the other driver was meant to come (closer to 8am) so I was a bit confused and disoriented. He said the other driver couldn\u2019t do the run, and so he was the replacement. He wasn\u2019t familiar with the car seats or the route, but he seemed to be sure he was meant to be picking up my son. Any change in plans in life makes me nervous. So I\u2019ve got used to telling myself to try to go with the flow; adjust and relax, don\u2019t over-think it. So I let my son get in the taxi van with this stranger. Ten minutes later the original replacement taxi driver turns up at our door, with one of the other students already in the back, ready to pick up my son. I told him someone else had already picked up my son, he was confused and tried to call the base operations to find out what was going on. He couldn\u2019t get through but said he\u2019d sort it out, and drove off. Leaving me and my husband alarmed. I tried to get hold of the head teacher to let her know what had happened, but didn\u2019t get a reply. My husband rang the taxi company to find out what was going on, they told him the taxi run had been taken off one of the drivers that was currently out there picking up these children. We weren\u2019t told why. Thoughts start bouncing around as to why one of those drivers lost his run; was he a risk to our son, was he a poor driver, did he now have a vendetta with the taxi company and had refused to stand-down? In the meantime we worried too that there would be no-one at the school if and when our son arrived; usually the teachers would meet him, but the new taxi driver clearly hadn\u2019t been walked through the routine and we were worried he\u2019d just drop off our son \u2013 probably far too early considering the early pick up \u2013 and then what would become of our wandering child? My husband decided to drive to the school himself to wait for our son to appear, in case no teachers would be ready for him. Also of course, to make sure our son arrived safely. In the meantime I rang the taxi company again, who on three occasions told me he\u2019d arrive at the school by a certain time, and each time that time would come and go and my husband would let me know they still hadn\u2019t arrived. My husband had been waiting at the school for an hour. The teachers there didn\u2019t know what was going on either. The children were all meant to arrive in the taxi van by 8:30, the usual half hour after our son usually leaves our house. 8:30 came and went. 9am came and went. Still no sign of the taxi or our son. Other children from his class started arriving at school, dropped off by their parents, saying the taxi van had never turned up. Can you imagine what it was like by that stage? Our son is in a taxi van with a driver we don\u2019t know, who might be the man who has had his other runs taken off him, in a taxi van that never turned up at these other homes, and he\u2019s exceptionally late to the school. The taxi company tells me during one call that our son has been transferred from one taxi van to another, but they can\u2019t seem to confirm who the driver is of the van he\u2019s currently on, and can\u2019t seem to figure out why he hasn\u2019t arrived at the end location yet. Finally, at 9:10am, the taxi van arrives at school, with our son and some other students aboard. My son had never been transferred, he was in the same taxi van that took him from our home. Arriving an hour and a half after leaving; a half hour trip had tripled somehow. We were a few minutes shy of calling the police when it had finally turned up; that was how distraught and concerned we were as parents. The whole situation would have been avoidable with more and better communication from the taxi company. It wasn\u2019t until after the whole mess that we were finally told via the school \u2013 who hadn\u2019t found out until after the mess too \u2013 that the original replacement driver (and man who turned up second) had lost the taxi run because his taxi van was unsuitable for carrying wheelchairs (and not due to some more sinister reason). The school shared our concerns and upset, and have taken the matter up with the taxi company on our behalf. So that was my morning from hell. A morning of me bursting into tears between holding it together to make endless enquiries. Of feeling responsible for the situation; berating myself for not listening to my gut instinct when a stranger came to pick up my son. Though looking back I\u2019m still unclear what I should have done differently; the taxi company didn\u2019t know they had two people doing the rounds at that point anyway so they would have just reassured me to let this man take my son. The school wouldn\u2019t have said any different either. Knowing that now didn\u2019t make me feel any less responsible at the time though. I spent the rest of the day feeling emotionally raw. My husband didn\u2019t want our son to be picked up by the taxi company for the return home; he no longer trusted them to act responsibly and thoughtfully with our child. We decided eventually to let them bring him home, largely because the school had taken the issue seriously and has reassured us that they will be laying a complaint and looking into how this mess happened, and let the taxi company know that the lack of clear communication was unacceptable. I had many nightmares last night, and this morning I\u2019m still feeling the after-effects of those intense emotions. As the day wears on I know they\u2019ll go, and this will just become a blip on the radar in time. Everything turned out fine, my son handled the situation well, life goes on. But I never want to feel that way again; even that tiny taste of one of my greatest fears coming true, was too much. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/10/26/then-who-took-my-son-aka-the-morning-from-hell/", "title": "\u201cThen who took my son?\u201d aka, the Morning from\u00a0Hell"},
{"date": "April 5, 2017", "body": "This post has been updated, due to important new information being revealed during question time in parliament, on April 6th. There has been a flurry of concerning stories of late, about changes to the autism services, supports, and programmes provided by IDEA services (the services arm of the sizeable and respected charity, IHC). Clearly, some autism families are finding these announcements and changes rather confusing and stressful. I\u2019m writing this post in an effort to clarify whats going on, and why. On the 21st of March, IHC announced that it will be exiting a range of services it had been providing. This includes no longer providing facility-based respite care, home support, and holiday and after-school programmes. The reasons appear to be complex, but a clear consideration in their decision was the limited funding that is provided to them by the Ministry of Health. There have also been changes by the government \u2013 both underway and anticipated \u2013 to how disability services are funded and delivered, which have impacted on how IHC sees its future in the service sector. IHC are, of course, not the only service providers in these areas. There are many charities, organisations, and individuals providing such care and opportunities. However, any disruption to existing service providers will always seriously impact on those who already use those services, not to mention the employees providing that service, which brings us to the next big issue making the news of late: Unions and disability sector workers, again particularly in regards to IDEA services. On the 3rd of April, it was announced, through the  E tu  union, that IDEA support staff will be striking after Easter in protest of how they are treated by IHC. In particular, in response to low wages, issues around job security, and inadequate consultation \u2013 an issue all the more prominent in light of the recent service (and thereby, job) cuts announced by IDEA services in March. IDEA support staff are concerned that they were not adequately consulted about those changes, and are concerned about the impact those changes will have on the people they provide support to as well. I find it interesting that the core issues the union is bringing to light on behalf of the workers, match the issues IDEA services itself is facing in relation to one of its own most crucial funders, the government (and more specifically, the Ministry of Health). It would seem that IHC has been placed in a difficult situation and that difficult situation had got passed along (perhaps, inevitably). For example: Low wages \u2013 IHC has pointed out that funding has not kept up with demand, that they have been operating in the autism services area at a loss for years.  Job security and consultation \u2013 the government hasn\u2019t renewed the autism programme service contract with IHC, which came to an end in March, meaning IHC now has had to cut even more services and, for the month of April, will be providing those particular autism programmes without any funding from the government (more on that further down). As to why that service contract hasn\u2019t been renewed, I can\u2019t say, and I can\u2019t see anywhere where IHC has said either. I\u2019ve striked that above part out, because it has recently been revealed during parliament question time that it was IHC, and not the government, that elected to discontinue the contract for providing autism programmes. Not only was it apparently IHC\u2019s decision, but IHC also chose not to take up an offered three month transition period that was on offer from the government. Making matters even worse, it has been pointed out by the government that IHC chose not to tell their clients they had decided to cut these programmes until after their decision had already been made. If all of this is true, IHC looks to indeed be an organisation that fails in its obligations to others around issues of job security and consultation, and it makes it look like IHC has allowed the public to be deceived (by leaving out key information that would have been expected to be forthcoming in this situation) into thinking that the whole situation was in the government\u2019s hands and the government\u2019s fault, rather than their own decision. It does appear that the cut services will be provided by some other organisation, but which one has not been announced by the Ministry of Health yet. Remember that there are already a variety of organisations providing autism services \u2013 IHC was just one such organisation \u2013 so presumably one of the others will be taking up the targeted funding IHC has lost (Autism NZ, for example). This still causes concerning uncertainty and distress to those directly affected \u2013 both the workers and the clients; continuity and certainty of services is an important aspect of providing quality and effective care to the disabled. Now to return to that latest piece of news about the cut to autism programmes: the further cuts to autism services, announced on April 5th. In addition to the loss of facility-based respite, home support etc as mentioned above, IHC has now announced that it will no longer provide any autism education and one-on-one communication programmes, due to losing that provision contract with the Ministry of Health. Their three affected programmes are called \u201cGrowing up with Autism,\u201d \u201cASD Plus,\u201d and \u201cCommunication and Behaviour.\u201d These were apparently successful and popular programmes, that had waiting lists too. (I imagine this latest development will only make relations with the union and the support workers, that much more tense, but that would depend on who provides the autism programmes within IDEA services.) Some aspects of all of this that have caused confusion, and my attempts to address those confusions, are as follows (1) The notion that funding has been \u201ccut:\u201d A number of people have claimed that the funding for these programmes has been cut by the government, and then got confused when the government claims it has actually increased funding. To clarify, it appears that the funding remains (and has increased), but (1) the group receiving the funding will change, and (2) that funding has not kept up with demand, and (3) that funding has not covered actual costs involved in providing existing services. So it would be more accurate to say \u201c funding was cut to IDEA services in regards to   IDEA has turned down funding earmarked for  the autism programmes it was running, and that funding had not been adequate to sustain those services for years.\u201d This is a rather different claim than \u201cthe government cut funding.\u201d (2) The idea that IHC will no longer provide any autism services. Rather, IHC still performs a wide range of services, and performs a vital advocacy role, for those with a wide range of disabilities, including autism. There are specific services that have been cut that will impact on those with autism and their families, that is true, but IHC still performs other services and supports for those with autism and other disabilities. (3) The idea that IHC was the sole provider of the relevant cut services. I\u2019ve seen parents panicking that their children will no longer receive supports they need, under the beliefs that IHC was the sole provider and that the funding had completely gone. As pointed out above, other organisations do provide such services and the funding has not entirely disappeared. There may be some disturbing disruption for those already using the services, but (apparently) those gaps will be filled by other providers. Despite these reassurances that the sky (or at least, most of it) isn\u2019t falling, it\u2019s still true that underfunding and poor work conditions in the disability sector is rife, and that successful and popular services have been cut. There\u2019s still the striking support workers on the horizon, and that is very concerning for those directly affected. It\u2019s also not completely transparent what has happened to cause the shift in funding at issue, or where it will go and why, and that bothers me too. We are perhaps then left with more questions than answers, but I do hope that this post has cleared up some confusions.

{"date": "October 20, 2011", "body": "\n Image by PaMeLa JaCKSoN via Flickr \n Not long before my son turned six years old, he created his first imaginary friend. The friend\u2019s name is \u201cWhanau,\u201d which happens to be the Maori word for extended family. I can imagine all sorts of motivators for that choice of name, foremost in my mind is his school teachers asking if he played with \u201cwhanau\u201d at home (and similar phrases and questions). It\u2019s not a word we use at home ourselves, and even if we had used it now and then, his pronunciation of the word is much better than mine! The first time I met Whanau, my son was playing with him on the couch at home. My son told me that Whanau was his \u201cpretend friend.\u201d Over that first day and the weeks since then, I have found out a lot about Whanau, including his age, his family, and what he does with his days. My son treats Whanau like a younger friend or sibling; someone he can teach, boss around, and care for. At first I was overjoyed, I took the invention of an imaginary friend as a positive development; a sign of my son\u2019s growing creativity and imagination. Indeed I thought that it would be rare for an autistic child to have an imaginary friend since they required skills that autism classically affects (social skills, communication, and of course, imagination). It didn\u2019t take much research online though, to change my expectations about autism and imaginary friends, and I quickly encountered various outrageous and ridiculous theories. One mother had created an elaborately expressed theory based on the original mistake \u2013 when autism was first identified \u2013 of thinking autism was a type of schizophrenia. She decided that any sign of imagination \u2013 most especially the existence of imaginary friends \u2013 was an early warning of delusions and a separation from reality. So she strongly advised other parents to do as she had done; thoroughly quash any signs of imagination in their autistic children to prevent it becoming full-blown schizophrenia. Other theories held to the view that imaginary friends are always a sign of dysfunction in an autistic individual; always existing well past their ideal life-time (the kindergarten years) and providing a way for autistic teenagers and adults to avoid real social interaction. More general notions about imaginary friends (independent of the question of autism) suggested imaginary friends are always inappropriate; that it is only in growing social situations (such as starting kindergarten) that children realise and learn that it is wrong and different to have imaginary friends and thereafter replace them with real friends. So that the continued existence of imaginary friends \u2013 even in the preschool years \u2013 was a sign of something being wrong. Thankfully I did encounter the saner calmer views; that imaginary friends are a quite normal and common stage of development. Although it does appear that imaginary friends (much to my surprise when I read this a few times) are actually more common in autistic children than neurotypical children; some even saying that the existence of an imaginary friend at all may be treated as a  sign  of autism (!). Since autistic children are developmentally delayed, their imaginary friends may appear later and last longer. There is nothing inherent in the existence of an imaginary friend that indicates deep-rooted social or life problems that require resolution. Indeed, my son\u2019s imaginary friend appeared at one of the happiest and most social times of his life; he has a best friend at school, his anxieties have been broadly decreasing, and his relationship with his younger brother is better than you\u2019d even hope for with typical sibling interactions. He is doing great lately. He appears to use this imaginary friend not to escape or replace reality; rather to practice communication and reverse roles with other people in his life (especially parent and teacher roles, so he can parent and teach Whanau). My son has no issues understanding that Whanau is imaginary rather than a full-blown delusion; indeed it was he who announced to me that Whanau was his pretend friend: He knows he\u2019s not real. Neither does he spend a lot of time with Whanau, he just appears now and then briefly, often during play time at home. Yes it is conceivable that an imaginary friend could be a sign of a problem. A very withdrawn child might use this friend to express frustration, aggression, etc. They might use an imaginary friend as a confidant in an unlistening, judgmental world. But that is not my son\u2019s world. Indeed when I asked his head teacher for her views about Whanau, she said she thinks it\u2019s harmless particularly  because  my son is such a happy and social child (his head teacher is specially trained in educating autistic children; on a side note let me just say she is a brilliant woman who we are very lucky to have in his life). We treat Whanau as we would an imaginary friend of any other child (and the following advice sits well from my research): We don\u2019t actively encourage Whanau\u2019s existence but we don\u2019t try to kill him off either. We play along on the rare occasions my son invites us to interact with Whanau, and we do not try to over-take or direct the existence and activities of Whanau: He belongs to my son. Mostly I get to listen to amusing conversations and information that my son passes on to Whanau; his six year-old words of wisdom and insights. So I\u2019m happy for Whanau to exist. I see him as evidence of my son\u2019s growing and developing imagination. Whanau provides just one more way in which my son can practice communication, and take on other roles in life. This imaginary friend has appeared at a happy and settled time in my son\u2019s life, and indeed in our family\u2019s life. I see no evidence of strife preceding the creation of Whanau, nor feeding the existence of Whanau. I\u2019ll watch with interest over the coming months; to see whether Whanau appears more or less, how his relationship with my son changes, etc. If his imaginary friend is anything like the ones I remember having when I was around his age, then they will be a source of fun for him. I remember my imaginary friends fondly. I don\u2019t remember anyone trying to kill them off, and I would have been upset and confused if anyone had tried to. It\u2019s all too easy to pathologize everything when it comes to autistic children. It\u2019s important to take that step back and remember that childhood \u2013 autistic or otherwise \u2013 is filled with a range of fascinating and perfectly innocent experiences. Best I can see, Whanau is one of those fascinating and perfectly innocent things, and he\u2019s welcome to stay a while.

{"date": "April 5, 2017", "body": "When I was dragged into the world of disability by my eldest son, I was forced to confront a lot of new and uncomfortable truths \u2013 truths about people, about society, and about myself. I couldn\u2019t stay who I was and still be an effective mother and advocate for my son. It was a long and unpleasant transition, with a fair few breakdowns and personal crises along the way. This was awfully inconvenient: trying to care for a child with high needs is not a good time to be having a painful personal awakening. And sharing your own inner turmoil during such times never goes down well because the world screams back at you to stop being so damn self-involved and to focus on the child instead. Focus on the child, while your view of the world has been turned on its head, focus on the child, while your understanding of the brain and the body and what makes those things \u201cgood\u201d is fundamentally challenged, focus on the child, while your entire life plan becomes so much mulch. When my second child was diagnosed not just with autism, but with dyspraxia, ADHD, anxiety, and suspected dysgraphia and dyslexia, I was thrown back in the grinder and I was angry at myself that I couldn\u2019t just take it in my stride. I berated myself for being too weak to just nod and smile and gleefully jump into the learning and therapies and interventions for him too. Hadn\u2019t I been through this all before \u2013 wasn\u2019t I all super-enlightened and accepting of all disabilities now? Why the hell was it so hard all over again \u2013 did the fact I was finding it so hard to accept that my second son had all these other challenges, a damning reflection on me \u2026 again? That\u2019s part of it though, isn\u2019t it: our children get diagnoses, and they\u2019re still who they were before the diagnosis, but  we  change. Our current understanding of what the child can do, will do, how their lives will be, gets thrown out the window. Our view of what we were going to do with our own lives, has to adjust every time a new diagnosis turns up. Every new diagnosis is a new learning curve, and a new foray into the politics and beliefs about what it means to get that new diagnosis. It\u2019s less painfully world-jolting the second time through, because you have a platform from which you can start to make sense of disability now, but the adjustment is not purely academic; the most precious thing in the world \u2013 your own child \u2013 is affected by how well you cope with and make sense of the diagnosis. Through the years, I\u2019ve found certain truths that I didn\u2019t appreciate before my eldest son was diagnosed. Those truths have made it easier for me to get through the hard times, and have changed who I am (I\u2019d venture to say \u201centirely for the better\u201d, but I\u2019m far more anxious and less self-assured than I was before all this happened, so there is definitely a trade-off in there). I\u2019m going to be all arrogant and suggest to you that these revelations I\u2019ve come to accept, really are true, regardless of where you live and who you are, and I\u2019m going to be even more arrogant and say that I think some of these truths could even help other parents working their way through the shock of a new diagnosis. You\u2019re welcome to disagree with what follows, and maybe you can further my own growth through your disagreements. Regardless, here are my pearls of wisdom, gleamed over the years both through personal experience and through learning from far greater minds than my own: (1)  Disability is ubiquitous, and inevitable . There is nothing perverse or unexpected about disability. It is there when you break your leg at 20, it\u2019s there when your eyesight is failing at 35, it\u2019s there when you manage to live long enough to reach old age. Sometimes it is relieved by surgery, or time, or modern medicine, and sometimes it\u2019s not. Some are born with it, some don\u2019t even know they have it, some come into it from a sudden event or so slowly that one day they realise it\u2019s been there for years. It is part of the human condition, and how well we treat those who have disabilities is ultimately how well we treat ourselves since we will be them some day. A society that doesn\u2019t appreciate and make allowances for those with disabilities \u2013 treating them as an abomination to be tucked away in institutions or as the butt of jokes \u2013 is an infantile and ignorant society that is limiting its own potential. (2)  Diagnoses are a human construct , and so apt to change with time and with whoever is doing the diagnosing. A diagnosis is a name we put on a condition or group of conditions, to help us make sense of the etiology and the reality of living with it and what to do about it. How those symptoms are grouped together, is a decision made by people \u2013 people who are experts in their field, but also people who are influenced by things like politics, history, government and private insurance funding categories, and their own pet projects. This doesn\u2019t mean diagnoses can\u2019t be \u201caccurate\u201d or helpful \u2013 if receiving the diagnosis makes sense of what is going on and helps you know what to do about it, then it\u2019s serving its function well. My point is not to say diagnoses are all subjective, because they clearly aren\u2019t, rather my point is not to get too fixated on the diagnosis itself \u2013  use  the diagnostic label, let it guide you, it\u2019s a shortcut to quicker and better understanding of what to do now that you have it. It is not a condemnation; it is a tool. Use it, don\u2019t let it overwhelm you. (3)  Being disabled is not a punchline . There is something particularly odious about those who use words like \u201cretarded\u201d or references to \u201cbelonging on the short bus\u201d as an insult. Doing so says that having different or special needs is something to be embarrassed and ashamed of, and hideously distorts and simplifies the huge complexity of disabilities and those with disabilities \u2013 even those society once thought of as simple and intellectually disabled in some irredeemable way, have surprised us with their variant brilliances and talents. History is full of people doing amazing feats, and bettering society, in the face of immense and disabling personal challenges. And more to the point, they are all still people, with their own emotions and the right be to be treated with respect. Using these people like punchlines, is not just cruel, it is ignorant. That\u2019s not to say there is no place for humour within disability, of course there is. Some great comedians are themselves disabled and use their disability within their jokes, and sometimes if you can\u2019t laugh at a situation then you just cry \u2013 we need humour in our lives. But the everyday hateful humour of calling people retarded and \u201cspecial needs\u201d as an insult, that\u2019s not clever or helpful. I don\u2019t believe in censorship to eradicate that sort of cruelty though, I believe in education and information to help people see what they\u2019re doing and why it\u2019s wrong \u2013 if you just tell them they \u201ccan\u2019t say that\u201d, you\u2019ll only make them want to say it more and they won\u2019t have learned a thing. (4)  Autism, and a huge number of similar learning disabilities, are used as political footballs  \u2013 be careful you\u2019re not letting your child\u2019s challenges be used for someone else\u2019s agenda. Whether it\u2019s used in the debate about vaccinations, the arguments over the use of screen-time and technology, the issue of what age children should start school, or in the endless fights about parenting styles or discipline, people love to drag in the existence of autism (or other learning disabilities) as evidence for their pet cause. Remember what I said above \u2013 that diagnoses are a human construct and change over time \u2013 to help you avoid getting overly fixated on these sorts of things. Remember that the diagnosis is a tool, it\u2019s there to help you to help your child, it is not an indictment on you or that child. Refuse to let other people turn the existence of your child into some horrible tragedy that could have been avoided if only everyone did what that other person said; enter the debates if you like, it\u2019s good to set people right where you can, but don\u2019t let those debates dominate or disturb you or your child. Your child is awesome, which brings us to \u2026 (5)  The gifts of disability . This is a hard one for many to accept, and is easily twisted and misunderstood and exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness. The \u201cgifts of disability\u201d is just the understanding that, often times, disability comes with its upsides. Whether those upsides are in savant skills, or amazing memories or unique understandings that reveal new knowledge we all benefit from, or astounding artistic talent, or the sweet compassion that is often found in those of certain disabilities, or a healthier and happier perspective about life from the disabled person or their loved ones. It can be something tiny, or something profound \u2013 it\u2019s simply a matter of opening your eyes to the fact that disabilities are complex and people are complex and rarely is any experience entirely an unmitigated disaster. It\u2019s trying to find and grow the good parts found within any challenge we face, it\u2019s seeing the uniqueness and personal gifts of any individual and celebrating and encouraging those talents. This is not the same as thinking disability itself is good or should be pursued in its own right, rather it is taking a realistic (and hopeful and enlightened) approach to understanding what it means to live with disabilities, and appreciating that a person doesn\u2019t stop being a person and merely becomes a condition at the point of diagnosis; we are all so much more than a label. And, finally, (6)  How well you cope with your child\u2019s diagnosis, depends on a huge range of factors, many of which are outside your control . How well you cope depends on your own previous experience with disability (especially the specific one that has been diagnosed), it depends on your family and friends support network, it depends on your financial position, on your family and cultural and work and societal expectations, on your personal age and stage of life, on your existing commitments, on governmental and charity supports where you live, on your mental and physical health at any point in time. Do not compare how well you are coping, with Jane down the street \u2013 her child might have far fewer challenges despite having the same diagnostic label, she might be independently wealthy and have only one child and have a live-in therapist. You, are not her. Her child, is not yours. Do not beat yourself up for taking a longer time to come to terms with a new diagnosis. Do not think you are a lesser human-being than that Facebook acquaintance autism mum who always seems so sure of herself with that perfect smile endlessly plastered on her face in every carefully crafted photo. It\u2019s OK to struggle. It\u2019s OK to be you. It\u2019s OK to be honest, and it\u2019s OK to ask for help when it all gets too much. There you have it. Maybe I\u2019ll look back at that list years from now and will think what an ignorant little fool I was, and that\u2019s OK too. I\u2019ve come a long way in what I think, and feel, and value, and believe, and I\u2019m happy to accept I\u2019ve still got a long way to go yet. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/revelations/", "title": "Revelations"},
{"date": "February 25, 2017", "body": "One of the most challenging, and most important, decisions we make as parents of young children with special needs, is where to send them to school. I have two children with various special needs. One of my children has been to four schools, the other to three, between them they\u2019ve been to five different schools, including private and public, special and mainstream, and high, mid, and low decile. Across the years I\u2019ve had some wonderful and some horrible school experiences, and have been on a school board, I\u2019ve also been in regular contact with many other families of children with special needs. I\u2019ve learned a lot across that time and through those experiences about what to look for in a school when you\u2019re trying to find one for a child with special needs, I\u2019ve also learned that a lot of parents struggle to know what to look for \u2013 thus this post! I hope you find it useful, and I\u2019d love to get your own ideas on what you look for and have experienced too. Finding schools Begin by identifying what your school options are. This  Ministry of Education search page  will help you identify the schools near you.You can attend your local public school if you are in zone \u2013 the site will show you the zones, as should the school\u2019s own web page. You can also attend any public school that doesn\u2019t have a zone, and you can attend any private school if you can afford their fees and meet their specific entry requirements. If you receive ORS funding \u2013 or have otherwise been given government and school permission to do so \u2013 you may also be able to send your child to their local special school, these schools typically have large catchment areas and have zones too. ERO Reports Next, look at a school\u2019s latest ERO report \u2013 these are reports done by an official government body, the Education Review Office, looking for strengths and weaknesses within the school. Those reports can be found by entering the school\u2019s name in the search bar  on this page.  Particularly look for any mention of how the school values and caters to children with special needs. These reports will give you other useful information when trying to find the right school for your child, such as the number of children attending the school (more on that below). Be mindful of the review cycle that the school is under. If the government is comfortable with how the school is being run, it will be on a three year review cycle. If the school is being reviewed more often than that, then there are likely to be some real issues going on at the school, often at a high level, which can mean the school is going through a lot of changes or needs to go through a lot of changes \u2013 either way, that state of flux is not conducive to the settling in and support of a child with high needs; if a school is struggling, it\u2019s unlikely to have the time and resources at hand that your child needs. Conversely, if a school is on a four-to-five year review cycle, it shows the government is very happy with how the school is being run and that can in-turn boost your own confidence that they\u2019re likely to be well-placed for the challenges your child may bring. The school\u2019s own website Your next stop should be the school\u2019s own website \u2013 do a web search for the name of the school, and look for the link that has .school.nz on the end. By looking through their website you should be able to find evidence of how they value and support children with special needs. Their page should help you identify any extra services they offer, whether they have a SENCo on staff (more on that below too), and whether they have fixed teacher aides on staff. Look for the school\u2019s stated values and priorities \u2013 if high grades and sports turn up everywhere, but there\u2019s no mention of having a safe and caring and accepting environment, that may be a red flag. Keep an eye out for any mention of their view towards bullying as well \u2013 a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach tends to mean the school in mindful and concerned about the well-being of all students. Student and class numbers Generally speaking, you\u2019re best off with a school that has more than one classroom for each grade, this will make it more likely that they can find a teacher to suit your child\u2019s needs and temperament since there is a choice available, and means if something goes horribly wrong with one of the teacher or classmates relationships then there is another teacher and class option within the school for your child. I actually recommend trying to find the larger schools, this may seem counter-intuitive because a smaller school would presumably get to know your child better and have more individual time for them, so I\u2019ll explain this point further: Large schools are more likely to have a special needs structure permanently in place, with permanent and experienced and trained staff, because of the frequency with which they are likely to encounter children with a wide range of special needs. They are more likely to have long-term teacher aides on staff, which is a huge advantage \u2013 short-term and brief placement teacher aides wont have a good working understanding of the school and its grounds, they wont have established relationships with key school staff. The longer a teacher aide has been around, the more likely that have the experience, training, and proven record that will benefit your child. Large schools are also often better at pooling their resources and money and organizing what they have available to them because of the flexibility that comes with having more of it (due to per-child allocations), and they\u2019re more likely to have particular equipment available to them because of prior or widespread need within the school population. There are going to be some small schools that do a great job of these things too, of course, and some large schools that don\u2019t have such good systems and structures in place, but generally speaking the larger schools seem to cope better in this area. SENCo If a school has a SENCo \u2013 a Special Education Needs Coordinator \u2013 it\u2019s generally a good sign, since this role is not compulsory in our schools and can be very useful. Generally speaking, a SENCo has a good working understanding of what the child may be entitled to from the government and how to go about getting it, and should have a positive working relationship with the local government-funded service providers. However, many schools don\u2019t properly value this role, and may be giving the position to someone who is already working a full load within the school as a class teacher, or be farming out the role to whoever wants to take it on without much care as to whether that person is experienced or knowledgeable about the area and people they will be working with. A classic example of how a school can get this very wrong, is the year my children\u2019s school changed it\u2019s SENCo three times, causing immense disruption to my children\u2019s supports and not identifying or completing important applications for supports. So the presence of a SENCo is a good thing, but until you\u2019ve met with the SENCo it can be hard to get a sense of how good a thing it actually is, which brings us to the next suggestion: The school visit Any school you are wanting to send your child to, should be very willing and able to meet with you well in advance of when your child would begin class. This first meeting should be with the SENCo if there is one, otherwise with someone high up in the school (such as a Deputy or Assistant Principal) who has the power to influence what class your child will be placed in and who has a good understanding of what the school has available to support your child. This meeting will be perhaps your best guide to the attitude of the school towards children with special needs \u2013 are the people you are meeting with happy to see you, eager to please, relaxed and confident they can care for your child, or are these people nervous, unsure, reluctant or dismissive, do they say anything that makes you feel your child will be unwanted or a burden, if so, get ready to look elsewhere; you don\u2019t want a fight on your hands and you don\u2019t want to be pulling your child out of that school part way through the year (been there, done that). Take a support person with you to the meeting, see what they thought of the school and staff too. Take some questions along, ask about what supports and services are in place at the school already, ask whether they\u2019re experienced with dealing with children who have similar challenges to your own child \u2013 share a lot about your own child, be honest and up-front. Watch for their reactions to the information you share \u2013 you want the knowing smiles and the reassurance, not the furtive sideways glances and the sharp in-takes of breath. Try to get a staff member from that meeting to take you on a walking tour of the school during school time, this will give you a good feel of how settled and happy the kids are, what safety risks might be on site, and whether the classroom set-up will pose any issues for your child. Being round during playtime is good too, the way children interact with each other during free-time is a great indicator of school attitudes and expectations. If you decide you\u2019re serious about sending your child to that chosen school, then the school should also assign a teacher well before your child begins in that class, and you should be able to meet with that teacher and visit the future classroom \u2013 with your child \u2013 as many times as you need to before they start school there. This is a great opportunity to help the teacher prepare for the challenges ahead, and to help your child feel settled and comfortable with the schooling ahead. It is important that you feel comfortable with your child\u2019s teacher too, because they\u2019ll be spending the most time with your child when at school, and you\u2019ll be dealing with them more than anyone else at the school. If it feels wrong \u2013 if this isn\u2019t the right person for your child \u2013 think through why you feel that way and whether it can be fixed or whether you may need to request a different teacher (and be willing to clearly explain why you\u2019re making that request, chances are the school can help reassure you or address the concern). If the school is unwilling to even meet with you, or wants to put off any such meeting until very close to the start date for your child, those are solid signs that they\u2019re not taking your needs seriously and don\u2019t appreciate what supports they\u2019re going to have to have in place ready-to-go for your child\u2019s first day there. Decile New Zealand schools are ranked by decile, where 10 is the highest and represents a high socioeconomic school population-pool whereby the school relies more on parent donations and receives less government funding \u2013 with the reverse being true for decile 1 (low parent financial input, high government financial input). Decile ranking has nothing to do with the quality of the staff or the teaching, it\u2019s simply an (often unhelpful) reflection of the wealth, education, and employment levels of the school community. People have all sorts of preconceptions about the relevance of decile ranking when it comes to helping out kids with special needs. Some think low decile is better because they have more government funding and are more used to dealing with challenging children, others think high decile is better because they have more money overall to draw from despite the lesser government contributions and they have more ability to focus on the needs of those with disabilities since they aren\u2019t bogged down in dealing with other everyday social issues of children turning up with (for example) no shoes and no lunch. Some say lower decile schools have a more relaxed and accepting attitude towards special kids and that high deciles tend to be more elite and overly focused on strict rules and grades, others say low decile have more \u201ctroubled\u201d children attending so a higher likelihood of their child being bullied or hurt while at school. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve discovered having had my kids in a whole range of deciles: Deciles don\u2019t matter. Visit the school, read the ERO report, do all those other things, do not think of decile ranking as a shortcut to figuring out how well the school will cope with your child. Because it really isn\u2019t. It is definitely relevant to whether you may even be able to afford to send your child to that school (think uniforms and fees and donations-that-aren\u2019t-donations), but it doesn\u2019t give you much insight at all on how well set up the school will be to actually resource and support your child. That last sentence goes for choosing a private versus a public school too \u2013 how well off a school is, is not decisive, you\u2019ll need to take all those other things I\u2019ve mentioned into consideration as more essential than a school\u2019s income sources. Other parents\u2019 opinions I\u2019ve left the most important, and hardest to access, for last: Talk to other parents of children with special needs, who have sent or do send their child to that school. They\u2019ve seen the school in action, they know the staff, they\u2019ve heard the rumours and know if they\u2019re true. Ask those parents how the school has dealt with issues when they arise \u2013 there will be issues with our children, the question is how well a school deals with them. Ask the parents what communication is like within the school, how well and how often the teachers interact with them. Of course parents opinions can be highly subjective, and some will love what others hate, but the more parents you talk to from a school, the better sense you will get of what it\u2019s really like to send your child to that school. You want to find that one brutally honest parent who hit a hard time and who the school either worked with to sort it out to everyone\u2019s advantage, or who the school drove away or gave up on. It\u2019s hard to access other parents from a school you don\u2019t attend yet, harder still to find the ones who have children with special needs, and harder yet to find the brutally honest ones! But give it a go \u2013 use online forums or friends-of-friends \u2013 because it\u2019s worth the effort. There you have it. Hopefully that list was helpful, do let me know if I\u2019ve left something major out and what your own experiences have been like. And good luck in your search for the right school for your individual child. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.tki.org.nz/Schools", "http://www.ero.govt.nz/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-school-for-a-child-with-special-needs-in-nz/", "title": "What to look for when choosing a school for a child with special needs, in\u00a0NZ"},
{"date": "October 29, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s been a year since I started this blog, about autism and my autistic son (who is now six years old). \n Image by Kristina B via Flickr \n In that first year, my blog got 33, 714 hits, the largest proportion of those originate from the USA. My most viewed post is \u201c Violence, Autism & Bad Parenting. \u201d That is not my own favourite post (far from it), but it does seem to be the post that brought me to the attention of  Ele Ludemann from Homepaddock , who went on to mention my blog and that post in  her regular spot on Radio New Zealand,  back in February. Prior to that piece of public attention, my blogging managed to get me a one-off spot on a nationwide TV show discussing autism, \u201cLetters to Lindsey,\u201d which was a fantastic and new experience for me. I have the piece on DVD but never figured out how to put it up on my blog, and had reservations about doing so because I try to protect my son\u2019s identity where I can. I still struggle with the question of how much I should allow people to know about me and my son via this blog, and the issue of  whether and how it might impact on my son\u2019s adult future . One of my favourite posts that I\u2019ve written, does manage to come in at third most popular; \u201c Socialization as a reason to mainstream special needs\u00a0children .\u201d The top site referer to my blog is Facebook, where I have  a page for my blog  with 89 fans. The third top referer is Twitter,  where I also have an account , with 241 followers. The top commenter on my blog, is Sharon. The post most commented on is the one about  Marijuana and Autism . The most popular search term bringing people to my site is \u201cautism and oughtisms\u201d (nice to know they intended to and did find me). Second most popular term is \u201cautism violence\u201d (the third is \u201cautism and violence\u201d) thus leading to the top post I mentioned at the start. Which is sad; that so many people come to my blog seeking a discussion of autism and violence. Very early on in this blogging adventure, I started the search for other blogs by parents raising autistic children. The first one that really grabbed me, and continues to be one I check in on almost everyday, is  Autism Jabberwocky . The blogger I have perhaps learnt the most from, and who has most influenced my attitudes over this past year, would by Kim Wombles from  Countering . There is no blogger who I agree with 100% of the time, but the one who comes closest, is Sharon from  The Tumultuous Truth . The autism science blogger who I find most interesting (and importantly, accessible) is Jon at  Cracking the Enigma . I\u2019ve mostly enjoyed blogging over the past year, but at times I\u2019ve had enough of the bickering and misunderstandings and pressure. I kept at it because of the learning, friendships, and new perspectives that come from being engaged with blogging. I\u2019m quite happy and proud of my blog on the whole. I\u2019ve been given \u2013 and taken \u2013 the opportunities to share posts on others\u2019 sites too, such as Autism and Empathy, About Autism, and Teaching the Teacher (links to those and other guest posts I\u2019ve done, can be found  here .) So yeah, it\u2019s been a busy and mostly good blogging year. A year from now I\u2019ll be reading this post again to see how much has changed and in what ways. Thank you to everyone who has been part of my blogging adventure thus far. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/31699569@N00/2836828090", "http://homepaddock.wordpress.com/", "www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2456473/online-media-ele-ludemann.asx", "http://www.facebook.com/autismandoughtisms", "http://twitter.com/#%21/autismoughtism", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/", "http://www.crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/10/29/the-stats-and-a-review-of-my-first-year-of-blogging/", "title": "The stats and a review, of my first year of\u00a0blogging"},
{"date": "July 3, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Dan4th via Flickr \n I regularly encounter news stories about autism and the law; an autistic person committed a crime, or was the victim of a crime, or has had dealings with the police ( because they wandered  for example). Sometimes the autism aspect is incidental, sometimes it is absolutely central to understanding the story; often times people struggle to tell the difference between whether it is incidental or essential. As a general rule I\u2019ve steered clear of commenting on these news stories, despite having a background in law. I am aware that law and legal procedures differ across the world, so writing a story about what happened will usually require a fair amount of extra research that I usually don\u2019t have the time to do. I also know that what is reported in the papers is a fraction (and sometimes a distortion) of what really happened; so drawing conclusions from those reports without having read the original case notes (which I am unlikely to have access to) is a dangerous and arguably pointless sport. I\u2019ve realised though that there are still certain important aspects of these stories that I can comment on, and clarify, particularly for those who don\u2019t have the legal background but want to understand why a case went the way it did. So I\u2019m going to try to do this more from now on. This post is an introduction to the multitude of ways in which autism and the law interact; a precursor to those future posts about specific stories as they arise. I want to begin though with a brief introduction to my own experience with the law, since it seems relevant! I am not a lawyer. I am an academic. I have a law degree (with honours including a dissertation), and I have a number of years teaching experience at two universities. I was a lecturer in law for a while, in the areas of contract and business law more generally. I continue to be a tutor in a university law school, usually teaching jurisprudence (my passion) but I\u2019ve also taught criminal law. As I\u2019ve already stated, law and autism interact in a number of ways. In an effort to understand the different issues at play during those interactions, I\u2019ve split them into three categories, with further subcategories of \u201cagainst the autistic person\u201d and \u201cby the autistic person\u201d. This is just a preliminary categorization, but I think it\u2019s a helpful initial approach. Interacting with the police In any interaction with the police \u2013 even at the most innocent level of enquiries and investigations \u2013 autism can have a significant impact, due to problems with communication, behaviour, and social interaction. Answering even a simple and seemingly straight-forward enquiry from the police, will sometimes be a very real challenge for an autistic person, and may have very real consequences. Other than those interactions with police  by  autistic people, there is also the sub-category of interaction with the police  about  autistic people. Such as if an autistic child has wandered, or a neighbour has complained about the child abuse they think is occurring at a home because of the tantrums and behaviour associated with autism. In these situations people find themselves trying to explain to the police that it\u2019s not just that a child has wandered, the child is also (perhaps) non-verbal and has very limited appreciation of dangers. Or parents try to explain to the police that the child who appears injured, has suffered from self-injury that they tried to but could not stop, rather than injuries caused by the parent directly. Legal / illegal acts For acts performed by autistic people, their autism may go to the question of mens rea; essentially, their intent. The things we might use to infer intent for a non-autistic person, may not hold the same relevance for an autistic person. Autism also impacts on the quality and meaning of the evidence against them; shady and suspect behaviour, such as running from the scene of a crime or not meeting your eyes, can mean something very different coming from an autistic person than from a non-autistic person (this is again generally relevant to interactions with the police). For acts performed against an autistic person, the autism may be relevant too. For example, did the autistic person supply meaningful consent to an otherwise injurious act. The existence of autism also comes up to excuse or mitigate behaviours that would otherwise be considered criminal against them, such as physical restraint, electric shocks, and other potentially harmful and demeaning behaviours. Punishment Judges usually have a significant amount of lee-way in the types and amount of punishment for various offenses. If an autistic person has been found guilty or responsible for an act against the law, the punishment they receive should take into account their autism. Maybe they need special mental health services, rather than incarceration. If they are placed in prison, it could be an incredibly devastating and life-threatening experience for them, far above and beyond the normal prisoner experiences. Again, there is the separate category of the punishment for acts performed against an autistic person. They are particularly vulnerable people, so hurting or taking advantage of them might attract more harsh penalties. Also, acts which might otherwise have been considered extreme and\u00a0 deserving of equally extreme punishment, might be somewhat ameliorated in the eyes of the judge due to the challenges involved with the care of these people (I should perhaps clarify that I do not have in mind the recent case of the  woman strangling her autistic son  when I write that, I mean more so behaviours done specifically to keep the child safe from causing harm to themself or others, such as the use of restraint). It is important not to underestimate the impact autism has on legal issues, both for when the autistic person is the perpetrator and when they are a victim. Autism should be \u2013 and often is \u2013 taken into account. But autism is not generally treated as an \u201cexcuse\u201d for criminal behaviours. Understanding the finer details is challenging, but an important challenge, and one I will attempt to meet more often in this blog (as time and energy allows!). *** Some good advice for autistic people who find themselves engaged with the criminal justice process: \u201c Until proven innocent \u201d A selection of New Zealand (local) news stories as examples of interactions and issues between the law and autism: \n 31 year-old prison officer with Aspergers, smuggled goods into a prison , June 2011. \n Looting after the Christchurch Earthquake, by a man with Aspergers  (including claim of assault by police), March 2011. \n 18 year-old autistic woman arrested for assaulting her mother and causing damage to property , March 2009. \n Cyber-crime by 18 year-old with Aspergers , May 2008. \n 11 year-old autistic boy runaway, killed by car , September 2007. \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/43264265@N00/5133977586", "http://news.health.com/2011/03/24/dangerous-wandering-a-lesser-known-side-of-autism/", "http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/07/02/mother-yvonne-freaney-who-strangled-autistic-son-spared-jail-91466-28981860/", "http://news.health.com/2011/03/24/dangerous-wandering-a-lesser-known-side-of-autism/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/5130506/Prison-officer-got-by-inmates", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/4822263/Quake-looter-says-police-beat-him", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/2284195/Autistic-girl-to-leave-police-cells", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/462248/Mum-muzzles-autistic-Kiwi-cyber-crim", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/34726/Tragic-end-for-runaway-boy"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/autism-and-the-law/", "title": "Autism and the\u00a0Law"},
{"date": "July 16, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I was at once overwhelmed, and underwhelmed, by the help my son received for his autism in his pre-school years (from diagnosis at age three, to starting school at five years old). Overwhelmed, because I found myself swamped in so many therapists than my daily diary of appointments became a bewildering list of newly-learnt acronyms (PT, OT, ST, EP, EIT, ESW, SW); and underwhelmed because I wanted their services to arrive faster, stay longer, and happen more frequently. I desperately needed some sort of over-view and co-ordination of what was happening with my son, so I\u2019d find myself often wishing there was just an \u201cautism expert\u201d instead of a bunch of \u2013 essentially \u2013 \u201csymptom experts\u201d (people addressing problems with speech, movement, behaviour, etc). I often found myself angry at the therapy team; like they weren\u2019t listening to me, or didn\u2019t understand my son or didn\u2019t understand autism itself. I was annoyed that they took six-week breaks, and didn\u2019t have all the answers, and sometimes made things worse. Looking back over that two-year period, I am amazed at the level of help we received, all of it for free (tax-payer funded to be precise). And a lot of the ways they did things that bothered me, I can now see as not so bad, or even for the best. Like approaching autism primarily via its symptoms, with experts in each area as required. Autism is, after all, defined by symptoms. And even though the many-person/ diverging-theories approach I thereby had to interact with were sometimes contradictory and hard to manage, having such a diverse range of experiences and approaches available to us through this myriad of specialties, provided different solutions and perspectives to the problems we faced. Allowing me to take the best bits from the best minds among the group, and apply them as best suited my son. This approach required me to be brave enough to speak out when something wasn\u2019t working, to identify the potential and actual conflicts in advice, and to be proactive with mediating the information so it was tailored to my own son; not blindly accepting that every piece of advice relevant to an autistic child was always relevant to my child. Autism is, after all, highly diverse in the severity, and in the manifestations of the defining symptoms. What might have worked for another autistic child, wouldn\u2019t necessarily be relevant to my son. Would a single \u201cautism expert\u201d have been as effective as the team? Maybe. But I can easily see how an imagined expert in autism would struggle to match the wide range of expertise in each symptom area that I ultimately had access to. Each person dedicated to assessing and working on their specific problem area, each with years of training and experience that arguably combines to be mightier than a single person\u2019s training and expertise. The fact that it was hard to co-ordinate all their efforts and therapies into a coherent and non-contradictory whole, is not necessarily only fixable via a single all-encompassing expert in autism. In effect, I became the co-ordinator; the one person in the team with the total over-view. And really, that is perhaps how it should be. That role was not an obvious or easy one, particularly for me still coming to terms with autism and my son, but I was ultimately best placed to become the \u201cautism expert\u201d of the group. Another way in which I think they maybe did right rather than wrong, with the benefit of hindsight, is in taking those times off from such regular visits. It turned out to be vital that my son have breaks from the learning and persistent interaction, otherwise both he and I would get overloaded. Being busy with lots of meetings and therapists, definitely made me feel like we were achieving something, but \u201cbeing busy\u201d isn\u2019t the same as making progress. It was vital that new lessons were given time to be absorbed and put into practice. It was also vital that I stepped forward as his mother and teacher and therapist, not relying on the professionals to hold my hand too much. I came to understand that their job was to set me up to do their job for them: They would teach me the skills, knowledge, understanding and methods that would allow me to not need them anymore. Afterall, I am there day and night, and I will be with him until the day I die. It is vital that I can do what needs to be done. They generally continued to make themselves available for contact during emergencies in those break periods, but in time I learnt to not need them when new problems arose; they had taught me the methods I needed to sail that boat without them at the rudder. Would it have been better if they hadn\u2019t taken such long breaks and had more intensive contact during the work periods? Maybe. But I at least now understand that there was benefit and reason behind those breaks \u2013 and not just because they had huge work loads and a ridiculous number of clients. I\u2019d got too caught up in the \u201cbeing busy means progress\u201d mind-set. But part of the reason I\u2019d got so caught up in that mind-set, and that I was often annoyed with the therapists, was my personal mental state at the time as I came to terms what autism meant for my family; \u201cbeing busy\u201d at least made me feel like I was doing  something  in the face of all the problems. Anyone I interacted with during that time (including therapists) were interacting with a scared mother. Why did this happen to my son, what does it mean for his future, and for my future? Is someone to blame, can anything be done to fix it? How do I cope with the intolerance, ignorance, and judgement, by strangers and the people I love? I personally needed help for my own well-being, but so often \u201chelp\u201d back-fired and made my and my son\u2019s life worse than prior to the intervention; so ultimately I\u2019d decided to turn down any offers for personal help and just focus all my energy and passion on my son and the help  he  needed. Looking back though, I am glad they offered the help anyway. I am grateful for the people and the organisations that tried to make my and my son\u2019s life better, for at least caring enough to try. I wish I had been more bold with telling them where their offers of help were going wrong or making things worse; though I think at the time I didn\u2019t have the knowledge or confidence to make myself heard. The system in place to support parents and their autistic children, as they learn about autism and how to live with it, are imperfect, with plenty of room for improvement. There are clearly areas of high need that are not being met, or being met poorly. There are some great therapists, making poor and consequential decisions; things don\u2019t always go as planned, even with very careful and loving planning. But there is support, and expertise, offered through the public system, and supplied by some amazingly dedicated and passionate therapists. There are people constantly reviewing and assessing the outcomes and benefits of the services offered. I have good reason to believe that things will improve for future families. The level of care and involvement of the therapists, was really quite impressive. They had to put up with my screaming violent son, and his annoying perfectionist mother. Sometimes the therapists cried along-side me, when they saw the very real suffering. Sometimes we laughed and rejoiced together, when my son would surprise us with something new and wonderful. My son\u2019s successes gave them very real and heart-felt joy. So here\u2019s to you, my son\u2019s therapists, for doing your best and helping my son and I to be our best too. I wish you could see him now. I know you\u2019d be so proud of how far he\u2019s come and how well he\u2019s doing; you need to know that you helped that become a reality. I want you to know that though I remember our disagreements and frustrations, that I also remember all those hugs you gave my son (once he started allowing hugs!). I remember the times you sat him on your lap, and smiled so genuinely at my amazing little boy. I remember all the hugs and kind words you gave me too. You were a part of our family for a time; seeing into our otherwise isolated and hidden world. You made me feel like we hadn\u2019t been forgotten after all.

{"date": "July 17, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n It\u2019s well known that parents of autistic children, often exhibit autistic traits, such as those identified in the Broad Autism Phenotype test (which I have  written about previously ). But is this a reflection of existing autistic tendencies, or did we take on these traits as an understandable and predictable consequence of having to deal with an autistic child? For example, was a mother always \u201crigid\u201d, or did she become that way (or more so that way) in response to dealing with a child who strongly desires and exhibits such rigidity? These types of questions are raised in this very interesting post from SFARI, called \u201c Parent Trap .\u201d At the very least, their concerns about the effects of raising a challenging child and the relevance of gender roles, are important considerations for any researcher trying to accurately gauge the autistic traits of a parent of an autistic child. So with such issues in mind, I decided to re- do the BAP test , this time from the perspective of myself  pre -children. Specifically, my early to mid twenties, when I was at university. And compare that to the result I got taking the test for who I am currently, as recorded in that previous post of mine. I have very strong recall of those university years, so it wasn\u2019t hard to do what I consider to have been a fairly accurate job of answering the BAP questions. These were the compared results: After  children: Rigid Personality, 59 aloof, 96 rigid and 45 pragmatic Before  children: Rigid Personality, 50 aloof, 81 rigid and 47 pragmatic Which is to say, not a lot of difference. I still sit above the cut-off point in regards to rigidity, but according to the graph I only just sit above it pre-children, and sit clearly above it post-children. Whether the very act of becoming a mother \u2013 regardless of having an autistic child \u2013 would have made me so much more rigid, is unknown of course. I think \u2013 based on my own reflection and experiences \u2013 that my son\u2019s autism has made me a much more rigid person, specifically  because  of his autism. But that lack of flexibility, and need for control and predictability in my life, was already there anyway. What caused that original rigidity, is also up for grabs. I can see how it could have come about in direct response to various childhood experiences I went through, but again maybe that just bought out what was already a strong tendency within my genetic make-up. My increased rigidity sits in line with observations spoken about in \u201cParent Trap\u201d; that mothers tend to be \u2013 and be seen as \u2013 rigid, and fathers are seen as aloof (more aloof than they think they are). I\u2019d agree too that my husband was already quite aloof but became more so after our autistic son. I\u2019d have to try to get him to take the test for his younger self and see if it shows such an increase. I think too there is benefit and insight from letting someone close to you (a spouse in particular) take the BAP test for you and see how their perception of you differs from how you perceive yourself. In fact, once I\u2019d finished typing that very thought I decided to do the BAP test for my husband. He\u2019d previously done it for my original post, and got \u201cneurotypical\u201d, which surprised me at the time; I expected him to at least be aloof. Having just taken it for him in his absence, his result has changed to: \n Aloof personality, 100 aloof, 57 rigid and 70 pragmatic. (ie, above the cut-off point on aloofness, and thereby not neurotypical). \n So I did it for him pre-children too, again the results showed far more aloofness after having children. The pre-children results were: \n \n Neurotypical:\u00a0 81 aloof, 56 rigid and 57 pragmatic. \n Personal conclusions from all that test-taking then, are as follows: It appears that having an autistic child has enhanced \u201cautistic traits\u201d in both myself and my husband; making my rigidity, and his aloofness, more pronounced. Our results in regards to my being rigid, and him being aloof, aligns with the study looked at by SFARI. Whether those traits are autistic as such, or natural reactions to the challenge of raising an autistic child, is unclear, though I suspect there\u2019s a bit of both going on there. \n \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autismawareness.jpg", "https://sfari.org/blog/-/asset_publisher/Jb6r/content/parent-trap?redirect=%2Fnews-and-commentary%2Fall", "http://www.okcupid.com/tests/the-broad-autism-phenotype-test"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/did-your-autistic-child-drive-you-bappy/", "title": "Did your autistic child drive you\u00a0BAPpy?"},
{"date": "July 19, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n In the wake of the passionate and high levels of interest in the  autistic Christchurch looter  case, \u201cSunday\u201d released  another autism related story  last weekend, called \u201c Wired Differently .\u201d Even before the documentary aired, the teaser was under attack for inaccuracies, and for highlighting a single part of the autism spectrum experience. Having watched the documentary twice now, I have mixed reactions to it. I was expecting a piece about the difficulties associated with parenting such challenging children, and that definitely featured prominently through-out. But predominantly, the documentary focused on highlighting the short-fall in much-needed support for families with autistic children (and for those children once their parents pass away). It turned into an indictment on the lack of funding from the government, for supposedly core services, particularly those funded through the charity Autism New Zealand. In telling this woeful tale, it shared many individual stories, starting out with the most extreme consequence of insufficient support: The  murder of the autistic 17 year-old Casey \u00a0 at  the hands of a parent  (note she was 17,  not  15 years old; just one of the factual errors made in the show). The interviewer also cited a figure of 80% split-ups between parents raising an autistic child, and used an example of a one-parent home in the piece to highlight the consequent realities. By now you should be fully aware of where the attacks are going to come in. But I\u2019ll spell them out anyway for those of you perhaps not as familiar with these well-worn issues. I\u2019ll begin with the notion that caring for an autistic child can make murder understandable. The murder of a disabled child is not a natural reaction to a stressful situation; filicide is typically the result of an already mentally-ill mind. \u201cLack of support\u201d might help us to understand such a mind being pushed closer to the brink, but lack of support does not explain the act of murdering an autistic child. Furthermore, there is no reason to specifically think that the rate of murder of autistic children is  higher than the prevalence of autism in the population. (Useful post for these and other vitally important points: \u201c Playing the Blame Game: People don\u2019t kill their children because of autism .\u201d) The 80% split-up rate is another dodgy call on behalf of \u201cSunday.\u201d I have written in a  previous post , about the lack of  any  evidence for this 80% figure, and pointed out there that there have though been recent studies showing a far more typical rate of divorce amongst parents of autistic children. A much more in-depth and researched piece about the fictitious 80% figure  can be found here . And  this piece from medicine.net  helps to explain why it is so important not to ramp up the divorce figures; there are real consequences for families when they think they are more likely to get divorced, alongside receiving the autism diagnosis for their child. There are other aspects of Sunday\u2019s report which also rubbed me the wrong way, because they were misleading, ill-explained or under-explained. You\u2019re left with the impression that Autism NZ is the only local / national charity doing serious work and providing serious support for the autistic community; so that lack of funding and reduced services provided by them is the be-all, end-all. Ignoring  Altogether Autism ,  IHC ,  Parent to Parent ,  Autism House  and no doubt a raft of other charities. There are  a range of groups  \u2013 some wholly government-funded \u2013 that provide a range of training programs for new autism families, which was one of the particular services focused on in the report. I\u2019m not saying Autism NZ isn\u2019t a great and useful charity, I\u2019m just saying the impression by the story was that they were the only charity doing these works, and that the well-being of autistic families depend on their specific survival (so the government should give them money, and lots of it). (And on a side note, another factual error on behalf of the report, was their claim that five workers had lost their jobs at the Autism NZ Waikato branch, according to all other news reports I\u2019ve seen, the number is actually six.) The show also gave the general impression that the current government doesn\u2019t show awareness of, or provide support for, autism families. There  was  mention that one of the child\u2019s special sleeping arrangement had been funded by the government, and that some government funding helped cover carer costs. But there\u2019s also the  free  developmental pediatrician visits; speech therapy; occupational therapy; physiotherapy; educational psychologists; social workers; funding provided for use as the family sees fit via needs assessment agencies (eg can be used for ABA and carer support); and the non-income-tested fortnightly payments from the child disability allowance. Then there are the teacher aides and specialists provided through the special needs schools, and within the mainstream school environment too. I\u2019m not saying we couldn\u2019t do with more support. Neither am I saying some families who need access to these services always get them. I am saying that the government does clearly recognise the needs of autistic families and have shown this through a wide net of supports available for free. This was not made clear in the report, but is clearly highly relevant to getting an accurate picture of the level of support for our families. Now I\u2019m not saying the whole report was bunk. It was emotionally touching, and accurate in its portrayal of the hardships many families face. Having said that, autism is a spectrum, and though they refer to that a few times, I was not surprised to see adult and high-functioning autistics complaining that the piece misrepresents autism. Journalists almost always manage to upset one end or the other of the spectrum though. Either painting it too harshly or painting it too kindly. In Sunday\u2019s piece they were simply presenting realities, rather than presenting a definitive face of autism. I wouldn\u2019t be too ready to jump on the band-wagon of blaming them for not representing the true diversity, especially considering the theme of addressing the lack of support where it is most needed. I was pleased to see Sunday talking about and addressing the lack of support for autistic adults, particularly those who have reached an age where they have lost their parents. I worry a lot about what will happen when my husband and I can no longer support our son. I love the idea of a community village for adult autistic people, and would be one of the first in line to buy into such an option for my son. The idea that this could be a reality here within a matter of years, was very encouraging. But I am not aware of what is really available out there, and considering my disappointment with their information about other aspects of the report, I find myself a tad cynical about the accuracy of the support for adult autistic people too. I simply don\u2019t know how accurate their portrayal was. There was some moments in the report that sung to me with heart-felt recognition; such as where the family asked their child whether he wanted a squash or a tickle. This is something we ask our son almost every day, because he responds so well to both types of contact, and the  squash plays a particularly meaningful role  in our interactions with him. It always feels great to see other families so like our own in these ways; it really does make you feel less alone and less misunderstood. The ultimate up-shot of the report \u2013 for all its flaws (some significant, some less so) \u2013 was a raising of further awareness and empathy for what it\u2019s like to live with and raise an autistic child. The fact that various political parties (I\u2019m aware of the  response by Labour  and the  Greens ), have decided to get passionately behind the cause directly following the report, is worth noting. They are  calling for more support for our families , and having a good whinge at the current government for dropping the ball. I\u2019m aware that the current government has actually dedicated many millions specifically targeted for autism, and have heard a lot of very positive things about their awareness of and dedication to our families, so I was sadly surprised to see them under such strong attack, but what else would you expect in an election year? (It\u2019s hard not to be cynical; that we\u2019ll be forgotten after we\u2019re no longer the hot topic or it\u2019s no longer an election year.) Still, can\u2019t complain about them fighting it out to who\u2019s going to be the most generous to our families. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on (and sharing) the rhetoric as the election gets closer. So all-up, far from the best piece of journalism I\u2019ve seen on the issues, but arguably more good than harm will come from it. Time, and the local public reaction, will tell. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-looting-case-raises-autism-profile-4308196", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-looting-case-raises-autism-profile-4308196/video", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2000/aug/23/guardiansocietysupplement7", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/archive/national-news/453335/Grieving-mother-jailed-for-arson", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/08/playing-blame-game-people-dont-kill.html", "http://www.science20.com/science_autism_spectrum_disorders/no_real_difference_divorce_rate_families_children_autism_spectrum", "http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=116462", "http://www.altogetherautism.org.nz/page/autism_76.php", "http://www.ihc.org.nz/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx", "http://www.parent2parent.org.nz/start.htm", "http://www.autismhouse.org.nz/", "http://www.altogetherautism.org.nz/page/107-finding-services+training-programmes", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1107/S00305/autism-funding-crisis-needs-to-be-addressed.htm", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1107/S00307/autism-support-must-be-recognised-as-a-frontline-service.htm", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10739317&ref=nzwchron"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/the-errors-and-impact-of-the-nz-documentary-wired-differently/", "title": "The Errors and Impact of the NZ documentary, \u201cWired Differently\u201d"},
{"date": "January 15, 2013", "body": "Today I came across a very interesting article on the New Zealand Herald site, written by Mike Lee. It\u2019s entitled \u201c Naming gay All Blacks marks sexuality, not talent .\u201d The concerns raised in it closely parallel the concerns I have about the multitudes who have been promoting Alexis Wineman to win Miss America, merely on the grounds of her autism. By Darien Library, via Flickr The argument runs along these lines: Whether it\u2019s sports, or beauty pageants, or any other area of competition or employment, what matters is how well someone performs at the tasks necessary to succeed in those endeavors. When we instead turn our attention and ask others to do the same, to sexual orientation or disability, we are treating those considerations as if they are relevant and important, in the same way that we beg everyone who discriminates to  not  do: We are saying \u201clook, this person is different\u201d when what we should be focusing on and praising is the talent and achievements themselves. Whether someone has a disability or other difference is entirely their own business and shouldn\u2019t be treated as fodder for public consumption, particularly when it\u2019s not relevant to the excellence (sports ability, beauty) at issue in a competition. Furthermore, to bring attention to the difference, marks the person out to have to perform better than their counterparts. As Mike puts it: \u201c Rather than being judged on their ability alone, they might be scrutinised more closely and be under immense pressure to perform even better than average in order to avoid accusations of reverse discrimination. \u201d The ideal, instead, would be to recognise and respect individuality. To praise a person\u2019s excellence in their chosen field, quite independently of whatever labels they carry around. To not belittle their achievements by saying \u201cwell, you\u2019ve done quite well, for a black man\u201d (or whatever the difference), when instead we should be celebrating what they have achieved in and of itself (ie, not merely despite the barriers they faced). If someone\u2019s achievement is all the more remarkable because of their disability, that is interesting and noteworthy, but it doesn\u2019t mean we should constantly structure the person\u2019s achievements in that light. (I couldn\u2019t help but wonder too when I saw all the claims that Alexis was the first Miss America contestant to have autism. How do you prove such a thing? What about those who went before her and didn\u2019t try to use their autism to some sort of advantage or to garner more attention, and simply competed on their merits in the contest? What about those who came before her who had autism but no confirmed diagnosis, are they less worthy of public praise than she is? When I think about this, I feel very uncomfortable with her using autism to grab the spotlight, I\u2019d have been more impressed if she\u2019d acknowledged that many people have autism without having a diagnosis and that these people are all around us anyway; the whole \u201clook at me, it\u2019s important that I win because I told the world I have autism\u201d thing doesn\u2019t sit well with me. I realise I\u2019m in a minority here.) But \u2013 and it\u2019s a big but \u2013 do we not have to adjust our ideals (that people be seen as and treated as individuals), to take account of lived reality? In a world where discrimination occurs, does it not make sense to try to counter it with reverse discrimination? And in a world where disability and other differences are very real barriers to equal opportunity achievement, should we not openly support and identify those who have overcome those barriers to be able to compete with those who didn\u2019t face the same barriers? Hold them up as something for similarly affected people to aspire to, and to reveal to the rest of the world that difference is not as relevant as they think it is to personal achievements? I\u2019m torn about this one (I broached the issue not long ago in  a post on autism pride  too). For me, it\u2019s a question of whether we act like we live in the world we want everyone to reach \u2013 one where individuality matters more and labels are not seen as defining the entire person \u2013 or whether we act in constant acknowledgement of all these barriers that currently exist (but not modeling the actual contextual irrelevance that people should show towards the difference). Furthermore, do we adopt the very rhetoric we\u2019re arguing against \u2013 the one that tells us what you\u2019re born with really does matter to your worth \u2013 and just turn it on its head by saying it matters because it makes you  better , rather than the status quo of making you worse? This is where I currently stand: I want people to treat my son in the ideal sense I aspire to. I want them to recognise and respect his individuality. I don\u2019t want them to obsess about his autism, though I would like them to recognise its relevance in various situations (such as providing consideration to his challenges so that he can still participate in society, in much the same way we allow for wheelchairs to all public buildings. But in an ideal world these considerations would be a natural part of how systems and buildings etc are set up; with an eye to the simple reality that humans are complex and very varied beings.) I want to be consistent with my expectations: That other people should not treat someone as more or less worthy by accident or birth, so neither would I. To me, that\u2019s a matter of personal integrity. If my son gets to the top of his chosen field, and wants to share the fact that he has autism with the world, that would be fine by me. If he doesn\u2019t share that he has autism though, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s not something to be ashamed of, or some special blessing, it\u2019s just part of his lived reality, it\u2019s a \u201cfact.\u201d He is not obligated to the rest of the world \u2013 or to the autism community \u2013 to share this fact. If he does remarkably well in his life but doesn\u2019t do well by \u201cnormal\u201d standards \u2013 lets say he can live independently but can\u2019t get any sort of job or have a long-term relationship \u2013 I\u2019d be happy to celebrate and recognise what he has achieved in light of his limitations, but he\u2019s still just who he is either way. It\u2019s his life, and he\u2019s doing the best he can, and it\u2019s his story; it\u2019s not \u201cinspiration porn\u201d for the rest of the world. But then what am I doing with my blog? How does my blogging fit into the fact that I want to treat him as the complete and complex individual that he is? I like to think I protect his identity here by not revealing my own, so some of these issues are not as major as they might otherwise have been. But the fact is I do write for a world where autism is misunderstood and our stories need to be heard to help change that. Isn\u2019t that the inverse of the ideal I want to act within? My blogging has been taking a slightly different tact lately \u2013 such as in my piece I mentioned earlier on autism pride, and in my  other recent post on telling strangers he has autism  \u2013 so perhaps ultimately my blog too will reflect this growing recognition. Is there not though, a relevant difference between a mother celebrating her own son\u2019s achievements, and me celebrating the achievements of a complete stranger merely  because  they have autism? Clearly I have more questions than answers. But I think they are questions worth asking (for me if no one else!) If you want to share your own views on these matters, and why you hold those views, I would be grateful for the insights. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10858894", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/darienlibrary/7473241130/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/all-blacks-beauty-queens-achievement-and-autism/", "title": "All Blacks, Beauty Queens, Achievement, and\u00a0Autism."},
{"date": "January 10, 2013", "body": "There is a beautiful boy, with the sort of face that supports stereotypes of stunning autistic children. He is three and a half. He is in the bath, and his mother sits beside the bath with a camera. The camera is not to capture funny pictures of the child laughing in an over-flowing floppy tower of bubbles, it is not there to capture him playing with toys or other joys. It\u2019s just a thing to do, taking these videos and pictures. Because every day is the same, every day is dictated by a three-year-old boy who the mother struggles to understand. She is exhausted, and it is hard to find activities she can do around the child that don\u2019t upset him. She can\u2019t sing or sit in the wrong place \u2013 and in a year from now her son will not even let her talk without hitting her in the mouth and biting her arm \u2013 but she\u2019s allowed to sit by the bath, with a camera, and so she does. By corrine klug She decides to attempt to engage him with speech. He is distracted, staring at nothing or something in the distance, but she captures his attention by using his name and asking him to say hello. She gets no response but tries again. Gently encouraging, no pressure, trying to keep things upbeat, because he has a tendency to get upset quickly. He looks at her, he looks thoughtful, eventually he says, \u201cone, two!\u201d The boy can count to ten, but he has trouble using any functional language. She\u2019s been told there are no promises he\u2019ll ever talk in a sentence. But for now, \u201cone, two\u201d is communication, and his voice is something to be encouraged. So while it\u2019s not the expected or wanted answer, it is an answer, and she praises him, \u201cone, two, good boy!\u201d No more words come from him, but before the video footage cuts out, he turns his eyes to his mother again and does something that he knows she will like and that is expected when in front of a camera: He smiles. Briefly, but he smiles. The mother is happy, she turns the camera off, the footage ends. Her day continues, much as it had all the months before and months after that. I watched that video today, I found it in my old archives. It feels like someone else\u2019s life. The seven-year-old son I have now can talk in many running sentences. His speech is unusual, but he can speak in more than numbers, and his words make sense to those around him, and those are things to celebrate. He now has good eye-contact, and he smiles naturally and often. It\u2019s like we\u2019re both not who we were. It feels like there is so much \u201cautism\u201d between now and then. Years of therapy, and specialists, and tears and tantrums and violence and fear. And learning, so much learning. From there to here, was the hardest experience in my life, and probably his as well, though I don\u2019t know if he remembers it. There have been times, many times, I wish I could not remember it, but I have to, to recognise how far we\u2019ve come and not just how far we\u2019ve yet to go. I don\u2019t know if anyone in my life back then knew what our lives were like behind closed doors. I often thought about all the people walking by on the street, just going about their lives, walking past the madness going on in our home without a second thought. When I\u2019d take my own son for walks in his stroller \u2013 always the same circuit, always the same direction, over and over \u2013 I\u2019d count the houses we passed and try to figure out how many autistic children there must be in each neighbourhood according to the latest 1 in 110 ratio. Wondered what else went unseen, and thinking about how naive I once had been about what life could be like where no one else can see. Now I\u2019m one of those people just going about my life, but I still read and care about the other children and mothers that like my son and I, are trying to find a way to communicate with each other, to be together, to find and hold on to smiles. For some families, my boy in the bath tub becomes the man in the bath tub, who still answers a \u201chello\u201d with a \u201cone, two.\u201d For some people reading this, you\u2019re just starting out and wondering which path your life and your child\u2019s life will take. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t have your answers. But know this: You are not alone, no matter how alone and misunderstood and scared you feel, you are not the first or only one going through this. When you get the chance, capture the happy moments, make note of every little progress, celebrate even the words that don\u2019t make sense yet because they could be the start of something wonderful beyond words. \u201cOne, two\u2026\u201d may not be a conventional beginning of a sentence or a vocabulary, but it is a good place to start. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/corrinespictures/5939733457/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/the-boy-in-the-bath-tub/", "title": "The Boy In The Bath\u00a0Tub"},
{"date": "January 16, 2013", "body": "When it is used to talk about parenting practices, the word \u201cspoil\u201d brings with it judgement as well as description: It describes overindulging the child, letting them have whatever they want, even when the request is unreasonable or excessive, but it also immediately condemns the practice as ruination of the child because of the more general meaning of the word. There is nothing good about something being spoiled. By wwarby And yet, spoiling my son was exactly what was required in order to break through at least two major hurdles in his life caused by\u00a0his autism. Both times that I indulged his every wish, I was told not to, that it was just encouraging bad habits and causing us unnecessary and extreme expense. But I was acting under the guidance of experts and putting my own knowledge of my son and autism into play. We had success, and my son is not in the least bit ruined, he is only happier and more skilled than before. The first example is when we were teaching him PECS, a form of communication using pictures to represent what he wanted to communicate because his speech was so limited. Part of the PECS process is to find something that highly motivates the child, and use it to encourage and reward efforts to communicate. In order for the process to be successful \u2013 to teach the child that communication efforts are a reliable, good and effective thing \u2013 we had to meet every demand for whatever he most desired. For example, if he most desired a type\u00a0of sweet, and he brought us the picture that represented the sweet, we would meet every single demand with immediate satisfaction, regardless of the time of day or what else we as parents may have been engaged in at the time. This goes against some basic parenting advice, about teaching the child to wait politely, not to interrupt adults, and not to indulge a child with sweets or otherwise meet ongoing requests for something that in itself is not good for them. But the bigger picture was that communication was the goal, and communication was absolutely essential\u00a0to his future well-being, so that took precedence. Furthermore, meeting every single demand was a stage in a process, it was not the point at which the training stopped. It was a transition phase to help him make the connections, once he\u2019d made them and realised the system worked for his needs, further steps involved requiring more of him before he got what he wanted, and eventually introducing a \u201cwait\u201d sign and system too; a sign and system that would have meant nothing to him if we hadn\u2019t first established the meaningfulness\u00a0and relevance of PECS in his life with the stage of meeting every single demand. A second example is\u00a0when we were toilet\u00a0training him. I used brand-name ridiculously pricey Thomas the Tank Engine toys and play-sets to motivate my son for each stage of the toileting process. I used to order hundreds of dollars of toys in advance multiple times, through a website that specialised\u00a0in Thomas toys, so they\u2019d be ready to go whenever he had successes. This was at a time when money was very\u00a0tight, but I knew it was the right thing to do. Again, it was about finding the right motivator for him. My son has a very good eye for detail, and knows when an item looks like the genuine thing on the TV and when it doesn\u2019t. He was motivated in part by their very sameness, had I just used any old lower cost train and train set, the motivator would have been greatly decreased or maybe not been there at all. I had to start with whatever gave me (and him) the highest chance of success off the bat: if you don\u2019t get things right the first time with an autistic child, it can create whole new anxieties and issues that you then have to overcome before you can try the original challenge again. I had to overcome his existing concerns with something more powerful than all the new experiences he was about to go through. Similarly as in my first example, this was a transition phase too. I had people telling me that he\u2019ll become reliant on the highly expensive rewards, he didn\u2019t. I knew how to slowly fade out rewards as behaviour became more habitual and less scary for him. I slowly, very slowly, faded it our from a toy for every wee and pooh, to just toys for poohs and stickers for wees, and eventually down to stickers for both, then only used praise. It worked, and we didn\u2019t go broke, and we didn\u2019t ruin his character or create a spoilt brat. Again, it was a matter of priorities as much as anything too: It was more important that our son learn to use the toilet, than to worry about the possibility to creating a spoilt child. It is easier anyway to undo any spoiling, than to teach toilet training and speech. Autism has a way of putting other parenting concerns into a very different perspective. So yes, I have at times deliberately spoilt my child by overindulging him and meeting his every demand, and no I did not \u201cspoil\u201d my child\u2019s character or patience in the process. I have said this many times in my blog and here I say it again: You cannot take the usual parenting strategies for \u201cnormal\u201d children, and simply apply them to autistic children. Parenting advice for a child who is developing normally, is not always relevant to our kids. The judgment we receive from strangers and well-meaning do-gooders, is very often loud, harsh and undeserved. We normally don\u2019t have the time or energy to educate and explain what\u2019s happening to every judgemental person we encounter, we have our hands full with our children. If I tied to explain my son\u2019s extraordinary eye for detail as to why I buy branded more expensive products, or tried to explain how PECS works, the person I\u2019m talking to is going to think I\u2019m making excuses rather than the explanations they actually are, if they listen at all. But it\u2019s frankly none of their business anyway. These are lessons I didn\u2019t learn until after I was in a position to personally know better. It\u2019s easy to be all righteous and indignant once you\u2019re in-the-know. I write for myself, I write to show my understanding and sympathy to others who have been in my situation, but I also write in the hope that just maybe someone who didn\u2019t realise these issues were at play will think twice when they next find themselves in a position to judge. Things are not always as they seem; sometimes spoiling a child really is in their best interests. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwarby/5027161428/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/how-spoiling-my-son-helped-his-autism/", "title": "How Spoiling My Son Helped His\u00a0Autism"},

{"date": "January 18, 2013", "body": "This morning I took my seven year-old son to the movie \u201cWreck-It Ralph.\u201d He coped very well with the experience, and we both enjoyed the movie in its own right. But there was something extra wonderful about this movie that deserves recognition and praise, and allowed me to enjoy it on a whole other level. Since the movie is still running at the theatres, I won\u2019t include any spoilers in this post. I will only share the themes that I found very attractive, and leave it to you to discover the way they are expressed when you watch it yourself. I will provide a brief summary though of the plot, which reveals nothing you wouldn\u2019t find in the trailer anyway. The movie is about a \u201cbad guy\u201d in the video game (Ralph) who wants to break free of his role; he doesn\u2019t want to be treated like the bad guy anymore even though that\u2019s his job. So he breaks free into other video games, hilarity and disaster ensue. The morals in this story apply nicely to the autism world, as should become clear as I go through them. The first moral of this story is a simple but important one about not treating people like single dimensional characters (all the more eloquently expressed by the use of characters in a video game). It\u2019s about recognising that we may play certain roles at particular times in our lives, or be viewed in a particular way because of what has to get done, but that we are actually complex people with complex needs, and that it is in no one\u2019s best interests to simplify people into a simple, single-dimensional package. This is also related to the second moral that comes through the film: Not to let others define you. When we fixate on what others think of us and see ourselves through their eyes all the time, we give them a lot of power over us. We need to be ready to define ourselves and break free of imposed stereotypes. Third there is the value of breaking out of our comfort zone. That it is too easy to get used to the way we do things and get things done. That there is much to be learned and gained from trying a new way to achieve our objectives, even though that new way and those new experiences may scare us at first. There are amazing people with huge diversity out there, get out and discover it. Finally,\u00a0 the moral of accepting and celebrating difference. The idea that just because someone doesn\u2019t conform, doesn\u2019t mean they are a threat \u201cto the system.\u201d Sometimes, their different perspectives and experiences are exactly what we need to make everyone\u2019s lives better, and to reveal truths we were otherwise blind to \u2013 about ourselves and about the world around us. There are other nice morals in the film too, like being careful when you think you\u2019re doing something for someone else\u2019s own good, and recognising the value of other people\u2019s life experience. It\u2019s also simply a lovely, funny, clever film. The story-line will overwhelm some kids, and it\u2019s a very busy movie, but all the car antics and the constant action kept my son very happy, and a happy son is a happy mother. I\u2019d love to hear what you thought of it too (spoiler-free though please!)

{"date": "December 2, 2012", "body": "Autism is like cancer: Just like there are multiple autisms, there are multiple cancers, but they have an underlying similarity. We need to focus on finding the elusive causes (which may also be multiple) and the corresponding cures and preventatives. Autism is like a person\u2019s race: People are born with it, and society can make it hard to live with it, but race is not something we should work on changing. What we need is more acceptance, tolerance and understanding of diversity, not a \u201ccure.\u201d Wait, I\u2019m not finished yet\u2026 Autism is like diabetes; you might be born with it or come to have it later on, the important thing is to focus on management and finding a way to live the best life you can in the face of the challenges. Photo by Frank M. Rafik. Autism is like a broken leg; it may be caused by lots of different events, and can vary in severity. The important thing is not to put all the effort and research into finding out what caused it, but to focus on the fact it exists and try to fix it now. Analogies attempt to draw key similarities between something people are already familiar with (cancer, diabetes, race, broken legs, etc), with something people are less familiar with (autism). The aim of analogies is generally to elucidate some truth or insight through the comparison. There are always (necessarily) differences between the two entities being compared, and focusing on those differences can easily make any analogy look farcical or redundant: Autism doesn\u2019t kill like cancer or diabetes can; race doesn\u2019t affect your ability to learn your own language or use the toilet; broken legs are always a bad thing that objectively make your life worse and everyone agrees should be fixed\u2026 Already you see the next problem: the analogy is formed with an eye on the  conclusion,  not on the deductive strength of the premises, and yet it\u2019s frequently wielded like an argument: The person making the analogy has already decided what they want you to think about autism (that it\u2019s good, bad, needs a cure, doesn\u2019t need a cure) and then chooses a comparison point that suits their ends. (Which is fine; that\u2019s how analogies work, we just need to be honest about it.) For example, if you think autism is simply beautiful diversity, you\u2019re hardly going to choose a cancer analogy to explain the nature of autism. So when one side is shouting \u201cit\u2019s like cancer\u201d and the other side shouts back \u201cit\u2019s like race,\u201d and start trying to pick apart where each others\u2019 analogies don\u2019t perfectly match autism, it\u2019s not really a substantive debate or argument that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s just a shouting match over pre-formed conclusions. Which is not to say that the analogies can\u2019t be helpful; they can. Analogies are very useful methods to make a point or get people approaching a topic in a new way, or simply to attempt to explain an entirely new concept. It\u2019s just when it comes to autism, the factions are so deeply split and so passionately directed towards their own views, that these analogies more often inflame upset and deeper division, than aid understanding and comprehension. Autism affects people in such diverse ways, to such different severities, and still has so many unknowns and half-knowns around it, that trying to capture it in a simple analogy to something we really  do  already understand, is likely to always come off badly. It is one thing to use an analogy to explain something you know very well to someone who doesn\u2019t know it well; it is quite another to use an analogy to claim superior knowledge (and superior attitude) against someone else who also lives with and has a highly developed understanding of autism. It is in the latter way that I see these analogies used the most, and to least effect. Ultimately, forming autism analogies to win an argument, is like\u2026 (I\u2019ll let you fill in the gap \ud83d\ude42 ) \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/abuaiman/356116623/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/the-multiheaded-autism-analogy-beast-and-why-you-cant-fight-it/", "title": "The Multiheaded Autism Analogy Beast (and why you can\u2019t fight\u00a0it)."},
{"date": "July 19, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n The debate about whether using marijuana to treat the symptoms of autism, is a good idea or an atrocious one, is tainted by the rather arbitrary designation of it as an illegal substance. Parents who treat their child with the substance, get painted as lazy and selfish individuals, sacrificing their children to an under-researched and under-ground option instead of taking the \u201ctried and true\u201d safer options. Those promoting marijuana use in the context of autism are seen as corrupting the genuine search for answers to the mysteries of autism, just to provide a defence for their existing drug habits. So I\u2019m going to take a step back, and I ask you to do the same should you choose to comment on this post. Deal with the facts, and put aside conspiracy theories and moralised positions that come from reactions to the word \u201cmarijuana\u201d. Think of it as \u201csubstance XYZ\u201d if it helps. (I should say that it\u2019s not just those anti marijuana use, who get carried away with the over-heated rhetoric and conspiracy theories. There are lunatics in every movement, and the pro-cannabis team have their fair share. In fact, some of their out-spoken members are so extreme and obsessive that they are very good at turning people away from their cause from the first mention. The obsessive amongst them are held up as examples of what marijuana consumption does to your brain: Your reasoning and communication is affected, and your constant focus is on securing the source of your next fix.) There is growing appreciation on a global scale, of the (non-recreational) benefits of marijuana. The research feeding that understanding though, faces barriers to funding because of its legal category, and because of the arguably limited profit from its medicinal use (it is, after all, a freely grown and widely available plant). Without adequate research, the problem of isolating which of the very large number of components in marijuana are helping to ease the symptoms of autism (and the consequences of living with autism), remains a particularly significant problem, that often leads to people preferring use of the naturally occurring variants which haven\u2019t been stripped of certain properties the way that medical marijuana often is. The way in which marijuana is delivered into the body also often clouds the issues (pun intended). Smoking it is neither the most effective nor safest option; vapour and digestion are better. Often the debates get caught up in images of children puffing on a joint, which is un-necessary and unhelpful. Educating users about the risks, benefits, and methods of getting the substance safely and effectively into the body, is hampered by its illegality. Even when medical marijuana is made available through prescription, some families feel too stigmatised to publicly seek out and acquire it through the safest and correct channels; preferring a clandestine approach to treating their child in a way that supposedly protects their child and themselves from governmental scrutiny (though such an approach has obvious and serious risks attached). I don\u2019t want to travel too far down the road of questioning its overall illegality or the current controls on its otherwise legal usage. I think the more interesting and important questions lie around its purported benefits, and the question of at what point in a treatment plan should marijuana become an option for autistic people. I admit that the issue of illegality and the benefits of its use, cannot be ultimately separated out: What\u2019s the point of knowing its great if no one can get their hands on it. But the primary question must be whether it is great at all; once that is established, the question of illegality would start to respond more to match those benefits (which is a trend we\u2019re already seeing.) So how can it assist with autism? It\u2019s important to point out that it is not a cure for autism, it alleviates symptoms of autism. But considering that autism is defined by its symptoms, some may argue that significantly alleviating those symptoms is by definition a cure, even if one that requires on-going consumption of the substance. What symptoms then, does it assist with? The most common ones I\u2019ve read about are anxiety, self-harm, aggression and restrictive diets. Sometimes these symptoms are so severe that the effective treatment of them with marijuana, is a life-saver in a very real sense. Some of the behaviours that marijuana addresses (such as aggression) may be considered in the category of  consequences , rather than  symptoms  per se, of autism. But where the behaviour would supposedly have not occured  but for  the precense of autism, the distinction between symptoms and consequences of autism in this context is not necessarily of particular import (though still an interesting and note-worthy distinction). But what of alternative options; such as widely used drugs and behavioural interventions? As with any other drugs, the primary response to treating an autistic child should be educational and behavioural interventions. Where those are not working, or more extreme help is required while the benefits of those methods are coming into play for the sake of the child\u2019s own safety, then the family may be encouraged to try drugs currently on the market. There is usually extreme caution around using any drugs on children, and particularly so for autistic children since their bodies appear to react in unusual and unpredictable ways to drugs. The drugs that are currently widely available for treating autism, often have severe side effects; to the point that a problem has to be particularly extreme before the benefits of taking the drug will out-weigh the harms caused by taking the drug. In turn, before turning to marijuana, a family should have tried behavioural and educational interventions, and must make an informed choice about the harms versus benefits of taking marijuana. There do appear to be less harms, and less extreme harms, associated with taking marijuana than for taking the more widely available drugs. It\u2019s long-term use is also arguably better understood than mainstream drugs despite some limitations on official research, since marijuana has been available a heck of a lot longer than the modern manufactured and prescribed drugs, and the effects of its use have also been observed for thousands of years. In a broader sense \u2013 beyond addressing individual symptoms \u2013 marijuana use appears to positively affect overall quality of life for autistic people too. The stories of users are not typically ones of stoned individuals staring at their fingers and pretty colours all day, when they would have otherwise been alert, independent and contributing members of society (which is the image many people call up when they talk about marijuana use more generally, and simply cross-apply it to the life of a severely autistic child). Rather, marijuana appears to \u2013 for example \u2013 lower social anxieties to the point where otherwise house-bound adults and \u201cunteachable\u201d children, become more engaged with those around them and better able to learn within school environments. Would I use marijuana with my own son? No. But that is because we have never used any autism-specific drugs for our child, following the cautious approach of his developmental pediatrician who avoids using drugs on autistic children, and strongly encourages persistence with behavioural interventions instead (even in the face of his extreme anxieties that seriously impacted on his daily life). Had our son been even marginally worse than he was, when he was at his worst, I can not say what we would have done. I went through hell with my son that changed me at my core; it\u2019s not that hard to imagine that my own values and priorities could have drastically shifted if I\u2019d found myself in an even worse situation than I was. From all my reading (and I know I only scratched the surface), one thing is very clear: That it is important that marijuana be further researched to identify and isolate the components that appear to alleviate autism symptoms, and to better understand how and why it may work. Marijuana is not a devil plant, the use of which will always be a statement of the poor character and judgement of the user. To treat it as such further victimizes some of the most severely affected autistic individuals and families that turned to it as a very last resort (in a world where people still painfully restrain and submit autistic people to barbaric practices, in far less appealing efforts to address the symptoms of autism). The debate surrounding its use is complicated by a wide range of issues; some of real concern, some of little weight or importance. If we can calmly approach the topic, putting aside pre-conceived ideas that aren\u2019t backed by science or sound reason, then we\u2019re one step closer to figuring out whether you\u2019d have to be out of your mind to treat autism with marijuana. (Pun intended). *** I encountered a lot of rubbish during my research into this topic.

{"date": "December 8, 2012", "body": "Philip Patston is a disabled white gay comedian, who asks us to think again about our use of labels. He recently took part in a TEDx talk in Auckland, which I share below and encourage you to watch and share too. It\u2019s entitled \u201cThe Label Libel, A New Look at Diversity.\u201d Patston covers a lot of ground in his talk; I just want to emphasize and reflect on certain elements that spoke to me as someone immersed in the autism world. What I say below is more tightly tailored to the disability world I see everyday than the more general issues he addresses. Though Patston rightly recognises the importance and value of using labels, he challenges us to take a closer look at the dysfunction of labels. Even within disability movements, there is a tendency to rely too heavily on labels to capture a \u201csameness,\u201d that does a disservice to the uniqueness of the labeled individual. He asks us to consider that we each carry multiple aspects of humanity (ethnicity, health, gender, etc), which are scales of grey rather than black and white divisions. For example, healthy versus unhealthy is not always a useful and accurate division (a lesson I\u2019ve learnt through my autistic son\u2019s insistence that I label every conceivable food as one or the other!) Patston challenges us to get away from thinking of people in terms of the labels we place on them (or indeed, that they may place on themselves), and instead focus on commonality and uniqueness: In each of those aspects of humanity, we have things in common with others, and things that make us unique from others. So using a label can mask these divisions, not just in terms of the grey rather than the black and white on each scale, but also in terms of keeping an eye on the uniqueness we always retain despite carrying around our common labels. He uses a metaphor of \u201cdecay,\u201d but in a positive way (which is quite clever, in the very fact that it undercuts the label of \u201cdecay\u201d \u2013 you\u2019ll have to watch his leaf analogy to truly appreciate the idea). There are two ways in which he asks us to decay existing paradigms, that I want to comment on: Identity, and agreement. Both of which commonly arise as issues in the autism community. In regards to identity, Patston encourages us to decay the notion that we are one thing, and not another. He wants us to resist locking ourselves (and others) into labels, which have the effect of highlighting one aspect of ourselves in a way that hides or belittles the rest of who we are. Which is to say (to restate what I said two paragraphs back), that not only can labels be misleading in their commonality and their black / white categorization, but they can also overly simplify our true complexity and lived realities. Over the past year I have become increasingly wary about the amount of power given to the idea of autism, when someone adopts it as the core of their identity, a power that is highlighted in times of diagnostic change. I accept that some take great comfort and positivity from choosing autism as their identity, but I think we must be careful about accepting any rhetoric that tells us this is the  only  way to truly accept and recognise \u201cautism.\u201d We should be wary (and critical) of the claim that those who deny autism as identity, are doing damage and an injustice to themselves (and to their children.) Which brings me to the second point of decay: Agreement. Patston thinks we should decay our need for agreement in community. That we should recognise that there is diversity ever-present even within a community that yet binds itself to a cause. A classic example of where this goes awry: a community might insist on and chastise those who do not use the \u201ccorrect\u201d language when referring to particular ideas. In the autism community, there is often talk that we must only use one phrase or word to talk about ourselves and others, and an outcry when people dare to not abide (for example, \u201cautistic\u201d versus \u201chas autism,\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d versus \u201cdifferently abled\u201d). By insisting on agreement and harshly judging those who do not conform, we again downplay the reality \u2013 the true diversity \u2013 among us: We may carry the commonality of living with autism (either in ourselves or our loved ones), but we also each bring with us uniqueness in our other aspects of humanity, and in our experiences and perspectives. Which is where I find the contradiction in the Autism Neurodiversity movement, quite maddening at times: To cry out for acceptance of diversity, but insist there is one right version of it. To group together under one title that names itself by diversity, but in doing so already defines how that diversity must be thought of and talked about. (For an extended examination of my views on the movement, see my post \u201c Acceptance of Diversity within Neurodiversity..? \u201c) Similarly the insistence I\u2019ve heard over the past couple of years that we should all just get along, that we should stop fighting with each other and focus on agreeing that we need more services and funding for all autistic people. In one sense, this accepts uniqueness, in that it acknowledges we have different views on terminology and the origins and nature of autism. However, it also assumes that agreement is possible in areas that are actually just as (beautifully) diverse: Our views on what is good for autistic people, on what is the good life, on politics, and economics, and on so many other ways in which true diversity remains. Insisting on agreement, ultimately aims to silence true disagreement, which sounds trite, but let me explain: It is better to acknowledge and hear the disagreement, than to hide it away and deny it is there or should even be there. The diversity of ideas about how to see and think about autism, forces us to confront our own assumptions, and challenges us to defend them. We may not like being put in that position \u2013 it may feel uncomfortable and even threatening \u2013 but denying others views don\u2019t make them go away, and may leave those other people feeling just as uncomfortable and threatened. Better to speak openly and honestly and recognise diversity, than to pretend to speak for everyone in a group when really you speak for the portion that happens to already agree with you. A lot of this talk of accepting diversity may sound close to relativism or nihilism, but I argue it\u2019s not that extreme, for two reasons: There is not the denial of truths and knowledge, rather the recognition of the complex and challenging reality that we all carry these commonalities and uniquenesses. Further, there is the explicit acceptance that there is positive value in the use and recognition of labels, but that value must be tempered by recognition of the down-sides and oversimplification caused by labels too. Making you agree with Patston\u2019s own words, or with my elaboration and application of the them to the autism world, is not the end goal of my post. I only want to share these ideas, and share my musings on them, to see what comes of it. Not to force you to accept and agree and conform, but to re-think and reflect and re-see. At the very least, I think there is objective good that comes from pondering the use and misuse of labels, in particular in thinking about the point that if we must use labels \u2013 and it appears that we must \u2013 that as much as possible we must use them for the betterment of those labeled, rather than to hurt, restrict, or hide an individual\u2019s uniqueness. But those are just the musings of a white atheist Jewish New Zealand mother\u2026 for want of a better label. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/the-beauty-of-decaying-labels-reflecting-on-philip-patstons-tedx-talk/", "title": "The Beauty of Decaying Labels: Reflecting on Philip Patston\u2019s TEDx\u00a0Talk."},
{"date": "November 1, 2012", "body": "Yesterday my son and I both experienced something for the first time: Trick-or-treating on Halloween. Halloween is relatively new to my country, and is still very widely attacked here as an unwanted Americanism which is all about rude kids wanting free candy. For many it is simply seen as a way for various high-profile companies to make some extra money, on something which has no meaningful history (compare Christmas, which at least has meaning for many, despite the commercialisation). But those are adults issues and views, none of them matter to a seven-year old who sees children knocking on our door each year, dressed up in costumes, getting free lollies from us, before the children run off laughing to the next house. So there\u2019s nothing unexpected in my son asking to join in this year. I like that there was something new that he wanted to try, and saw the opportunities in the experience to teach and extend his skills and confidence, so neither should there be anything unexpected in the fact that I agreed to him giving it a go. Leading up to the day we hit a hurdle: The only thing my son wanted to dress up as was a clock (clocks being one of his central obsessions), and it\u2019s not a readily available costume, nor one I had the time or resources (or skill) to create. As the day neared both I and he became less enamoured with the idea of Halloween; he decided he didn\u2019t like scary things, and I was concerned about taking a child around without a costume, asking for treats that I didn\u2019t even want him to eat. Then something shared on Facebook changed my mind and lead to our first night trick-or-treating: It reminded me that there are very many things my son has had trouble doing and has been excluded from, just because of fears and expectations (both mine and his), and that I have prided myself on working to find ways around those fears and expectations. If a friend on Facebook (who doesn\u2019t have an autistic child and who is not autistic) can share this message of acceptance and open-mindedness, then the least I could do was act with the hope and expectation that maybe people could overlook my son\u2019s differences and welcome him just like all the other less-deserving ratbags in our neighbourhood; ratbags who don\u2019t face these issues but present the very face of rudeness that the image is trying to rewrite in people\u2019s minds. Which brings me to this point: There are rude children on Halloween, we see them every year lately. They don\u2019t bother dressing up in costumes, they don\u2019t say thank you, they knock on doors where people show no interest in Halloween in a country where Halloween is still mostly frowned upon. And they do it in droves (we\u2019re not just talking a few of the kids, this is more like a majority of the kids who knock on our door). So how do you tell the difference between these rude children, and the disabled ones who face verbal and physical challenges that can come off as rudeness, and how do you take those differences into account when teaching the \u201crules\u201d of Halloween? Because I looked up the Halloween rules, and what I kept coming upon time after time, was a list of exclusions for disabled children: They must say thank you, they mustn\u2019t using grabbing motions at the candy, they must wear a costume \u201cif they\u2019re not wearing costumes, don\u2019t give them candy.\u201d All of which means that children facing sensory and motor and communication issues are likely to be seen as rude and unwanted on a day which is meant to be fun for all kids. Then I figured out what the problem was, and why the message about rudeness on Halloween is all garbled and confused: These instructions about rules and rudeness should only be directed at the parents preparing the children for Halloween; it is \u2013 as ever \u2013 their responsibility to guide and inform their own children in matters of manners and behaviour. By the time that child comes knocking on your door, if they\u2019re not in a costume and forget their words and say or do the wrong things according to the rules, the person handing out the candy should be giving the benefit of the doubt, and blaming the parents (if they must blame someone) instead of punishing the child standing on their doorstep. When you open your door, you have no idea of the history behind the child in front of you; assume the best and help them enjoy their night instead of ticking off a list of rules in your head. Real and concerning rudeness in this context isn\u2019t hard to spot; children who are mean or actively rude in their words and actions (as opposed to those who don\u2019t follow perfectly correct words and behaviours) are of a very different sort than those who are struggling with disabilities. And quite frankly, even if a child was struggling with disabilities, there is always a line drawn at meanness or intentional rudeness, so the distinction between rudeness and disability melts away at that point anyway. These same concerns are mirrored in matters of general public behaviour and discipline, and the way the public reacts when they see a parent struggling with a difficult child, and chip in their sarcastic comments and sneers of disapproval: You don\u2019t know the child, you don\u2019t know their history. It is the parent\u2019s responsibility to teach that child manners and good behaviour, it is not your role to pass judgment on absolute strangers and hold them accountable for falling short of your standards. The difference between an abusive or neglectful parent, and one who is struggling with a disabled child (even when it is an invisible disability like autism), is the same sort of difference as between an accidentally and intentionally rude child at your door on Halloween: Withhold the judgment, condemnation and punishment when you don\u2019t know the child and family\u2019s history; save your scorn for the unambiguous cases of rude ratbags. So for all this musing, what happened with my own family and son on Halloween?

{"date": "December 14, 2012", "body": "In  an opinion piece in the main national newspaper  here in New Zealand, Paul Little has a rant about the changing fads of diagnostic labels. He predicts that \u201cdepression\u201d will no longer be a condition by mid-century, then goes on to state: \u201c And now, Asperger syndrome turns out to have been, in many cases, a fancy name to describe people who are rude and can\u2019t be bothered to change their ways. The new edition of the psychiatric profession\u2019s bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, will not recognise Asperger syndrome as a condition. People showing behaviours formerly falling under this label will be seen either to have autism or to not have autism .\u201d In the piece, the writer shows no awareness of the fact that the autism label is itself being changed, and is likely to thereafter accommodate many of those who currently have an Asperger\u2019s diagnosis. He\u2019s also missed the relevance of the proposed introduction of \u201cSocial Communication Disorder,\u201d which would have otherwise being supposedly rich fodder for his attitude towards \u201crude people,\u201d and which is relevant to the changes to those with an autism spectrum diagnosis. Putting that aside, I want to ask a question: Why does hate speech get so easily shared by a national newspaper? How is it considered acceptable that someone can take a very large group of vulnerable people, and declare them merely to be intentionally rude people? The damage this does to these individuals can be profound. Not only does it further stigmatize this group of people, it perpetuates a pop-culture misunderstanding and goes further to claim that the misunderstanding has now being revealed as truth, when in fact it is very clear that the very people making the changes he so approves of, do  not  hold such a view as his and were not motivated by such a view in deciding to remove Asperger\u2019s. Even cursory research into the reason for the changes to the diagnostic criteria, would have made that clear to Mr Little. Is it true that some people claim to have Asperger\u2019s to get away with being rude, as he goes on to claim in that same piece? I have no doubt. Those people are just like him though: They have misunderstood Asperger\u2019s and are belittling the lived experiences and hardships of a people they clearly know very little about. Plenty of people pretend to have conditions they don\u2019t have, does that mean the condition was never real for others? Of course not, and yet the writer seems to use this as proof that Asperger\u2019s was always a farce (\u201cfor many\u201d anyway). I personally know of people with Asperger\u2019s who are polite  to a fault . This is because they are hyper-aware that they can misunderstand others and be misunderstood because of their challenges reading and reacting to social communication, so they over-compensate by always apologizing even when they\u2019ve done nothing wrong, and second-guessing their every word and action in an effort to not accidentally offend others. Some even hide themselves away, preferring not to personally interact with others, because they fear the mistakes they\u2019ll make. Is that what we think of as intentionally or indifferently rude people? Because  that\u2019s  the Asperger\u2019s I see everyday. Not all of those with Asperger\u2019s are like what I describe above, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re human beings with their own various pasts and experiences and preferences and making their own choices in life. Asperger\u2019s does not dictate personality and does not shape every aspect of who someone is: It\u2019s not as simple as \u201cAsperger\u2019s= rude.\u201d To imply it is, is both cruel and ignorant. I\u2019m all for free speech, but I\u2019m also all for people doing research and applying thought to a topic, before furthering stigma and hurt on a vulnerable group of people. Paul Little can say what he likes (apparently), and a major newspaper can share it with their readers, but so can I reply to point out the rather obvious and objective errors in such a piece, and so can you, because the piece allows comments. Feel free to let him know that the rudeness (and ignorance) on display, is all his own. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10852783"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/aspergers-a-fancy-name-to-describe-people-who-are-rude/", "title": "Asperger\u2019s: \u201cA fancy name to describe people who are\u00a0rude.\u201d"},
{"date": "November 1, 2012", "body": "(Continued from  Part One .) The night before Halloween, my son and I decided to give it a second chance, and headed off for a quick evening shop for Halloween supplies. We managed to piece together a wizard outfit from a witch\u2019s hat and a vampire cloak (which lead to some interesting questions from him about what a vampire was); there wasn\u2019t much left to choose from. I also picked up a squishy pumpkin decoration for our own front door, to let the local children know they were welcome to knock. The night arrived. I talked my son through the rules about how to knock. He wanted detailed rules about when he could ring the door-bell, how many times he could knock, and whether he could both ring and knock. He also wanted to know the precise number of seconds we had to wait at each door before moving on; initially he suggested 10 seconds. I said that would be fine. Then he suggested \u201cperhaps 20?\u201d I said probably too long. \u201cPerhaps 15?\u201d (This went on for a while). We discussed where he could knock; what to look out for to help make the right decision: Not to go houses that had signs out telling people to stay away, and could knock at houses which had out Halloween decorations. He wanted to know if we could knock on every door in the neighbourhood regardless of decorations, I told him that might be rude because they may have sleeping babies or don\u2019t like the noise or are busy or don\u2019t like Halloween. He understood that. (None of the other kids \u2013 or parents \u2013 in the neighbourhood seemed to consider this, which I\u2019ll come back to.) We also went through general manners (taking one candy unless they say otherwise, saying thank you). We were ready. (The string that tied the cape together, broke off the moment I went to put it on him, but a safety-pin later we were ready again!) I scouted the entire street \u2013 both sides all the way up and back \u2013 for a single house that had out Halloween decorations. Our house was the  only  one in the entire street. Yet while my son and I walked up and down the street figuring this sad fact out, we saw scores of children (some with their parents) knocking on every single door and asking for candy. I reconsidered my rule about only knocking on certain doors, but it was my son who refused that plan even though it would have likely meant more candy: He told me of his own accord that he didn\u2019t want to be rude. My autistic seven-year old deciding being polite was more important than getting more candy; seeing all these other adults and children being rude as he understood it, yet refusing to do the same because he didn\u2019t want to bother or upset people in our neighbourhood. I felt more than a touch of pride at that, and resolved to stick to our plan; whatever it took. What it took was getting in the car and driving around the surrounding residential streets. My son and I played look-out for any houses with decorations out, and when we spotted one I\u2019d quickly (but safely!) pull over and we\u2019d put his wizard\u2019s hat back on and unwrap his overly-long safety-pinned cape, get his Halloween bag out and make our way to each welcoming place. Because we were being so selective, every home we visited was over-joyed to see us (and ready with the candy of course). There was no knocking then waiting anxiously for no one to be home or to be rejected, it was an 100% success rate (well, almost 100% to be honest; we got the wrong house once down a multi-use drive-way, and I felt the resultant disappointment of no candy and guilt of disturbing the household. I was glad it only happened once). We found about one house per street, but there was a lot of fun in trying to spot the houses with decorations, and a fair bit of excitement knowing each time that we would be wanted and welcomed. By the time I called it a night, his lolly bag wasn\u2019t over-flowing, but it was sufficiently full of chocolates and candy to be called a success in that regard too. I had been worried about the sweets he\u2019d get that I wouldn\u2019t want him to get, and about him eating too many sweets in one sitting. But he didn\u2019t want about half of the lollies anyway (the overly chewy and overly hard ones). And he was happy to have the lollies over days instead of minutes. He even shared the unwanted sweets (and some of the wanted ones) with his parents. So what came of our mutual first-ever Halloween? Lessons in polite social interactions, with thank yous and holiday-appropriate greetings; the chance to feel part of an event celebrated by other children his age; increased confidence in going new places and talking to new people. But perhaps most amusingly and ironic of all, my son got the chance to think about and put into practice non-rude behaviour. The autistic child with the social and communication and sensory challenges, was the sweetest kid on the street that Halloween. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonyjcase/2916953201/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/the-difference-between-disability-and-rudeness-on-a-halloween-in-nz-part-two/", "title": "The Difference Between Disability and Rudeness, on a Halloween in NZ (Part\u00a0Two)."},
{"date": "October 4, 2012", "body": "My autistic son struggles with those very many idioms that people so effortlessly and often use. Where other children might learn the sayings through repeated usage, or not understand the sayings but find them nevertheless amusing, my son had a tendency to find them confusing and even upsetting. Literal language didn\u2019t come easy for him; figurative language is that much harder. There are lots of methods to try to teach our children how to confront these challenges. We can use computers and apps, verbal explanation, visuals, demonstration, etc. The book \u201cSuper Silly Sayings That Are Over Your head, \u201d by Catherine Snodgrass, is one method to try to teach the idea and examples of idioms. We bought it for our son many months ago, and it continues to be one of his much-loved books. So in the spirit of sharing our solutions to common problems experienced by autistic children \u2013 and then in turn faced by their parents \u2013 I\u2019m going to tell you a little about this resource. The book contains 42 idioms, 3 to a page. Each idiom is accompanied by the intended meaning and by two illustrations: One illustration of the literal meaning, and one of the intended meaning. Because the literal meanings of idioms are quite farcical, the pictures of those literal meanings can be quite amusing for the kids (my son very much enjoyed them). I think this served to release some of the tension and confusion around the very idea of idioms for him; taking something that he\u2019s found stressful and confusing in the past, and making light of it through silly pictures. There were many idioms in the book that are in very regular use around my son, and there were some common ones that didn\u2019t make it into the book. But because the book teaches the idea of an idiom through so many examples, it makes it easier to try to explain previously un-encountered idioms, by referencing back to the idea taught through those examples. My son even takes it upon himself sometimes to choose to use the idioms he\u2019s learnt through the book, which always makes him smile as he\u2019s reminded of how silly the literal meaning is. He gets real joy from knowing the intended meaning, and showing us that he knows how to use idioms. It brings his language more closely into normal language use too; so much of his language is unusual and highly literal, it\u2019s good to have a smattering of idioms in there to loosen it up a bit, to make his language issues less obvious in the process. We used this book with our son from the age of six, which felt appropriate. I can see it being useful for children older and younger too. (It\u2019s hard to suggest a strict age guideline for a book that is partly intended for those with developmental delays.) I would recommend it for those who notice their children struggling with this issue, and I can imagine it being an enjoyable resource for those who don\u2019t too, because of the educational and amusing nature of the book, and the at times quite delightful illustrations. Don\u2019t let idioms get you all bent out of shape. I\u2019m sure the book will leave you tickled pink and maybe even knock your socks off. It won\u2019t cost you an arm and a leg either. If you\u2019ve got alternative solutions to this challenge, or have your own views on this book, I\u2019m all ears, no need to button your lip. All of which are idioms included in the book. If you\u2019d like to know if a particular idiom is covered, just ask, I\u2019m happy to lend you a hand \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/supersilly_0.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/review-of-super-silly-sayings-a-book-of-idioms/", "title": "Review of \u201cSuper Silly Sayings,\u201d A Book of\u00a0Idioms."},

Maybe you feel I abused you when I was a child; pretending we were together when we weren\u2019t, just so I could get out of doing things I didn\u2019t want to do. Maybe I took you for granted in my early adult-hood, when you got in the way of other things I wanted to do. But since having a family, I realise how much you mean to me. You may think I abandoned you to be with my children; constantly parting from you so I could go to them when they cry or need the bathroom or need reassurance. But without you, I cannot give them the mother they deserve, or be the wife my husband needs. Loving them only makes me love you more. I\u2019ve been talking to my eldest son about you lately: Trying to explain the difference between you and death, because he wanted to know. And it\u2019s only made me appreciate you even more. Death is so greedy and it lies; it pretends to be you but it refuses to let go. You though, always let us go back to other things we treasure, refreshed and ready to enjoy them again. Without you, my brain is at half-speed, and my negative emotions are too intense. I\u2019m too angry, too sad, too impatient. There\u2019s a fuzzy grey film over my life that distorts everything. After we\u2019ve spent time together, the film lifts and reality \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 shines through. So when I meet or hear from other people who don\u2019t spend much time with you either, I try extra hard to be patient and understanding with them, and I hope others will do the same with me. And finally, dear sleep, it is only because I am missing you so much that I would ever even consider anthropomorphizing you in a letter, on a blog that\u2019s meant to be about my autistic son. I wait anxiously until we can be together again.

{"date": "May 10, 2011", "body": "\n Image by djniks via Flickr \n My husband and I have to be particularly careful about what we teach our son, because if he takes the wrong meaning or application, it can take literally months to unteach or reteach it. The most recent example is something that drives me crazy every single day: The simple word, \u201csorry.\u201d We initially taught the concept to our son in the context of apologizing after he\u2019d done something naughty; he had to say \u201csorry\u201d before he could come back downstairs after having \u201ctime-out\u201d in his bedroom. He learnt very quickly that it made us happy to hear him say sorry, we\u2019d reinforce the importance and function of the word with smiles and hugs, \u201cthat\u2019s OK, let\u2019s go back downstairs.\u201d To show him that adults say sorry too, and to further illustrate its application, I made a point of using the word when I made a mistake around him: \u201cSorry I knocked your pen off the table hon, here you go.\u201d So he started to notice that it wasn\u2019t just for when someone has been very naughty and sent to their room. To clarify I spelt it out to him in what I thought was careful terms. I wanted to make sure he understood that sometimes we have to apologise for unintentional injuries, I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t use the word \u201cbad\u201d since that implies moral fault, so I said something like this: \u201cIf you do something wrong on accident or on purpose, then you say sorry.\u201d Boy was  that  a big mistake. He started \u2013 and continues \u2013 to say sorry for the slightest infringement. If he asks a question and the answer is \u201cno\u201d (even if he\u2019s just asking whether he\u2019s correct about what something is called), then he\u2019ll say sorry. If he makes an error when he\u2019s drawing (maybe the line goes further than where he\u2019d intended it to stop), he\u2019ll say sorry. If he\u2019s in the other room and he\u2019s done something that we can\u2019t even see and hasn\u2019t caused anyone or anything any harm, he\u2019ll run up to us and say sorry. And he doesn\u2019t just say it once. He says it quickly over and over, until he is correctly acknowledged and reassured. The replying words have to be \u201cthat\u2019s OK\u201d. Variations like \u201calright\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be sorry\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s no problem honey\u201d, don\u2019t work; he\u2019ll just keep saying sorry until he gets the right response. Sometimes I can\u2019t respond fast enough for him, because I\u2019m in the other room or busy with the baby, sometimes the quickness and \u201ccorrectness\u201d of my response makes no difference though. And the more he says \u201csorry\u201d, the more upset he gets. He\u2019ll even drive himself to tears and screaming as he endlessly repeats the word, at times ending in the sort of meltdown where his senses seem to shut down and nothing we do or say will make him calm and happy again. I\u2019ve tried to tell him he only has to say \u201csorry\u201d once, to try to stop him getting so worked up with its repetition. But then he\u2019ll say sorry for saying sorry more than once, or he\u2019ll sit there getting frustrated and start silently crying (and then not so silently screaming the word anyway) if he tries to control the urge to say sorry endlessly. I\u2019ve also tried to unteach this very broad usage of sorry. I decided to introduce concrete instances of when he should say sorry. I told him to only say sorry if he accidentally or purposefully hurts someone or breaks something. He thought about that for a while, then added to it of his own accord; he said something along the lines of \u201conly say sorry for hurting people, breaking, and throwing.\u201d I said that was fine, and repeated back the three categories to him, hoping we\u2019d made a break-through. Later I had to add \u201cshouting\u201d to the list of naughty things that deserve a sorry (shouting in a house with a sleeping baby is a rather big deal). Even though he now knows he\u2019s only meant to say sorry once, and what he\u2019s meant to say it for, he still repeatedly says \u201csorry\u201d for a huge array of issues, and gets all worked up towards the point of meltdown about it. I\u2019m hoping that with enough repetition about how to use \u201csorry\u201d, that it will sink in and the problem will fade in time. I\u2019ve coped with similarly maddening behaviour many times with him. Saying \u201csorry\u201d a lot might sound like a minor problem, but when it leads to his tears, screaming and meltdowns, when there was nothing to be sorry about in the first place \u2013 and when it can happen every few minutes and at least every half-hour of the day \u2013 it is highly intrusive to just getting on with life. Being a parent of an autistic child requires immense patience, detailed observations and problem-solving skills, to figure out what is setting your child off and how to fix it. In my experience, there are always multiple issues that the child is struggling with at any point in their life, so you also have to pick and choose which ones to work on \u2013 working on them all at once is usually far too much for the child and parent to cope with, and can undercut the effectiveness compared to focusing on a couple at a time. We\u2019ve overcome him not letting any strangers in the house; not letting me talk to anyone under any circumstances; biting toys to the point of making his lips bleed; hitting his head against the wall at night so that he got two balding patches; having meltdowns whenever he had to get out of a car at a new location, and so many countless other behaviours that it makes me teary eyed to even recall them. So we\u2019ll overcome this too. Just one more problem, one day at a time, and eventually, one sorry at a time and at the right times. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/15564167@N00/3647007791"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/a-sad-story-of-sorries/", "title": "A Sad Story of\u00a0Sorries"},
{"date": "April 1, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n There\u2019s been a lot of controversy about the worth of World Autism Awareness Day (and month), especially amongst those of us who raise awareness about autism everyday already by speaking and writing about it. I agree with a lot of those observations and concerns, so I\u2019m going to take my own spin on the day: To my son. I am aware you have autism. I am aware that you have beautiful big brown eyes too. I am aware that these are parts of you, not your whole. If I could take away all your hardships, I would. But in this I am no different than any other mother. I also know that those challenges and hardships are shaping and defining you, and that you turning out to be the most amazing little boy. You are not aware of how hard I fight for you, how hard it has been for me, still is for me, and might always be for me. But that is not for you to know. All you need to be aware of is how much and how deeply and unconditionally, I love you. Will always love you. One day a year, the world\u2019s attention will focus on the part of you with a controversial label. You will grow up hearing the word \u201cautism\u201d, and one day you\u2019ll ask me what that means. And though I don\u2019t know yet what I will reply, I will smile, because you  can  ask me. Because I was once told there was a good chance you would never speak in sentences, and you proved them wrong. The more the world becomes aware of autism \u2013 the more money and time and effort is poured into unlocking its secrets and finding new ways to help you make your way in this world (and help the world to make way for you) \u2013 the better your life will become. You are not aware of all the research and passion dedicated to finding ways to improve your life. People are fighting for the best future you can have. I am fighting for the best future you can have. And if all a \u201cworld autism awareness day\u201d does is add one more person to that fight, or make one less person ignorantly prejudiced against you, then that\u2019s good enough for me. You deserve every happiness, and I will do whatever I can to make the world a wonderful place for you to be. Love, Mum. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-autism-awareness-day.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/i-am-aware/", "title": "I am aware"},
{"date": "May 6, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Christolakis via Flickr \n I recently came across something called the \u201cBroad Autism Phenotype\u201d (BAP) test . My natural inclination with online autism tests, is to be sceptical and weary, particularly because I\u2019d come across other online tests that made everyone come out as \u201ca little bit autistic\u201d: Autism is a serious and real condition, and those sorts of tests seemed to trivialize both its seriousness and reality. I do see some worth in such tests, in as far as they can help identify whether someone should perhaps seek a confirmed diagnosis from a professional, but I would never rely on such a test for a diagnosis (no one should). The BAP test though,  comes from scientific literature , and has a specific aim: To identify \u201cthe phenotypic expression of the genetic liability to autism, in non-autistic relatives of autistic individuals.\u201d Being such a relative, and having no confirmed (but suspected) family history of autistic-type behaviour, that intrigued me. So I took the test, which  you can find here  (try to ignore the \u201cOK Cupid\u201d bit, yes I know it\u2019s off-putting and makes it hard to take it seriously). And this was my result: \n Rigid Personality \n You scored 59 aloof, 96 rigid and 45 pragmatic \n You scored above the cutoff for rigid personality, which means you probably don\u2019t really like changes, especially unexpected ones. You may have a daily routine that you seldom vary, dislike going to unfamiliar places or meeting new people, or have specific rules about how you do things which you refuse to change. However, you are not particularly aloof, and probably don\u2019t have much trouble with social communication. You are probably on the broader autistic phenotype. \n \n All previous tests looking for traits of autism or autism itself, have indicated me to be nowhere near the spectrum; yet what this test was looking for, and what it concluded, made sense to me: Yes, I am very \u201crigid\u201d, and my rigidity can make life very difficult and stressful for me and those around me. I\u2019ve often thought it was rather beyond the \u201cnorm\u201d. I have coping strategies for the fact that I hate change and new things; I plan everything out carefully in advance, I do dummy-runs of events, and I allow a lot of extra time for things to get done so I don\u2019t have to make any quick decisions without time to adjust. I always have numerous contingency plans so even when things don\u2019t go as planned, I still have a plan! If someone proposes a change or something new to me, my gut reaction is to always say \u201cno\u201d, so I actively remind myself to not give an answer straight away; give myself time to adjust and think it through first. This aspect of my personality has gotten worse since having my autistic son, because now that change and newness upsets him too, it pushes my own anxiety levels even higher in response: I try to avoid \u201cthe unexpected\u201d on behalf of us both. There is the upside though that my personal awareness and understanding of these anxieties, has helped me to advocate for him and explain his behaviours to others. It also helps me to effectively implement methods that aim to lower his own anxieties around change. Still, for all these insights and seeming truisms, I wanted to test friends and relatives to see if the test matched them too, and indeed to see if it revealed a family history. The test had performed well at picking up autistic people  over at this other blog post , and I was very impressed with how well it performed with my friends and family too. It picked out those friends of mine who were diagnosed with autism already, and those who already knew they sat close to the edges of the spectrum. It turned out what I perceive as correct responses about the neurotypicalness of certain friends and family members. And then we get to the bits that really got to me. My husband, who also had never came off as having autistic traits on previous online tests, was also neurotypical on this test. In turn, I think I can rather reliably say that the rest of his immediate family (brothers, parents etc) are very unlikely to get a positive response on the BAP test. My own siblings came off as neurotypical. But my parent, got over the cut-off for both \u201crigidity\u201d and \u201caloofness\u201d on the test (though neither of those are words I would have ever applied to their personality \u2013 the terms need to be taken within the context of the test). The test concluded my parent was \u201cprobably either on the broader autistic phenotype or actually autistic.\u201d So, considering the test is trying to identify signs of genetic predisposition to autism, as evidenced in non-autistic relatives, it seems to have identified that the genetics have carried down the family line from my parent, to me, to my child. Anecdotally, there\u2019s good reason to think that it travels further up the family tree in that same direction too. So how do I feel about all of this? Rather positively actually. I feel like I have a clue to understanding where my son\u2019s autism comes from. And it doesn\u2019t feel like playing the blame-game either. I don\u2019t blame my parent, or myself. I know genetics is complicated, and for all I know there\u2019s something in my husband that triggered what would have otherwise remained dormant, hell, who knows. Even if it was \u201cmy fault\u201d \u2013 even if it is my genetics \u2013 that doesn\u2019t upset me. My son is who he is, and having a hint at the \u201creason\u201d for it, doesn\u2019t change him, or my attitude towards him, in any way. It\u2019s just interesting to know. It does suggest that my son\u2019s specific autism was not the result of some random genetic mutation (as some autism apparently is), but that it was something already in my genes. That apparently impacts the likelihood of any future children having autism. But we always knew there was a higher chance of our future offspring having autism anyway, and we still had our second son knowing those risks. And I am so incredibly glad we took that risk; I love both my sons beyond measure. The information makes me think differently about my own aversion to change and newness. I have always battled with that aspect of myself; variously fighting it, trying to deny it, or being miserable about it. But now I view it as perhaps just a part of me, to be accepted and managed as best I can, through the sorts of methods I already use (much as autism is a part of my son, that we also manage in a variety of ways). Not as something I must stamp out and battle with. I can even see it as a strength \u2013 it is a large part of the reason I am almost always on time to events, and am well prepared for things like exams and jobs. It\u2019s a nuisance at times, sure, but many things in life are; it\u2019s our attitudes towards, and management of, those nuisances, which can make all the difference. So there we have it. Maybe I fit within the broad autism phenotype. Maybe I have a family history of people who do the same. Or maybe its just another online test that tells stories rather than truths. Either way, it opened my eyes to certain possibilities and understandings, and was a positive experience for me. I\u2019d love to hear your own thoughts about, and experiences with the test too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/43052603@N00/3332941114", "http://lifeintheaspiehouse.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/bippity-bappity-boo/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17146701&ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.okcupid.com/tests/the-broad-autism-phenotype-test", "http://lifeintheaspiehouse.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/taking-the-test/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/lessons-learnt-from-taking-the-broad-autism-phenotype-test/", "title": "Lessons learnt from taking the Broad Autism Phenotype\u00a0Test"},
{"date": "May 11, 2011", "body": "There is a local story that is causing a lot of discussion about bad parenting, special needs, and nutrition. There is a 20-year-old man, who has essentially only eaten KFC skin, and more recently also fish batter, for the past 12 years (since he was eight years old). He has cerebral palsy and autistic-like traits, as a result of oxygen deprivation at birth. He functions around the age of a two or three-year old. His family has taken their story to the press. They are asking for advice from people who have been through similar situations, or professionals who might have new advice. You can  watch the full video here . Please do watch it all, it\u2019s less than seven minutes long. If it won\u2019t let you view it (I\u2019ve heard that some people have struggled to view it), please let me know and I\u2019ll add more details to this post. I just thought it best to let the parents tell it in their own words as much as possible. I am still searching for a version that I can embed to this post. The main reason for me sharing this, is a plea to my autism community to offer up help to this family if you can. Like me, many of you have struggled with the eating difficulties that come with autistic children. You\u2019ll need to watch the video to understand the challenges, what they\u2019ve tried so far, and indeed to fully appreciate the desperation these loving parents have to find a solution to this harmful problem. I\u2019m also sharing this story with a deep sadness, having seen the horribly predictable reactions of the public to their plight. On  this discussion thread alone , you\u2019ll see people attacking their parenting, saying intellectual disability is no excuse, even saying that what is happening is a form of child abuse. These parents take the drastic step of reaching out publicly for help \u2013 exposing their story and themselves \u2013 and they get attacked for their honesty. It\u2019s those sorts of reactions that stop parents asking for help. And it\u2019s those sorts of reactions that drive home how important autism awareness is, and how far we have to go. So please, if you can help this family with new advice, or support them somehow through this problem and the attacks they\u2019re currently suffering, then do. If you want to email the program that ran the story to get your message to the family, their email is  closeup @tvnz.co.nz. If you want to try to talk to the dad directly \u2013 on the off-chance he\u2019s still monitoring the thread \u2013 he has popped his head in on  the discussion happening here . He\u2019s posting under the name  harepeka . Please do share this story with others who might be able to help too.

The blog I\u2019d discovered was so surreal, that I initially thought it was a joke. (If you want to discover what the blog was, you\u2019ll just have to do the test \u2013 one of the results reveals it). After further research, I realised it was for real, and it got me thinking about the huge diversity in attitudes that you come across as an autism blogger. Over the months since I started blogging, I have noticed various trends about attitudes towards autism amongst bloggers, and decided to put them together in this quiz. You can find and take the quiz, here. The particularly interesting aspect of this whole exercise, was that I honestly had no firm idea of what attitude category I would fall within. I wrote and published the quiz without knowing my result. So I was particularly amused when my result was this: Autism Blogger Attitude Quiz \n Your Result: Meta-Blogger \n Chances are you\u2019ve been blogging about autism for a while. You understand that a lot of the debates within the autism community turn on definitions and subtle nuances. You possibly think a sense of community is more important than having answers to all the questions. You also probably think I am horrid for creating this quiz in the first place. \n Result Breakdown: \n 80% Meta-Blogger \n 78% Moderate \n 60% Curebie \n 50% Neurodiverse If you decide to take the test, let me know either in the comments of this post, or in this poll, what your result was: Take Our Poll And what you thought of the quiz: Take Our Poll Please note that there was no ill intent involved in creating this quiz.

{"date": "April 20, 2011", "body": "\u201cLoving Lampposts\u201d is a documentary about autism, specifically about attitudes towards autism, and the neurodiversity movement. It includes commentary about various therapies for autism, and interviews with some of the central personalities of the autism world, while telling the personal stories of both autistic adults and parents of autistic children. In some ways it tries to cover too much ground, brushing lightly over some central issues and debates. But in as far as it sets out to introduce you to the neurodiversity movement, it succeeds. After watching it I do have a much better understanding of the neurodiversity movement and their attitude towards autism. I was not convinced though that the movement is in the best interests of autistic people, and found some of their examples and arguments quite weak, but there was plenty to seriously think about. I was interested to see the disability versus difference debate about attitudes towards autism, rephrased as disability  and  difference within each autistic person, which strikes me as a much stronger version of the neurodiversity view than the one I\u2019d previously encountered. There were many times during watching it that my husband and I would stop the film to talk about what we\u2019d just seen. Sometimes that was to say we agreed or disagreed with what was just said, and discuss it further, but there were also those wonderful moments when I had to stop it and say \u201cthat\u2019s just like watching our son\u201d. Autism varies so much, that it was quite special to see another child so very similar to our own in speech and behaviour. I could smile in recognition and understanding, and got that \u201cwe are not alone\u201d feeling which is always so reassuring and comforting. I also found it particularly interesting, and also rather upsetting, to see and hear directly from autistic adults. Upsetting, because it reminds me of the life-long challenges my son faces, and that he\u2019s always going to need extra help and support, and it worries me whether society and other family members will be willing and able to provide that to him. I understand these challenges at an intellectual level, but to  see  it in other people, really brings it home. There are extended interviews included on the DVD, which were worth watching for a number of reasons. There was extra information and expansion of ideas in those interviews, but there was also more footage of conversations with adults with autism, which changed the perception I had received of them through the film proper. It did in fact strengthen my view that autism is much more disability than it is mere difference (which is just to say, they face more challenges and need more support than someone who doesn\u2019t have autism. Never forgetting of course the broadness of the spectrum, and the different ways and severity with which autism impacts on an individual\u2019s life.) Perhaps the most beautiful part of the film to me, is the very start, with the little boy and his lampposts. It brought me to tears the first time I saw that segment online, and it still lifts my heart the twice I\u2019ve watched it on the DVD. It always reminds me of my son\u2019s passionate love for clocks and clock towers, but beyond that it is also such a beautiful image of the innocence and specialness (for lack of a better word) of autistic children.

{"date": "April 21, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Reder via Flickr \n At the end of my son\u2019s first term of school, I am now in a position to reflect on whether we made the right decision to send him to a special needs school, instead of a mainstream one. I\u2019ve also now attended his first IEP (individual education plan) meeting, with his head teacher, and three main therapists, so I know how they think it\u2019s going too. (Those three main therapists \u2013 all provided by the school \u2013 are a speech therapist, occupational therapist, and physiotherapist who also deals with his orthotics.) I had heard so many depressing stories from other parents about what it was like to have their autistic children in mainstream schools; always fighting for their child to be understood and supported, and having to constantly visit the school to deal with what the school perceived as problem behaviours. But that it was for the best since their child was \u201cintegrated\u201d with \u201cnormal\u201d children. I\u2019d heard the opinions that special needs school were just places that difficult kids were dumped, like a babysitting service that wouldn\u2019t challenge the child, where my child would undoubtedly pick up bad behaviours from other special needs children. I don\u2019t have to spend my time at my son\u2019s school fighting for his future; his teachers and therapists are as passionate as I am about supporting and advancing him. I don\u2019t have to endlessly explain his behaviours and challenges; they understand some of them even better than I do (and believe me, that really is saying something). They are not a \u201cbabysitting service\u201d; they are teaching him maths, spelling, swimming, dance, art, basic life skills like cooking, you name it, it\u2019s all there and more, and we\u2019re seeing the flow-on benefits and skills at home. His classroom is inviting and full of visual guides to help the students through their day; a lovely place for him to spend each school day. But he doesn\u2019t just stay in the classroom; they take the children on field trips to shops and to watch plays and to parks too (if you have an autistic child, you know what a challenge that must be, but they do it and do it well!). He loves school, so much that he runs to his classroom every morning with a huge smile on his face, and hops into his chair eager to start the day. I am breathtakingly happy: With my son\u2019s progress, with the school itself, with his teachers\u2019 and therapists\u2019 attitudes and understanding of his challenges and his strengths. And he\u2019s happy too. I wouldn\u2019t swap our choice for anything, and I would fight tooth and nail to keep him there. But I don\u2019t have to, because he has the right to go there until he is 21 if he needs to and if we want him to. I\u2019ve learnt that he\u2019s excelling at maths, to the point that they\u2019re going to introduce him to the mainstream maths curriculum slowly to see how he takes to it. I\u2019ve learnt that he\u2019s particularly struggling with his fine motor skills, and is performing in the bottom 2% for his age for \u201cvisual motor integration\u201d; that it\u2019s affecting his progress in writing and self-care skills. From talking to his teachers I now better understand how he learns, and indeed how he hides his learning deficits. They\u2019ve done in-depth reports detailing where he is developmentally, and plan to do more to further complete the picture of where he is and how we need to help him get where he\u2019s going. I trust them with him, with his happiness, his safety, and his learning. It feels so intensely wonderful to trust other people with my child, in a way I never felt I could before. We have a wonderful relationship with the teachers and therapists; they recognise the hard work we put in for the past five years, and the ongoing work at home. And we of course recognise the amazing dedication they have to our son. They\u2019ve surpassed all my expectations for a special needs school (a public one at that), and they\u2019re helping my son to surpass my expectations for his long-term prospects too. It\u2019s a long road ahead, with no guarantees, but I\u2019m glad they\u2019ll be with us on that journey. *** If you\u2019re interested in further reading about the choice between a special needs and mainstream school for an autistic child, see two of my previous posts: \u201c Socialization as a reason to mainstream special needs children \u201d and \u201c A Right to the Wrong Education? \u201c. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/77526889@N00/1797229871"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/reflection-on-his-first-term-at-a-special-needs-school/", "title": "Reflection on his first term at a special needs\u00a0school"},
{"date": "April 22, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n As I read \u201cAutism\u2019s False Prophets\u201d, I found myself wishing that I\u2019d read it years ago, so I could have been better informed and prepared to deal with all the misinformation about autism, and the dangerous therapies offered for autistic children. After receiving the diagnosis of my son\u2019s autism, I was swamped with theories about causes, cures, and who\u2019s to blame. I went through a lot of stress and guilt that reading this book would have significantly lessened. It\u2019s arguable that these sorts of books \u2013 dealing with controversies \u2013 are best left until after you\u2019ve come to terms with the diagnosis and have got therapies underway; but considering how seriously and quickly a parent can get side-tracked by the abundant misinformation out there, I really do think the sooner a parent reads this, the better and easier their journey with autism will be. So what misinformation does the book deal with then? It focuses the most on the autism/vaccine controversy, which is hardly surprising considering the author\u2019s expertise and experience in the field of vaccines. The autism/vaccine controversy is no small part of the autism story, it\u2019s far more important than I had realised: A large number of the disproven and dangerous therapies offered to autistic children, stem from a belief that autism is caused by the \u201ctoxins\u201d and consequences of receiving vaccines. When you better understand the flaws in the autism/vaccine link, you\u2019re better equipped to identify and steer clear of the therapies that flow from that error. Offit deals with other disproven therapies too, such as facilitated communication, which I\u2019d read a lot about previously but learnt even more about in this book. \u201cAutism\u2019s False Prophets\u201d is about more than just vaccines and therapies. It also discusses the nature of scientific enquiry and the search for truth in general. Offit explores issues of how media and society interacts with scientific findings and stories. I found what he had to say about \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d, quite interesting and enlightening. The part of the book I enjoyed the most though, was the legal discussion; particularly the stories of how the courts and law suits have played their part in the autism/vaccine saga. Perhaps it is because of my legal background that I found that so intriguing, but I suspect anyone would be interested to see what hidden and overt impacts legal cases have had on the recent history of autism research. Despite the huge number of names, positions and organisations that Offit deals with throughout the book, I managed to keep track of who was who, which is testament to his writing. I wouldn\u2019t say his writing style was particularly excellent (at times the book felt disjointed), but he goes out of his way to make difficult concepts and complicated stories, accessible to the average reader. The edition I read was the paperback 2010 edition, which is relevant for two reasons: The first is that it contained a new preface, where (amongst other things) he acknowledges the huge number of well-informed parents who have not been sucked in by, or acted upon, all the misinformation about autism \u2013 a majority that he admits under-estimating when he first wrote the book. The second reason the paperback edition matters, is because Offit donates all royalties from the sale of it to the Autism Science Foundation. So if you haven\u2019t bought this book already, now\u2019s a great time to get around to it. \u201cAutism\u2019s False Prophets\u201d is well researched (with references), very thoughtful and thought-provoking. It will make you angry, make you sad, make you gasp and quite possibly even laugh at the insanity of some of what you read. Most importantly, it will leave you better informed and better able to deal with the great questions of autism. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism%27s_False_Prophets_frontcover.jpeg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/review-of-paul-offits-autisms-false-prophets/", "title": "Review of Paul Offit\u2019s \u201cAutism\u2019s False\u00a0Prophets\u201d"},
{"date": "April 15, 2011", "body": "\n Image by natalia & gabriel via Flickr \n As you\u2019re no doubt aware, an ad hominem attack is fallacious where the person making the argument is attacked instead of the argument itself. When addressing an argument, you need to deal with the premises and logic that lead to the conclusion, not the  person  presenting those premises and logic. However, if one of the premises is an appeal to authority (\u201cJoe is a scientific expert, and Joe says this scientific proposition is true, therefore it is true\u201d) then an ad hominem attack can be justified because it is attacking one of the premises (Joe\u2019s authority). Again though, the relevant aspect of the authority must be attacked \u2013 you could attack Joe\u2019s scientific expertise, but attacking his marital status would be irrelevant. This brings me to a very common attack made on autistic people, when they express a positive opinion about autism. A classic example can be seen in the particularly controversial  Amanda Baggs , who does not see autism is an inherently negative thing \u2013 rather as a difference \u2013 despite it having a severe impact on her daily life. You can see her most well-known video on  Youtube here . There are a lot of ways one can attack her opinions and attitudes towards autism. One of the more extreme ways is to attack the idea that she even has autism: To attack the diagnosis. This attack is potentially valid, because she purports to speak from experience, so if you can attack the experience aspect of her \u201cargument\u201d, then the ad hominem is going to the appeal to authority, and so is not (inherently at least) fallacious. However, unless you can definitely disprove someone\u2019s diagnosis of autism (which is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible), then attacking the diagnosis is not a good or worthwhile argument. (Although I must say, some people have done a  remarkably intensive job  of trying to prove Amanda Baggs doesn\u2019t have autism.) It is also a particularly cruel attack; denying someone\u2019s life experiences, and calling them a liar who is harming genuinely afflicted people, is rather extreme. It is always going to be a better approach to deal with the other premises and logic that make up their argument. (For example, attacking the choice to live off government assistance and other people\u2019s daily help while \u201csinking into autism\u201d, instead of working towards the ability to live independently as much as possible.) This style of attack \u2013 attacking the diagnosis instead of the argument \u2013 is also commonly used against people with Aspergers or high functioning autism, especially when they argue that autism is \u201cdifference\u201d rather than \u201cdisability\u201d (you\u2019ll find plenty of examples in the comments sections of blogs about autism). The attack often takes one of two forms. Either \u201cyou don\u2019t really have autism\u201d or \u201cAspergers isn\u2019t really autism\u201d (therefore you can\u2019t speak on behalf of autistic people who are genuinely suffering). The first of those attacks, as mentioned previously, is difficult or impossible to prove, and the second is quite simply false (and is going to be \u201ceven more\u201d false if /when the  new diagnostic criteria get rid of the term Aspergers altogether, folding it into the word \u201cautism\u201d ). When people speak from their own experience of autism, and the opinions they share about autism don\u2019t match our own, the better starting point is to remind such people (and ourselves) that autism is a spectrum disorder, with enormous variations in quality of life and autism\u2019s impact on their lives. Yes, autism can affect how the world is interacted with and understood in some very similar ways across the entirety of the spectrum, but how big an impact that has on an individual\u2019s life, and whether it affects what they personally choose to do with their life, still differs. One person on the spectrum simply cannot speak for all people on the spectrum, because of such individual differences. Their personal experiences though can provide insights, understanding, awareness. These debates about one person with a disability trying to speak on behalf of all people with that disability, are not unique to the autism community. The attack on the word \u201cdisability\u201d \u2013 preferring to refer to it as \u201cdifference\u201d \u2013 is also common. A good example is the ongoing debate within the deaf community, where some  attack others for encouraging and using cochlear implants that allow people in their community to hear better . There will always be debates about whether something is a disability or a difference, with one side saying the other is unenlightened and trying to murder-by-cure, with the other side fighting back just as strongly for the freedom, independence, and quality of life that is otherwise restricted by the condition. We need to accept the presence of that ongoing dialogue, and be open to the range of voices who want to add to it \u2013 whether speaking as a person with autism, or indeed a person without autism (not having autism doesn\u2019t mean your opinions and insights about autism are invalid or irrelevant either). It\u2019s hard not to be emotional when debating autism, especially when children and their futures are involved. When people get emotional, they resort to ad hominems very quickly. And ad hominem attacks usually feed return ad hominem attacks. It can get ugly pretty quickly. These debates are important though. Trying to focus on the structure of the arguments put forward \u2013 the premises, the logic \u2013 is the respectful, and stronger, approach. Being aware of the fact you\u2019re making an ad hominem attack \u2013 and understanding when such an attack is actually justified (because yes, it sometimes is) \u2013 is a good starting point. *** Please note that the point of this piece is not to attack Amanda Baggs, or the deaf community, or indeed any one  other  than those who wrongfully use ad hominem attacks in debates about disabilities versus difference. My primary aim is to talk about the use and misuse of ad hominem. The examples I use are just that \u2013 examples \u2013 from what I\u2019ve encountered over the years.

{"date": "April 11, 2011", "body": "\n Image by wellcome images via Flickr \n There are plenty of theories as to why autism numbers have sky-rocketed over the past few decades. Opinions fall into two broad categories: Either the increase in autism is real (usually placing the cause on environmental factors such as toxins and vaccines), or the increase is largely one of changes in diagnosis (due to such things as broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness). One of the possible factors increasing diagnosed numbers, is misdiagnosis \u2013 particularly over-diagnosis. Misdiagnosis could be due to diagnosis by those without credentials (such as self-diagnosis by lay-people), but misdiagnosis can also be by those with the correct credentials (such as developmental pediatricians). I\u2019m going to share a story about an example of the latter. I want you to help me make sense of it. There is a particular doctor who is well-known in the local autism community, for being the \u201cgo-to\u201d guy when you can\u2019t get anyone else to confirm that your child has autism. (Hear alarm bells going off already?) I\u2019ve personally heard and seen his name recommended to others in that capacity. It should not be surprising then that I recently came across a very confused and upset parent, who was told by this doctor that her son has autism, when she sees no convincing evidence of it in her son at all. She\u2019s attended seminars and such like after the diagnosis, and though all the other parents around her showed agreement and recognition of the autistic traits spoken of, in their own children, she found no such recognition about her own son. Needless to say, she\u2019s decided to seek a second opinion (and on her description of her son\u2019s behaviour, I think that is a wise course of action). This doctor has also apparently shared the opinion that all gifted children have  Aspergers, so if you were to take your gifted child to him, chances are  pretty good you\u2019re walking out of there with a diagnosis of autism too. I\u2019ve seen this doctor particularly recommended to people who were keen to get government paid financial assistance for their difficult child. This same doctor is also known for being a bit too fond of medicating children, where other pediatricians are far more reluctant to fall back on medicating the young. He\u2019s not cheap either, if you don\u2019t approach him through the public system. You\u2019re looking at almost $400 for an hour session, which is all he requires to make a diagnosis. (I should perhaps add that my own son\u2019s pediatrician only saw him for an hour before making a diagnosis, but my son had classic autism, and it was an easy and obvious diagnosis for every professional he has interacted with. If his autism was less severe at the time of diagnosis, I would have expected longer or multiple sessions. And his pediatrician has seen him many occasions since then too of course.) All of this is hearsay (even though I\u2019m reading these things on multiple local forums, and his name and reputation is well-known in the autism community). From what I can see, he is qualified and respected in his field, though I admit that I wouldn\u2019t know where to look to find evidence that he wasn\u2019t. I do not know whether there are any checks and balances on over-diagnoses either \u2013 perhaps there are and he has not being found to be over-diagnosing via those systems, I just don\u2019t know. And so I\u2019m not sharing his name or his practice. But I am nevertheless sharing this story, because I think it raises some interesting and important talking points. One such point is the question of  under -diagnosis. There is absolutely no doubt that many people who do have autism, are going undiagnosed, or wrongly diagnosed \u2013 there are an abundance of such stories and experiences splashed across the net, and I\u2019ve seen it myself more than once. Maybe this doctor is just receiving the tougher fringe cases of autism \u2013 the ones  missed by all those other practitioners who couldn\u2019t give the parents  the answers they needed. If he is just keenly aware of autism, and sees it in people in its less obvious forms, is he perhaps revolutionary in his own understanding and perception of how widespread autism is? Should he therefore be seen as a hero, rather than a villain (a villain for confusing, upsetting and misleading parents, and for helping people to get scarce financial assistance when legitimate cases are struggling to get their \u201cpiece of the pie\u201d). Another question is whether there is anything wrong with him helping parents to get that financial assistance? If he sees worthy and needy parents, and he knows how to work the system to get them the support that he sees them in need of, then he is arguably a hero for cutting through the red tape for them (I should add that he does work in one of the poorer areas of the city). My concerns here go beyond rorting the system, and misleading parents. Overdiagnosis also feeds opinions like  those of Michael Savage  and  Denis Leary .  That is, that we\u2019re seeing huge numbers of  people diagnosed as autistic, who aren\u2019t really autistic; who just have  parents seeking to place the blame for bad parenting elsewhere, and  who want the extra money and resources that the government provides to families with diagnosed children. My instinct is to see this doctor as a man exploiting desperate parents, for the money that comes with a diagnosis (either being paid by them directly or by the State which pays for their visits). It\u2019s hard not to be cynical when you hear that he supposedly thinks all gifted children have Aspergers. But why would he risk his practice and reputation for the sake of more patients (and money)? Well it\u2019s hardly inconceivable that a doctor would do such things ( recent local news story as case in point ). So with limited information, but plenty of clues to \u201csomething\u201d going on, I put it to you: If (and that is a  big  \u201cif\u201d) this doctor really is over-diagnosing autism, does that make him a hero, or a villain? If he is over-diagnosing, is he just a cog in the wheel of a messed up system that makes it too hard to get support, or is he part of the problem itself? \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mediamatters.org/research/200807170005", "http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/famecrawler/archive/2008/10/15/denis-leary-austism-means-your-kid-is-stupid-and-lazy.aspx", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10717639"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/when-a-doctor-over-diagnoses-autism/", "title": "When a doctor over-diagnoses\u00a0autism"},
{"date": "April 26, 2011", "body": "Before Autism Awareness Month draws to a close, I wanted to open my blog to the voice of someone who is living with autism. I am a mother of a child with autism, but I do not have autism myself, and so I rely on talking to people like Clara to open my mind to how the world looks from that other perspective. Clara is not only a very kind and beautiful friend, she is also a talented artist \u2013 the art at the end of the post is by her. Without further ado, I now pass this post over to her to share her message: ***** Greetings, awesome people of awesomeness! ^_^ My name is Clara, I am nineteen years old, and I have a form of autism called Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, which is on a high functioning part of the spectrum. Linda has kindly allowed me to ninja her blog for a post to talk to you guys, which is awesome and lovely of her, so I am going to try and tell you guys about my life as an adult with autism. (Well, mostly adult.) \ud83d\ude00 Clara Unlike many children, although I displayed \u201csymptoms\u201d of autism through my childhood (such as learning to walk late, and hitting my head on the wall because I was angry) I was not diagnosed until I was fourteen. My mum says that through my childhood years, I watched people carefully and learned from their behaviour and used it as my own. I have what she calls a \u201cparty face\u201d \u2013 a learned set of behaviour that I used when interacting with people that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with or didn\u2019t know well. This would involve learned responses and lots of nodding and smiling. My Nan used to say the word \u2018damn\u2019 a lot. One day when I was around 5 or 6, when I was just leaving her house, I randomly came out with, \u201cI can\u2019t find my damn shoe!\u201d And everyone laughed and asked where I learned that word, and I had no idea why because it was just another vocabulary word! So I went and hid upstairs because I was embarrassed. It\u2019s rather funny to remember now though! \ud83d\ude00 When I started Secondary/high school at age 11, I ran into a lot of difficulties that nobody, myself included, understood. I hated being there \u2013 there were swarms of people, and everybody expected me to know where I was going and what I was doing and what to say. I recall an incident that happened when I was around 12 \u2013 our school was very strict on uniform, and I was always a very good girl, never breaking rules on purpose. One day I arrived at school late because I had been upset about going, and had forgotten to tuck my shirt in. I only realised when I got to the top of the first flight of stairs and ran into a rather strict teacher, who was incredibly brash with me, and told me to go back down the stairs and wait for her there. I went back down, shaking like a leaf, and sat at the bottom of the stairs, and waited, and waited, and waited. The registration bell rang and I was still waiting and shaking, because I didn\u2019t know what else to do. My friends came down from registration and found me sitting there shaking and told me to come to my lesson with them but I couldn\u2019t because the teacher had told me to wait. The teacher never showed up, and so I had to leave and go to my lesson. For months after that incident I lived in fear, terrified that I was going to run into that teacher again and she would confront me. When I was by myself, I would run between my destinations so as to avoid any confrontation from anyone. Other students found this funny, as I was a rather chubby girl who looked rather silly running, especially with my pigtails and glasses and top button done up. Eventually I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, and was taken out of school to do one hour a day at home with a tutor. I was shortly after that diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome. I managed to get myself four basic certificates, which is awesome ^_^ My mum was the only one who really understood my mind during these years. So many other people, family members, professionals, school authority, said that I was just being an awkward and difficult teenager. Although many of my teenage years were extremely sad times, for me and for the people around me, I was never happier when the day came for me to leave school for good. ^_^ Since leaving school, I have had the freedom to learn about the world, about people and about myself. I am happier than I have ever been, and although I have my wobbly days, I for the most part am happy, and bouncy and full of love for the world around me. \ud83d\ude00 I have a wonderful boyfriend who I met online (In World of Warcraft, which I adore!) Who supports me in all my endeavours and kicks the butts of the people who are not nice to me. I have met him once in real life (he lives 300 miles away) \u2013 and that was the most amazing day ever. \ud83d\ude00 I have made many friends online \u2013 through World of Warcraft and also through Second Life. I love cats, things that are pink, cupcakes, cookies, rainbows, soft things, drawing, making things and cuddles and kisses. ^_^ Although it would take me about 50 hundred thousand blog posts to explain my story properly, I would like to assure those out there who have autism or those out there with children with autism that you aren\u2019t alone. I wish that I could help all of you through your struggles. But if there was one thing I could change about my younger years, it would be awareness. Awareness for the family members and \u201cprofessionals\u201d and school staff that considered me to be difficult and badly brought up and just throwing a temper tantrum to get my way. Awareness for the girls at school who laughed at me because I was awkward and shy and tripped over my own feet. Awareness for the teacher that left me waiting for 2 hours on the stairs. I would love to send all the hugs in the world ever to the wonderful people who are a part of my life now, my on-line friends and my real life friends and my lovely male friend, but most of all to my mum, who has been there through it all and never gave up on me, even when i was at my worst. I know she has been deeply affected by the events of my teenage years and I just want her to know that I love her. So the best I can do is to say to you guys, spread the awareness! \ud83d\ude00 Just as Linda is doing with her amazing blog, just as I have tried to do with this extended essay of a post. Help people to understand and the world will be a much more sparkly place. \ud83d\ude00 Unfortunately there will always be the people who are stubborn, rude and ignorant.

She\u2019d been away over the Easter break and I was keen to catch up. So we set about getting the children ready, which of course includes explaining carefully to my autistic son (the eldest son at five years old) about where we were going. I told him we were going to visit Grandma, then decided I\u2019d throw in a little treat for her. I coached him to give her a greeting that would make her smile. I told him that when he saw her he should give her a big hug, and big kiss, and tell her \u201cI love you Grandma!\u201d He smiled and agreed to do this, and so the plan was set and off we went.

{"date": "April 24, 2011", "body": "\n Image by an untrained eye via Flickr \n If you express a hatred of autism, chances are very high that someone will come along and tell you how offensive your hatred is, without making any effort to either support or understand the person doing the hating. You may get a lecture about how autism can\u2019t be separated from the person, so to hate the autism is to hate your child. Or about how \u201chate\u201d is such a strong word (as if that in itself is an argument). So I\u2019ve decided to write a post supporting the haters, because in my experience, hating the haters solves nothing, and in fact can further their hurt and confusion. What they really need is a great big hug. The first thing to appreciate is that hatred or anger, is usually just a stage in the process of coming to terms with a child\u2019s diagnosis. Learning about autism itself, and the impact on a\u00a0 child, is not a one-day experience, it is a one-day-at-a-time experience. It\u2019s commonly said (and quite accurately in my experience) that it can take a good year to reach full understanding and acceptance of what it means to have a child diagnosed with this life-long condition. How long it actually takes will differ according to how severe the autism is, and the family\u2019s previous knowledge and experience with autism, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all here. Telling the parent (and it\u2019s usually a parent being attacked for hating autism), that their emotions are invalid or offensive, completely ignores the fact that the hatred is probably transitory, and that going through that emotion is a necessary part of eventually reaching full acceptance. If you deny them the chance and right to express their genuine emotions, you are neither helping them nor their child, you are just asking them to suppress their emotions, which is particularly unhealthy and can slow down their progression. Instead \u2013 even if the parent is not new to the autism diagnosis \u2013 the sensible and helpful approach is to first ask  why  they hate it. Perhaps they are confused about what causes autism \u2013 many people see autism as something thrust upon them by vaccines, which makes them angry. Fine, take the chance to inform them and change their mind through better information. Maybe they\u2019re hating autism because they\u2019re extremely depressed in general and are struggling with all aspects of life at the time, fine, then offer them some kind words of support and reassurance, and maybe point them in the direction of professional help. Or maybe they\u2019re so angry because they feel utterly helpless in the face of the behavioural challenges of autism, in which case they need to be told about things like PECS or occupational therapy or whatever else can help whatever\u2019s challenging them the most. For each of those various causes of the hatred, the help differs. Just telling them to \u201cnot hate\u201d, addresses none of those issues. When you tell someone not to express an emotion, the emotion still remains, and can in fact intensify because the person is receiving the message that what they think, feel and experience, has to go unsaid. It increases bitterness, and that sense of isolation (physical and emotional isolation is a huge problem for parents of autistic children already). They will \u2013 sooner or later \u2013 find someone else who hates autism just like they do, who aren\u2019t as well-informed and capable of lessening the anger and helping them address the causes (and who will let them speak honestly about their emotions since they share those emotions). The last thing you want is a community of angry, misinformed parents feeding off each other\u2019s confusions. It is far better to welcome these haters with open arms; expose them to new attitudes and  reasons  for those different attitudes, at the same time as respecting how they currently feel about what can be a very difficult condition to manage. Because attitudes don\u2019t spring forth from nothing, or being told that your previous attitude was wrong; they come from information, experiences and can change gradually through being part of a community. Better it be the welcoming community that disagrees, than the welcoming community that reinforces that hatred. The idea that hating autism is the same as hating the child / person with autism, is assuming far too much, and painting the hater as a villain when if you asked a few questions, you\u2019ll probably find the exact opposite: That they are saying they hate  autism , because they deeply love their child, and don\u2019t wish to confuse together their feelings about one with the other: \u201cI don\u2019t hate my child, I hate the challenges that autism is putting him through\u201d. It is a good thing then that they are separating the two, you don\u2019t want someone to be hating their child (it is a sad fact that some people do hate their autistic child, be glad the person who says they hate autism has made a distinction!) The argument that autism is intrinsic to the child, and therefore to hate autism is necessarily to hate the child, is a hotly contested idea. If you want to have that debate with the parent, then have that debate  openly , don\u2019t assume they accept your premise that the two are inseparable then skip to attacking them for feeling something they don\u2019t feel (ie hatred of autistic people). Yes there are people out there who hate autism, full-stop. Maybe they don\u2019t understand the huge variation in autism, and see it only through the severe cases they\u2019ve personally interacted with. Hell, maybe they just hate differences and would use eugenics to wipe out all differences in human beings (that has got to be the rarest possibility, but is often treated as what the haters must really want, and are attacked accordingly). But how can you know if you never ask, and how can you correct them when you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re actually saying; as I\u2019ve tried to make it clear in this post, there\u2019s a huge variation in what they might mean and why they feel the way they do. It might sound trite, but if you really want to stop people hating autism, you can do it best by showing the haters a bit of love. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/26312642@N00/2184519712"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/hugging-the-haters-why-hating-autism-is-not-so-bad/", "title": "Hugging the Haters: Why hating autism is not so\u00a0bad"},

{"date": "April 30, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I want to make it clear from the outset that this post is an attempt to get my own head around these issues. So if you can see an error in my own reasoning, I strongly encourage you to point it out, and I thank you in advance. \n Language is a tricky slippery monster. Many people are thrown by its uncertainties and variance, and when faced with those challenges, conclude that language lacks meaning; that it is inherently fluid and always determined by something other than a dictionary (such as solely by the author\u2019s intent). The fact that these arguments are made using language \u2013 and that we understand those arguments (as weak and mislead as they usually are) \u2013 belies the central tenets of the claim. Instead of delving further into the philosophical aspects of the discussion at its broadest levels, I want to talk about how all this applies specifically to autism. I\u2019ll start by talking about this thing called a \u201cpenumbra\u201d. The penumbra of a term refers to its \u201cedges\u201d; where the definite cases meld into the maybe. For the purposes of autism, you\u2019d find the penumbra of autism where it moves firmly away from \u201cclassic\u201d autism, and starts to slip into harder-to-diagnose cases of high-functioning autism (such as in mild instances of Aspergers or PDD-NOS). (If that term \u201chigh-functioning\u201d bothers you, hold your horses until the end.) It is a common feature of language, that terms have a definite centre where we can identify an instance without debate. Just because these words\u2019 meaning getting fuzzy at the boundaries \u2013 or we can\u2019t pin down the definitive characteristics needed to say something is or is not \u201cX\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean the word has no meaning and is never correct. Similarly, all might agree that person Z has autism, yet argue whether person Y has autism because it\u2019s close to the boundaries, that lack of certainty does not undo Z\u2019s diagnosis; it\u2019s just an observation about the difficulty of drawing lines at the penumbra. I\u2019ve seen some people do a fallacious slippery-slope, once they realise that not all cases of autism are straight-forward diagnoses: They conclude that autism is such a nebulous term that anyone might fall within it, therefore the term is inherently meaningless / corrupted, giving reason to doubt that autism is anything other than a version of usual mental retardation at one end (please excuse my terminology here, it does serve a purpose) or a type of personality variance at the other. There is a related problem that arises because of the nature of autism being a spectrum disorder: If someone doesn\u2019t understand that the core features of autism are observations across a number of fixed categories, they will not understand that the instances that fall within each category can differ. Even medical professionals can and have made this error \u2013 such as those who think anyone with autism must be a toe-walker, or have sensitive ears. They are mistaking concrete instances for the broader categories (as well as making an error about how autism is diagnosed). Some people argue that the very nature of the variance suggests autism is a made-up condition, serving some nefarious purpose: Whether they say it is so parents can feel less guilty about the product of their bad parenting, or less inferior for having had a \u201cretarded\u201d child, or the parent is just after extra money and extra help for their child on the grounds of a slightly different personality than other people. Just as autism has a penumbra of application that make people mistake its existence, it is also a spectrum disorder that makes people think the variance is at odds with the certainty of its existence. There is a more general and common problem here, than just confusion about how autism is diagnosed: These people are making an error about the direction of the language. They are working backwards from a confirmed example (person D definitely has autism, person F is different, therefore person F doesn\u2019t have autism), instead of upwards to the example (how was person D diagnosed): From the specific to the general instead of the general to the specific. This is not just a problem because of how autism is diagnosed and defined, though it  is  a frequent problem when talking about autism with less experienced members of the public,  because  of how it is diagnosed and defined. Being able to articulate where they are making an error \u2013 and that the error is not an unusual one or one specific to autism \u2013 makes it easier to correct them: It is the difference between replying \u201cthat\u2019s like saying a whale isn\u2019t a mammal because it lives in water, you\u2019re thinking about this the wrong way\u201d, rather than having to cite the diagnostic criteria for autism and explaining ways in which it differs between individuals (though you will no doubt get to that point if the discussion continues). The same claim and errors are made about the use of the terminologies \u201chigh functioning autism\u201d and \u201clow functioning autism\u201d. It is pointed out by some that it is too hard to draw the line between someone who is high functioning and someone who is low functioning, therefore the terms are redundant. Again, they are treating the penumbra as if it undercuts the term entirely. Just because some high functioning people show low functioning, and some low functioning people show high functioning, does not mean that there are not some people who are very clear instances of low functioning autism, and some people are very clear instances of high functioning autism. If a penumbra is  too  large, it can \u2013 arguably \u2013 eclipse the function of a term, but that is a different argument from putting forward examples where it is hard to determine high from low functioning autism. Again, an error is made when people point out that someone can move across the spectrum \u2013 starting out low functioning and becoming high functioning \u2013 therefore the term is redundant because it lacks permanence across time. But by the very act of identifying that that person was once one type, and then the other, the arguer has undercut their argument that the term cannot be used to describe how autism  is  (and once was) affecting an individual. It is not an inherent part of defining the level of functioning of an autistic person, that that level never changes. I should add that neither are the terms  inherently  offensive. It is descriptive. Any moral judgement added to it is done by the reader. (Admittedly if enough people found the term offensive, it may become generally considered an offensive term, but even words like \u201cretarded\u201d retain meaningful and accurate usage.) In as far as \u201cfunctioning\u201d for autistic people is tied to an IQ measure (and it sometimes is), it is an unhelpful and un-necessary terminology, because IQ is hard to measure in autistic people, and can be talked about as a completely independent question to how well an autistic person functions in the world. However, the way the term is commonly used among the professionals and parents I have interacted with, \u201cfunctioning\u201d references the ability to function within the world \u2013 that includes self-care skills, communication and social ability. Ability, and not just  preference : Low functioning autistic people are not those who have chosen to (for example) not socialize or communicate, they are rather those who cannot do so (though this ability can change). I have seen high functioning autistic people claim that they are low functioning because they  choose  not  to communicate by words,  preferring  the written word, or choose not to socialize, even though they could if they were put in a situation that they must. It seems to me that the ability to consciously make that choice \u2013 where many autistic people cannot \u2013 suggests they are high functioning. I have also seen instances of people claiming they were low functioning, because they do not always function at a consistently high level (do any of us?). The capacity to usually (even if not always) function at a high level, strongly suggests someone is high functioning. But you see already that we have moved into the penumbra, and it is here that the debates get messy and emotional, when really all that\u2019s happening is what is quite natural to language; the fuzzy edges are being put under a microscope, and found (surprise surprise) to be fuzzy, and debatable. The terms high and low functioning nevertheless serve a function in terms of allocating limited resources, and talking generally to the populace about how autism affects an individual, in a way that simply saying \u201cmy child has severe / mild autism\u201d, does not. Just because it is a spectrum among people, and indeed across an individual\u2019s life-time, does not undercut the purpose of using the terminology about level of functioning. If the terminology of functionality is deemed too offensive, then I see no problem in replacing the terminology with other words, if they also successfully demarcate that there is indeed a spectrum here of needs and abilities. Yes it would be a lovely world if every individual was treated directly according to their individual weaknesses and strengths \u2013 autism or no autism \u2013 but the fact is quite simply that some autistic people need extreme levels of support and resources just to make it through the day, whereas others do not. Pointing out, and acting on, that simple and vital fact, cannot reasonably be considered \u201coffensive\u201d. Here too we see people making the error about confusing an instance with the general term. Just because they can point at person X and say \u201chere is someone who is not strictly speaking high or low functioning\u201d or \u201chere is someone who is considered low functioning, yet this other person who is also called low functioning is very different from them\u201d, does not mean they have disproven the categorization. Yet that is exactly the sort of argument I have seen time and time again. In summary, when people disagree with you about whether autism exists, or whether particular terminology applies to autistic people, they might be struggling with getting their heads around the concept of the penumbra, or be moving from specifics to generals. It might feel like they\u2019re making an immoral attack on your child, but replying emotionally and defensively \u2013 though understandable \u2013 is going to be less effective than pin-pointing where they\u2019ve gone wrong and trying to correct the error. Otherwise we\u2019re all just sitting around banging tables loudly at each other, and not convincing anyone of anything except our respective passions, which were never in dispute. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Antumbra.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/language-and-autism-the-impact-of-penumbra-and-generalized-instances-on-debates-about-the-existence-of-and-functioning-levels-within-asd/", "title": "Language and Autism: The impact of penumbra and generalized instances, on debates about the existence of, and functioning levels within,\u00a0ASD"},
{"date": "May 17, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Ed Yourdon via Flickr \n I came across  a post  asking whether families with autistic children really should be entitled to pay less for \u201cordinary activities\u201d. Here \u201cordinary activities\u201d refers to activities like sports groups or zoo visits; ones that aren\u2019t specifically tailored to autistic children (compared to therapy sessions or special needs groups). The purported justification behind letting families with autistic children pay less for attending these ordinary activities, is financial hardship, since it is financially taxing to raise a special needs child. If that is the justification for lower (or no) fees, then the suggestion is that is unfair; many people struggle with finances, and some families with autistic children do not struggle with finances, so why should they be given a fee-break on the back of having an autistic child? I was surprised to see the discussion presented in this light. It is not how I have ever thought of why autistic children should be able to attend ordinary activities for lower fees. Though realising other people see the question in this way, helps me to better understand the rather snooty and judgmental responses I have sometimes received when asking event or activity organisers whether they provided cheaper fees for special needs families: If they thought I was simply after a cheap ride, I can better understand why they thought I had a cheek to even enquire. I\u2019ve even had some places say they didn\u2019t want to sign forms that would have made a government organisation pay me back for the fees I gave them. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ve always thought about why families like mine should get cheaper access: Having an autistic child makes it hard to get out of the car at the destination, get in the door where the activity is being held, and remain there for the full length of the activity. And that\u2019s if the child is even willing or able to take part in the activity. There are so many sensory, communication and general behavioural challenges with these children, that paying the full amount to attend and attempt these activities, does not appear to be fair and equal. The child is unlikely to get the enjoyment, benefit and learning that is comparatively highly likely for \u201cordinary\u201d children. There is not equal value, so why pay equal amounts? The predictable reply here is that some other children will also not enjoy or participate in the event, but are expected to pay full price. But the category of autistic children as a whole, makes it far less likely, and it seems fair to me that the organisation acknowledge and respond to that very real and appreciable difference. There is something especially relevant here about autistic children, rather than just special needs children: Our kids specifically do not respond well to change. They crave routine and predictability. So trying something new \u2013 no matter what that new thing may be \u2013 is a challenge in itself. There isn\u2019t really an \u201cordinary\u201d activity for our children. They are all challenging because our children are challenging; you can\u2019t just switch off the autism, or find activities where autism is totally irrelevant. Even when autistic children are passionate about taking part in an activity, they need help to move-on when it\u2019s finished, or not to just end up loudly stimming their happiness to the degree that the other children can\u2019t take part too. What about the extra supervision that our children often need at such activities; maybe we should be paying more, not less (I have seen this argued). But how often do our families just dump our children at ordinary activities? We are far more likely to be the unpaid parent helpers who stay to help our children understand and take part in the event. In fact, in my experience, us parents turn into helpers for the rest of the children too \u2013 the ones who don\u2019t have special needs but need help tying a shoe-lace or can\u2019t get a move quite right, and end up asking the closest adult. For a far-too-long time I was the reliable unpaid parent-help at my son\u2019s mainstream kindergarten; I turned up and stayed to help my son, but I ended up dealing with all the other children \u2013 changing their outfits for dress-up, helping build that block castle, even breaking up fights and soothing an injured child. I will always respect the right of the activity providers to charge whatever they like; I\u2019m not arguing for compulsory cheap fees, or that providers charging full price are immoral or ignorant. I would like to think though that if they understood all these special challenges \u2013 and that our children might end up excelling at and loving their activities given the chance \u2013 they would consider lower fees. It\u2019s often government bodies providing subsidised prices anyway, through various bodies and funding, so no point beating up the service providers. Putting that aside, the principal aim of this post was an effort to explain what I see as legitimate reasons for lower fees. (And I haven\u2019t even addressed the good financial sense it makes to offer lower fees to families who otherwise wouldn\u2019t consider attending at all.) Clearly in this post I have been talking from personal experiences with my son. I haven\u2019t previously sought the opinions of families who have autistic children about how they feel about paying full fees for ordinary activities (which is clear when you consider my surprise that people would think it\u2019s only a question of the family\u2019s income). So now that I\u2019ve shared my own views, and why I have them, I would be very interested in hearing yours too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/72098626@N00/4594620675", "http://autism.about.com/b/2011/05/16/do-families-with-autism-expect-too-many-entitlements.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/no-ordinary-activities-should-autistic-children-pay-lower-fees/", "title": "No ordinary activities; should autistic children pay lower\u00a0fees?"},
{"date": "May 18, 2011", "body": "\n The face of Big Ben (via Wikipedia) \n By now, you know  my son adores clocks . You\u2019ll remember the story about how we took him  to the zoo , and he stopped to stare at a clock rather than see any more animals. You may even recall the  rather amusing  turns of phrase  he\u2019s come up with  when talking about his clocks. The clock love just keeps growing, and finding new outlets. One of my son\u2019s favourite types of outings, is visiting local clock towers. The photo at the bottom of this post, is one I took in the weekend; we\u2019d been to a park as a family, but the outing wasn\u2019t over until we stopped off for him to  happy dance  around a tower clock on the way back home. He also loves visiting jewelry stores, to look at the watches on display. Yesterday his class visited a historic village. The highlight for my son, according to his teacher, was seeing grandfather clocks. He\u2019s seen them on the TV, he\u2019s seen them on the computer, but to see a real-life full-size grandfather clock was particularly special. He\u2019s made it very clear to us that he wants to go see Big Ben. We are in New Zealand. Big Ben is just about as far away from New Zealand as you can get. It\u2019s a long-term goal; we\u2019ve told him he might be able to visit it as a man (and yes I\u2019ve had to calculate for him how many days it will be until he starts being a man \u2013 it was 4000 and something). He also plans to buy himself a grandfather clock of his own when he gets a job. I\u2019m all for motivation, even if he is only five. He used to have two wristwatches, but he played with them too much and they stopped working. Once we stopped him wearing them to school (since they weren\u2019t telling the correct time anyway), I placated him by drawing a watch on his wrist. He\u2019s since started drawing clocks and watches on himself. I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s not old enough to get a tattoo! He loves drawing clocks on places that aren\u2019t his own skin too. He draws them so much that it\u2019s noticeably improved his fine motor skills, as he tries to master a circle and the correct placement of those dashes, dots, or numbers around the clock face. He knows his grandfather clocks from his cuckoo clocks, his wristwatches from his alarm clocks, his analog from his digital. He knows a minute hand from an hour hand from a second hand from an alarm hand. He also knows roman numerals. He\u2019s even pretty good at telling the time. Each new room he enters or TV program he sees, he\u2019s looking for a clock in the background and lets us know when he finds it. His mind is always tuned to clocks. They are his chosen rewards for good behaviour; if he gets his hair cut (which is a big deal for him), he gets a new clock or at the very least, a new children\u2019s book about telling time. I spent a good while one day trying to get him something extra special; a book with all the different types of clocks in it. I found a few about antiques, but nothing worthy of my son\u2019s level of passion. I\u2019ve now got rather used to the endless ticking that surrounds me at home. It doesn\u2019t maddenly distract me from everything the way that it used to. I\u2019ve even tried to become passionate about the clocks like my son; so I can share in his joy and excitement. It doesn\u2019t fascinate me particularly though; I can see their occasional beauty, but I wouldn\u2019t want to look at them all day (or even for more than a few minutes). But I love my son. So much. And if he thinks clocks are worth loving, then that makes them pretty special in my book too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parliament_Clock_Westminster.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/for-the-love-of-clocks/", "title": "For the love of\u00a0clocks"},
{"date": "May 14, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n This is another one of my posts where I am trying to sort and clarify my current knowledge and understandings. Though I do have a legal and philosophy background which I use in this post, I do not have a science background (though I have been reading quite a bit about the scientific method and science history of late). So if you spot an error in my reasoning or facts, just let me know; consider this a learning effort rather than a concluded opinion. There\u2019s been a lot of talk around the autism community lately, about the impact of legal decisions on scientific findings. In particular, whether a decision by a court that vaccines have caused autism, means that they actually do cause autism. Putting aside the arguments about the difference between finding vaccines cause brain damage and \u201cautism-like\u201d behaviour, versus whether they cause autism proper, there is a broader issue here about \u201ctruth\u201d; specifically burdens of proof and contextual truth. It is that issue which I\u2019m going to discuss here, focusing on law and science. A legal decision should never be taken out of the context of the court and the laws under which the case was brought. A statement that action X caused outcome Z, as decided by a court, means according to the burden of proof for that particular type of claim, the court at that time reached that decision. That might sound flimsy, but the less flimsy outcome is that the two battling parties can now get on with their respective lives: They presented their arguments to a third-party to settle the dispute, and must accept the ruling, unless there is a right to appeal the decision. They cannot take the law into their own hands if they disagree with the ruling, without facing their own further legal consequences. They may of course exercise their freedom of speech to dispute the finding, being careful with regards to defamation law, contempt of court, and various other restrictions depending on the country within which they choose to exercise that freedom. So we\u2019re\u00a0 familiar with people arguing the courts made the wrong decision \u2013 whether on moral or factual grounds. But those complaints are not surprising; the point of the ruling was not to make everyone happy, it was rather to dispense justice as defined by the existing laws. Most people understand the basics of all this, so they know that when a court, for example, finds someone guilty of a crime, that there is a chance the person did not actually commit the criminal act, but according to what could be ascertained in the court the person will be held accountable and face the consequences. It\u2019s a natural consequence of human fallibility; courts are human institutions upholding human-made laws as applied by human judges. The courts should be getting the correct outcome the vast majority of the time, otherwise there would be serious risk of revolution, or at the very least, major reform. (We all know they get it wrong sometimes, and governments have to make large payouts when they do. Legal systems are generally set up to let nine guilty men walk free, rather than put away one innocent one \u2013 at least in modern democracies!) However, there are always those who will see the occasional wrong decisions, or not understand how the system works in general, and decry the entire legal system as worthless and unable to declare truth at all; forgetting that the truths are contextual to the legal framework. They point out that eye-witness statements are unreliable (100 people see 100 different things), get bowled over by issues of relativity, without appreciating that we function perfectly fine in this world living with such relativity anyway; the courts just bring it into sharp relief. The courts also openly respond to such issues, with rules about hearsay and admissible evidence more generally. Indeed, the law \u2013 like science \u2013 is aware of trends in human thinking that can distort the search for the truth. Both law and science have protections against issues like confirmation bias and correlation versus causation. The law uses phrases like \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d and \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d to capture and address such concerns. Science uses the scientific method (I\u2019ll say more on that later). Courts would like to always deal with deductive reasoning that leads to infallible conclusions, but they have to be comfortable with the reality that much of what we do in this world is based on inductive reasoning: The sun came up yesterday, and everyday before then in living memory, but we don\u2019t have proof it will come up tomorrow. This is not a reason to throw up our hands and run around screaming that everything is unknown and unknowable; instead it is a reason to search for as much certainty as we can in face of those challenges. This indeed is how we function everyday. We make our kids lunch for the next day, we set aside our clothes, we do not assume the sun will not rise just because we don\u2019t have deductive proof of it. Without these contextual \u201clegal truths\u201d, we would be in a particularly unpleasant state of anarchy, where people took their own justice based on their own version of what justice is. The legal system grants the ability to move forward with our lives when there are disputes, to make decisions and know the consequences, and know that those consequences will be enforced. Such is a large part of its beauty: A virtue of (relative) certainty. Science requires a similar level of appreciation of the value of being able to make decisions instead of being paralysed with inaction, and faces similarly misguided attacks when it at times churns out un-truths. Allow me to explain: Just as the legal system is a system, set up to find truths so that we can get on with our lives, science is a system that offers up truths that allow us to make decisions about our health, and operate successfully in the world more generally. The legal system has completely man-made constructs of courts and judges and laws; yes the people who set up those constructs aim to create an objectively just system, but there are perfectly functional legal systems across the world that vary enormously in regards to the specific laws and court systems they have in place. (Putting aside at this point the objectivity of the \u201crule of law\u201d and declarations of no legal system in the absence of the rule of law \u2013 there is only so much I can cover in a single blog post!) Science has a more solid reference point than our human notions of justice though: The world that exists independently of how we wish it was. We can alter, add to, and take away from the world around us, but what happens when we alter,add and take away from it, is determined by observable scientific laws that we cannot alter just because we want them to be different. Science uses the scientific method to discover new truths, and to refine and test old ones. Those \u201ctruths\u201d \u2013 like legal \u201ctruths\u201d \u2013 cannot be taken out of context. A scientific truth about whether a pill works to cure a certain condition or not, is made \u2013 again, like legal decisions \u2013 with reference to a sort of burden of proof: The scientific method takes into account the statistical significance of results, acknowledges the huge variety of factors that might be at play in any finding, and addresses the sorts of very-human reasoning errors that I mentioned earlier (such as confirmation bias). But this doesn\u2019t mean we throw up our hands and say it\u2019s all too hard, \u201cresults vary from one study to the next!\u201d, \u201cwe can\u2019t control for all factors!\u201d, \u201coh look there\u2019s a miracle that disproves the stated scientific truth!\u201d. Just like law, science gives us a way to move forward with our lives, to not be paralysed with inaction in the face of the uncertainties that exist quite naturally and normally all around us. This is no reason to be a subjective relativist; it is a reason to be a  realist . The genuine relativist is the person who \u2013 if they have honesty and integrity \u2013 wouldn\u2019t bank on the sun getting up the next day. They would live in a flux, and (again, if they have integrity) won\u2019t bother arguing with you, because what\u2019s the point, it\u2019s all relative anyway, and you probably don\u2019t really exist \u2013 their senses are probably creating this entire world. (That is not a ridiculous suggestion that no one would make by the way; certain philosophers and spiritual leaders, have proposed such a non-existence.) Questions of epistemology overwhelm them because they define their lives by the unknown, instead of by the vast knowns that allow us to function everyday, without walking through walls into new dimensions. (This is a theme I have commented on before in  my discussion of the penumbra of language ; we mustn\u2019t let the fuzzy edges of what is known, lead us into thinking nothing is known.) Both law and science openly recognise these uncertainties. Law understands there is a difference between the notion of an objective infallible law, and man-made law, by references to the difference between natural law and positivism. It also adds terms like \u201cfound guilty by the court\u201d instead of just saying \u201cis guilty\u201d, and uses \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d and \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d. Science uses terms like \u201cbest hypothesis\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cstatistically significant\u201d. These are not weasel words. They are honest words, recognising our limitations. They are not evidence of the pointlessness of law, or science, they are reasons to indeed respect law and science \u2013 because they openly acknowledge such issues and respond to new evidence that might undercut existing understanding, as a reason to re-evaluate current understandings. So you can also see why you can\u2019t seamlessly move from a legal decision, to a scientific \u201ctruth\u201d: They are operating under different systems, with different burdens of proof. If one system is superior than the other at ascertaining truths in the pure sense of that word, then it is science. Science is used to help establish legal findings (did person X kill person Y), but law is not used to establish scientific findings. Some scientific questions get tested in law courts, but only to determine how they fit within existing  man-made law , such as laws about financial compensation. Not to test whether they are objective truths about the world outside of the law courts: Any such findings must be kept within their context. Questions of truth \u2013 and here we are particularly dealing with the foundational problems of epistemology \u2013 are not new. Discovering an inherent uncertainty in science and law doesn\u2019t make someone the defender of the people or a hero or someone revealing a conspiracy. It just means they\u2019ve just discovered what pretty much every one else in that profession already knew. Awareness of uncertainties and our limitations is reason to continue the search for truth that enhance and extend our lives, not the reason to abandon it and hand over your decision-making to an even more uncertain source of truth\u2026 But that\u2019s a topic for another day, and probably for another blog \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Scientific_Method.png"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/law-science-burdens-of-proof-and-contextual-truth/", "title": "Law, Science, Burdens of Proof, and Contextual\u00a0Truth."},
{"date": "May 18, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Diego_3336 via Flickr \n My own opinion of the relationship between autism and gut problems (based on research and extensive reading, rather than a \u201cgut-feeling\u201d), is that the two issues need to be approached separately: More specifically, that there is nothing inherent in autism that means a child has a gut problem, but that plenty of children with autism do clearly have gut problems that need to be managed. And importantly, that for those autistic children who do suffer from gut problems, addressing those problems can lessen the severity of the autism symptoms. This lessening of the severity of the symptoms though does not mean the autism is being fixed, it is a natural consequence of increasing the \u201ccomfort\u201d of the child: If a child already has significant sensory, communication and behavioural issues, pain and general un-well-being is only going to make them worse. Keeping the issues of gut and autism separate, is further complicated by the often restrictive and poor diets that our children have, due to sensory (and sometimes fine motor) problems. Fixing dietary deficiencies can also improve behaviour and reduce discomfort, in ways that will can show as improvements in the symptoms of autism. With all of these \u201cmaybes\u201d and links, it\u2019s easy to think that \u2013 as a parent \u2013 you might as well give a special diets a go. What\u2019s the harm? I\u2019ve written before about the harm that occurs from taking part in a GF/CF diet \u2013 which can be physical as well as financial \u2013 so I won\u2019t re-hash that here. (Of course, if you have proof that your child is sensitive to gluten and casein, those harms are more than worth the costs.) More generally, there is a harm in thinking that autism as a condition is caused by \u2013 and be cured by \u2013 addressing gut problems. Not least of all because it can detract a parent\u2019s time and resources from other treatments and therapies that have a far more positive and reliable impact on the symptoms of autism. Of course all of this debate gets muddied by Wakefield waters. Many people naturally associate claims about a gut connection, with Wakefield\u2019s claims. Wakefield\u2019s claims are not generally taken seriously anymore, and so associated claims about the gut are also often dismissed (which is just another example of the damage done by Wakefield). It\u2019s important to consider new hypotheses about any relationship between the gut and autism, independent of the specific one suggested by Wakefield (which had been established in labs that were turning out false positives, and couldn\u2019t be replicated in independent labs). I am particularly aware of these issues because my husband \u2013 my autistic son\u2019s father \u2013 has  Crohn\u2019s disease  (which was Wakefield\u2019s passion prior to autism). Crohn\u2019s can be inherited, and can be a particularly severe gut problem. We have no evidence that our son has inherited Crohn\u2019s from his father. We do know that our son doesn\u2019t have any food sensitivities or allergies because we\u2019ve had him tested. I am very aware of my son\u2019s bowel motions since he still needs help in the bathroom. I monitor him, and the science about all this, as best I can. So I was particularly interested to see this today:  \u201cSupporting Real Autism Science\u201d  by Todd Drezner, at Huffington Post. I strongly suggest popping over for a read. I equally suggest avoiding the comments since they\u2019re going to turn into a \u201cwe hate Wakefield\u201d \u201cwe love Wakefield\u201d fest, which is not the heart of the issue, and should not be the heart of the issue: As Todd points out, it is a distraction. (It makes you wonder if some of the commenters even got the point and importance of the post.) I do hope that the messages and calm reason of Todd\u2019s post, help others refocus the debate; away from personalities and improbable theories, and back towards new hypotheses and science. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/31018257@N00/25365082", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001295/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-drezner/supporting-real-autism-sc_b_859728.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/a-gut-feeling-about-autism/", "title": "A Gut-Feeling about\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "April 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I\u2019ve always felt that the key to lessening the impact of autism on my son\u2019s life, was speech therapy. (I\u2019m not alone in that opinion, it is apparently the  most used  of all autism therapies). A good proportion of the meltdowns and misery he experienced were due to not being able to tell me what he wanted, and me not being able to tell him what was going on. It\u2019s also very hard \u2013 and potentially futile \u2013 to discipline a child for their behaviour, when you don\u2019t know whether the behaviour is caused by fear or anger or confusion; so many aspects of the challenges caused by autism can be worked on once there is some sort of language in place. But what form should that language take, when speech is extremely delayed, and will possibly never eventuate? And how can you be sure that the alternative form of language you are introducing to your child, won\u2019t in fact  hinder  the development of spoken language? These are the issues I\u2019d been trying to get my head around, when our son\u2019s speech therapist recommended trying PECS.  PECS  stands for picture exchange communication system. It\u2019s a very popular and well-regarded method of introducing language to an autistic child, backed with good evidence of efficacy. Still, I had concerns about how introducing a picture-based communication system might deter my son from learning to speak. How many times had I been told by other mothers, that he would only learn when faced with frustration as his teacher \u2013 wouldn\u2019t a picture based system that lessened the frustration, undercut the desire to gain verbal language? Frustration as a teacher, makes sense when dealing with a child who doesn\u2019t have autism. I suspected this before, but now with such a child as my second-born, I know it to be true. My youngest (not autistic) son gets frustrated at what he can\u2019t do, then works endlessly to figure out  how  to do it. My eldest (autistic) son wouldn\u2019t even try new things; he\u2019d just do the old and familiar over and over, all day if he could. When showing him something new (if I could get him to take an interest at all), the frustration that came from not being able to do something would either drive him completely away from the task, or drive him towards a meltdown. Persisting with a frustrating task could even create whole new anxieties and fears in him that I\u2019d then have to battle for months afterwards. So no, frustration in itself is not a great teacher for autistic children. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that frustration \u2013 or anything else \u2013 will lead an autistic child to eventually develop speech. They might remain non-verbal. Because of this possibility, it makes sense to present them with an alternative form of communication, not to just hold your breath that years from now they\u2019ll naturally \u201ccatch-up\u201d. I was also concerned about whether PECS was the best alternative communication system. In particular, I wondered whether something like sign language \u2013 which I and others were more familiar with \u2013 would be better. Part of the beauty of PECS is that it transcends any particular language (english or otherwise), since it\u2019s visual. As sad as it is that sign language isn\u2019t more widely used and understood, the fact is that using pictures to represent what you want when dealing with strangers, is going to be more accessible and successful. Even more important than that though when trying to decide on an alternative communication system to speech, is the fact that PECS works so beautifully with the autistic brain. Autistic people are highly visual learners and thinkers. Some of the more remarkable and beautiful aspects of the way autistic people interact with and understand their world, are tied into this heightened/different \u201cvisualness\u201d. It\u2019s important to realise too that PECS is not simply an alternative form of communication, it is supplemental. The picture cards are used at the same time as spoken words, and there are words written on the cards, reinforcing both verbal and written language. Evidence has shown that rather than replace verbal speech, PECS actually enhances and progresses verbal speech. After I\u2019d done all my thinking and researching and talked it through with the speech therapist, we started using PECS with my son. It\u2019s a system that does need to be learnt \u2013 you need to do it the right way; doing it the wrong way or going too fast, can teach confusion and lead to having to \u201cunteach\u201d what was taught to the child. So you have to be committed to giving it a proper go. You also have to accept that once you\u2019ve started using the system, it is considered unethical to take it away from the child; like taking away their ability to communicate. PECS does require a lot of materials \u2013 picture cards, folders, a filing system of sorts, a lot of velcro, etc. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll have this all supplied by the speech therapist (like we did). If that\u2019s not an option available to you, you can keep costs low by doing things like sourcing pictures from free online sites or drawing your own. I do credit PECS with being the prime force behind my son moving from single words, to his first ever sentences. It also of course expanded his vocabulary, and made his words more correctly correlate to items (instead of being quite so random). And \u2013 very importantly \u2013 it had a significant impact on the number of meltdowns he had each day, since he was now able to better tell us what he wanted, and we were in turn able to tell him if something wasn\u2019t available. My son no longer uses PECS, but it\u2019s all still there in a box under his bed, if he ever wanted it. He is very verbal, though he still has a very long way to go before he\u2019ll even have the eloquence a three year-old preschooler (he\u2019s now five and a half). He\u2019s still hard to understand sometimes, still uses odd and often confusing sentence structures, but he is able to make himself understood most times, and to understand very much of what I say to him too. Of particular note and importance, he is constantly improving; his repertoire of words is ever-growing, and the sentences he comes out with keep getting better. It is that  progress  which was lacking prior to PECS. PECS was like the key that started the engine, and he\u2019s been humming along ever since. (If you\u2019ve tried PECS, or are trying PECS currently, I\u2019d be very interested in hearing your experiences and opinions too.) \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg", "http://autism.healingthresholds.com/therapy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Exchange_Communication_System"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/to-pecs-or-not-to-pecs/", "title": "To PECS, or not to\u00a0PECS"},
{"date": "May 19, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n This is inspired by  a post I\u2019ve just read over at \u201cThe Tumultuous Truth\u201d . I started writing a comment on Sharon\u2019s post, and realised it was turning into post length, so I\u2019ve decided to turn it into a proper post over here. Please read her original post first (it\u2019s a nice short one. Mine unfortunately isn\u2019t). \n Much like Sharon\u2019s son Harri, my son likes to \u201ctest\u201d people. Once he\u2019s familiar with a subject matter (colour, shape, letter names, etc), he finds it amusing to pretend to get the answers wrong. This is not just wishful thinking on my part; I\u2019m not delusional about what he knows and doesn\u2019t know. There are clear hints when he is playing someone: He\u2019ll look out the side of his eye at them, with a sly smile on his face, watching carefully and gleefully for their reaction. This is compared to when he suspects he\u2019s correct but has made an error; at those times he looks confused and thoughtful, rather than sly and happy. When he\u2019s learning or he\u2019s unsure or has made an error, he is slow to reply and takes time to process the information. When he is playing you for a fool, he is quick to reply and very (overly) sure of himself \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the game. A game that confuses his teachers, friends and occasionally us too, but that clearly and significantly amuses him. And it\u2019s a pain. It can make it hard for his school teachers to figure out what he genuinely doesn\u2019t understand, and so what he needs to be taught. It can also of course make it very hard if not completely pointless to assess and grade him, if one was so inclined. I think that from his perspective, there is joy in the game of pretending, and in seeing other people\u2019s reactions. In order to overcome that joy, we have to provide extreme motivation (comparatively more joy) for a correct answer \u2013 such as an activity he really wants to do or food he wants to eat. The reward is not simply for getting the right answer, the reward is also for being serious instead of acting the goat. The problem has been exacerbated by a kindly approach some of his teachers have used at school. They will sometimes offer up the wrong answer then make a big to-do about how silly that wrong answer was. The purpose of this is to reinforce the right versus wrong answer, to make sure the children don\u2019t feel too upset about giving the wrong answers, and to keep lessons light-hearted and amusing. The upshot for my son, is sadly predictable though. I suspect this whole issue is going to become a central subject of a future IEP (it was mentioned briefly in the previous IEP, but since that was his first school IEP we had too much else to cover at the time). This problem has gotten worse lately for another reason too. He has amped up his game. It lasts longer now, and he seems to have been working on his \u201cpoker face\u201d. We\u2019ll ask if he knows something and instead of his usual sideways look and sly smile, he\u2019ll look away while he answers so we can\u2019t read his face either way. He eventually reveals his game by laughing or getting irritated at us for actually thinking he didn\u2019t know the right answer (earnestly sitting down to teach someone something they already have confident knowledge of, can be rather irritating to the learnee). I\u2019ve tried to out-deceive him, by pretending I don\u2019t know that he really knows the right answer. I do this to remove the reinforcing satisfaction he gets from the laughter and silliness that would usually have followed. The problem is that this pretending is his main way of making jokes with us \u2013 a key form of silliness. So not laughing feels a tad cruel sometimes. I provide other ways to be silly together \u2013 tickles and physical humour and silly sounds. But for more complex verbal humour, and guaranteed giggles, it pretty much comes down to this deceit about what he actually knows. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to completely deprive him of it. For now \u2013 though it can be annoying and confusing \u2013 I\u2019m not excessively worried about this game of his, since he\u2019s only just started school. He\u2019s still learning what is expected of him at school, and how he might be assessed and any consequences for correct answers on such assessments. He faces so many other challenges right now \u2013 fine and gross motor skills, self-care, general language, food issues, behavioural, etc \u2013 that this sort of word play isn\u2019t at the top of my daily-worries list. But it is a problem, and one we will have to face head-on some day if time and experience doesn\u2019t gradually teach him when it\u2019s OK to joke like this, and when it\u2019s not. Because of his autism \u2013 specifically the learning disability aspect tied in with communication problems \u2013 people already struggle to figure out what he does and does not know. Imagine applying an IQ test or a national standards school test to a child like mine, and trying to conclude from that his level of intelligence or knowledge. With this current game of his, the exercise would be farcical. Long term observations over days at the least, would be required to ascertain what he genuinely knew and didn\u2019t know, because at any one instant he could be playing you for a fool. And if you thought a one-off test could measure my son\u2019s intellect or knowledge, that is exactly what you would be. It would be a test of if he understood the function of a test, and wanted to take part in a test, which are different questions. (If you find these questions of intelligence, testing intelligence and motivation to perform, as interesting as I do, I strongly suggest you read \u201c IQ and Motivation\u201d over at Neurologica Blog .) I want to end this post by thanking Sharon for sharing her story about Harri, and thereby motivating me to share my own about my son. Writing this post has helped organise my thoughts about why my son does this, and how it might be corrected in time \u2013 and indeed how I should perhaps feel about it in the meantime. I don\u2019t know whether this is a particularly autistic behaviour \u2013 some factors suggest it is, others not so much \u2013 regardless, it is an extra challenge for when people are trying to interact with and assess my son, which is hard enough without him finding humour in intentional error. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IQ_curve.svg", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/2011/05/so-far-so-good.html", "http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/iq-and-motivation/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/humour-in-intentional-error-why-my-autistic-son-will-fail-your-test/", "title": "Humour in Intentional Error; why my autistic son will fail your\u00a0test."},

Your cousin\u2019s child is not the prototype of all autism.

Some children get more severe, some get less severe, some stay at the same severity. If it doesn\u2019t change or gets worse, it is not proof of bad parenting.

{"date": "May 21, 2011", "body": "\n Image by amandabhslater via Flickr \n Yesterday I took my one year-old to the local playground. The morning\u2019s rain was still collected in puddles at the bottom of slides, and the grass fields alongside were full of hidden marshes that threatened to pull my slip-ons from my feet. I had hoped everything would be drier, but none of this bothered my son who threw himself with predictable glee into the occasion. So I ignored my adult sensibilities and threw myself into following him over, up and down every surface he decided to conquer. That playground is usually bustling with preschoolers, and their parents making small-chat that they don\u2019t mind being over-heard. But that day, it started off just him and I, gradually drying off each slide and tunnel by our own movement across it. By the time another mother and her two children arrived, the sun and the efforts of me and my own son, had made the playground a much more attractive option. I had been contemplating taking my boy home by then, but I took the chance to engage in some social activity for both me and my boy. I pointed out their arrival to him, and said in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cdo you want to go say hello?\u201d His face lit up and he hurried over as fast as his 17 month old legs would carry him. This included arriving face first on the ground on the way, but that only slowed him down long enough that it took him to find his feet again. The mother looked so together, with her younger one year-old daughter, and her four year-old son. Polite and beautiful children, well-dressed, bright eyes and smiles. Our children interacted and shared around their mutual perfection. Just two mothers, three children, in a playground between rain-falls. I correctly guessed the age of her son, and we chatted about what school he would be attending. I mentioned my own five year-old was currently at school. \u201cOh yes, which one?\u201d I answer. Gosh that\u2019s not local is it. Well, no. I don\u2019t explain that he\u2019s attending the special needs unit there because of his autism, since that so often kills the conversation (other mothers usually have no idea what to say to that, or say something unintentionally insulting); I specifically only supplied the name of the mainstream school that his special needs class is located within. More polite chatter. I like this woman. She smiles a lot behind her large sunglasses. She loves her children, enjoying their joy. In a lull in the conversation, I decide to mention that we do live local, it\u2019s just my son is attending a special needs unit at that far-away school. She asks why he doesn\u2019t attend XYZ (the name of the special needs school which actually runs the classroom he attends at the mainstream school. If I have completely bamboozled you at this point, I direct you to  my post that explains what a \u201csatellite\u201d class is .) So I tell her, that he does attend XYZ, just in the form of a satellite class run through the mainstream school. And then it\u2019s my turn to ask a question: How did she know about XYZ in the first place (the name of local special-needs school is not a generally known thing). So she says, she had a Down syndrome child. Had. I tread carefully. It\u2019s none of my business. I could smile and nod and shift the conversation away, or I could gently enquire. I decide on the latter. \u201cHad? Did he\u2026?\u201d No, not dead. She\u2019d given him up, though I know from our conversation that she still had him with her until at least six months old. He had been her second child \u2013 the elder and younger were with her at the playground. Another family that lives near her have care of her Downs child. She starts to apologize for being emotional, and I can see behind her sunglasses that she has started crying. I want to hug her, but social norms stop me invading her space. She puts together sentences while she tries to contain herself. She tells me that she thought everything might turn out \u201cOK\u201d, that the development would \u201ccome right\u201d; we agree that hope can blind you to reality. She tries to explain, I tell her she doesn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m not judging her. I understand. I have such a strong need to make her understand that this stranger she has just met in the playground, with a special-needs child, understands why she gave up her own. I don\u2019t. How could I? My child is autistic, he doesn\u2019t have Down syndrome. I have no idea what it would be like to have a Down syndrome child. But having a special-needs child does make me understand that I don\u2019t understand; that I can\u2019t presume to even begin to grasp the challenges she faced, or how hard her decision was, how long it took her to make it, or all the reasons why she made it. Just like people who have never had an autistic child have no idea what I\u2019ve been through.  That  is what I understand: That I  don\u2019t  understand. And so I will not \u2013  cannot  \u2013 judge her. What I can do, is see her pain. Pain that is so real and so vulnerable that my own eyes teared up in response to hers. We share a few special-needs platitudes as the sky darkens above: We talk about not taking a child\u2019s development for granted, and how enormous the differences are between normally and differently developing children. I realise as we speak that what I have been through over the past years have brought me through my \u201c grief \u201d about my child having special-needs, to a place of understanding and acceptance about it, in a way that she doesn\u2019t seem to have. Her grief and confusion still seem to occupy her; preoccupy her. But I am only observing this, and speculating, there is still no judgment here, only an effort to give her an outlet for a few minutes, until the rain starts to fall. I apologize that I must go. My little man is worn out, and the rain is coming in. But it was nice to meet her and we agree we mutually look forward to meeting again. As I walk to the car with my toddler in my arms \u2013 his cuddly little body too tired to perform his usual wriggles \u2013\u00a0 I realise we never got each other\u2019s names. That night in bed with my husband, I should be falling asleep but I\u2019m thinking about her. I tell my husband that I think she is brave; that it must have been so hard to give up a child when you realise you can\u2019t give it what it needs. Can\u2019t? Won\u2019t? Even as I say this I realise I don\u2019t know enough to pronounce her brave. He says what I\u2019m thinking; that \u201cbrave\u201d isn\u2019t really the right word. Is there a \u201cright word\u201d? I eventually fall asleep not knowing the answer to that question. In the morning I decide to write a blog post about it, called \u201cThe Crying Stranger in the Playground,\u201d and I wonder what my readers will think. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/15181848@N02/2334490457", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/05/18/neurodiversity-grief-and-the-normal-minority/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/the-crying-stranger-in-the-playground/", "title": "The Crying Stranger in the\u00a0Playground"},
{"date": "May 25, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Last month I took part in a \u201cworld autism views\u201d survey by an organisation called \u201cRelate to Autism\u201d. I came across it randomly via a local online forum. As  you can see from the discussion in that forum thread , we weren\u2019t particularly impressed with the way the questions were worded or the options for answers. Still, I thought it might be interesting to see the results, which were sent to my inbox today. You can see their overall summary  here . And  here\u2019s the break-down  of who took part in the survey. The most interesting outcomes for me from  the section about causes of autism , were that: \n Far more North Americans think autism is caused by \u201ctoxins\u201d, than do people from the rest of the world. \n Autistic people are the strongest group against the notion that vaccines cause autism (parents and grandparents were most convinced vaccines cause autism \u2013 which is significant since parents make the vaccination decisions). \n I was happy to see that of those parents, NZ/Australia/Polynesia are least convinced that vaccines cause autism. Our region were also most likely to reply that autism is inherited to some degree. \n The  section about autism treatment , is largely useless (in my opinion) because (1) it didn\u2019t specify what it meant by \u201ccure\u201d, \u201ctherapy\u201d and \u201cmedical\u201d; and (2) the answer options were particularly frustrating for this section since the answer for one autistic person would vary hugely from others, and it was hard to convey that difference in the options provided. Something noteworthy from the  section about whether autism is a gift or a tragedy : Significantly higher numbers of North Americans said \u201cautism is a gift to humanity\u201d was \u201cdefinitely true.\u201d In the  section about where autism research should focus , it was interesting that \u201cNorth Americans and those in Australia / New Zealand do not think (on average) that research should focus on finding ways to make children with autism behave as other children do\u201d. On the whole, the efficacy of the survey was undercut by how they worded the questions and answers, but it did nevertheless churn out some interesting differences and talking points. It also makes it hard to take the survey seriously when their summary had some rather glaring proof-reading problems (which you will spot without too much trouble \u2013 a shame no one at their end did). It strikes me as somewhat a wasted opportunity to find out some interesting opinions from what was a reasonable sized sample of people. If they run the same exercise again, I hope they address these issues, so that successive years of the survey will also show trends changing (or not changing) as new autism research comes to light and new autism stories hit the media. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Green_tick.png", "http://www.trademe.co.nz/Community/MessageBoard/Messages.aspx?id=652556&topic=23", "http://www.relatetoautism.com/index.php?subform=article&article_id=561", "http://www.relatetoautism.com/index.php?subform=article&article_id=557", "http://www.relatetoautism.com/index.php?subform=article&article_id=558", "http://www.relatetoautism.com/index.php?subform=article&article_id=560", "http://www.relatetoautism.com/index.php?subform=article&article_id=562", "http://www.relatetoautism.com/index.php?subform=article&article_id=563"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/commentary-on-results-of-world-autism-views-survey/", "title": "Commentary on results of \u201cWorld Autism Views\u201d\u00a0survey"},

{"date": "May 24, 2011", "body": "Back in 2009 I tried blogging about my son\u2019s autism as a therapeutic exercise that had been recommended to me by a friend. I felt awkward about writing about my son so publicly, so I didn\u2019t turn on the search feature, and abandoned it after only four posts. In 2010 I started keeping a written journal about my son, and at the end of 2010 I decided that I\u2019d attempt blogging again to seek out more interaction with others in the autism community. Obviously, I decided blogging was a good idea this time around, and kept at it. For the sake of completeness, and so I can just shut down that other blog, I\u2019m going to reproduce my original four posts below (none of them are particularly lengthy). So here they are: My\u00a0Son . January 17, 2009, 8:04 am This blog is about my son, who is on the Autistic Spectrum. He is three years old. We\u2019re on a very long waiting list for a full diagnosis of how \u201cbad\u201d he is, and in the meantime my husband and I struggle through everyday \u2013 learning what we can from anyone who will help us. This blog exists for three purposes: (1) To track his progress so I feel like there is actual progress \u2013 each day can feel like the one before and I need some way to remind myself that little wonders do happen here and there. (2) To reach out to other people, for their support and encouragement. (3) The hope that some people who read this will be able to give me advice and help, and maybe see things I\u2019m missing or taking from granted. The Wheels Off The\u00a0Car\u2026 January 17, 2009, 8:31 am My son loves anything with wheels, they are his obsession. First word out of his mouth each morning\u00a0is \u201ccar?\u201d as he pleads for a car ride. The task he completes each morning before he will have breakfast, and often before he will let us change his nappies, is lining up his scores of cars on the couch. They stay there all day, we\u2019re not allowed to move them, so we don\u2019t use the couch to sit on during the day at all. Through-out the day he adjusts his cars and lies his head down beside them to examine them up close as he carefully moves them into his idea of perfect alignment. Today we had a special moment. He takes the wheels off\u00a0 a lot of his cars \u2013 if they can be removed they tend to get removed. Then he throws the wheels somewhere that he can\u2019t reach them \u2013 usually over the boundary gate at the front door. Today he collected a lot of them on the way inside after we\u2019d been out in the stroller, and took them to his cars. It was a very hot day so I went to my computer to relax and rest my feet for a bit. One by one he bought in to me a wheel, and the correct car for that wheel. To understand how amazing this is you need to realise that he has literally scores of them, I would get tired if I tried to count them all (though I might attempt that tomorrow). He was choosing the right tyre for each car (that he had stripped off on previous days) and was bringing them to me to put back on. Each time I\u2019d take the tyre and I\u2019d say my usual phrase when he brings me a problem \u201cmummy fix\u201d. I\u2019d let him watch closely as I put the tyre on, and he watched quietly and calmly. Then he\u2019d take the fixed car, leave the room, and come back with the next. He did that about\u00a0four times. No words from him \u2013\u00a0he doesn\u2019t talk much at all and has never spoken a complete sentence \u2013 just that lovely calm determinedness that he always puts into his cars as he came and went. It might seem like such a small thing, but it is huge to me. Any little sign of comprehension, purposeful behaviour, and advancement, means the world to me. And in my books this fulfilled all three of those. Waiting\u00a0Lists May 6, 2009, 4:29 am My son is now three and a half. Back in February he was finally diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum. Other various professionals had told us they thought he was, but it was the developmental paediatrician at the children\u2019s hospital who officially got the ball rolling. After her diagnosis he got placed on waiting lists \u2013 so many waiting lists. Now two and half months later we\u2019re still sitting on those waiting lists and slowly going mad. We had a brief call from the occupational therapist who apologized for what would be a very long wait for us. She asked me over the phone whether there was anything specific I wanted her help with at the time. It was hard for me to answer that when I had no idea what her role and expertise was! I ended up in accidental tears to her through my frustration as I talked about all the things that were worrying me. She wasn\u2019t the last professional I would break down into tears to as I talked about my son. So we wait to see her, to see a physiotherapist, and a eye specialist, and a speech therapist, etc. I don\u2019t even know all the lists he\u2019s on! I know that making phone calls seems to change nothing, and just add to my stress and frustration. Everyone I talk to is very sympathetic and concerned for my well-being, but nothing ever seems to come of it. I need help, my son needs help, my family needs help. They say if you want help you have to ask for it, but they forget to tell you that you\u2019ll be placed on a very long waiting list before anything comes of it. Oh and, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, I\u2019m also pregnant with my next kid. It\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride\u2026 \n Progress July 31, 2009, 10:47 pm My son now has an amazing number of therapists involved with him on a weekly basis: An occupational therapist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, and an educational psychologist. He also goes to an ABA playgroup with other preschool autistic kids for two hours every week. He\u2019s also just got a placement at a local kindergarten, where the head teacher has experience with special needs kids \u2013 he\u2019ll start there in late August. Which is to say that a heck of a lot has happened and changed over the past couple of months! The steep learning curve keeps going \u2013 I have so much still to learn about the differences and conflicts between various therapies like ABA vs RDI. I\u2019m still forming opinions on the causes and diagnoses of autism, and on the relationship between high-functioning autism and Aspergers, vs more \u201cclassic\u201d autism. So much to learn, but a life-time to learn it, so I\u2019ll get there! My son is responding well to the various therapies and therapists, none seem to be harming him or setting his on a backwards path. At this point we are very much trying out a wide range of options and observing and evaluating their effects. My next child \u2013 due in December \u2013 is a boy. The pregnancy is going well and the baby-to-be is healthy in all checkable regards. We know it will be hard bringing up another kid when my existing son is already so much work and exhausting in so many ways, but we\u2019re feeling hopeful and happy on the whole. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/from-my-old-blog-discovering-my-son/", "title": "From my old blog: \u201cDiscovering my\u00a0Son\u201d"},
{"date": "May 27, 2011", "body": "My beautiful boys My first child was autistic. The fact that I hadn\u2019t raised or parented a child previously, had a huge impact on my experiences with and attitudes towards autism. The combination of first-time-mother anxieties and experiential ignorance, with a special-needs child who showed no outward sign at birth of his challenges, was rather devastating. It meant I was slower than I should have been to get my son the help he needed since I let those with (apparently) more experience and expertise undercut my gut-feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right. And it fed a strong sense of guilt that all this must be happening because I screwed up somehow; I clearly sucked both as a parent and as a breeder. I was evidently no good at this, I should have never tried to become a mother. The darkness I went through when my son was at his worst (and I didn\u2019t understand autism), was a previously unimaginable hell of isolation, self-blame, helplessness, mental exhaustion, all made worse (in my opinion) by the fact that he was my first-born and my only child. And I thought it might be that way for the rest of my days. I hated autism (not my son, I saw my son and autism as separate things which was a  very  good thing considering my state of mind), and I hated myself. The hatred didn\u2019t come out in anger though, it came out in frustrated tears, everyday. (I don\u2019t really cry at all these days, except when I slammed my finger in the door the other day, that made me cry.) The fact that my first intimate and lengthy experience with a child was with an autistic one, has also greatly impacted on my second child (who doesn\u2019t have autism). That impact on my second-born has been a particularly positive one, which does not sit flush with the warnings I\u2019d received about bringing another child into the family. I\u2019d been told that siblings of autistic children suffer; that they often feel neglected and have their life experiences limited because of the family trying to work around the autistic child. (I\u2019d also of course been warned that there was a good chance my second child would have autism too.) But I can see how my experiences with my first-born and his autism, have made me incredibly grateful of the things that drive other mothers mad, such as the destruction wrought by a toddler who actually wants to touch and climb on everything, and the non-stop noisy babble that comes from a child who actually wants to and can use words. My heightened awareness of social interactions due to my eldest\u2019s autism, has given me the ability to set up and encourage what is a particularly loving and gentle relationship between my boys, that people often comment on. I frequently get positive feedback about my youngest, from total strangers \u2013 gosh he talks a lot, gosh he\u2019s so social, gosh he\u2019s really a happy child isn\u2019t he! Yes, yes and yes. He stands out in his crowd of peers (and even older children) in all those regards, and I have no doubt that a fair amount of that is a result of his mum having parented an autistic child. It\u2019s not all sun and roses of course, his life is also negatively effected by his brother\u2019s autism in a variety of ways, but on the balance I do believe the effect has been positive. (And I must emphasize that this is a separate question from whether the effect is positive or negative compared to if he had otherwise had a neurotypical brother.) There is more to say (and I have more to say in future posts) on all of these issues, as to how the order of children effects attitudes towards autism, towards the autistic child, and their siblings. It\u2019s not just the order either, it\u2019s also the gap between children that appears to have a huge impact. Many of the problems I\u2019d heard about for siblings of autistic children, turned on the issue of parents going through \u201cgrief\u201d and learning about how to cope with autism; if there\u2019s not much of a gap then you\u2019re still going through this when the second comes along, so there can foreseeably be more resulting issues. I realise that this cannot be a discrete question of birth order; that experiences are also inevitably affected by previous education and experiences with children and special-needs, and of course the personality and support networks of the parents. But considering how intensely and completely life-changing it is to become a mother of someone \u2013 whether they have special-needs or not \u2013 it strikes me that whether it was your first or subsequent child who had autism, has a major role to play it all this. I can only really talk from personal experience and even that is limited by the fact my children are the young ages of five (and a half) and one (and a half). Still, those have been some interesting and life altering experiences, and as always it will be educational to hear about how they compare with others who read what I will write. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/27/the-impact-of-birth-order-on-attitudes-towards-the-child-autism-and-parenting/", "title": "The impact of birth order, on attitudes towards the child, autism, and\u00a0parenting"},

{"date": "May 30, 2011", "body": "\u201cThe Panic Virus\u201d is a tale of vaccines gone wrong and vaccines gone right, and how it is that autism got so tightly wrapped up with the issue of vaccine-injury. Seth  Mnookin makes it easy to understand how desperate parents and misguided scientists have become so dedicated to a weak and highly improbable theory: That vaccines have ever been a cause of autism. He is sympathetic to the plight of the parents; he does not underestimate their and their children\u2019s suffering. I rather felt that he was too kind at times, in that you are left with the picture that only alternative theories and treatments held any real \u201cpromise\u201d of answers and improvement (and that this is why some parents found them so attractive). It would have been wise to include at least a minimal section about the range of effective therapies that already exist and have lead to significant improvements in the lives of autistic children. He does provide very fleeting mention of ABA, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, but not in a way that informs the reader of their success and that they are a small part of a wider group of helpful therapies. Along the same vein, it would have been helpful to have more discussion about what we do know re various causes of autism, and more generally the evidence for alternative theories to vaccine-injury. Without this extra information on \u201cmainstream\u201d treatments and causes, a new autism parent reading this book may yet find themselves similarly attracted towards the alternative options he covers, particularly when it seems that the only other option available looks like an almost passive acceptance of the symptoms of autism (as illustrated through the presented views of the parents who will try anything and everything). I would hope though that Mnookin successfully counters this temptation, with his careful explanation of: the dangers of not vaccinating; the errors in reasoning that lead people towards accepting unproven or disproven therapies; and of course the very real dangers (including death) that can result from taking part in such \u201cnon-traditional\u201d options. He doesn\u2019t just make his case through the eyes of scientists, sociologists and judges, he also shares unforgettable stories that make the importance of this debate \u2013 and the consequences of ignoring science and reason \u2013 particularly real and emotional. The narrative is quite good: He makes a good effort to move the story along chronologically (which is hard to do considering the number of simultaneous issues at play). He lays good ground work for what will be discussed further along in the book, and he writes in a very accessible way. All these factors make this a particularly good introductory text for people who are perhaps not already familiar with the history, science, and large number of personalities involved. After reading \u201cThe Panic Virus\u201d, I have a stronger appreciation of those key personalities; prior to reading this I did not have a good grasp on the history of the big charities, organisations, websites and the people behind them. Having said that, the book does particularly focus on what is of most importance to current Americans, but I can\u2019t and don\u2019t flaw it for that, it\u2019s just particularly noticeable to an overseas reader. Autism parents the world over will have heard of Jenny McCarthy, Oprah Winfrey and Autism Speaks, so there is no doubt the US holds a central place in the autism-vaccine story. The book is very recent (2011), yet already it is dated, since key players (such as the Geiers) and key stories (such as the weak and distorted recent claim that autism-vaccine-injury compensation has occurred \u2013 and been hidden \u2013 in the US) would have fit very easily and relevantly into his discussion. However, that is the problem with writing about such a current and ongoing \u201cdebate\u201d, and is hardly a down-fall of the book; just a reflection on how important this book is right now. Indeed, the developments that have happened since his book was published, have just strengthened the arguments and conclusions that he presents in the book. He notes and discusses such developments in  his blog . (While you\u2019re there, it\u2019s worth checking out  the corrections  he\u2019s made to certain wordings and details in his book too; there\u2019s nothing too significant or major there \u2013 certainly nothing that weakens or undercuts his arguments and conclusions \u2013 but still some notable oversights that I think you should check out if you read the book.) On the whole, a solid book, quite well written, both well informed and informative. A good and accessible introduction to the issues and history of the vaccine-autism debates. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sethmnookin.com/blog/", "http://sethmnookin.com/the-panic-virus/corrections/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/review-of-seth-mnookins-the-panic-virus/", "title": "Review of Seth Mnookin\u2019s \u201cThe Panic\u00a0Virus\u201d"},
{"date": "October 9, 2012", "body": "Yet another awesome autism blogger \u2013  Sharon from \u201cThe Tumultuous Truth\u201d  \u2013 has called it quits. I\u2019ll add the words \u201cinactive blog\u201d to the link on my blog roll, as I have done for a fair few over the years. I\u2019ve had a look through the list of blogs I used to follow that have shut down, and I can\u2019t say I see any trend for the reasons why they quit: Sometimes it\u2019s life entering a different stage, or conflicts in the online community, and sometimes no reason is given at all. I\u2019m fine with all options; the blog writer owes no one an explanation as far as I\u2019m concerned. We start for our own reasons, and we stop for our own reasons. \u201cThe Tumultuous Truth\u201d is a favourite blog, that I checked on very regularly ever since discovering it. But what\u2019s better, was getting to know the writer herself, which only happened because we enjoyed each others\u2019 blogs (we had no other previous connection). I have an increasing number of friendships that have grown from blogging. Friends who make me laugh, and who sympathise with me when I\u2019m going through tough times, and who simply understand. They\u2019re people I may never meet, but there are all manner of ways of being close without actually being close. So yes it\u2019s sad that Sharon won\u2019t be sharing her awesomeness through her blog anymore. But blogging is for so many of us, just a blip on a much bigger radar. We cross lives with other bloggers and commenters for a while, nothing may come of it or something may come of it, but hopefully we part ways better informed and more enlightened than before we met. Like all those other bloggers, I wish Sharon the best, and thank her for all the great posts, and I encourage you to head over and check her blog out if you\u2019ve not previously had the pleasure. And I hope that the day I choose to stop blogging too, people can say it was worth my while doing this thing I do for the time I did it. Where do good bloggers go when they stop blogging? They\u2019re next-door, and in-line behind you in the supermarket, and in the playground. Good bloggers were always there alongside us, and will continue to be there, mostly unknown and unrecognised but changing lives and perceptions and educating all the same. Even an inactive blog can cause change for the better. Thank you Sharon, for being a voice for the good, and best of luck with your kids and your future writing, I look forward to following your continuing journey elsewhere: It\u2019s only just begun and yet you\u2019ve already come so far\u00a0 \ud83d\ude42 *** Edit: I am very pleased to see that Sharon has returned to blogging, please do pop over and check out the continued awesomeness readily available at  The Tumultuous Truth . \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.co.nz/2012/10/running-out-of-steam.html", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.co.nz/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/where-do-good-bloggers-go-when-they-stop-blogging/", "title": "Where do good bloggers go when they stop\u00a0blogging?"},
{"date": "May 29, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n There are a wide range of responses to the proposed changes to the DSM criteria for autism (due to come into effect in 2013). Some view it positively for the exact same reason that others view it negatively (\u201cAspergers will just become autism, this is great news / a terrible tragedy..\u201d). There are a lot of concerns about what this will mean for access to government support and school services. There are also worries about identity; specifically as to whether any particular child will still \u201cbe\u201d autistic under the new criteria. Worrying about access to services is natural, but there\u2019s not much point to it at this stage. Most services respond to level of need, not just the name of the diagnosis. This is particularly true of autism which is a spectrum disorder \u2013 some need extreme levels of help, others need and want none \u2013 and services respond to those differences. Either way, service providers will have to figure out how to respond to the changes, and until we get the chance to comment on any  proposed   service  changes to the  proposed   DSM  changes, it\u2019s all very premature and quite possibly un-necessary stress (for all we know, and as some have suggested, this will actually broaden the level of support for more people on the spectrum.) I have been particularly intrigued by the emotional responses of some people to the idea that their child will no longer be called \u201cautistic\u201d (or \u201cAspergers\u201d). Now they will fit under some other category of developmentally delayed, or intellectually disabled, or a number of the other new terminologies that appear to be created (or altered) by the proposed changes. Some complain that this is a conspiracy to kick the lowest functioning out of the disorder\u2019s name, others that is removes the specialness of keeping the name \u201cAspergers\u201d somewhat separate from the term \u201cautism.\u201d Me, I don\u2019t really mind. Call my son whatever he is, if he is no longer autistic under the new criteria (which looks unlikely, his autism is rather \u201cclassic\u201d), then that\u2019s fine with me. It\u2019s just a word, with a lot of emotional and historical baggage, but still a word, and one that hasn\u2019t existed for particularly long in human history either. As long as my son\u2019s still recognised as having some special needs \u2013 which he does and always will \u2013 I don\u2019t care if the title is \u201ctiddlywinks syndrome.\u201d Mayhaps it turns out he\u2019s actually some condition I\u2019d never heard of before, or a whole new one. I will learn all about it the same way I had to learn all about autism. Maybe it will give me new insights and understandings of what\u2019s really going on with him; that would be fantastic. I didn\u2019t think he was autistic when he was an infant. Finding out he was autistic for sure when he was three, gave me some answers, but a heck of a lot of questions too that remain unanswered, of most importance for a long time was: What \u201cmade\u201d him autistic? Regardless of what made him this way, there is no known cure, and it\u2019s highly questionable whether there ever will be. At the end of the day (and the start of each day), the fact is I have this child, with these challenges, and the way we deal with him each day responds to those challenges \u2013 regardless of what title sits at the top of that list of challenges (whether that\u2019s \u201ctiddlywinks,\u201d \u201cautism\u201d or \u201cAspergers\u201d). Is there benefit to knowing it\u2019s \u201cautism\u201d (currently so-called)? Well of course there is. It helps me understand his mind and his actions. Knowing it was autism was a short-cut to figuring out what might and does help him. But there are an ever-growing number of treatments and therapies connected to the name \u201cautism\u201d which also do not (and some that simply cannot) help an autistic child. So you still have to be a smart parent that sifts through the rubbish. You also still have to specifically tailor any worthwhile and effective therapy, to your specific child: To their specific challenges and the severity of those challenges. Even amongst the more useful therapies, there is variance in how they are practiced from one city or country to the next. Which is all to say, the word \u201cautism\u201d points you towards the gate of the correct amusement park, but doesn\u2019t tell you which rides to get on, or where the \u201cexit\u201d is located (or whether you should and ever could exit). It opens up a world \u2013 a community even \u2013 but there are no promises the other people taking the ride along-side you think you belong there too or agree with you about whether this is a good or sucky amusement park. Changing what the term \u201cautism\u201d refers to, affects the relevance of past studies and research and books and so many other things, but this is not a new problem. The term has changed before, more than once (particularly widened rather than narrowed), and though such changes do create a lot of confusion and misconceptions (such as autism numbers mysteriously skyrocketing), change in and of itself here is not an evil. And this is coming from a woman who has a particularly rigid personality \u2013 hating change \u2013 according to the broad autism phenotype test. Maybe I\u2019m all Pollyannerish here, but it just seems to me that a fair chunk of the up-roar and anger about shifting labels, is a bit \u201cthe end of the world is nigh\u201d when really the sun is just setting yet again. Maybe as more information comes out and I get to read more reactions, my own opinions will shift in kind. But for now, it seems to me, that autism by any other name, is just whatever autism is now\u2026 by another name. *** Here\u2019s a link  to the actual proposed changes. A couple of useful news stories about the changes, both touch on some of the issues I address in my post: \n \u201c Revised psychiatry manual targets autism.. \u201d (CNN, Feb 11, 2010.) \n \u201c Aspergers Officially Placed Inside Autism Spectrum. \u201d (npr, Feb 10, 2010.) \n And here\u2019s a selection of some interesting posts on the topic, illustrating a range of responses and attitudes towards the changes. It\u2019s worth reading the comments on the posts too: \n \u201c Proposed new autism criteria\u2026 \u201d by The Autism Crisis (Feb 10th, 2010). \n \u201c Who will be autistic in 2013?.. \u201d by Lisa Jo Rudy at about.com (May 27th 2011). \n \u201c Low Functioning Autistic Persons Remain Invisible.. \u201d by Facing Autism in New Brunswick (May 15th 2011). \n and \u201c Proposed Revisions to Autism Diagnosis.. \u201d by stark raving mad mommy (Jan 28th 2011), which is a great post, but extra fun because it gives you giggles too.

{"date": "October 12, 2012", "body": "The New Zealand Government decided  not  to appeal  the court decision that ruled in favour of the Ministry of Health paying people to care for their own family members  (a decision delivered in June this year). That is to say, the Government has decided to  allow  family members to get paid to care for their own children, instead of the previous status quo of specifically excluding family members from this pool of government funding. Before we get too excited about how these changes will affect us, keep in mind that they are only looking at allowing payments to carers of  adults  with disabilities (despite the fact that the reasoning in the ruling itself seems to apply wider than just to adult dependents); those of us caring for younger disabled children, are still evidently going to be excluded from accessing the pool of funding (this \u201cemployment\u201d), merely on the grounds of our family status. For example, there is a significant pool of funding that I am allowed to use to pay strangers to care for my son, but that funding cannot be granted to myself or my husband (even if we were in the position of having to give up our jobs \u2013 as I once was \u2013 solely in order to provide appropriate care to a very high needs child). The Ministry of Health is calling for submissions on how best to implement these changes, and is running \u201cworkshops\u201d around the country; details on both are available via  their website.  The closing date for making submissions is November 6th, 5pm. There are some key questions they are seeking answers to (italicized sentences are quotes from their official submissions form): What do you think is the best way to ensure that disabled people\u2019s interests and quality of life and those of their family are protected under a policy allowing family to be paid for providing support? That is to say, they are concerned about monitoring that both the disabled adult and the family are being looked after under the new arrangement. They make various suggestions, all of which read like extra layers of bureaucracy based on the presumption that parents don\u2019t know how to adequately care for themselves and their child. If I sound a little bitter and cynical, it\u2019s because I am: Parents have been caring for their disabled children all their lives \u2013 unpaid \u2013 but now that they can get paid the Government is worried it\u2019s not in the best interests of the disabled adult and the carer themself!? I get the concern, but I think it\u2019s over-stated and somewhat insulting. They then ask: Do you generally agree with a targeted approach to paying family carers? The \u201ctargeted approach\u201d they\u2019re referring to, is about introducing criteria that means only a subset of families who currently qualify for these support payments, would actually qualify for personal payment under the new payment scheme. It\u2019s a cost cutting measure (and they admit as much). Again, I\u2019m unimpressed. What this amounts to is the Government found it suitable to pay strangers to do the work for these families, but now that family member\u2019s can be paid too, they want to limit the group who qualify. So there are, it would seem, still going to be significant numbers of parents who cannot receive these payments, even though they are the relevant group of people the court ruled in favour of back in June. I\u2019m a bit bamboozled too; if the funding pool per person was already limited (it was  never  an endless source), then why now further limit the type-of-person (ie, \u201cfamily member\u201d) who can access that fixed pool of funding? Is that an admission that the pool of funding was regularly under-accessed, and now they\u2019re worried families will actually  utilise  what\u2019s available? As a family that regularly under-accesses the available funds because we can\u2019t find adequate care and carers for our son, this wouldn\u2019t surprise me. Or are they admitting they\u2019re going to significantly extend the funding actually available (and if so,  why , when the court decision was about being  excluded  on family status, not about there not being  enough  funding allocated?) They go on to suggest some criteria for the targeting, including: the remoteness of the disabled\u2019s adult\u2019s home; cultural or religious requirements; high or complex needs; and safety and well-being issues if the care was in a non-family member\u2019s hands. As far as suggested criteria go, they seem quite reasonable. Though it\u2019s hard again not to imagine extra layers of bureaucracy introduced to apply and monitor the criteria. In so many of the suggestions made on the submission form, I can see piles of much-needed funding disappearing into red-tape instead of getting to the families that desperately need it; frankly that\u2019s the way it already is, all of this looks to be much more of the same blundering mess. Which of these two ways of paying family carers for providing home and community support services do you generally agree with?  The two options they suggest, are paid as employment, or paid as an allowance. Then they ask for details of what family members should be paid for. Three suggestions are provided: (1) The family determines how much unpaid support they should provide, (2) a NASC (Needs Assessment Service Coordinator) determines how much unpaid support a family should provide, using a principled approach, or (3) a NASC uses a generic approach whereby each family is meant to provide the same amount of unpaid support. This is all getting at the point that the Government expects all families to do a certain amount of unpaid work in the care of their children \u2013 evidently, even their adult children \u2013 and are trying to quantify how much that should be (and are dragging NASCs in to help figure it out, I am  not a fan  of our local NASC, so I hate to think of them receiving even more power than they already wield). They offer up some potential principles for NASCs to use in making this decision. It\u2019s a lengthy list of options that I won\u2019t reproduce here. Basically it includes comparatives to non-disabled families, and the comfort of the disabled adult and the family member, and \u201c paid support should not displace support that is provided by a family carer freely and willingly, and that is within their capacity and ability .\u201d Etc. They also ask for a clear quantification of exactly how many hours per week a family member should be required to provide unpaid support. Around about this point in the questioning, you really start to think it would all be a lot better if they made it a simple allowance-per-family rather than a paid-per-hour-employment system. Which brings you nicely to thier next question about whether it would be best to create an allowance administered by Social Welfare, rather than a paid-carer system per se: \u201c The payment would recognise the contribution family carers make in supporting disabled people, rather than reimbursing them for providing home and community support services. Under this option, no other form of payment would be available .\u201d Under the allowance option, they ask whether you\u2019d want the payments tiered to need (again, as assessment by a NASC), or a flat rate (again, eligibility assessed by a NASC). Personally, I find the allowance option somewhat attractive, but I\u2019d like to see the flawed NASCs left right out of it, preferring whether someone meets criteria or not to be determined by the medical specialists who diagnose or deal with the individual in the first place, who perhaps go through a check-list (just like they currently do for the Child Disability Allowance), thereby removing costs, time, and bureaucracy in the process. It is this point which most tempts me to write a formal submission to the Ministry of Health. Their next question just puts the boot in: The Government would like  you  to tell it where it\u2019s meant to get the money from. It wants you to decide who else in the disability system should go without so they can do the legal and moral right thing of allowing family members to access these payments that they should have  never  been excluded from. Frankly it reads like someone who lost a court case about human rights, asking those who won the case to tell them how they\u2019re meant to pay to remedy the breach of those rights. Oh wait, that\u2019s  exactly  what it is. They offer up suggestions, like strict criteria for who qualifies, low rates or payments to allow them to reach all concerned, and \u201c reducing the level of disability support funding allocated across all disabled people receiving Ministry funded disability supports. \u201d And that\u2019s where the official submission form ends: Pointing out that doing the right thing costs money. I don\u2019t mind the introduction of stricter criteria, I don\u2019t mind that they can\u2019t afford to pay parents 40 hours of top-end rates to care for their disabled children. I  do  care about the legality and morality of what they were doing before (the system was always an unjust horror, still is, and foreseeably still will be after all this), and I  do  care about the threat of reducing the already minimal funding allocated to those with high needs in our country. We\u2019re in an economic crisis, I get it, but we\u2019re talking about people who can\u2019t hold down paying jobs because they\u2019re caring for their disabled adult children. We\u2019re talking about a Government that will pay complete strangers to care for your disabled children, but not you,  solely  on the grounds that you\u2019re related to them (regardless of your own qualifications, experience and training). I\u2019m not convinced that the Government has appreciated the gravity of what they were doing wrong and how many lives it was ruining, neither am I convinced that their consultation will churn out a better future for these individuals and their families. I very much would like to be wrong. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/jsmoorman/2298671281/", "http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/consultation-paying-family-carers-provide-disability-support-2012"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/the-consultation-on-paying-family-carers-to-provide-disability-support-why-im-not-impressed/", "title": "The Consultation on Paying Family Carers to Provide Disability Support; Why I\u2019m Not\u00a0Impressed."},
{"date": "October 15, 2012", "body": "As a parent of an autistic child, you get used to certain conversations repeating themselves when talking to parents of non-disabled children. Over time you lower your conversation-expectations and adopt pre-set responses, but it can still wear you down and make you feel like you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land; where disability is not considered part of the parenting experience, and is not to be genuinely discussed. Over the weekend I had a conversation with a woman while her son and mine played together as part of a team sport. She was eager to tell me many things about her life, and her own son, and particularly about her hardships, even though we\u2019d never met before. Who I was and who my son was didn\u2019t seem to interest her, but it was clear she desperately needed someone to listen and sympathise, so I politely listened with the appropriate expressions of \u201cgosh that must be hard\u201d and smiling or looking sad at all the right moments. What I really wanted to be doing was watching my son play the sport, so I could see where he was struggling and clap for him where he succeeded, but each time I tried to disengage the conversation she\u2019s just start talking again, and I didn\u2019t want to be expressly rude. This mother was particularly worried about her son\u2019s behaviours; she considered him to be rather restless, and worried about his sleep patterns. She wanted another child but didn\u2019t want to risk having another \u201cdifficult\u201d child. In order to show my understanding of her challenges with having a difficult child, I took the risk of telling her my own son had autism. With barely the beat of a breath, she responded with \u201cbut he looks so normal!\u201d I have so many potential replies to that statement, none of them are nice. So I just nodded and bit my tongue. Autism is an \u201cinvisible disability,\u201d you can\u2019t tell a child is autistic by looking at a photo of them. They often behave in certain ways that those who have experience with autism can pick up on very quickly, but if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for, then yes they\u2019ll look \u201cnormal.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have autism. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not disabled. The way they look means  nothing . Still, she clearly wasn\u2019t familiar with these points, so why beat her over the head with it? I was only trying to show empathy, not wanting to engage in an autism or disability lecture. But she had more to say. She wanted to know how I knew he was autistic. I tried to explain the early and very obvious signs. But each time I attempted to explain them, she compared my son to her (very obviously  not -autistic) son: \u201coh yes, my son did that too.\u201d Which is another pet hate of autism parents: Yes some children are speech delayed, some have coordination issues, some have their little stims, some have trouble making friends or like to be alone. None of that even comes close to what it is to have autism, and by saying \u201coh yeah, my son has that too\u201d you are belittling the severity of the condition and sound like you\u2019re challenging a specialist\u2019s diagnosis or the very condition itself. It is actually quite a combative thing to say for many parents, and encourages comparisons where they are inappropriate and inaccurate. But the last thing I wanted to do is get into a slinging match over autism versus normal developmental symptoms, so again, I bit my tongue and left all this unsaid. Once she\u2019d finished playing the comparison game about our children\u2019s behaviours, she decided to show sympathy for me by saying it must be so hard, then leapt straight into \u201cbut every child has problems don\u2019t they.\u201d Another predictable statement that makes me want to pull my hair out: Yes, I know some kids have physical disabilities, and mental disabilities, but the truth is the huge majority of kids do not have any serious conditions that impact on their daily lives. This sort of statement \u2013 \u201cwell all our kids have issues\u201d \u2013 again just belittles the frightening reality and incredible financial, physical and emotional hardships involved in raising a severely disabled child. The statement is not particularly insightful, it is just one of many platitudes people use to flat-line all our experiences, and again can be quite confrontational if said in a dismissive manner in this way. She was surprised that I had \u201crisked\u201d having a second child, when the first one had so many issues. I told her what we\u2019d been told: That there was at the worst, a 20% chance our second child would have autism, so an 80% chance of not going through all those challenges again seemed pretty good. She said she wouldn\u2019t have taken those odds. What to even say to that? I could have told her I\u2019d love any child I had, I could have told her even worse odds would have still driven me to try for a second child, I could have told her how insulting it was that she was commenting on my breeding decisions. But again, she was a stranger, I really didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation with her. She returned to talking about her life and her child, and the existence of my own son and his own issues were just a blip on her conversation radar. Which is fine because I\u2019d quickly had enough of her squinting at my son trying to discern his non-normality. I continued my polite listening and nodding, and come the end of the session I was very happy to be on my way with my \u201capparently normal\u201d son. Later I shared part of the story with my autism parent friends, and they came up with numerous humourous (and harsher) responses to when someone tells you your child \u201clooks normal.\u201d As lovely as it is to have a supportive, understanding group of parents to talk to about these upsetting conversations after the fact, the simple truth is the poor woman I spoke to that day meant well. She probably didn\u2019t really know what to say, stumbled her way through the uncharted territory, and clearly meant no out-right offense. The fact that I walked away from that conversation feeling a bit hit-over-the-head, and the fact that I\u2019ve had these exact same conversations with so many different people, is something she\u2019s no doubt oblivious to. Trying to correct all her misconceptions, and explaining why her words can hurt, would have taken more time and energy that I had to spare, not least of all because I kept trying to watch my own son playing his game. What\u2019s more, I am hyper aware now of people in this world who struggle with social interactions \u2013 since it is such a core and pervasive aspect of having autism \u2013 so I try to be gentle and assume the best of intentions, even when people so clearly screw up from my own perspective. I could choose to take offense all the time \u2013 god knows people are very good at causing it when it comes to autism and my son \u2013 but that\u2019s not a pleasant way to be or to interact with others (and I do try to be pleasant!) The alternative I more frequently adopt these days is not to mention my son\u2019s diagnosis or his special school or his challenges at all. It tends to leave a big gaping hole in my conversations with other parents I interact with \u2013 to not mention something so central to my child and my own everyday life \u2013 but in my experience all these other parents really want to talk about is their own child anyway; they only ask about mine to maintain the minimum level of politeness. And why not, I guess, we\u2019re all wrapped up in our own children, isn\u2019t that natural? I just get tired of having to constantly choose between predictable hurtful conversations, and keeping quiet about something so central to my and my son\u2019s life. The sense of isolation you feel as a parent of an autistic child, is on multiple levels: It can be the inability to leave the house with your child, it\u2019s the stares and judgments when you do, it\u2019s the lack of understanding from family and old friends as your life veers off in another direction. And it\u2019s in what you wish you could, but know you can\u2019t say, to strangers who think \u201cbut he looks so normal\u201d is both a compliment, and a denial of disability. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/predictable-conversations/", "title": "Predictable Conversations."},
{"date": "October 16, 2012", "body": "Did you know that you don\u2019t really love your child, and that you\u2019re lying when you say you do, because of your attitude towards their autism? No? Quote from a very recent comment over at  Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism : \u201c If you want your children to be happy and grow up healthy (autism or no) you have to fully accept them. That\u2019s what love is: plain, simple acceptance. It\u2019s a cold and painful truth that a lot of parents of autistics fail to adequately love them. They can keep saying it but it means absolutely nothing if the child doesn\u2019t feel accepted. \u201d I wish this was an anomalous comment, but it\u2019s the exact sort of comment I\u2019ve read far too many times since I started blogging, and it is so deeply flawed and intensely aggressive, that I have to say something\u2026 in fact, many somethings. First, love is not a quantifiable competitive sport. The love a parent feels for a child is utterly indescribable, and until you\u2019ve had one yourself it is hard to do justice. It is the kind that makes you lay down everything you own and treasure \u2013 including your own life \u2013 for that child\u2019s wellbeing and happiness. To tell a parent that their love is \u201cinadequate\u201d is an astounding mix of ignorance and meaninglessness; by what standard do they fall short? If the person doesn\u2019t do exactly what you think they should do, think exactly what you think they should think, their love will therefore be inadequate? What a terrifying prospect and suggestion (and I fail to see how else to read that nonsense); that someone has the monopoly on defining adequate love for a child. How utterly bizarre, and what a flawed proposal. Even the notion of acceptance here is so simplistic as to be unhelpful, and even damaging. Acceptance in a broad sense \u2013 for example, acceptance of a person, which is what matters here \u2013 is not to be confused with acceptance of every tiny aspect of what a person does, thinks and behaves. I accept my son utterly, I will always love him, no matter what he does. But in no way does that mean that I will accept his every action, his every thought, his every illness, his every challenge, his every word. To do so would be doing him a disservice as a parent: I need to be ready and willing to guide and educate and when necessary, judge him. Because that is what parents do. It is what we must do. All of us \u2013 not just those of autistic children \u2013 we all must be willing to help our children become the best they can be and to reach great heights. You don\u2019t do that by accepting everything about them in that less general sense; that is just confusing together two very different types of acceptance. Maybe I don\u2019t accept my son\u2019s bucked teeth, so I get him braces. Maybe I don\u2019t accept him hitting his brother, so he gets time out. Maybe I don\u2019t accept autism in all its manifestations in him, so I teach him to talk, and to not self-harm, and to read others\u2019 emotions. That does not mean I don\u2019t accept him, nor to even the tiniest extent, does it mean I don\u2019t love him. Absurd. Offensive. Ignorant. Note too that the commenter says that despite all protestations to the contrary, the love of parents like me, is a lie, because of this commenter\u2019s versions of acceptance and their criteria for love. So all my words, mean nothing. The outcome is pre-determined. How do you reason with someone like that? You can\u2019t, because they deny the value of your words and emotions. So I don\u2019t bother replying to them directly on someone else\u2019s blog, I come to my own, because here I respect and value other people\u2019s feelings, and I don\u2019t deny their genuineness, I don\u2019t tell them how to love, or that their love is inadequate, because I am a parent and I know how truly horrible those sorts of attacks are. Here, I feel safe to speak my emotions. The idea that love means nothing if a child doesn\u2019t feel accepted, is again, so removed from the function and role of parenting, that it is bizarre. Many children are frustrated because they think their parents don\u2019t accept their every decision, or they mistake their parents\u2019 actions and words for lack of deeper acceptance and love, when the parent is just doing what parents have done time immemorial: Challenged the child, helped the child grow and develop, and disciplined the child to help shape their moral character and aid them to make the right choices in life. That\u2019s our job. To not do it, would to fall short as parents. Sometimes that may leave the child feeling less than fully accepted, that does not negate the parents\u2019 love or make the parents inadequate; to say it does is to grossly simplify a parent\u2019s job and emotions. So this is what it comes down to for me: If you want to argue about what\u2019s best for a child, and what are good parenting practices, go for it. If you want to figure out the nature of autism and why it\u2019s good or bad, feel free. But the day you tell a parent their love is inadequate, you\u2019ve crossed a line you should have never approached. Our love for our children is something fierce, immeasurable, and endless\u2026 For a few it\u2019s not, but that few exist outside the autism world too \u2013 there will always be parents who abuse and neglect, even despite the depth of love they have for their child. Child abuse is so often the consequent of multiple factors, including parental mental illness, and should not be simplified to \u201clack of acceptance\u201d or \u201cinadequate love;\u201d that in turn over-simplifies the horrors that lead up to and come from abuse. To lump parents of autistic children in with abusers and neglecters, is to return to old disproven theories of refrigerator mothers; theories which damaged the children and needlessly tore loving families apart. Questioning love for the purposes of scoring points in a debate, is playing dirty and deserves no respect. I didn\u2019t want to write this post \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to bring attention to such views \u2013 but the fact is these cruel statements are all over the internet whether I comment on them or not. And I, for one, am sick of these cruel mind games: If you can\u2019t mount an argument without resorting to these lines of attack, then you had no argument to begin with. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/10/understanding-autism-acceptance.html", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/buttersweet/356056617/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/love-and-acceptance-youre-doing-it-wrong/", "title": "Love and Acceptance, You\u2019re Doing It\u00a0Wrong..?"},
{"date": "October 26, 2012", "body": "\u201cHope\u201d is such a positive word, and something we so effortlessly and kindly wish upon people in hardship: \u201cHave hope.\u201d \u201cThere is hope.\u201d \u201cHold on to hope.\u201d But the word can become painful when something you so desperately hoped for \u2013 your own child \u2013 turns out so extraordinarily different from what you\u2019d hoped, even when you\u2019d thought you\u2019d set your hopes low at the outset (\u201cI just want a healthy happy child who can grow up to have a family of their own one day.\u201d)  Having those hopes for your child\u2019s \u2013 and ultimately your own \u2013 future, seemingly ripped away by something as mysterious and misunderstood as autism, is deeply painful. A sort of pain that changes who you are, because you\u2019d do anything to not feel it again; to not go through that sense of loss and like your world has been tilted under your feet. A pain that makes you put up barriers to hope, that makes you more distant and cynical in an effort to protect yourself while you try to adjust to your new reality. When people talk of hope that your child will \u201crecover\u201d or \u201cget better,\u201d and you know the statistics are against you of that happening, hope can feel like a cruel tease, just setting you up to fall again. It\u2019s so hard to get your head around your and your child\u2019s new reality, that to even contemplate hope feels out of step with what you\u2019re trying to do in your daily life. And when people talk of hope, it can feel like they\u2019re in denial of your reality, or aren\u2019t paying attention to what you\u2019re going through right now; why are they talking about hope when you\u2019re just trying to figure out how not to be physically attacked and how to stop your child attacking themself too? In the mental and physical exhaustion, hope can feel like a waste of energy and thought; the here and now is everything, and demands everything of you. But there\u2019s a crueller twist of the knife, that you don\u2019t see coming: The people who will tell you in condescending tones, that you were a bad mother for ever hoping for your child to have a normal life in the first place. That a good mother would have just hoped for their child to be who they are, whatever that may be (regardless of how hard it makes the child\u2019s life). As if we as humans never dream of what our children might do, and what conversations we\u2019ll have with them, and what they\u2019ll look like, and who they\u2019ll love; as if these most natural wonderings and hopes, are a mark of a substandard parent. And it\u2019s not enough that your past hope was wrong, no, you\u2019re also a bad person for hoping your child will someday be different: that they will use verbal communication; that their stims won\u2019t mark them out for ridicule and bullying; that one day they might be so improved that the diagnosis of autism will no longer apply to them. That they\u2019ll be one of the extraordinary few who drop off the spectrum. Again, your very hopes mark you out as worthy of criticism. So at once, you see your hopes shatter, and you have people telling you not to lose hope, and you have others telling you your past hopes and future hopes are inappropriate and reflect badly on you as a parent. So you see, hope becomes a dirty word. The mere mention of it can make you cringe, because it carries so much baggage and pain and critique. A word that you once thought of as compassionate and reassuring, has become tainted with cynicism. And you find yourself reluctant to tell other parents in your same position, to have hope, because you know how redundant that can feel, and how simplistic and dismissive it can come across. Or maybe, that\u2019s just me. For some, hope is what keeps them going; reading stories of others\u2019 successes and rare outcomes gives them the strength to get through one more day. For me, I had to have the amazing successes I\u2019ve had with my own son, in order to reach the point where I now feel safe to hope again. Everyone else\u2019s success stories were only valuable to me for learning how to implement therapies and try new methods; not for finding that elusive and meaningful hope. I so want to reach out and give other parents hope now too, but I struggle to reconcile that with it being a dirty word for me for so long after my son\u2019s diagnosis. It has been four years since my hopes were shattered, and only now do I feel \u201csafe\u201d about rebuilding them; but different more mild and adjusted hopes, to what I now understand about my own son and about his own autism. Building hopes without that knowledge and understanding, would have set me up for heartache anyway. I\u2019ll say this to you then: Careful who you share your hopes with, because some will use them to judge and pigeon-hole you as suits their own agendas. If you put them out there, know that they may be misunderstood and used to hurt you, particularly in this highly charged world of autism politics. Don\u2019t be afraid to hope, but try to keep your hopes in context to reality, and the way you can best figure out your reality and what are realistic hopes alongside, is to get to know your own child and their challenges as intimately as possible. All those gurus selling you hope for money, don\u2019t know your child and their condition as well as you do, don\u2019t let them build and abuse your hope to hook you in; do your research and keep a level head. And please, don\u2019t let others make you feel miserable for daring to hope.

{"date": "July 11, 2012", "body": "Today I\u2019m sharing a guest post by my mother. I asked if she would write a piece about what it\u2019s like having an autistic grandson, and how it has been adjusting to that truth. I was inspired to ask her to share her experience after reading  this article  about grandparents adjusting to their special needs grandchildren. My mother was \u2013 is still \u2013 an amazing mother to me, and is now being a wonderful grandmother to all her grandchildren too. Here are her own words: I\u2019m a special grandmother \u2013 that\u2019s the way my autistic grandson makes me feel. He\u2019s loving and very bright and because I\u2019ve been a teacher of new entrants I have a lot of tolerance for his repetitive same questions and his \u2018happy dance\u2019 behaviour. I like the way he responds to things with such ready humour. Even before he started speaking he understood jokes. To start with, when he was two years old, I had trouble coming to terms with the potential of his being autistic but now I understand and appreciate him as a very interesting individual. His mother has done intensive research into autism and has worked hard with him to help him achieve to the best of his ability \u2013 and I can see, he is capable of a great deal more. I have met autistic adults in the happy niche of academia. He could well slot into a research department or into the world of holographic design or whatever movie making/computer games develop into for our future entertainment. What made me and him laugh the other day was when I brought out an A.A. Milne Christopher Robin book for him to read. \u2018It\u2019s called \u2018The World of Pooh,\u2019 I told him. \u2018The world   of  pooh ?\u2019 he queried in astonishment and he looked at the book. \u2018It\u2019s got a  lot  of pages.\u2019 He laughed and laughed and went a bit OTT falling on the floor with his laughing but that was okay. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing either. I know he has melt-downs and I know they\u2019re hard for his parents to deal with but they do. I have huge respect for them having managed him before they could reason with him and now too when he finds it difficult to accept reason versus his anxiety for something to be \u2018right.\u2019 I recall as a child being terribly upset when someone told me the car brake was \u2018on\u2019 when I believed it should be \u2018off\u2019 or the car would roll down the hill. If the engine was off, you see, the car wouldn\u2019t move forward so why shouldn\u2019t the brake meet the same criteria? Yes, I was an anxious child so I have some empathy for my grandson dealing with this messy world. Things just don\u2019t go along as you expect unless you can make some sort of order in your own little cave where the outside doesn\u2019t intrude. It takes a lot of growing up to discover the outside actually cannot intrude into the order you have in your own mind. That\u2019s where it matters and maybe our special boy will find that out too one day. I believe his autism isn\u2019t a broken mind. It\u2019s just a different way of fitting the world around oneself. Differences are necessary for human survival. Who knows? Just as people learn to read in a variety of ways, so people learn to view their universe too. A different way of looking at the world and understanding it to the degree that you can portray it to others around you might lead to a new way of relating to our planet that hasn\u2019t been considered previously. It might be the salvation of our species or the platform that springboards us all the way to the stars. The potential is unlimited \u2013 that\u2019s the way I see it and that is how it can be for my grandson. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.grandparents.com/gp/content/expert-advice/family-matters/article/special-needs-three-a-different-kind.html", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/73230975@N03/6874324473/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/guest-post-from-grandmas-perspective/", "title": "Guest Post: From Grandma\u2019s\u00a0Perspective"},

This time last year I did a post  recording all my stats and reviewing my most popular posts at that time, as well as mentioning my favourite bloggers.

My  Facebook page  had 89 fans, it now has 221.  My Twitter  followers have gone up from 241 to 583. I\u2019m quite chuffed with all those increases.

What brings those lovely people to my blog? My most viewed post continues to be \u201c Violence, Autism and Bad Parenting. \u201d Another violence related post comes in at number three: \u201c Autism and Violence Rhetoric .\u201d The most searched terms bringing people here are, accordingly, \u201cautism and violence\u201d and \u201cautism violence.\u201d I continue to be disappointed that these topics are what drive people to my blog, but I hope those people stick around and read some of my more up-beat and amusing posts while they\u2019re here. The most commented on post is still the one on  marijuana use for autism . Followed (not surprisingly) by the number of comments on my \u201cAutism, Violence and Bad Parenting\u201d post.

{"date": "October 29, 2012", "body": "The  DSM-5  (the updated diagnostic manual, due to come into effect next year), has made a change to the relationship between ADHD and autism. Previously, the two conditions could not officially be diagnosed together, due to an express exclusion under ADHD, which requires that the ADHD symptoms didn\u2019t occur during the course of a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (autism). The new ADHD criteria remove that restriction. \u00a0  Research (and plain good reasons) are  cited for the change . The reasons provided for the change are highly persuasive; the reasons for the initial (and continued) exclusion, are not. Particularly noteworthy reasons for the change, are that the medications used for ADHD can be of great benefit to those with autism who have relevant issues, and that it is possible there is a specific subgroup of those with autism who present with ADHD (which appears to be  about 30% ) \u2013 that there may be overlapping genetic influences for both conditions. It is also possible that those who present with both ADHD and autism, have different \u201cneurobiological and clinical correlates\u201d than those with just autism. So the forced separation of the two diagnoses, gets in the way of potentially effective treatments, and gets in the way of truly reflecting and understanding the relationship between these two conditions, and in turn the meaningfulness of the absence of ADHD from those with only autism. So why were they separated in the first place? Apparently a key concern was that autism would go under-diagnosed otherwise, and that those who would have benefited from autism interventions would be more likely to miss out, as the  autism inattentiveness would be confused with ADHD . ( One of the concerns  about allowing them to now be co-diagnosed, is that the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses will increase.) The fact is that medical professionals have already been diagnosing ADHD alongside autism (anecdotally anyway; I know of very many families who have had both diagnoses declared for their child). It\u2019s also already widely known that some ADHD medications are helpful (and used) for the relevant issues experienced by those with an autism diagnosis. It seems that this change is just bringing autism and ADHD diagnostic rules, in line with existing clinical behaviours and the body of research in this area. I don\u2019t know much about ADHD, ironically what I do know about it I almost exclusively learnt through personal research into autism and through autism blogs. My own son does not appear to have ADHD from what I\u2019ve read of the criteria. He does have many of the \u201cinattentiveness\u201d traits required for a diagnosis under that heading, but it is of a different qualitative sort of inattentiveness as I understand it; ways that can be, are sufficiently, and are better explained by his autism. I can clearly and easily imagine that there are cases where those ADHD criteria are met quite independently and in addition to the autism-caused behaviours. It\u2019s an interesting distinction though, and one I intend to do further research into. From what I understand, there is broad approval of this particular DSM-5 change. I would be interested to hear whether you think this change will impact on your own child\u2019s diagnosis / diagnoses, and whether you think the change is a positive one. I\u2019d be particularly interested to hear from those whose children already have both diagnoses, and what their clinicians said to them about the comorbidity when diagnosed. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dsm5.org/about/Pages/Default.aspx", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/monojussi/6842380323/", "https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/news/2012/new-rules-allow-joint-diagnosis-of-autism-attention-deficit", "https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/news/2012/new-rules-allow-joint-diagnosis-of-autism-attention-deficit", "http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/change-in-the-relationship-between-adhd-and-autism-in-the-dsm-5/", "title": "Change in the relationship between ADHD and Autism, in the\u00a0DSM-5."},
{"date": "July 12, 2012", "body": "Back in 2010, the ERO (the New Zealand Government\u2019s Education Review Office) released a Report that found only half of New Zealand schools demonstrated \u201cmostly inclusive practices for students with high needs.\u201d Subsequently, the Government came up with a policy (\u201c Success for All \u201c) which included a goal that 80% of schools do a good job of this by 2014. In 2011, 253 schools took part in a questionnaire to identify how well they were progressing towards this goal of inclusiveness.  A report containing the findings was released in April 2012.  According to the schools\u2019 self-reports, 88% of them now have \u201cmostly inclusive practices.\u201d Too good to be true? In this post I\u2019m going to have a look at what I found to be some of the more interesting pieces of information coming from that 2012 Report. One of the distorting factors in the schools\u2019 self-reports of their practices, is that they didn\u2019t use the actual questionnaire\u2019s definition for special education students. The questionnaire defined these students as \u201c those who have learning, communication, emotional or behavioural difficulties, or intellectual, sensory, or physical impairments. \u201d The intent was to focus on the higher needs student \u2013 the top 1% to 6% with moderate to high needs. Instead the schools used a very broad definition for special needs students, including gifted and talented students, those with English as a second language, and even \u201cboys\u201d as a special needs group. Having such a broad definition meant the schools\u2019 answers weren\u2019t about the top 1% to 6% needy student, but rather for half of the schools it was 7% of their students, and for one in eight schools it was a quarter or more of their students. Clearly this impacts on the reported inclusiveness of the schools for the most needy students. A second major issue in the schools\u2019 self-reports, was the notable lack of information about the actual achievement levels of the children with special needs; only 15% of the schools provided their Boards with such information. As the ERO Report notes, this makes it hard for schools to actually evaluate or accurately conclude on how effectively the school is including these students, or on how well their practices are working for these students. The schools instead focused on things like \u201cimproved attitudes\u201d or what they\u2019d done to include special needs students, apparently largely over-looking the actual gains made by those students. The 88% of schools which considered themselves to be \u201cmostly inclusive\u201d were not evenly split between primaries and secondary schools: Primary schools at 91%, secondary and composite schools at 64%. Of the remaining schools, only one said they didn\u2019t have some inclusive practices. In some instances, the school policies in themselves indicated that special needs children would not be included, if the school considered that it had insufficient resources. Statements along these lines are apparently contrary to key disability and education documents, specifically the  Education Act 1989 , the  Human Rights Act 1993 , and the  New Zealand Disability Strategy. The relevance of a school considering it has \u201cinsufficient resources\u201d as a valid reason to exclude special needs children, is thrown into sharp relief when you consider a point made later in the Report about funding and support issues: About half of the schools said the funding they received was insufficient, and 43% of the schools had difficulty accessing sufficient specialist advice. That\u2019s a huge proportion of schools that consider themselves under-resourced. Schools are not meant to suggest to parents that their children would be better off elsewhere, and are meant to ensure that all students with high needs can attend even if their teacher aide is absent.  News stories  collecting parent anecdotes, and stories I have personally heard many times over from many families, show that schools are often using these funding and general resource shortages as a reason to exclude special needs kids. In summary then, the schools self-reported findings looks good on the surface; with 88% of schools considering themselves as being mostly inclusive, surpassing the 80% target for 2014. However, as the 2012 ERO Report notes, there are very real limitations to the validity and accuracy of these findings, including the schools\u2019 changed definitions of \u201cspecial needs\u201d and the lack of backing evidence for the schools\u2019 views. In fact, the details of the Report show that there is real reason for concern about schools\u2019 practices and attitudes, and that we have a long way to go yet before there is meaningful wide-spread inclusion. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/OurWorkProgramme/SuccessForAll.aspx", "http://www.ero.govt.nz/National-Reports/Including-Students-with-Special-Needs-School-Questionnaire-Responses-April-2012", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/maistora/3237164755/", "http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM175959.html", "http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html", "http://www.odi.govt.nz/documents/publications/nz-disability-strategy.pdf", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10786481"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/how-inclusive-do-nz-schools-think-they-are-looking-at-a-2012-ero-progress-report/", "title": "How inclusive do NZ schools think they are?

{"date": "July 8, 2012", "body": "I\u2019ve been making my way through a book which is a compilation of the life stories of successful autistic adults, written by themselves. The compilation is brought together by Temple Grandin, and is called  \u201cDifferent\u2026 Not Less.\u201d  Once I complete the book I\u2019ll do a full review, but at this stage I want to write about a particular recurring aspect in the stories, which is already impacting on how I view autism and my son. These successful adults were typically diagnosed late in life, even though their autism (and associated conditions) were impacting on their lives from childhood. Late diagnosis of these adults is no mystery, considering the huge rise over the past two decades in awareness and recognition of autism, and the changes in autism criteria during that time. I wouldn\u2019t simply say their autism was too mild to allow diagnosis from a younger age; that doesn\u2019t accurately reflect what I\u2019m reading about their childhood experiences, and it does a disservice to the enormous amount of effort they put into making their lives what they have become. The stories of the impact diagnosis had on them, is interesting in a number of ways. Typically it was that the diagnosis allowed them to better understand themselves and their behaviours. As a \u201ctool\u201d you might say; something of explanatory value both of the past and their present. But it did not (at least in the stories I have read so far) become an  identity  per se (in the way that I have read many people refer to autism online). Autism is a useful truth about them, but it doesn\u2019t give them excuses or reason for personal restriction. These adults have been successful because they expected much of themselves and others expected much of them too. They didn\u2019t have preconceived ideas as youths about what jobs they might be suited to because of autism, instead they tried many different jobs \u2013 doing well at some, poorly at others \u2013 but always learning something new about themselves and the world from even the failures. They didn\u2019t all end up in predictable autism occupations (such as working with computers); they sought out and took opportunities as they arose, and ultimately followed their passions to success. Something Temple is clearly keen on herself, is the idea that autistic youths not get too caught up in their autism; that they don\u2019t make autism  itself  their passion. There are, after all, only so many jobs available for autism advocates, and few people who write about their own autism are guaranteed a living from it. Indeed, she has expressed that her own ability to be an advocate and speaker on autism issues, came around  secondarily  to her passion and success with cattle. I think there are some important considerations in there, and its slowly changing how I view autism too. I wonder how healthy it is to identify very closely and essentially with a term that is at the mercy of  the DSM and ICD scientists ; to identify intimately with a word that is still under redefinition. I wonder too about how identifying too closely with \u201cautism\u201d may encourage some to think autism pre-determines what they can do successfully with their lives. That taking it on as an identity would limit a person\u2019s view of who they are and what they might one day be capable of. I think it might be best then to think of autism as a \u201ctool,\u201d as I mentioned above seen in these adults stories. As a way to better understand themselves and a helpful guide to how to make your way in the world, for example by careful planning and being aware of issues with reading others\u2019 body language. In this way \u201cautism\u201d is a helpful rather than limiting concept. It is a piece of information rather than an identity. These thoughts are also impacting on how I\u2019d like to talk to my own son about autism, going forward. In the past I have talked to him about autism as a part of who he is, as something that affects his mind \u2013 in both good and bad ways. I\u2019m tending now instead to think I shall work towards him seeing autism as a word that helps him to be aware of how best to approach new situations (for instance), and how to encourage success more generally. Instead of \u2013 for example \u2013 perhaps one day telling him that autism makes it harder to read others\u2019 body language (which it does), and thereby avoid situations where this might be expected of him; I would focus  instead  on telling him that because autism can make it harder to read others\u2019 body language, he needs to be more aware of others\u2019 body langauge and work harder to understand it. Again, that autism is a helpful piece of information, but is not definitive of who he is or who he could be. It\u2019s an important difference. It\u2019s also making me less inclined to personally refer to someone as \u201cautistic,\u201d preferring instead the phrase \u201chas autism\u201d ( but I still wouldn\u2019t go around telling anyone else what term to use for others or themselves in this regard ). Of course accepting autism as an identity doesn\u2019t doom or necessarily limit someone\u2019s self-image; for many it is indeed empowering. I just think there needs to be real caution about how we particularly encourage our children to view autism as an intimate and essential part of themselves, especially at a time when the definition of autism lies in strangers\u2019 hands. The constant of my son \u2013 his identity \u2013 is more than autism. Autism makes his life harder in a multitude of ways, and easier in some, but who he is and what he will become is ultimately up to him; autism is just along for the ride. My views on this topic are still evolving. Even though I\u2019ve had my son\u2019s diagnosis for almost four years, I am still \u2013 and will probably forever be \u2013 learning what this means for him and for me as his mother. I know writing about \u201cautism as identity\u201d tends to invite passionate and sometimes aggressive responses. I only ask that if you respond to this post, you keep in mind that I am still learning and am ever willing to learn; teach me instead of attacking me, if you\u2019d like to make me see things differently. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Different-Not-Less-Temple-Grandin-Tony-Attwood/9781935274605"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/08/autism-as-a-tool-rather-than-an-identity/", "title": "\u201cAutism\u201d as a tool rather than an\u00a0identity."},
{"date": "July 13, 2012", "body": "I recently realised that people with diametrically opposing views on the existence and validity of conditions like autism, appear to make the same argument about the modern trend to \u201cpathologize normality.\u201d So I decided to break-down the argument that is otherwise so briefly summarised in that phrase. At which point it became clear that the \u201cpathologizing normal\u201d argument can stand for (at least) two very different views of humanity and of mental difference; that the seeming agreement on the phenomenon was strictly superficial. So, for the sake of clarity \u2013 and the hope of more open dialogue next time I encounter the phrase \u2013 I want to attempt to explain these two versions, as I understand them. The first version goes something like this: There is a modern trend to put labels on completely normal children. On children who are just a little shy or withdrawn, or just full of energy, or just poorly disciplined. These children don\u2019t have ADHD or Aspergers or ODD etc, they\u2019re just the perfectly normal kids we\u2019ve always had in society, but are now receiving these trending labels because of various motivations. Examples of those motivations include parents who refuse to accept their own parenting is at fault, and clinicians who want to make money from providing therapies and drugs to these kids. When it comes to adults seeking and attaining these labels for themselves, it is because these adults want excuses to behave poorly / avoid taking responsibility for their behaviour. The fact is that conditions like these don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s just the pathologization of normal (however undesirable or unpleasant that \u201cnormal\u201d may be). The second version of the argument goes something like this: Conditions like Aspergers, ADHD etc, are real \u201cconditions,\u201d but they are part of the normal human spectrum of experience and existence. These conditions are treated though as if they are wrong and need \u201ccorrecting:\u201d These people are put on drugs and through endless therapies and in other ways told that what they are is wrong and must change. Instead we should be supporting and encouraging these individuals to be the best they can with their talents, and to work with their challenges in a positive light. We shouldn\u2019t be labeling them as sick or deficient, to do so is to pathologize normal. This second argument often comes hand-in-hand with an attack on any attempt to define \u201cnormal.\u201d They frequently question the validity of a distinction between \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cabnormal,\u201d instead using the word \u201cnormal\u201d in this context to capture the point that human experience is brilliantly diverse and valid in all its diversity: That pathologizing people with Aspergers (etc) is a denial and attack on that necessary and natural diversity. Both versions of the argument have a few things in common: Concern about the impact \u2013 and abuse \u2013 of labels; concern about the perceived readiness with which professionals turn to drugs to deal with \u201ctroubled\u201d people; and concern that various conditions are included in mental health manuals at all (or the ways in which those conditions are defined in those manuals). However the views clearly and seriously diverge when it comes to perceptions about the legitimacy of the conditions at issue, and that is at the very core of the first version of the argument. Furthermore, the seeming agreement on the concerns listed above, is largely superficial. For example, whereas the first version of the argument would see a label like \u201cAspergers\u201d to be negative and unhelpful, the second version may see the label as something helpful and positive to be proud of. And whereas the first version argumenters might want conditions like these wiped from the \u201cmental health\u201d manuals altogether (and not continue to exist anywhere else either), the second version arguers may wish the conditions to be less negatively defined and not be considered a type of \u201cdisorder\u201d rather than a difference. So next time you encounter someone who wants to run a short-hand argument that we\u2019re seeing a modern trend of pathologizing the normal \u2013 that what was once treated (or should be treated) as normal and natural, has come to be seen as sick and abnormal \u2013 before you agree with them and wonder how you disagree on everything else but see eye-to-eye on this, now perhaps you\u2019ll be better able to identify just how deep that disagreement really runs. I, at least, have been in this position in the past and not being able to pin-point the very real difference in views. I\u2019d be interested to hear whether you have used the shorthand \u201cpathologizing normal,\u201d what you personally meant by it, and why you hold the view. I know some of my commenters in the past have tried to argue that this is a modern trend, I would love to hear whether I\u2019ve captured your concerns, or if there\u2019s a third version of this argument that I haven\u2019t even considered yet. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/exfordy/128576390/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/two-versions-of-pathologizing-normal/", "title": "Two Versions of \u201cPathologizing Normal.\u201d"},
{"date": "July 15, 2012", "body": "I\u2019ve had quite a bit of interest in  the book I created for my son  that told him he has autism. So much so that I\u2019m thinking of offering the service to others: Creating highly personalised books that introduce a child to their autism. The book would include photos and wording based around the child\u2019s own life and family and experiences, put into a template that I\u2019ve already created. The general idea behind the book is teaching the child that everyone has differences, and autism is their own \u201cspecial difference.\u201d I\u2019ve done various costings and am thinking now of putting the money into the start-up costs. But before I take that financial step, I wanted to get a better gauge of the level of interest in such a book. At first I\u2019d focus on the New Zealand market \u2013 which keeps costs low and payment simple \u2013 so I have two polls below to help me figure out if this will work or not; an international poll and a national (NZ) poll. The cost of the final product would likely be between $20 and $30 (NZ dollars, inclusive of postage). Please only say \u201cyes\u201d in the poll if you honestly would consider buying the book in that price range. I ask that if you have any comments about the idea, that you share those through the comments section too; perhaps the idea would be more attractive if it was modified in some way..? I\u2019m thinking about producing one (or more) free trial books to get feedback too (free except postage, and only available to New Zealanders at this stage). If you would be interested in helping me with that trial phase, then let me know that via the comments (by commenting I will be able to see your email but the public won\u2019t). If you express interest in a free copy I would hold onto your email to let you know when (if) the books become available for general sale too, so please  do not  put your hand up for a free copy unless you are  genuinely  interested in being contacted further about the book via email. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll ultimately go ahead with this idea or not \u2013 I really would like to \u2013 but this polling is a good place for me to begin figuring out if it\u2019s worth the cost and time.

{"date": "July 22, 2012", "body": "Many years ago \u2013 when I was a university student with a different surname, and hadn\u2019t yet heard the word \u201cautism\u201d \u2013 I bought myself a kitten for company. A particular incident that happened soon after I got her, has stuck with me very strongly ever since, and illustrates something that bothers me when it comes to watching adult-and-child interactions now that I have children of my own. A friend was visiting me at my flat, and of course I introduced him to my new kitten. My friend took a rather intense and perverse joy out of teasing and fooling my kitten (in unkind ways), which culminated in him announcing in a very condescending and dismissive manner: \u201cstupid cat.\u201d My immediate thought was how poorly it reflected on him that he felt it necessary to illustrate himself to be smarter than, and able to outwit, a tiny kitten. That he felt announcing the kitten\u2019s \u201cstupidity\u201d to me was something amusing and worth sharing. It did change how I felt about and saw him; I know it may seem like a small incident to some, but I loved that kitten until the day she died, and anyone who took joy out of proving and declaring a new kitten to be inferior to an adult human, was inferior themself in my eyes. Now, over a decade later, I see the same sort of behaviour and perverseness present when other adults set out to \u2013 and succeed \u2013 in fooling and misleading my children. This is particularly true for my autistic child, who\u2019s literalness and taking people as honest and trustworthy (much more so that his neurotypical peers do), leaves him particularly open to being mislead. These adults who set out to misteach him, are kind people who think they are amusing him (and amusing themselves in the process), but all I see is a fully grown adult who is trusted and knows they are trusted, abusing that trust to teach my children lies. The sort of lies and misteachings I\u2019m talking about range from the seasonal lies of Santa and Easter Bunnies and Tooth Fairies, to lies about how the world works and what consequences come of behaviours (eg, your fingers will drop off or your eyes will go blind). The sort of lies where the other adult winks at me as the parent, as they supposedly share this joy in their ability to lie so convincingly to someone who is looking to them for answers. My autistic son is always asking questions, endless questions, and he listens to and takes in the answers he receives. Each answer he gets typically spins off into another volley of questions. He takes answers seriously, incorporates the knowledge it provides, and will reference those answers in the future as he tries to make sense of this world. So each false answer, each intentional lie or misteaching, just necessitates more lies in answer to the flow-on questions. The alternative is to admit one lied to him originally, which confuses him and requires him to unincorporate the information that had been given to him, which he often finds hard to do. I spend far too much time un-teaching the easy pointless lies of other adults, who should have just taken the time and respectful approach of telling my son the truth when he seeks them out for knowledge. It\u2019s not that my son doesn\u2019t recognise and enjoy fantasy \u2013 he surely does. But he needs to be told when something isn\u2019t real, that doesn\u2019t come naturally to him in the way that most children can identify if an adult is intentionally pulling their leg. Unlike other children too, my son doesn\u2019t just hear a fancy story and then go back to whatever he was doing; he tends to obsess and desperately try to make sense of what he\u2019s told. It\u2019s a good trait for learning \u2013 he is an absolute knowledge sponge at times \u2013 but it is unhelpful when he is around adults who think lies are easier and more amusing than the truth. The fact is though that I feel the same about my younger \u2013 non-autistic \u2013 child. I don\u2019t want adults lying to him for them own amusement either. I want him to grow up knowing that Mum and Dad \u2013 at the very least \u2013 are trustworthy sources of knowledge. That we would not, do not, lie to him for the sake of our own amusement. That he can safely learn from us and always come to us for guidance. He too will grow up around fairy tales of dragons and magic, but he will know they are not real, and will be none the poorer for that knowledge; I am a firm believer in the notion that the real world \u2013 that truth \u2013 holds far more magic and wonders than any fairy tale ever could. As Douglas Adams so beautifully put it: \u201c Isn\u2019t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? \u201d I understand why some adults lie to their own children \u2013 that is their own parenting choice \u2013 but I do not enjoy or accept it when adults lie to my children. I do not laugh along when adults misteach children, any more than I laugh when a grown adult human outwits a tiny kitten in a way that confuses and upsets the poor creature. I think there is more joy in trust \u2013 and in reality \u2013 than in all the Santas, mermaids and fairies in the world. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/stillburning/2192164993/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/outsmarting-kittens-and-misteaching-children/", "title": "Outsmarting Kittens and Misteaching\u00a0Children"},
{"date": "July 17, 2012", "body": "\u201cDifferent\u2026 Not Less\u201d is a compilation of life stories from 14 adults on the autism spectrum. The stories were brought together by Temple Grandin, who also has a chapter at the start and end of the book, and briefly introduces each of the writers at the start of their own chapters. Temple provides and reinforces themes through-out the book; her views and intent behind the book, are also clear in the choice of contributing authors. The sub-heading for the book nicely sums up why you\u2019d consider buying it, or who you might consider buying it for: \u201cInspiring Stories of Achievement and Successful Employment from Adults with Autism, Asperger\u2019s, and ADHD.\u201d One of the main reasons I bought it was to be able to share it with my son; to provide relevant and meaningful role models. However, having read it, I would be careful about when to introduce it to him: Some of the stories have adult content (though not graphically) and some are quite depressing at times, so I\u2019d hold off sharing it with him until he was perhaps an older teenager. The childhood stories of the contributors provide mixed backgrounds in terms of \u201clevel of functioning,\u201d though they tend to be what most would call \u201chigh functioning\u201d or at the mild / Aspergers end of the spectrum. This doesn\u2019t mean their stories and experiences aren\u2019t relevant or useful for those of us with more \u201cchallenged\u201d children: Reading about how to encourage success and support people with social, sensory, and language issues, from the insights of their personal experiences, is helpful across the board. As a parent, I found a few important lessons scattered through-out the book, but best summarised in Temple\u2019s own chapters: About how to effectively utilise the intense interests of a child to help them towards employment, the importance of mentors and of using non-conventional means to find employment, and keeping an open-mind about what an individual autistic child might do with their lives (not letting the stereotypes \u2013 or even intense interest in autism itself \u2013 hold back or definitively define a child\u2019s future). As relevant as it was to read actual examples of these lessons put into practice \u2013 through the individual life stories \u2013 I personally did not enjoy and take away as much from those life stories as I did from Temple\u2019s own words. I also found myself frequently (and uncomfortably) \u201cclashing\u201d with the writers\u2019 personalities and the ways they treated and thought of other people in their lives. But perhaps that\u2019s part of what the book reveals; inner autistic difference from \u201cneurotypical\u201d ideals and expectations. I think that being a parent of a child who was so intensely and severely affected by their autism, also skews my view of the challenges these adults faced: Parenting a child who struggles with even the simplest communication, and whose repetitive behaviours get in the way of learning and basic social interaction, gives me a different reference point of the daily struggles of autism. To put it another way: I would be \u201cglad\u201d if my child faced the challenges these adults had faced, because that would mean he was doing amazingly well compared to what he currently faces. For all that, I\u2019m still glad I read the book. I think it provides multiple windows to the autistic mind, and provides strategies and insights for success (and not just for autistic people I might add!) I\u2019d hesitate to recommend it to parents of particularly challenged autistic children, but yes I\u2019d otherwise recommend it to parents and especially to young adult autistics who need inspiration and to feel like others have been there before and made it work. I did walk away from the book with a renewed respect and interest in Temple Grandin herself, and I will be pursuing more books by her to further access her insights on how best to help children like my son. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/different.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/review-of-different-not-less-a-collection-of-life-stories-from-autistic-adults/", "title": "Review of \u201cDifferent\u2026 Not Less.\u201d (A Collection of Life Stories from Autistic\u00a0Adults.)"},
{"date": "July 23, 2012", "body": "Tonight, the current affairs show \u201cCampbell Live,\u201d produced yet another story about the education system here in New Zealand letting down children with special needs. The story is entitled \u201c Struggling through the system .\u201d It is about a 13-year-old girl who performs academically at \u201cLevel One,\u201d basically at the level of a five to six year-old. She has  2q37 deletion syndrome , which has significantly impacted on her ability to learn and her ability to carry out basic physical skills; she has an obvious and established intellectual disability. (And for my autism readers, as you may suspect, it is associated with autism too; \u201c About 25 percent of people with this condition have autism .\u201d It is however an extraordinarily rare condition.) Yet despite this child\u2019s obviously high needs \u2013 for educational, physical and social interaction supports \u2013 she apparently will not qualify for any government funding at high school next year. Not surprisingly, the prospect of high school without adequate support, is is a daunting and seemingly impossible one in the mother\u2019s eyes. The mother has fought for supports \u2013 she has a file full of denied applications \u2013 but she feels she\u2019s now left with little option but to keep her child home from school rather than dump her in a mainstream high school. (I intentionally use the word \u201cdump\u201d here, since I am strongly opposed to those who claim special needs children are \u201cdumped\u201d at special schools; I feel the reverse is closer to the truth, that special needs children are dumped in mainstream schools these days. I have  written a post on this previously  for those interested in that aspect of this debate.) I\u2019ve become sceptical of these local media stories about special needs funding, since they rarely confront and explain the complexities and varieties of special education resources available in New Zealand schools. In my experience, the media tend to simplify these issues to the point of very real distortion. Also, a large number of these stories seem to be about the parents holding tightly to an ideology about mainstreaming always being the better option than special needs schools, even when the stark reality for their child is high needs requiring the services provided through a dedicated special school. But that was not this story. This mother recognises her child\u2019s needs, and has no ideology blinkering her to what may be in the best interests of the daughter she has (instead of the daughter she wishes she had). She appears to be a very engaged and accepting mother. Her pain and frustration with the education system is heart-rending, and fully understandable. How is it even possible, that her daughter does not qualify for ORS, or any of the lesser funding options? From what I could see on the Campbell Live story, the child neatly fits  criterion 5 , almost to the word. For example: \u201cTowards the end of their schooling students who meet Criterion 5 will still be working within Level One of the New Zealand Curriculum\u2026\u201d (feel free to click-through and read the rest of the criterion too, it seems to fit her very well.) I\u2019m no expert on ORS, but I am somewhat familiar with it, and my son receives it. I really struggle to see why the girl was rejected. Of course, ORS funding is for those with the most need; those who are most severe. According to the Ministry of Education, this girl is not severe enough (despite apparently neatly fitting into their criteria). I\u2019m sure they know more about the child than I do, and about the severity of those who are consider worse than her and therefore fitting into the system. But at some point these decisions quite simply appear to depart from common sense. This child doesn\u2019t even appear \u201cborder line\u201d to me; she clearly needs very real support at high school. Furthermore, without that support, the mother \u2013 who knows her child better than anyone \u2013 feels she simply could not send her child to school. And I think in her position, I\u2019d feel and do the same. It was how I felt before my son was granted ORS funding. Her desperation, confusion, fear, are emotions so many parents of special needs children go through waiting to hear about, and when left without, adequate (or in her case, any) special education funding. The child was receiving adequate funding to attend primary school \u2013 including an aide \u2013 but now she\u2019s to be left without. Why? Did she suddenly lose her diagnosis? Take some monumental leap in development that disqualifies her because she\u2019s too capable now? According to the Ministry, it\u2019s a potential \u201cyes\u201d to that second question, since she has learnt to read. That\u2019s right, she learnt to read. Nowhere in the ORS criteria do I see \u201clearning to read\u201d being an exclusionary consideration. How does \u201ca 13-year-old child learnt to read\u201d prove they no longer need help? My son can read, as can many of his classmates. They all receive ORS (though yes I recognise many of them will come under different criteria than criteria 5, but I stand by my observation as relevant). What this comes down to is a judgment made by the people at the Ministry of Education, and it appears to be an erroneous one. They have processes for disagreeing with decisions they\u2019ve made, I have no doubt at all that the mother has been working her way through that hefty re-application bureaucracy already. I want to have faith in our education system. I keep hearing how we supposedly have world-class standards of teaching and education here. So why are we so clearly and constantly failing the neediest students? How can we hold our heads high in education in this country, when we put our most vulnerable students \u2013 and in turn their incredibly vulnerable parents \u2013 through this hell. Why is it so confusing and unclear why one child gets the funding, and another falls short; there appears to be a serious lack in consistency and transperancy. I get that special students are the hard cases, and that we should be careful about judging a system by the areas where it is the most challenged, the system may be succeeding for the majority of students (the \u201cnormal\u201d students, but I understand this claim is highly questionable too). But when the minority that is falling through the cracks, is a group of people who had no say in the hardships they faced \u2013 who are innocent of any wrong-doing and have done everything the state has told them to do and then some \u2013 you\u2019ve got to see that something is very wrong with the way the system is set up. I feel for this woman, and this lovely child. I don\u2019t know how to help them. Teacher unions revolt when their own mainstream jobs are under threat. People protest on the streets when the country\u2019s assets are for sale. Where are the masses crying foul for these families? How many crying desperate innocent families talking about the same system failures, do we have to see on the television or newspaper each week, before people demand change? Or are families like mine \u2013 like this girls\u2019 \u2013 too different, too \u201cother,\u201d to grab the public\u2019s mainstream conscience. At least \u201cCampbell Live\u201d is making the effort to bring this to the public attention. What the public \u2013 what the government \u2013 does with that, is yet to be seen. *** I\u2019ve decided to add a poll to this post, to get a feel for the public sentiment towards, and experiences with, New Zealand\u2019s special education system: Take Our Poll \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.3news.co.nz/Struggling-through-the-system/tabid/367/articleID/262340/Default.aspx", "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/2q37-deletion-syndrome", "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/2q37-deletion-syndrome", "http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/PublicationsAndResources/FormsAndGuidelines/ORSGuidelines/ORSCriteria/Criterion5.aspx", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/6409927"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/campbell-lives-struggling-through-the-system-and-the-nz-education-system/", "title": "Campbell Live\u2019s \u201cStruggling through the system,\u201d and the NZ Education System (+\u00a0poll)"},
{"date": "May 2, 2011", "body": "\n Image by laurie.mcgregor via Flickr \n I was taught not to use \u201cum\u201d when I spoke, it makes people sound uneducated and can become quite grating. But when I learnt French, I was specifically taught to use the French equivalent when pausing to find the right words (an \u201ceuh\u201d rather than a \u201cum\u201d). The use of such filler words serves a purpose that comes to the fore when learning a new language: It signals a pause while you try to find the right words. I hadn\u2019t realised the significance of all this until my autistic son started saying \u201cum\u201d across the past week. Spoken language does not come naturally to my son. There was a time when it looked like he was going to be largely non-verbal. Each small language step has been hard-won. From single words with occasional correct use \u2013 mostly pure echolalia \u2013 to two words together, to pre-taught sentences, to slowly inserting his own variations in those sentences. He\u2019s had a developmental spurt over the past two weeks in his spoken language; he\u2019s increasingly using pro-nouns instead of just nouns, his sentence structures are getting better, and he\u2019s creating more independently structured expressions instead of so often using pre-heard ones. And then there\u2019s the um. Because he struggles to find the right words, there can be incredibly long pauses before he\u2019ll answer a question, or in the middle of his sentences. (Which I must say, I prefer over the endless perserveration which often ends in melt-downs, but that\u2019s for another post.) It\u2019s hard to figure out whether those gaps mean he hasn\u2019t heard us or whether it signals the end of his sentence. If we try to prompt him or continue the attempted conversation at the wrong times \u2013 having mis-read the pause \u2013 he can understandably find it very upsetting. He can\u2019t yet say \u201cI hadn\u2019t finished\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m thinking\u201d. The \u201cum\u201d now fills those voids. We now have that vital social cue that there is more to come, that he is processing, that we need to be patient and let him find the way to turn his thoughts into words. No one taught him \u201cum\u201d (that I\u2019m aware of \u2013 it would be an odd thing to intentionally teach a child). Yet there it is. So completely normal. So beautifully functional. So gosh darn helpful. I\u2019ve never been so happy to hear ums, I never truly appreciated how awesome that little noise could be. Something we take for granted, and actively try to un-teach students, is making the communication in this house so much healthier, calmer and more effective. Autism makes you notice the little things, even the importance of the gaps between the little things. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/73524884@N00/3467010071"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/um/", "title": "Um"},
{"date": "July 29, 2012", "body": "The mother of Julian Stacey wants lessons to be learnt from the loss of her son. It is with that desire in mind \u2013 and the deepest sympathy and respect for the family \u2013 that I write this post. In order to get as complete a picture as I could of what happened in this case, I have read the original decision as well as listened to radio interviews and read numerous news reports. What follows is my summary, and views, of this tragedy. In 2010, an 11-year-old autistic boy escaped from a respite facility here in Auckland, the facility is called \u201cSpectrum Care.\u201d The boy had the cognitive functioning of a one to two-year old child. He was found, drowned, in a near-by duck pond. A decision released last week by the Deputy Health and Disabilities Commissioner, found that Spectrum Care had failed in its duties to this child. Julian had been attending the centre since 2006. He had previously successfully escaped from the facility; not once, not twice\u2026: \u201cIn 2008 he escaped four times, and then twice in 2009.\u201d (In 2009 he\u2019d attempted escape three times, but was only successful twice. Another report I accessed said he\u2019d attempted to escape five times in 2008 and succeeded twice, so there is apparently some discrepancy in the reporting here, but the point is the same.) The facility knew clearly and first-hand the risk of escape, labeling the risk as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d in their crisis plan, and noting that the child had no road safety sense and was vulnerable to strangers should he escape again. They also knew he was drawn to water, and had noted that the duck pond which was 250 metres away, should be checked first if he\u2019d wandered off. With them knowing his history of escape first hand, and knowing the multiple and serious risks to his safety in the likelihood of escape, it is shocking to me that this facility \u2013 a facility\u2019s whose job it was to keep the child safe in the care of trained and paid employees \u2013 failed in this way. The factors that came together to lead to this outcome, were not seen as fatal by themselves. But in combination, they were deadly. They include the presence of two very new staff members (each with only a month\u2019s experience), among the poor staff ratios at the time (poor staff ratios caused by delayed parent pick-ups that day). Also, crucially, there was a back gate that hadn\u2019t been physically checked for being locked. A gate that could be opened from the outside (apparently intentionally so as to allow emergency access). There was a history of children who played in the park nearby, coming in via the back gate to retrieve lost balls. The focus of trying to make sure Julian didn\u2019t escape was on the front door, but it was through one of these back gates that he ultimately last escaped. (For a summary of the key factors leading to the escape, see paragraph 154 of the decision; all links are provided at the end of this post.) Since the incident, Spectrum Care has made more safety changes, including a buzzer system to alert staff to doors being opened, which \u2013 it must be noted \u2013 the mother had actually suggested prior to the death, but that Spectrum Care had considered \u201cun-necessary\u201d at the time. They have also adjusted their staff hand-over process, to make sure the children are kept in sight during hand-overs and that hand-overs are as quick as possible. The official findings are somewhat critical of Spectrum Care\u2019s attitude and perspective of what happened (see for example paragraphs 118-120, 126, 135-137, 147, and 150. A few specific examples: the Deputy Health and Disabilities Commissioner did not agree that the gate had to be able to be opened from the outside for emergency services, did not think there was adequate reason to focus so much on the front door as the primary point of escape, and did not think the staff had adequately supervised Julian considering his high risks). Spectrum Care also claimed the incident was a result in part of resourcing issues (para 151). The decision did not support this claim. Spectrum Care has apologized, but only in this past week;  two years  after Julian\u2019s death. Quite rightly, the mother says the apology is too little, too late, and that an apology earlier would have helped the family to move on. They still struggle with the loss. When the mother \u2013 Natasha Stacey \u2013 first got the news of her son\u2019s death, she fell to the ground and screamed. I can\u2019t read the stories of what she went through, of how she reacted, without getting tears in my eyes. Her story is the nightmare of so many families of autistic children, but she has lived that nightmare, and yes we must take whatever lessons we can from this. Drownings are apparently  the  leading cause of death for autistic children (and autistic adults), and not just for those with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Where possible, we must teach our children water safety, though that is frequently an extremely challenging proposition with our children (I know it is with my own son). Where the skills are lacking (and even when they\u2019re present) we must let carers of our children know about the higher danger of drowning for our autistic children. We have the right to insist on adequate staffing and facilities for our children, and where they are not adequate or we do not think we are being listened to, we keep fighting; it is not just our own children who are at risk: Poor safety practices and procedures can impact on  all  children in that organisations or individual\u2019s care. So don\u2019t tell yourself you\u2019re being a nuisance, or let them make you feel you are being over-protective; when it comes to wandering and drowning, it is a matter of life and death. My heart and my sincerest best wishes go to the Stacey family. I want them to know that Julian\u2019s death is not just another news story, that his story has been heard. That it touched me and many others, and we will try to learn from it too. And that I, for one, agree with the mother\u2019s view that the staff should have lost their jobs, or at least have been stood down during the investigation, and that Spectrum Care got off lightly for what has happened. The death of a child, especially such a seemingly avoidable death as this, screams for justice, a justice that does not appear to have been done. *** Links to resources used in the research for this post: \n \u201c Findings issued on death of autistic child \u201d Radio New Zealand, 25th July 2012. \n \u201c Carers found at fault over autistic boy\u2019s drowning \u201d stuff.co.nz, 25th July 2012. \n \u201c Facility criticised over drowning of autistic boy \u201d New Zealand Herald, 25th July 2012. \n Decision 10HDC00356, Spectrum Care Trust Board ; A Report by the Deputy Health and Disability Commissioner, 2012. \n \u201c Mother\u2019s anguish: System failed my son \u201d New Zealand Herald, 26th July 2012. \n \u201c Review of Mortality in Autism Drowning \u201d By Scott Myers, ASAT website. \n \u201c Drowning is leading cause of death among children with autism \u201d 22nd May 2008, SquidKid blog. \n \u201c Summer Safety for Children with Autism \u201d By Susan Moffitt, 16th May, 2011. \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcconnellfranklin/3110539323/", "http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/111564/findings-issued-on-death-of-autistic-child", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/7344242/Carers-found-at-fault-over-autistic-boys-drowning", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10822046", "http://www.hdc.org.nz/decisions--case-notes/commissioner%27s-decisions/2012/10hdc00356", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10822252", "http://www.asatonline.org/resources/articles/morality", "http://squidkid.org/drowning-is-leading-cause-of-death-among-children-with-autism/", "http://www.autismkey.com/summer-safety-for-children-with-autism/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/risk-catastrophic-the-foreseeable-death-of-julian-stacey/", "title": "Risk: \u201cCatastrophic.\u201d The foreseeable death of Julian\u00a0Stacey."},

{"date": "May 3, 2011", "body": "\n Image by woodleywonderworks via Flickr \n The idea that autistic people lack empathy, is as often stated as it is attacked. Some of the disagreement turns on definitions, which isn\u2019t surprising since the common usage and dictionary definitions of terms like empathy, sympathy and compassion, are not consistent. I\u2019d written a post (as yet unpublished) looking at and testing each definition. It was humming along nicely to begin with; I came across new ideas and information, about things like \u201calexithymia\u201d, and psychopaths vs autistics, and how some autistic people are actually overly aware and sensitive to others emotions (to the point of pain and extreme anxiety). But the more I read, and the more I collated what I\u2019d read into that post, the clearer it became that any meaningful answer to the question of autistic people and empathy, had to deal at some level with the question of language (both verbal and body language), and had to confront questions of theory of mind (which is closely related to the issue of language). Essentially, theory of mind is the ability for someone to imagine what is happening in someone else\u2019s mind. In order to figure that out, the prior development of language \u2013 or more so, some form of communication and meaningful social interaction with others \u2013 is apparently required. This is obviously a challenge for autistic people. So, arguably, without having the usual communication skills, the ability to empathise (which I\u2019m taking at this point to include sympathy and possibly compassion) is necessarily compromised. (Or is it \u2013 I\u2019ll get to that soon.) Then there\u2019s the question of the relative importance of spoken versus body language for forming a theory of mind. Studies have shown that not being able to see another person (being blind) did not change the areas of the brain that were active when dealing with theory of mind tasks. So not making eye contact or being able to read people\u2019s gestures and body language, is apparently not as vital as verbal language for empathy. So if an autistic person won\u2019t look you in the eye or watch your body, but otherwise has good verbal language skills, they\u2019re not necessarily missing some \u201ckey\u201d to empathy. Even the theorists who propose this link between language and theory of mind, recognise the capacity to teach an autistic person to recognise and respond to emotion, so the deficits can be addressed. Often such learning will be in the form of rote-learning recognition and responses (which is arguably the first step towards \u201creal\u201d response, though some believe rote-learning is the best you can hope for with many autistic people). Does teaching the rote-learnt recognition and responses, actually mean the autistic person now has a theory of mind? For the purposes of the question of empathy, does it mean that the autistic person is then truly empathetic, or have they just learnt behaviours to make it look like they are? (And how much does the difference matter, if the resulting behaviour \u2013 acts and words of compassion \u2013 are the same.) And what of this theory of mind in the first place, does it really incorporate emotions, or must emotions be treated as a separate consideration: Is there a vital difference between being able to understand what someone else is  thinking , and being able to share in what someone else is  feeling . If different parts of the mind are at play (and at least one study I came across suggested there are), then the talk of \u201ctheory of mind\u201d perhaps needs to be separated out from issues of empathy. Once I started getting my head around all of that, and the chicken-and-the-egg questions that kept popping up at each stage (do you need X for Y, or Y for X, and then is X a pre-requisite, or just helpful, to achieve Y, etc), I started working my way through some incredibly thought-provoking blog posts. Such as one about replacing \u201ctheory of mind\u201d with \u201ctheory of self\u201d; that the problems autistic people have with integrating  their  inner worlds is the more essential and prior problem to figuring out whether they can understand  other  people\u2019s worlds. And some very good points about how empathy comes hand-in-hand with deception; being able to understand other people\u2019s emotions and thoughts also means you can do some down-right nasty things to them, which don\u2019t come naturally to autistic people either. (Who\u2019s the psychopath now.) After all that, my brain was feeling a bit\u2026 full (if you\u2019ve ever studied for weeks on end for an exam, you know the feeling). I\u2019d learnt a hell of a lot, some of it so important that it has changed the way I now think about certain aspects of my son\u2019s past and current behaviour. Some of the lessons I\u2019ve learnt are ones I want to share (such as the incredible importance of realising that your autistic child may be avoiding eye contact and shutting themselves away, because they are over sensitive to emotional input \u2013 or it\u2019s causing anxiety because they can\u2019t but really want to understand it\u00a0 \u2013 so either way you need to be careful and thoughtful about what emotions you exhibit around them). The post I\u2019d initially written turned into spin-off stories about my son, and my Aspergers friends, and was turning into a top-heavy monster: Lots of spin-off, not enough foundation, not stable enough to hit publish. So here I am. Writing a post about a post I didn\u2019t publish yet. Trying to make sense of this huge wealth of information that has broadened my horizons and my passion about autism yet again. My inner academic tells me to go back to university and do a proper degree that allows me to specialise in autism, but my inner academic is an expensive pain in the butt, and I\u2019m busy raising children right now, so it can just sit down and be quiet thank-you-very-much. Some day, maybe. But for now, I\u2019ll keep reading, and writing, and learning: From others\u2019 posts, from compiling my own posts, and from what people share with me in the comments.

{"date": "November 10, 2012", "body": "I went to my son\u2019s IEP (Individual Education Plan) meeting a few days ago. Just me and his head teacher. I was expecting an update on progress towards meeting past goals, which I got. I was expecting a discussion of goals going forward, which we had. What I wasn\u2019t expecting was a word that appeared on the laptop screen towards the end of the meeting; a single word my turned my world upside down: Mainstreaming. His teacher told me that she\u2019d discussed the situation with the Principal, and they\u2019d decided my son \u2013 my autistic seven year-old son who has only attended a special needs school \u2013 is now a good candidate for mainstreaming. I\u2019m not sure what reaction she expected from me, but I can tell you that I could have never foreseen my own reaction: I went into mild shock. I couldn\u2019t hear what she said for a while after she said mainstreaming. The word on the laptop screen was stuck in my vision, and then I realised my vision was blurring and I was about to cry in front of her. I had to stop her talking (which I had stopped processing anyway), and apologise to her because I was still reeling from that one word. That moment, that M word on the screen, are imprinted on my long-term memory. The look on her face, the room all around us, the mix of confusion, astonishment\u2026 and just over-whelming joy. I know better than to idolize mainstreaming (and I hurried to tell her that I don\u2019t idolize it, I recognise its up-sides and down-sides). Nevertheless, it turns out that single word carries huge emotional stock for me, at a deeper level than I\u2019d previously realised or acknowledged. What \u201cmainstreaming\u201d means is that my son has adequate social, behavioural and academic skills to cope in a classroom with his same-age peers. \u201cMainstreaming\u201d means, more significantly, that my son has progressed immensely in the past two years, and is now ready to handle a situation that we couldn\u2019t have contemplated for him when he was five years-old. It means a shift in focus from teaching basic skills required to even learn, to being able to put those skills to the test in a more challenging environment. It means him being surrounded by children whose social, behavioural and verbal skills have the potential to improve his own just by being around them, whilst him having enough independent thought and judgment to not be sucked into all the worst that might also be presented to him in that same environment. It also means he no longer needs a teacher ratio of one to three students; that he has gained the ability to self-direct his learning and to follow instructions without as much hand-holding as he once required. Mainstreaming in and of itself, is not a better education; I stand by my very strong views that education needs to be varied and responsive, and that one size does not fit-all. But the shift from my son  requiring  a special needs school, to being considered  capable  of coping in a mainstream school; that is something special for the individual child, and something to be celebrated. Now comes the hard bit of course; the making-it-happen. Choosing the right school, sorting out zoning issues, transitioning, and ultimately finding out if my son truly is ready for this change. Because he may not be; I accept that possible reality. But my family \u2013 and evidently my son \u2013 are ready to find out. This is a new step in my son\u2019s journey, and we\u2019re ready for that part of his journey to begin. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/binkley27/2399018721/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/the-m-word/", "title": "The M-Word."},
{"date": "November 23, 2012", "body": "\u201cThe families with the greatest needs are the ones without the help.\u201d The above is a quote from a Principal of a Special Needs School in New Zealand,  in a recent news story  on the death of yet another autistic individual who was meant to be under the watchful eye of a caregiver. You may remember  my earlier post , mourning the preventable loss of an autistic child who drowned whilst also in care. On the books, I\u2019m sure New Zealand looks highly supportive of those with special needs: There is funding, there are support and service organisations, there are schools and advocacy services. Much of it is provided for free through government funding. But the lived reality, of what is required to access funding and support, and what you actually receive once you qualify, should make New Zealanders \u2013 and more specifically, the New Zealand government \u2013 embarrassed. Once your child receives a diagnosis, it\u2019s time to put your boxing gloves on, because you\u2019re in for a fight to get them what they need and what they are supposedly entitled to. My own child was severely autistic, and a physical danger to himself and others at the time of diagnosis. Our situation was dire, but even then we were placed on waiting lists that dragged on for months. Once the services did start up \u2013 the speech therapy, occupational therapy,\u00a0 physiotherapy, educational psychologist, and early intervention teacher, ultimately requiring the (frequently unsuccessful) coordination of no less than three different government departments \u2013 we received about one hour of help from each therapist a week, if that. Interaction with a therapist was not ongoing either; every six weeks or so they would take a few weeks off. We were also often reviewed to see if the service was still needed, and even when I\u2019d plead that it was, they\u2019d decide to give us months off and only reappear when I emailed desperate for their help. Summary notes on my son\u2019s progress that were filed with the relevant government agencies and overseers,  almost always  contained false information, often glowing reports about progress that simply and unambiguously had  not  occurred. At times I was left wondering if they were even talking about the right child. But I didn\u2019t have the time to complain about the erroneous reports that were filed; I had an extremely dependent and high needs child on my hands; fussing over report details was not on my list of priorities at the time. Every parent of a child with special needs in New Zealand, knows about \u201cORS,\u201d the acronym for the high level of funding that entitles a child to extra help at school, and to access special schools. But we all know too that it is  notoriously difficult to access, and that who qualifies and who doesn\u2019t is viewed as a cruel lottery  linked more to the quality of your application than the reality of your child\u2019s needs. A \u201cquality application\u201d is one that says the right things, in the right way; certain professionals in the field pride themselves on having high success rates because of the way they word their applications. Even once you have ORS though, if you should choose mainstreaming instead of special needs schooling, it is likely to be inadequate for the child\u2019s classroom support. It is very common for mothers of high needs students in a mainstream class, to have to be on beck and call throughout the school day, because the mainstream teachers can\u2019t cope. Some joke about living in the closet at the school because they have to be there so often. This of course signficantly impacts on their own ability to hold down a job and care for their other children. A fair few realise there is inadequate support and completely remove their child from the school system, choosing homeschooling as their only alternative. For those who tough it out, they have to put up with the public and the other parents complaining about their children being too much of a distraction for the other kids, and that their high needs child shouldn\u2019t be in the school at all. You don\u2019t see the other parents arguing for more support and training to allow these children to stay; it\u2019s easier to say \u201cgo away\u201d than \u201cstay and we\u2019ll make it work.\u201d Easier for them anyway, so they can get back to their tidy lives where \u201cdisability\u201d is something reserved for uplifting fluff-pieces at the end of a news bulletin. Respite services \u2013 providing a break and support for these exhausted families \u2013 have even worse waiting lists than for the basic services. You could wait for half a year, or more, and once you do receive these services, the actual provision of the service is never enough and the carers are frequently under-qualified and under-experienced (sometimes with deadly outcomes). Residential schools which cater to children with high and complex needs,  get shut down  with the promise of community based supports to take over the relevant families\u2019 needs. It sounds nice, but interviews with family members have revealed the same trends as what I\u2019ve talked about above: There are a lot of comforting words about how the services are there, but accessing services is a battle, and the quality of the services once accessed is inadequate to meet needs, especially complex needs like those associated with severe autism. As if all that wasn\u2019t bad enough, there are organisations which appear to exist just to stand in your way (ones that \u201callocate\u201d the funding), and which powerfully lobby for their own continued existence while the special needs community shouts for them to be overhauled or completely removed. We whisper the names of these \u201cTrusts\u201d like they\u2019re a dirty word, because we need their approval to be able to access funding, but they have immense and at times seemingly arbitrary power to stand in our way. I had a taste of this reality when I pleaded with such an organisation to release more of my son\u2019s allocated funding to our family, because we were in such high need. What I got instead was  a lecture about how I wouldn\u2019t be in such high need if I hadn\u2019t gone and had a second child . I can\u2019t even write that sentence without getting upset all over again. Yet I still find myself afraid to say the Trust\u2019s name out loud because I fear them taking away what little funding we get through them as is. And that is just a taste of what I\u2019m familiar with. My son is only seven, and from what I understand, the services and support only get worse once a child leaves school. So this is our reality, as families with special needs children. We\u2019re placed in front of a brick wall built out of red-tape and powerful organisations who lobby for their own existence, and waiting lists; while the public is told about all these lovely services and funding available to us. Services that are too few, and often of insufficient quality to actually meet the needs of those who need it most. So once we scale that immense wall, if we can \u2013 if we have the time, and energy and support to even attempt it \u2013 we realise that what we\u2019re looking at is more a mirage than an oasis. I must say that there are some amazing people and services that are available, if you can find them. Our son\u2019s first Occupational Therapist, and our son\u2019s current Head Teacher and Principal, stand out for me as astoundingly dedicated individuals, that are genuinely dedicated to my son\u2019s well-being. In fact, I\u2019ve clung to them like a life-raft, because I think I\u2019d be lost without them. To extend the analogy, I try not to rock the boat, because I am just so immensely grateful for what my son has. But for all the wonderful people and services we have been able to access for my son, it\u2019s important to know that we had to fight to get them in the first place. As my son now faces the prospect of mainstreaming, I find myself embroiled in whole new extensive fights that I feel I cannot win, but because I have amazing people on my side, I at least have the strength and courage to take on that fight. If New Zealand wants to hold its head high, and say with honesty and pride that it looks after its most needy, most innocent, most vulnerable individuals, then it needs to turn that mirage into the promised oasis, and knock down that brick wall. The government needs to listen to the families and disabled individuals (before it hears the lobbying of fat organisations that want their piece of the funding pie). Hear our fear, and our exhaustion, and our need. Hear the words of someone who sees the reality everyday: \u201c The families with the greatest needs are the ones without the help .\u201d \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/7985644/Autistic-mans-fire-death-highlights-failings", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/heardsy/5899629242/", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10844294"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/accessing-services-for-special-needs-in-nz-the-brick-wall-around-a-mirage/", "title": "Accessing Services for Special Needs in NZ; The Brick Wall Around A\u00a0Mirage."},
{"date": "November 29, 2012", "body": "There are certain skills required for learning, that need to be actively taught to children like my son: Skills that are taken for granted in most \u201cnormal\u201d children, and therefore skills that are not a natural part of the curriculum in a mainstream school. Because of this, it was in my son\u2019s best interests to start his schooling at a Special Needs school, where they understood and worked on his issues with basic verbal communication, sensory and anxiety issues, and inappropriate and disruptive behaviours that he has little awareness or control over. He also struggled with the most basic social skills, so working on this \u2013 along with all those other issues \u2013 were part of his daily curriculum alongside maths, art, reading, and all the other usual topics. By Shovelling Son It\u2019s given him the grounding that he now needs to enter mainstream schooling; or rather, to  attempt  to enter mainstream schooling. Whether that attempt is successful or not ultimately depends on what supports and therapies he will be able to access within the mainstream environment. He is still entitled to some of what he received in a Special School, but I have been warned that it would be far less frequent, more difficult to access, and will quite possibly be inadequate for his current needs. So why are we attempting to mainstream him, knowing full well he will lose significant supports and services that he still requires? In part it is because of his age. My son is seven, and we have been told that if we leave it much longer, the difference between him and his school peers will become too obvious, making it harder to successfully (if ever) integrate him into mainstreaming. Again then, why do we want to mainstream him at all? That comes back to the very things that get taken for granted in mainstream schools, the things that he cannot readily access in a Special School: The frequent and daily opportunities to practice and have more challenging social interactions and conversations. My son doesn\u2019t really have someone who is his \u201cequal\u201d in this area in his current class, to practice with, other than adults; adults who can\u2019t give him that level of one-on-one tutoring (socially or academically) because they have a group of other high-needs students that they must also teach: If one student doesn\u2019t fit well into the class anymore, and giving them what they need will impact too much on their classroom peers, it makes sense to find a better fit for them. This is the same reasoning that might be behind taking a child out of a mainstream school and placing them in a Special School, here it is just running in the other direction. So, in a very real sense, I am being forced to choose between the therapies my son still needs (occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, etc), and a more suitable (more challenging) education and social environment. It occurs to us as his parents that we could keep him in the Special School and supplement him with higher education opportunities outside of the classroom. Similarly we could put him in mainstream and attempt to supplement with extra hours of therapies. Neither option is ideal for a raft of reasons, including time, money and the daily experiences he\u2019d still be having within each school. And yes I\u2019ve thought about homeschooling him, but I have another young child and a part-time job, so homeschooling is not ideal right now either. I need the school that doesn\u2019t seem to exist: The one between mainstreaming and Special School. Perhaps, an autism specific school, for children who still need to access therapies everyday, and as part of their curriculum, but are being more academically and socially challenged like in the classic mainstream environment. I want a school where my son has someone with experience and knowledge about autism, keeping an eye on him, but also keeping enough distance to encourage his independence and confidence. A school that provides enough structure for security and safety, but enough freedom for self-expression and self-discovery. A school that wants my son to be there, and feels confident that they are properly resourced and knowledgable enough to cope with his challenges. A school, that doesn\u2019t exist; at least not here, and not now. In a way, an important way, I think every school could and should be like that which I described; one that is willing and able to respond to each individual child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, whilst providing the general opportunities of social interaction and independence that come from the school experience. I\u2019m aware that modern homeschooling does meet those key criteria \u2013 when it\u2019s understood that part of the homeschooling curriculum is actively engaging the child in social experiences too \u2013 so I can see why that option is so popular among parents of autistic children who just don\u2019t seem to fit in either a Special School or a mainstream school. For now though, we as a family must make the choice, which in its starkest form, is that between therapy and education. We have to make the decision now. If we make the right decision, we can change my son\u2019s life for the better; the wrong one, could stagnate him or even make his development go backwards (towards higher anxieties and social withdrawal, for instance). This is not about choosing between different decile schools, and who\u2019s of my friends\u2019 kids go where, and what school is linked with good university entrance rates, or any of those typical issues other parents talk about. For my family, this is about choosing a type of future, and not having enough options to feel secure that any choice we make will genuinely be in my son\u2019s best interests right now. I don\u2019t truly know what to do. If you\u2019ve had to make a choice like this, what did you do, did it turn out well?

{"date": "December 18, 2012", "body": "You all know about the recent school shooting in America, and the controversy and misinformation linking the shooter\u2019s autism to his premeditated violence. I don\u2019t need to tread that path, others have done it better than I could have hoped to ( just one example  will serve at this point, but there are multitudes worth sharing). What I do want to bring up here, is something specifically relevant to my own blog. I tried to quietly keep my head down, I chose not to post on the shooting because it was too raw and I didn\u2019t want people to think I was playing off the tragedy. I couldn\u2019t even watch the news, it was too distressing. I couldn\u2019t read all the way through the written stories without it being literally painful, it made my heart hurt. But others dragged me into it anyway, by misusing my posts to further their own agendas and spread misinformation around the shooting. I\u2019d quietly watched my stats go through the roof, breaking my all-time records two days in a row as people were drawn to my blog by the search terms \u201cviolence and autism.\u201d I have two main posts that they found their way to, but the search term wasn\u2019t directing them towards the one relevant post I\u2019d written on the topic in the past:  My post on the non-link between autism and mass shootings . I\u2019d hoped that what the searchers were finding would be read in context; the context was spelt out in the posts themselves, but people read more into other people\u2019s writing depending on what they want from it. Which is what happened, when one person decided to  use one of my posts  in support of his public conclusion that \u201c In the future we will see an increase in violence due to autistic children becoming adults .\u201d I tried to respond to his twitter post but got no acknowledgement of my response, so I ultimately decided it was time to insert a paragraph at the top of that post to stop any further misuse of it \u2013 to stop it being used to heap undeserved and ignorant harm on autistic people the world over. (I may yet go back and re-write the paragraph, it was quickly done, but it was like trying to place a plaster on an emergency wound; I had to do something.) Later that same day, someone else took in on themselves to use another of my posts \u2013  the one on marijuana and autism  \u2013 to support his own public conclusion that \u201c marijuana helps w/autism maybe it could have helped [the shooter] & saved lives .\u201d I responded to him too, telling him that I didn\u2019t appreciate him using my post to support the erroneous link between autism and mass murder, and that the violence associated with autism is not that of premeditated mass murder. Instead of silence this time, I was met with abuse. The person verbally attacked me, calling me drunk and asking what was wrong with me. He\u2019d decided my post was useful to further his own arguments about the legalisation of marijuana, and linked it to mass murder to get his argument into the spotlight, by (intentionally or otherwise) misusing my post. He really didn\u2019t appreciate me calling him out on it. He got so aggressive that I ended up blocking him, his attacks were quite upsetting. When people do this with my blog posts \u2013 when they misunderstand or misuse them to hurt autistic people \u2013 I feel the frustration, helplessness, (and public embarrassment) that you do when a bully in the playground grabs your own arm and starts using it to hit you in the face. I tried to stay out of this discussion out of respect to these poor families, and because I knew others were dealing very well with the issues already, but people dragged me into it kicking and screaming anyway. So let me say this to those who would use my blog posts to hurt the people I love and live to protect: You are scum. You are either dishonest, cruel, and lacking of empathy or sympathy, or you are too lazy to read and think about the writing you are so readily abusing. Either way, I have no respect for you, and I don\u2019t want you anywhere near my blog. My blog is directed at people who choose to think, not those who swallow misinformation like mother\u2019s milk and spread it around like an ugly virus. Go write your own blogs, or find some deluded blogger who actually says what you wished I was saying, but leave me out of it. I need to say this too: How  dare  you use this unspeakable tragedy, to further your own agendas and to spread your hatred.

{"date": "July 25, 2012", "body": "ABA \u2013 Applied Behaviour Analysis \u2013 is a polarizing therapy in the autism community: For some it is the holy grail of treatment, for others it is an abusive practice. When we began an ABA playgroup with our autistic son when he was three, I was largely unaware of the controversy or details; I just saw the opportunity to meet other autism parents and to learn more about my son in a therapy-based setting. Even so, there were some elements of the therapy that disturbed me. For example, their insistence that my son not be allowed to just line up and play with vehicles in the break. My thinking was they were already asking so much of him during the learning sessions, why couldn\u2019t he be allowed to do what he wanted with vehicles on the down time, just because it was typical autistic behaviour? The vehicles were there and visible, it seemed like a cruel tease to me that he was barred from this self-soothing and simple activity. By barring his access to play in this manner, the breaks for him would end up with tears or even meltdowns. To put that in proper perspective though, you\u2019ve got to know that lining up vehicles was my son\u2019s primary \u2013 and often only \u2013 form of play each day at home. He was deeply obsessive and controlling about it. Another example, and the one this post is primarily about: My son\u2019s happy dance. When my son is happy, he hums, flaps his hands, and bounces up and down, or runs back and forth across a room (he\u2019ll do the running instead of the bouncing if he\u2019s really feeling the joy). At the ABA play group, they would stop my son expressing his joy in this way, by either tapping him on the shoulder or holding the sides of his arms, or signalling that he must be quiet. The touches didn\u2019t simply stop the happy dance though, they inevitably upset him since he really didn\u2019t like being touched like that (he\u2019s more receptive to deep pressure for what that\u2019s worth). So he\u2019d go from very happy, to quite miserable. This struck me as rather cruel and even un-necessary; wasn\u2019t his happy dance just his own and innocent way of expressing his joy, why were they so determined to stop it..? Needless to say, we did not enforce that stopping-the-joy approach in the home environment, and I did wonder whether the approach would have ever been successful anyway, since this happy dance seemed so deeply embedded in his behaviour. And so it was that the happy dance continued. And continues to this day. And now I deal with the unforeseen consequences of what I thought was my open-minded acceptance of his difference. Now I have regrets. My son\u2019s happy dance is the one strong behaviour that makes people stare at him in public, and steer clear of him in public too. If that was all it was \u2013 the staring and the steering \u2013 I could still convince myself that I was right. But there\u2019s more. The hum part of the happy dance dominates a room. Making it hard to have a conversation with anyone else or listen to the radio or just relax. The running back and forth becomes a hazard in a smallish house of four people. The constant bouncing up and down is ruining the furniture, as my son has become a larger child (the poor couch squeaks under him and is sagging in his favourite spots). But there\u2019s more\u2026 My younger son, my two year-old, has picked up the happy dance as his own. He now also hums and runs back and forth when he\u2019s happy. He used to just do it when his brother was around, which I thought was sweet \u2013 like he was in-tune with his brother\u2019s joy and expression of joy. But now he\u2019s adopted it as a behaviour as his own. And when other people stare I can\u2019t say or think \u201cdon\u2019t stare you judgmental ignoramus, he has autism,\u201d because he doesn\u2019t have autism. It\u2019s just a remarkably annoying and unusual behaviour, solely picked up from another child. When both boys are humming and running in the house at the same time, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to safely cross the lounge or hear yourself think. This is a multiple daily occurence now. A seemingly harmless and special difference, has become a problem. And I can\u2019t help thinking that if I\u2019d just listened to those ABA therapists, and followed through more, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess. If I didn\u2019t like the methods they were using to stop the happy dance, I should have discussed that openly with them \u2013 suggested an alternative perhaps \u2013 instead of silently adding it to my internal list of concerns about whether this was the right thing for my son. I should have openly shared my concerns with the therapists, instead of presuming that this was just how ABA was done and had to be done, I should have recognised what I had plenty of evidence for right in front of me: That ABA is personalised and receptive to the child. I know why I didn\u2019t confront them properly; I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful and so much of what they had done with him was actually working. (My son had gone from a screaming, fearful, angry child, to one who tried to take part and ended up very much enjoying his sessions with the playground. And I learnt a lot too through that group, about autism and about my own son.) I think it\u2019s so important that we encourage parents to voice any concerns, instead of feeling like the ignorant lesser party in therapies, because if the parents don\u2019t full understand and support a therapy, it is that much less likely to be successful in the long-term. You may wonder what happens now when I attempt to stop my son\u2019s happy dance. He doesn\u2019t cry, or have a meltdown or stop being happy. What he does, because he is a typically contrary and annoying six year-old right now, is hum louder and flap harder while staring straight at me and laughing, because he thinks it\u2019s funny to do the exact opposite of what he\u2019s told. He does that a lot. It\u2019s a real problem with him lately. I\u2019m working on it! He still naturally happy dances every day, many times a day, and I hardly ever crack down on it if his brother isn\u2019t around and if it\u2019s not interrupting conversations or whatever. I still think it\u2019s important to let him have that outlet in his own way. But I\u2019m cracking down more now in public and around his brother, so he learns what  all  children must learn: Not all behaviours are always appropriate, even happy behaviours have their place. That\u2019s life, and that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s what\u2019s required in a world where we share space and time with other people. I\u2019ve noticed a small reduction in the happy dancing ( without , I must emphasize,  any  reduction in actual happiness), which is great. At least it\u2019s not getting worse or staying the same, so I\u2019ll take the small victory for now. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have more success if I tried to stamp it out completely, but as I said, I still have concerns about whether that is best by and for him. I have had no success yet in reducing the behaviour in my youngest, who loves his older brother and treats him like a role model. As my youngest gets more words and stops seeing his older brother doing it so much, it should be easier to reduce the behaviour. I very much want it gone before he starts kindergarten, I don\u2019t want him being isolated and marked out as a target by his peers because of this. This is not part of \u201cwho he is,\u201d this is a solely learnt behaviour from another child who has a very real neurological difference which explains that origins of the behaviour  for that other child . I do wonder if perhaps there was a \u201csweet point\u201d for altering this behaviour in my autistic son: A point at which stopping the happy dance wouldn\u2019t have been so upsetting as it was when he was three, and before it became so much more deeply entrenched as it most likely has become over the years. If there was, I think we missed it. But I firmly believe it\u2019s never too late to take action to make our children\u2019s lives better, which my son\u2019s \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 would be, if I can get him to stop happy dancing all the time. I know this post will annoy and maybe upset some people, particularly those who were so supportive a while back of my open-minded acceptance and encouragement of this aspect of my son\u2019s difference. But I felt I needed to write this post anyway. I need to share my doubts and regrets and even continuing confusion about all of this; it is part of my journey with my son and his autism, and part of my journey as a parent. These are the judgment calls we have to make sometimes, over what may seem trivial to some (\u201ca happy dance, so what!\u201d), but impacts on our family life every single day many times over. I don\u2019t pretend to have the answers, I screw up along the way, but I never stop searching for how to do the best by my son, for who he is as an individual that must find his way through this world. So if you, on the contrary, do have the answers for me \u2013 if you can set my mind at ease, or feel you must dissuade me from this path I\u2019m on, or encourage me to be even harder on him than I am, or do it in a different way \u2013 then I invite you to share those answers and explain to me where those answers come from. In the meantime I shall take comfort from the fact that my home is filled by annoyingly happy children. That, at least, seems like an important success. *** Some of the other posts I have done about ABA and my son\u2019s happy dance: \n \u201c A Dance of Joy \u201d (29 Nov, 2010) \n \u201c Changes to ABA recommendations in the NZ ASD Guidelines \u201d (9th July 2011) \n \u201c Food rewards in therapies for autistic children \u201d (12th June 2011) \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/aba-regrets-and-a-question-of-happiness/", "title": "ABA, Regrets, and a Question of\u00a0Happiness."},
{"date": "December 22, 2012", "body": "Murderer, retard, genius. Hacker, monster, miracle with super-human senses. What is my son to you? What does the word \u201cautism\u201d tell you? It tells you that he meets the current criteria for a developmental delay. That he falls in to one of five separate conditions that come under the autism spectrum umbrella. Do you know which of the five he is? Do you know the difference between each kind? No? By Zephylance Lou Let me help you. He has \u201cclassic autism.\u201d OK, so can you now tell me what criteria he met to receive that diagnosis? How severely his condition affects him? Whether it makes him violent or gentle, beautiful or ugly, brilliant or moronic? You can tell me none of those things, because none of them are predetermined by his autism. None. You don\u2019t know his personality, what he wants to do with his life, what he is capable and incapable of. Yet children like my child, are tainted and dismissed and held up in awe, by a confused and misinformed public, looking for easy answers and tidy boxes for messy realities. The school shooter in the US is just the most recent taint, but is by far the harshest one I have had to witness since my son\u2019s diagnosis. The shooter may or may not have had Aspergers, there is no simple biological post-death test to ascertain this, and with his mother also gone it is unlikely we would ever come close to having enough information to ascertain it. Yet the suggestion that he did, that mere suggestion, has set an enraged and uninformed public lashing out at all autistics. Calling for those with autism to be locked up, to be identified and removed from public. Even as professionals and experts in multiple fields keep writing and telling them that autism and Aspergers have nothing to do with such a premeditated violent act, these members of the public still set up hateful Facebook groups and send hate mail and leave threatening comments on blogger\u2019s posts, taking it out on completely innocent bystanders who themselves are still reeling from the horror of the shooting. They even ask government agencies to locate and investigate autistic individuals due to concern that they must be the next mass shooter by virtue of their diagnosis. In the current climate, if you were concerned your child had a developmental delay and needed extra help, do you honestly think you\u2019d go for that help? Or would you be terrified that an autism diagnosis might mark them out as something to be vilified and punished in society? People already have very many reasons to avoid getting a confirmed diagnosis \u2013 whether for their child or themselves \u2013 this extra reason would easily force them away from that important investigation. So is that what the public wants: a larger number of undiagnosed children (and adults) not receiving the help they need; gentle kind children being told that they are destined to become mass murderers whether they want to or not; an increase in violent and verbal bullying against innocent children and families who have done no one any harm and are unlikely to ever do so? All for what? What will it get you, what is the point of all this terror? You want an answer to the horror, you want a reason for the unspeakable, you want to stop it happening again. You want what we all want. Then know this: Autism is not your answer.

{"date": "December 23, 2012", "body": "When I started blogging, the parts of the autism blogging and research world that most spoke to me, were those focused on children. There are many reasons for this, but there are three I want to briefly mention at this point: By Martin Gommel (1) Autism, to me, was something about my son \u2013 a child \u2013 so that was my primary reference point and experience with autism; it was the framework that made the most sense and meant the most to me as a mother. (2) My focus was on helping my son and helping others to understand my son, and so I needed and wanted to know about how to deal with a young child facing the challenges of growing up, complicated by the challenges of autism. And (3), I had no idea what would become of my son as he got older \u2013 how severely affected he might be \u2013 so reading accounts only told through the eyes of adult autistics who were high functioning enough to write such accounts, seemed to be at odds and potentially disconnected from what I needed to know to help my (as then) severely affected son. But I\u2019ve learnt a few things over the past two years. I\u2019ve learnt that many of the struggles are  the same in adulthood regardless of the severity of the autism , most especially in the area of social communication. So regardless of how severely my son may end up affected in adulthood, I need to know about and learn to help him best with those challenges which \u2013 to some extent \u2013 all adult autistics have been through. They need not be the same \u201clevel of functioning\u201d to provide relevant and useful suggestions based on their own experiences. I\u2019ve also seen my son move his steady way down the severity levels, from severe to somewhere between mild and moderate, in the space of only a few years. Imagine what could happen over the next ten years as he nears adulthood. It may turn out that the experiences and knowledge of the most capable autistic adult, could be of most relevance to his life. I\u2019ve learnt too that though I will always be there for him and love him like no one else can \u2013 like only a mother can \u2013 that he will come one day to be part of the adult autism community. How in-depth his involvement is in that community will be up to him. But after I am gone, that community will still be there, advocating for him and supporting him and understanding him. I need to look to that community, listen to what they\u2019re saying is hurting and helping them, and help make things better for my son\u2019s future with their guidance. Through reading the views and experiences of autistic adults, I have had many of my presumptions and views challenged, and always for the better, because of the added awareness and new perspectives it grants me, and thereby helps me to better understand and care for my son and the adult he will become. I do not agree with everything an adult autistic writes; that would be impossible since they do not speak with one voice. But I listen. And I learn. And I try to be patient and keep an open mind. They need to be heard, just like I want my son to be heard when he reaches adulthood. Autistic adults are as individual and different as autistic children are; I still do not hold the view that autism defines and informs every part of who my son is. He has his own personality, beliefs, preferences and interests. But what he has in common with these adults is important, and interesting, and will help me to help him towards a happy and fulfilled adulthood. So I especially look to those adults who have had successes and found happiness, because they help shine a path for my son to do the same. For now, my son is an autistic child. However I need to not just look to his childhood challenges, but also to his increasingly bright future, in order to help him be everything he can be: an amazing, autistic, adult. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/kwerfeldein/2234720298/", "http://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/news/2011/people-with-milder-forms-of-autism-struggle-as-adults"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/autistic-adulthood/", "title": "Autistic Adulthood"},
{"date": "January 21, 2013", "body": "I was watching a new video released by the American Psychiatric Association, on the changes to the autism criteria, when something that was said made me rewind and replay it, because it was a game-changer that I hadn\u2019t heard mentioned before. The  video can be found here , but I\u2019ll provide a transcript of the relevant part: Susan Swedo, the chair of the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group, begins by discussing that the social communication aspects of the new autism diagnosis, are \u201cimpairing and life-long, persistent.\u201d But then she goes on to discuss the second group of autism symptoms: the restrictive repetitive behaviours. She says that some patients may \u2013 through training and development \u2013 come to have less obvious manifestations of these behaviours in later life, so \u201c that criterion can be met on the basis of history alone .\u201d This is new, as far as I can tell. I\u2019ve had a re-read of the  original proposed criteria \u00a0and see no mention about some symptoms not having to be present at the time of diagnosis, or (and very importantly) not having to be present in later years. This would seem to be a major twist, since it means talk about \u201coutgrowing autism\u201d could only be relevant in regards to the social communication criterion: If you no longer meet all the criterion, that is to say you no longer have the repetitive restrictive behaviours, it appears you would  still  be considered autistic because you had such behaviours historically, as long as you still had social communication challenges. This reflects the current understanding that autism remains and affects a person, even though they may have found a way to \u201cpass\u201d as neurotypical. This also puts an interesting spin on claims of curing autism and outgrowing autism. I have tried to find the final confirmed diagnostic criteria for autism in the DSM-5, the one that would illustrate this change, but every search I do just turns up the proposed criteria or a request for me to buy the DSM-5 for myself. I would very much like someone to confirm if Swedo\u2019s summary is reflected in the precise wording of the new criteria, and whether I have correctly understood her statement and its implications. I haven\u2019t had much time to reflect further on what seems to me to be quite a big and important change to what we previously understood about the proposed criteria, so perhaps you see something here that I haven\u2019t yet.

{"date": "January 1, 2013", "body": "It seems that for many in the autism world, \u201cacceptance\u201d is about letting autism take over every part of who you are and what you do. That acceptance means wearing t-shirts proclaiming your link to autism, writing and speaking about autism pride, and tying autism into one\u2019s very identity. By Mykl Roventine I\u2019ve come to see this is \u201creactive acceptance:\u201d As a type of acceptance that happens in the face of negative stereotypes about autism. As such, it tends to over-sell the \u201cgood side\u201d of autism and gloss over the hardships. This makes sense because it\u2019s not simply trying to tell people what autism  is , it\u2019s trying to change an existing negative view towards autism, to replace over-the-top negativity with a balancing dose of good-vibes. The problem with this are many, but perhaps the one I see most often and find most frustrating, is when people try to counter-balance reactive acceptance with a dollop of negativity. For example, when someone sees a positive or prideful declaration of autism, and counters it with a harsh dose of how hard it really is. This typically swings the pendulum too far in the other direction, so you get the endless and exhausting \u201cautism sucks, autism rocks, autism sucks, autism rocks\u201d dialogue. This is really just people talking past each other: Each acting like the other is trying to paint a comprehensive view of what autism is all about, when really they were trying to rectify an incomplete picture of autism in the first place. It\u2019s like two people arguing over whether an elephant has a long truck  or  has a short tail. They may or may not realise what they\u2019re doing, sometimes it suits particular agendas to overlook the purpose of the statement they are reacting to. In a world where the disabled are treated poorly and ignored, it may make sense to over-sell the good, in the same way that it may make sense to push the awesomeness of women in a misogynist society. There is a point though at which even with that explanation of pushing the up-side, things have gone too far and lost their way: When the thing you were born with (or came to have through no conscious decision or fault of your own), starts being treated as an independent source of pride or as a reason to be considered better than others. For autism, this would be when people start treating autism as something itself to be proud of or that makes them better than non-autistic people. This is just another version of racism, sexism, or otherwise treating people as if they are better or worse by accident of birth: To consider someone to be better due to something they were simply born with, is in turn to consider people worse simply by virtue of something they weren\u2019t born with. This is just buying into the very rhetoric that is at the heart of discrimination in the first place: Judging people by something completely outside of their control. This is why I increasingly find the idea of \u201cautism pride\u201d somewhat perverse: Not because autism is not a good thing, or because autism is a bad thing, but because it is outside of one\u2019s own deliberate choices and actions. To me, meaningful pride is taken in something earned and worked for, in an achievement. Empty and confused pride is taken in something for which you had no input, as odd as me taking pride in my neighbour\u2019s well-tended garden. Reactive pride, and reactive acceptance, of something well understood, can be easily seen for what it is. But reactive pride and acceptance of something not well understood \u2013 like autism \u2013 just furthers the confusion of the public. When they\u2019re told in one breath that autism is awesome and something to be proud of, and then they hear someone else saying it\u2019s actually horrendous to live with, you\u2019re asking them to choose who has got it right since the messages don\u2019t match, and chances are they will side with the \u201cits\u2019 horrible\u201d side because people fear the unknown and the different, and are unlikely to accept a message that tells them they are lesser people by merely not being autistic (for instance). Furthermore, the \u201cit\u2019s horrible\u201d message, will appear to carry with it a sense of revelation of truth; people are going to be naturally sceptical when you tell them that something labeled as a disability is really not what the manuals and professionals say it is. Who is more likely to be carrying an agenda; the professionals and manuals, or the lay-person telling them autism is actually great? Some people will realise there is truth in both the horror and the beauty, despite being fed two contradictory messages, but most of the time people tend towards a view that just reinforces what they already think. I much prefer the idea of emphasizing the individuality of autistic people, rather than packaging them into some tidy message to react against some other tidy message. In my experience, the public thinks about autism in a very simple sense: They think all autism is caused by and will eventually cured by, some single thing. They think of autism in terms of whatever stereotype they most recently saw in a movie or read in a book. The astounding diversity is lost on them. So when someone does something horrible, who happened to have autism, or something wonderful, who happened to have autism, they quite naturally extend that impression to autistic people in general, and there are plenty of people who would happily reinforce that view for them. The reactive dialogues feed rather than breaks that pattern of thought. Encouraging people to recognise that autism is just part of what a person is, instead of their whole, is a good step towards freedom from the endless pendulum between the tail and the trunk. That way the next time someone with autism does something horrible or great, we won\u2019t have to jump back into reactive dialogues, we can examine the individual\u2019s choices and actions for what they are. Sometimes autism is relevant to what someone does and says, sometime it isn\u2019t. Simplifying autism, and packaging it into tidy t-shirt print messages, can just end up simplifying and packaging autistic people too. Autism is complex. People are complex. Reactive dialogues pay superficial homage to the true complexity of both autism and humanity. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/myklroventine/3448372653/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/reactive-dialogues/", "title": "Reactive Dialogues"},
{"date": "January 26, 2013", "body": "Why do we tell children not to be tattle-tales; not to tell an authority figure when someone else has done something wrong? In theory it is because we want them to work on the issue themselves and find their own solutions, or because we suspect they are lying, or we think they\u2019re simply trying to cause trouble over something trivial. A more cynical person might say it\u2019s because we can\u2019t be bothered parenting the problem. When I was a child I never thought it fair to be called a name by adults just because I was letting them know someone else had done something wrong. Now, as a parent, I still feel the same, only much stronger, because of my son\u2019s autism. The issue was highlighted for me in a recent incident. We were visiting family. Another child had done something inappropriate, that my son knew was inappropriate, out of the eye-range of us adults. My son came rushing inside the home to tell the adults what had happened. Before I could praise him for letting me know what had happened and either talk him through what to do or done it myself, another adult family member asked him if he was \u201ctelling tales.\u201d And another piped up to say he was being a \u201ctattle-tale.\u201d The reaction confused my son, as well it should. Because I have been working hard on encouraging my son to do exactly what he did. My son does not talk easily or readily about what he experiences, because he struggles with the words and with the point of recounting what he does. Not only do we encourage him to talk more, and talk about what he\u2019s seen and done for the sake of language and social skills, but we also encourage it for the sake of his own safety: We need to know if another child is hurting or otherwise abusing our son \u2013 this is all the more important as he\u2019s about to start a mainstream school for the first time, where teacher ratios and his own differences mark him out as a potential easy target for bullies. Furthermore, my son is still learning the appropriate reactions to uncertain or unusual situations, so each time he shares with me I have the chance to guide him on what the behaviours mean and what he should do about it. Just because my son comes and tells me what someone else has done wrong, doesn\u2019t mean I will decide it is appropriate to intervene for him, sometimes I will tell him what to do about it (if anything) and send him on his way. Add to all this the fact that my son is honest (to a fault), he doesn\u2019t lie about such things, it\u2019s just not in his make-up to do so. Whatever I might do when he comes to me, I would never greet his efforts to pass on this information, with the label of \u201ctattle-tale.\u201d I would never belittle his attempts to communicate and to share, with such a dismissive turn of phrase. I found it quite disturbing that other adults \u2013 adults who know him and his challenges \u2013 would be so ready to call him a tattle-tale. It concerns me then what other adults who don\u2019t know him so well \u2013 like his new school teachers \u2013 will do when he goes to them with his concerns and experiences. I guess all I can do \u2013 besides taking the chance to educate adults who I see doing this in front of me \u2013 is make sure my son knows that his own mother will always want to hear it. That I want to know how his day was, what happened, who did something naughty, help him understand whether it was actually naughty and what he should do about it. That way even if his teachers and other adults won\u2019t hear him or value his words, I can advocate on his behalf as someone who does care. I can encourage him towards being able to cope with these situations himself, and guide him to do the right thing, so eventually he will no longer need or want to run every naughty event past me anymore. But he is nowhere near that point yet, and even if he was and when he is, I won\u2019t be calling him names to get him to stop it. I do not take my son\u2019s voice for granted, there was a time when hearing meaningful words from him at all was rare, his social communication was hard-fought for, and hard-won. My son can tell me all the tales he wants. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/01/26/the-tattle-tale-autistic/", "title": "The Tattle-Tale Autistic"},
{"date": "December 29, 2012", "body": "My seven year-old son is autistic. This is a piece of information I once nervously shared with absolute strangers when they watched and judged me while I struggled with my son; I felt I had to let them know that my son wasn\u2019t a bad boy and I wasn\u2019t a bad mother, it was autism causing what they were seeing. Without the information about his diagnosis, I wasn\u2019t sure how I was meant to explain what they were seeing. By exfordy Now, when my son does or says unusual things that make people look at him or me as if there\u2019s something wrong with us, I no longer use autism to explain or apologise. Not because autism is no longer key to understanding my son and his actions. The reasons I no longer reveal this vital piece of information \u2013 even when it would make his and my life easier at the time \u2013 are three-fold. Before I get to them, I want to give two examples where I recently actively chose to bite my lip and not say what I once would have said. The first was when my son was in a bouncy castle. He was having a great time, when a much younger child, of about two or three years old, hopped into the castle too (under the less-than-watchful eye of his parent). The younger child roughly attached himself to my son, and everywhere my son went this toddler kept throwing himself at my boy. At times he tried to sit on my son\u2019s head and ride on his back. I wanted to tell the other parent that their son was being too rough and to please be more gentle because my son has special needs and struggles to know what to do and how to defend himself in these situations. Instead I simply asked my son if he was OK, and he said he was fine, and that \u201cthe boy likes me!\u201d (which the little boy clearly did). My son was enjoying the rough-and-tumble, even if it was awkward and looked painful at times, so I let him cope with it himself. Eventually it got too much but it was my son who called a stop to it by shaking the boy off and saying it was enough, and leaving the situation, at which point the other parent finally told his own son to be more gentle. A second example was today at the hairdressers. The hairdresser was asking my son what Santa got him. My son said Santa was pretend. This woman gave me a look like I was some sort of devil for allowing him to believe Santa wasn\u2019t real; she didn\u2019t ask if my son was a different religion, she didn\u2019t ask if he\u2019d ever believed in Santa or wanted Santa to be real, she simply assumed a seven-year old boy must believe in Santa. I wanted to tell her he was autistic, that he was very literal, that pretending Santa was real is a confusing notion for him and he\u2019s quite happy knowing the truth; he needs truths. Instead I kept my mouth shut and quietly judged her back for being so presumptuous. Because I hadn\u2019t intervened, she went back to talking to my son about whether he\u2019d got any presents for Christmas (now that she\u2019d got past the shock of hearing that Santa hadn\u2019t got him any), and he happily told her he did get lots of presents. Later during the haircut she commented on how very quiet he was being and said her own seven-year old son talks non-stop. My son was being quiet because he finds haircuts a bit upsetting and was focusing on trying to be calm, but I didn\u2019t explain, I just left it to see what my son would do. He looked to me for reassurance that being quiet was OK, I just gave him a big thumbs up and he smiled and continued in his focused silence. Later on the way home he asked me if it was OK that he had been quiet. I told him he had been very well-behaved and it was OK to be quiet when people aren\u2019t asking you questions, if you want to be. That not everyone has to talk all the time at the hairdressers. He was happy with that answer. Returning then to the three reasons that I no longer use autism to explain or justify my son to strangers (some of the reasons should be clear by this point). First, my son is old enough now that he needs to start finding ways to engage with others who don\u2019t understand him and who can\u2019t quite figure him out. He has adequate language and social skills to interact and problem-solve. Both children and adults still find him unusual and confusing, but I no longer step in to ease the path for him, so he is having to find new ways to make himself understood and welcomed. I don\u2019t intervene unless he is in real physical or psychological danger (though I\u2019d intervene in such situations whether he was autistic or not, that\u2019s plain good parenting). The world is not always going to embrace him, and I\u2019m not always going to be there to force them to; I would much rather he got used to what people are going to say and do while I watch and listen from a safe distance, than when I\u2019m not there at all to help him understand what went right (or what went wrong) after the interactions. Secondly, I no longer accept the close-minded restricted views of \u201cnormal\u201d that the average stranger carries around with them. Just because my son says or does the \u201cwrong\u201d thing, doesn\u2019t mean he deserves stares and I deserve criticisms; in fact, as I see it, their quick and ignorant judgment of my family is something they should be utterly embarrassed by.  They  are the ones at fault for expecting everyone to conform to their idea of ideal interactions. I do not owe them an explanation or apology for my son\u2019s words and behaviours (again, unless he was physically or psychologically attacking other people, but this is (a) simply not the sort of behaviour my son engages in, and (b) if it was, my interference with such behaviour and words would again be in accord with basic good parenting, so it should surely go without say). If I tell them my son has autism, they may show more tolerance and acceptance for this \u201cspecial instance,\u201d but they should be showing that higher tolerance and acceptance regardless. If I give them this reason at this time to be better people, then they may think they otherwise had good reason to be so judgemental. Disability and difference are around them all the time, they aren\u2019t owed labels and explanations in order to allow them to otherwise continue being jerks. I will not pretend that their attitudes and expectations were perfectly fine  but for  my son\u2019s autism. Thirdly, saying \u201che has autism\u201d only ever raised more questions than answers, it rarely functioned well as an actual explanation. The vast majority of people don\u2019t know what autism means for a child, and those who do know something about it almost always only know the myths and extreme stereotypes (like violent non-verbal or miraculous savant). So what\u2019s the point in telling them something that means nothing to them? A fair few even took their children away from my son after I said he had autism, like it was a disease or a warning of some kind. These reasons of mine for not using autism to explain or apologise, only apply to strangers. People who my son regularly interacts with, such as teachers and family members, are better off knowing about autism, and have the opportunity and interest to learn more about what it means, and what it means for my son. Maybe years from now I will feel differently again; maybe I\u2019ll make a t-shirt proudly telling every stranger that I\u2019m a mother of an autistic child. But for now, this is the right thing, for him and for me. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/exfordy/128576390/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/12/29/why-ive-stopped-using-autism-as-an-apology-or-explanation-to-strangers/", "title": "Why I\u2019ve stopped using autism as an apology or explanation to\u00a0strangers"},
{"date": "January 7, 2013", "body": "Yesterday,  a story on stuff.co.nz  looked at the increase in the number of New Zealand children being diagnosed with anxiety. There has been a significant increase in mental health diagnoses, particularly under the heading of \u201canxiety.\u201d The story shared concerns and analysis of the increase, quoting two University Professors who explained factors behind the increases (including the Christchurch earthquakes and the economic downturn), and \u2013 alternately \u2013 the view of a suicide prevention advocate who \u201c slammed the results as bad science .\u201d Original image by Heidi Cartwright, sourced via Flickr The suicide prevention advocate \u2013 Maria Bradshaw, the founder of \u201c Casper \u201d \u2013 attacked the New Zealand  Before School Checks  which are meant to pick up potential mental health (and other health) problems in preschoolers. However these checks only pick up potential issues, they don\u2019t  diagnose  them, so I\u2019m not convinced they are relevant fodder for condemnation. If there is a problem here, it\u2019s going to surely be with those who do the diagnosing, and with the actual Diagnostic Manuals; either a child has a condition or they do not. If a check system is identifying children who would had previously gone undiagnosed \u2013 and thereby without corresponding supports and interventions \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best to target the check system itself. Bradshaw\u2019s critique doesn\u2019t rest there though. She is worried that the \u201cdefinition of normal\u201d has become too narrowed. That once normal behaviour \u2013 such as tantrums and lack of concentration \u2013 are now getting labels. Those labels are sometimes accompanied too by drugs, for example there have been significant recent increases in mood-stabilising drugs and antidepressants prescribed for children under five years old. I hold some of these concerns myself, particularly around the prescription of mood altering drugs to very young children. I think it important though to take into account what the professors quoted in the story also said, about the likelihood that children remain under-diagnosed and many would benefit from a confirmed diagnoses who simply have not been assessed yet. What we may be seeing now rather than a \u201chuge increase\u201d of cases, is a growing awareness and recognition of cases that were always there. There are other excellent points made by the professors too, that you can read for yourself in the story. This post of mine is primarily concerned about a particular statement by Bradshaw. The statement is one that I find misleading, dismissive, and perpetuates an erroneous view of the general public about the reality and importance of mental health issues: \u201c These are not medical things. It\u2019s not like working out if your child has diabetes or not.  That\u2019s science, but this is not .\u201d The statement shocked me, coming from the head of a suicide prevention centre, so I went to their website, where I found some other concerning views being promoted. I found attacks on any use of antidepressants, which they backed by  a 2008 meta-analysis.  However, a simple search revealed that there was another, more recent  meta-analysis performed in 2010  that reached a somewhat different finding: \u201c For patients with very severe depression, the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial. \u201d The Casper site also doesn\u2019t bother with a  2012 systematic review  that reached the conclusion \u201c the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants for depression may provide a slight advantage whereas antidepressants alone and psychotherapy alone are not significantly different from alternative therapies or active intervention controls .\u201d Basically, it appears to be some cheery-picked results, to suit an agenda. What agenda could a suicide prevention group have in this area, and how might it impact on Bradshaw\u2019s views of modern mental health? The founder sadly lost her child to suicide after the child had been put on antidepressants. (That sad fact is why I was hesitant to write and share this post, but she advocates open dialogues around tough topics, and I mean her no personal ill will in writing this, so share this I shall.) The rest of the website much follows the theme of being against modern treatments for a variety of conditions, including being against vaccinations in general: \u201c vaccines cause illness\u2026 not cure it. More toxic chemicals pushed by big pharma corps . \u201d The attacks on modern pharmaceutical companies extends to dismissing studies associated with funding from such companies (as backed up by  this study  on 11 German Journals, for instance). (I know many of my readers are already familiar with the arguments around the relevance of funding to outcomes, and the point of sharing methods and being able to independently replicate results, so I won\u2019t go further into that at this point, I\u2019m just bringing this up as relevant background to the how the group views modern ailments and treatments.) I like many of the objectives the suicide prevention groups wants to achieve, including talking openly about the circumstances and reality of suicide, but I am less sympathetic to using it as a platform to attack a much broader and unconnected range of mental health conditions, and in general as an attack on modern medicine\u2019s evidence-based attempts to tackle these issues. Which brings me back to Bradshaw\u2019s statement about what is medical, what is science, and what is \u201cnot.\u201d The simple fact is that there are many conditions we now know to be medical, that were once just loosely grouped symptoms without a name. There are also many conditions that we once didn\u2019t have the ability to recognise with objective tests, because we hadn\u2019t developed the medical equipment to do so yet. Furthermore there are some medical conditions that we once dismissed as just \u201cpart of life\u201d or \u201cpart of the human condition\u201d \u2013 including disabilities and old age issues \u2013 that we can now successfully treat and thereby improve life quality for the affected individuals. The fact that we don\u2019t have all the answers yet, and can\u2019t find the exact spot in the brain or the body that causes the problem, doesn\u2019t mean something isn\u2019t medical and certainly does not mean it isn\u2019t science. In fact it is the very nature of science to observe and experiment and trial, and yes even make errors. In that scientific process it may become clear that there is nothing abnormal going on, that the condition is just an extension of a normal human experience for instance. Or that what we thought was condition X, is really a variation on condition Y. The conditions being added to the new Diagnostic Manual, and already in existing Diagnostic Manuals, are an expression of that ongoing process. Just like autism was once considered to be  childhood schizophrenia , and later split into five groupings, and now will become one main grouping under an umbrella term as of 2013. Each is part of step informed by science and experiments and trial and error, the process is not static. Nor do conditions that were once in such Manuals always remain classified as \u201cmental conditions,\u201d neither do mental conditions always sit apart from known and identifiable medical conditions. It is too easy, too dismissive, to say that various conditions are part of normal life and are expressions of growing psychologizing of normality. That in itself overlooks that a diagnosis requires strongly and persistently abnormal behaviours to even qualify for a diagnosis. It is too easy to read off the title of a condition and judge it without reading through the requirements. For example, again taken from the Casper site, in an attack on mental health services, they  write this : \u201c \u2026while the most common diagnosis was \u2018other\u2019 which includes labels such as factitious disorder (making up symptoms), social anxiety disorder (shyness) and things like not being able to sleep after drinking coffee! \u201c, clearly dismissing the named conditions as a bit of a joke. Yet even just looking at SAD,  it can only be diagnosed  when it severely interfers with daily functioning or is causing signficant distress, and when other medical conditions that might be causing the symptoms have been ruled out. This actually goes to another attack the Casper site makes on mental health conditions. They argue for an alternative approach to mental health, where a physical health assessment should be done first to rule out other causes of the emotions and symptoms at issue. However, from my own experiences and from experiences with my own son, this is exactly what already happens, and it is even expressly written into many conditions in the Manual as part of the diagnostic process; ruling out alternative causes of the issues is itself already part of the process. Which brings me back to the correct target. If we are concerned that certain conditions shouldn\u2019t be in mental health Manuals, and that \u201cnormal\u201d is becoming too pathologised, and that \u201cabnormal\u201d is getting treated with drugs (particularly in young children), then I think we should be having an open discussion about each of those concerns, instead of lumping them together into an attack on mental health and on modern medicine. Lumping them together in this way \u2013 attacking mental health categories and belittling their reality and their titles as if it\u2019s all a joke \u2013 only serves to further stigmatize a group of both adults and children who are in need of help, some of them in need of very serious help that can only be received after a confirmed diagnosis. When someone says that \u201cit\u2019s not medical, it\u2019s not science\u201d because of the symptoms used as part of the diagnosis process, they\u2019re ignoring all the science and medical work being done in the field, and the reality that there is huge cross-over between medical and mental health issues. And again, are just (as I see it) heaping ridicule and derision on a group of people who are already treated as unwanted outcasts. In summary, I do think we need to look at these issues, no doubt. But I think it needs to be done in a way that places the attention and the attacks (if attacks are needed) on the right targets, which appear to be the Manuals themselves and specialists who may be misapplying the Manuals. I think we need to be very careful not to ridicule, stigmatize or belittle the children who have received the diagnoses, or to dismiss and laugh at the concerns of their parents. We need to keep in mind that there is a huge and overwhelming percentage of children who do not ever even come close to receiving  any  type of mental illness diagnosis; \u201cnormal\u201d still exists, even if it does seem to have shrunk somewhat. We need to be aware too that the growth we\u2019re seeing may simply be the outcome of better awareness and that very many children are benefitting from the increased support and interventions they then receive following a diagnosis. There are many factors at play here. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s scientific investigation at work, trying to find the answers and weed out the errors. It may not be tidy, it may not get it right straight away, but it will keep searching and reorganising as we shift closer to the truth. Because this  is  science. *** If you\u2019re interested in reading more on the nature of truth and science, you may be interested in my post called \u201c Law, Science, Burdens of Proof, and Contextual Truth. \u201c \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/8146820/Number-of-anxious-kids-skyrockets", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/wellcomeimages/6880270910/", "http://www.casper.org.nz/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18303940", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20051569", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22860015", "http://www.casper.org.nz/news", "http://www.casper.org.nz/sites/default/files/Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20influence%20on%20Medical%20Journals%20Becker%20et%20al.pdf", "http://www.unstrange.com/dsm1.html", "http://www.casper.org.nz/FAQ", "http://socialanxietydisorder.about.com/od/diagnosisofsad/a/diagnosis.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/thats-science-but-this-is-not/", "title": "\u201cThat\u2019s science, but this is\u00a0not.\u201d"},
{"date": "January 31, 2013", "body": "Sometimes, I write posts that express a new idea I\u2019m still processing and so it may come off a bit roughspun. This is one of those posts. Go gently on me! We toss around the notion of karma like a harmless play-thing, we use it to suggest that people get what they deserve; that both horrible and good things are deserved in some sense. We warn against actions because of the karmic retribution that may come from them, and we tell the people we love that they\u2019re surely \u201cdue\u201d some good tidings after they\u2019ve suffered some undeserved misfortune, because of how good they truly are. From Flickr, by galo/* And when a child has autism, we look for what must have caused this \u201cmisfortune,\u201d what the mother or father must have done to call this down on themselves, they must have abused the child or injected it with toxins. We say things like \u201cthis happened for a reason,\u201d in an effort to make some cosmic sense, to suggest all things are in balance and purposeful in some way. We listen to theories that autism  is caused by  \u201cenergetic legacies from unresolved family issues in previous generations.\u201d And we think that  other people getting autistic children is what they deserved for saying mean things to us in the past . Or, we don\u2019t. When I was a youngster, I had a friend who lived by the saying \u201cshit happens.\u201d I thought the saying was pointless and was a way of giving up responsibility and control. It\u2019s only years later that I realise the true worth of such a statement, ironically brought home to me by a  very well researched and well thought-out essay  by Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg. In that essay Rachel puts a different light on disability than that we grow up with in today\u2019s culture. She highlights that disability is not some evil thing that is done to someone, rather it is part of the natural human state. We experience disability as part of our very human lives. I think she will forgive me if I quote an entire paragraph for you, because she says it better than I could, and you\u2019ll find the rest of her insights at the link provided above: \u201c [A]s a number of disability studies scholars have noted, disability is a condition to which the human body, because of its fragility, inevitably tends. Tobin Siebers echoes Shakespeare and Watson in asserting that, if we recognize the fragility of human bodies, then disability becomes central to the human experience and not its exception. Because all bodies are vulnerable to injury, illness, and age, disability is \u201ca defining characteristic of human beings\u201d (Siebers 2011, 178). Disability, to turn conventional wisdom on its head, is neither exotic nor tragic, but utterly ordinary and common to all societies, in our era and in every other. As Linton notes, disabilities can be difficult, but they are \u201cnevertheless part of the dailiness of life\u201d (Linton 1998, 4). \u201d So, if we can \u2013 and I think we must \u2013 accept that disability is part of the human experience, for better or worse, that some are born with it or come to it through accident or grow into it through old age, then trying to accord it some deeper role in the grand scheme of cosmic justice and karmic balance, strikes me as misguided and cruel. To do so, first almost always accepts that it is an abhorrent evil; something that was \u201ccaused\u201d by a bad choice that we or our grandparents made, when sometimes it was just the roll of the genetic dice or a bunch of factors that converged outside of our control. If we view disability (including autism) as something inherently negative that reflects both purposeful action and some sort of expression of justice, we turn other people into mere negative \u201cconsequences.\u201d Even if you see autism as some sort of fantastic product that came about through the awesomeness of the parents, you are relegating the person with autism to being what someone else \u201cdeserves.\u201d Whatever the cause of autism, and disabilities, they do occur. We try to discover and address the causes where we can to alleviate severity of symptoms if possible, or we may find there was nothing that could have (or should have) been done to make things otherwise. The fact remains that these things happen sometimes and they don\u2019t have to be turned into a tragedy or a piece of karma, to accord them deeper meaning or to make sense of them. The investigation of the origins and treatments for autism, do not require and are not advanced by buying into the idea of karma, despite what some (too many) clearly believe. Speaking of karma in relation to it, just turns people into deserved consequences of others\u2019 actions, and either romaticises or demonises a medical condition. So yeah, \u201cshit happens.\u201d Good shit, bad shit, things don\u2019t always have some deeper meaning or (as yet, perhaps) discernible cause. Disabled people don\u2019t exist just to inspire us (\u201c inspiration porn,\u201d another area that Rachel  has a profound and fascinating understanding of), or for  any other \u201cpurpose\u201d to the rest of us so-called normal people . They are people, with their own desires and their own stories to tell, and those stories don\u2019t have to whittled down to some moral that the rest of us can package up and carry around to post on our Facebook statuses when we\u2019re in the mood. If we let go of this idea of karma, of deeper meaning and purpose to disability and autism, we treat people with more respect as I see it. We also then take a step back from the sort of horrible, overly simplistic, and deeply misguided theories and expressions about autism that I gave at the start of this post.

{"date": "July 21, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n A while ago  I wrote about the ongoing problems we\u2019ve had with my son\u2019s sleep  (at the time, some of the core issues were regular wakings at 3am, and sleeping sideways on his bed). In the process of writing that post, I got thinking about what was causing the disturbance and odd habits, and how I might be able to address them. Eventually I decided he needed something to focus on during the night when he woke to break the habit of coming to our room; a new routine he could perform in his own room to replace the visit to our bedroom. I bought him a bus pillow. I chose a bus pillow because he loves vehicles, and he loves squeezing pressure; hugging his bus pillow ticked the boxes. I sat him down and explained to him that instead of coming to mummy and daddy\u2019s room when he wakes in the night, he should grab his bus pillow, squeeze it really tight, and go back to sleep. I repeated this tale to him many times, and showed him how to do it. I got him to repeat it for me, and reinforced his actions with praise and cuddles. It worked. But as with each solution to a problem caused by my son\u2019s autism, unforeseen new obsessions or consequences arise in response. As his occupational therapist used to tell me: It\u2019s two steps forward, one step back. You open up new doors in the mind, and somewhere another door blows shut. Sure enough, the improved sleep patterns started unraveling again. This time he wanted to make sure that the bus pillow was facing the right way, and needed our help to assure this. The bus pillow must be upside down, with the bus doors facing him. Sometimes the bus pillow goes missing over the side of his bed, and he asks me to fetch it back. Two nights ago I got out of bed three times at his request, but none were specifically bus pillow related: One was needing a wee, another was he wanted his sheets to be straight, and the third was he\u2019d fallen off the side of the bed (poor thing, but he was OK, just a tad shocked). Even though none of those three events were specifically bus pillow related, each time that I returned him to bed I had to make sure the bus pillow was upside down and with doors facing him. (Not that easy to do in the dark might I add; he doesn\u2019t want the light on but somehow knows his bus pillow is facing the wrong way, but needs help to correct it.) We\u2019ve had other sleep-time changes since that last post too. Of particular note, he now sleeps lengthways in his bed, with his head on a pillow instead of requiring two pillows to either side of his head. I take my successes where I can get them. The sleep problems will continue, and change in type over time. But taking a step back I can see the strong trend of overall improvement: A child who sleeps under sheets; with season appropriate clothing; who doesn\u2019t rub his head on the wall to the point of causing bald patches; who is able to sleep through the night at least sometimes; and who almost never wets the bed. Sure, he likes his sheets straight, and his tissue box and two handkerchiefs beside him on the bed each night, and yes his room sounds somewhat unusual at night as  his various clocks and watches  fill the otherwise silence with endless tickings; but each night as he goes to bed hugging his upside-down bus, he has a smile across that perfect little face of his. And I remind myself: Two steps forward, one step back, is still progress. And if he\u2019s going to bed each night happy, then we must be progressing in a good direction. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bed_in_Seattle_hotel.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/his-bus-pillow/", "title": "His Bus Pillow"},

{"date": "July 22, 2011", "body": "\n Image by mattbeckwith via Flickr \n People really don\u2019t like being told that the numbers of autistic diagnoses are rising because it has become \u201cfashionable.\u201d It elicits passionate outcries that autism is a genuine condition, and there is genuine suffering going on. And leads to people \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 demanding evidence that it has become popular in a way that has led to incorrect diagnoses. However, pointing out that a growing number of cases of autism aren\u2019t actually autism, is not the same as claiming it isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d; it\u2019s just the claim that some of the time, autism is a useful label to achieve certain ends seen as more important than an accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, there is evidence and facts that strongly suggest an increase based around such false diagnoses. I will expand on that below. Before I go further I want to acknowledge and explain the depth of emotion you inevitably see in response to professionals who point out this fad-nature of autism diagnoses. Parents of autistic children get used to having to defend themselves and their children from the ignorance of lay-people, who think there\u2019s nothing wrong with their child that a bit of discipline wouldn\u2019t fix. There are also a large number of vocal people out there who deny autism is a legitimate diagnosis in any situation. So when we see professionals pointing out that there are instances of autism that aren\u2019t really autism (and that is in part responsible for the rise in autism numbers), those well-meaning and passionate parents of genuinely autistic children, react the same way that they would when faced with people who out-right deny autism or attack their child\u2019s diagnosis. It\u2019s no surprise that the common response by parents is \u201ccome look after my child then, and tell me there\u2019s nothing wrong with him.\u201d That is an understandable reaction to someone claiming autism doesn\u2019t exist or an individual\u2019s specific child isn\u2019t autistic, but an entirely confused and irrelevant response to the claim that autism is over-diagnosed because it has become fashionable. That word \u201cfashionable\u201d or \u201cfad\u201d is what often gets the heckles up: How can it be fashionable to have a severely challenged child who has objective problems that stay with them a lifetime, despite every intervention? Problems that can even sometimes be identified by differences at a genetic level? That seems a perverse claim. And it would be a perverse claim, if it was being used to deny the suffering associated with autism, or being taken as a claim that people always enjoy having a child with autism. But fashionable in this context is referring to a number of easily observed trends: Clinicians that purposefully label a child \u201cautistic\u201d when they are not, because they (for example) want the best services for that child, and individuals who proudly self-identity as autistic because the term has become equated with superior intellect and creativity, while also explaining (or excusing) other (less savory) aspects of their personality and life-style. Indeed, it seems that these sorts of cases are what Allan Frances is referring to in his much-attacked recent article, \u201c The Autism Generation :\u201d: The most likely cause of the autism epidemic is that autism has become fashionable \u2013 a popular fad diagnosis. Once rare and unmistakable, the term is now used loosely to describe people who do not really satisfy the narrow criteria intended for it by DSM IV. Autism now casts a wide net, catching much milder problems that previously went undiagnosed altogether or were given other labels. Autism is no longer seen as an extremely disabling condition, and many creative and normally eccentric people have discovered their inner autistic self. This dramatic swing from under- to overdiagnosis has been fueled by widespread publicity, Internet support and advocacy groups, and the fact that expensive school services are provided only for those who have received the diagnosis. The Korean study, for example, was financed by an autism advocacy group, which could barely contain its enthusiasm at the high rates that were reported. So where is the evidence of this \u201cfashionable autism;\u201d of (at times purposeful) misdiagnoses and over-diagnoses? Yes, we all know of people who self-identify as autistic because they think it\u2019s trendy and somewhat amusing to do so, because we all know people who think they\u2019ve got whatever the buzz is lately. They\u2019re the same sort of people who think they have the latest virus because it\u2019s on the news a lot (even though they just have a cold). Not just hypochondriacs; perfectly normal folk who start seeing themselves in a different light just because they keep coming across the same topic and start to self-identify. \u201cI\u2019m sad\u201d becomes \u201cI\u2019m clinically depressed\u201d (even though they never seen a professional about it). \u201cI\u2019m fat\u201d becomes \u201cI have big bones and metabolism problems\u201d because that\u2019s the in-thing to say. This is not the same claim that no one is ever clinically depressed or no one ever has metabolism issues, or that the associated suffering of the genuine complaints is untrue. It\u2019s just that some people are highly responsive to fads, and these sorts of fads appeal to the idea that our problems are not of our own doing, some external or uncontrollable force is victimizing us. It shifts the blame. I have also met and heard of the parents of children who neglect or even abuse their children (depending on how you want to characterise their parenting), and then label the predictable resulting behaviour as autism or Aspergers. Of course the vast majority of us don\u2019t do this, and have genuinely autistic children who we passionately parent with the sort of dedication that leaves us physically and emotionally exhausted everyday. But some do. There are ass-hats out there who genuinely refuse to parent or discipline their child, and then seek an external or uncontrollable explanation to place the blame on, instead of their own failings. Thinking there is no one who would ever do such a thing, is like believing no one would ever kill or rape or steal; just because something is unthinkable and immoral to you, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. Fact is, there are some crap people out there, and some of them are doing the sorts of things that give the rest of us a bad and undeserved name. But are there professionals who would support and encourage such mis-diagnoses? Yes. The same way there are doctors who diagnose precocious puberty because it matches a theory they have about autism and supposedly justifies an expensive treatment plan. The same way doctors variously lose their licenses because of dodgy and unethical diagnostic (and other) practices. But it\u2019s not just professionals pandering to an eager audience; some of them also actively  seek out  those clients and generously hand out diagnoses when they haven\u2019t otherwise been requested or suggested by the parents or individuals concerned. Once these practitioners get a name for such liberal diagnoses, word of mouth attracts an ever-growing clientele who are positive their child deserves a diagnosis that has been turned down time after time at other practices. Indeed, I have written about such a local doctor before. He is the go-to guy for an autism spectrum diagnosis, and I\u2019ve heard from many parents who are positive their child doesn\u2019t have autism despite his diagnosis that they do. Parents who research and attend meetings and read books so they can better understand their child, and find out their child simply doesn\u2019t match the information every other professional body is telling them about autism. It\u2019s not just dodgy doctors who would do such things (doctors perhaps seeking the money and profile that comes from being known as the go-to guy). Perfectly good and arguably moral doctors, will also very often give a diagnosis for reasons other than accuracy. Those good doctors are like the ones spoken about in Grinker\u2019s book  \u201cUnstrange Minds .\u201d A quote from one such doctor in his book: \u201c I am incredibly disciplined in the diagnostic classifications in my research, but in my private practice, I\u2019ll call a kid a zebra if it will get him the educational services I think he needs .\u201d Grinker\u2019s book outlines the growing and impressive supports in place for children with an autism diagnosis (note though, as a side point, that \u201cgrowing and impressive\u201d does not equate with \u201cadequate\u201d). Often the services that would suit an autistic child\u2019s special needs, will also suit a child with a different diagnosis, but because of particular classifications or funding they are better off going under the head of \u201cautism\u201d: \u201c.. if a mentally retarded child without autism is incorrectly given an autism diagnosis, he or she might actually get better treatment than would be possible under the correct diagnosis .\u201d Or the child has minor problems that fall short of the autism spectrum, but would benefit hugely from access to the services available to autistic children (such as extra individualised tuition and behavioural management strategies.) Grinker also explains the variations in diagnosis from one clinician to the next: \u201c They make the diagnosis that they believe is most helpful for the child, but are not slaves to DSM criteria. This is why you can take your child to four clinicians and conceivably get four different diagnoses .\u201d It is easy to see how, with the increase in awareness and services for autism, that there could be a significant shift towards \u201cautism\u201d when trying to choose the \u201cbest\u201d diagnosis for an individual child. Grinker refers to a study in 1988 about ADHD, which showed notable diversity in the diagnoses given by clinicians for the same group of children, \u201c The clinicians agreed with each other only about 25 percent of the time\u2026 \u201c. (Anyone interested in reading further about these variations, and how funding and services can lead to an inaccurate increase in diagnostic numbers, would be well advised to read the book, it really is an eye-opener. All of this feeds into his wider argument that we are not experiencing a real \u201cautism epidemic.\u201d) So there is evidence for the inconsistency of diagnoses between clinicians, meaning a diagnosis of autism might not always be \u201cobjective\u201d, particularly at the edges of the disorder. On top of that, there is actual incentive in some countries and regions to pursue a diagnosis of autism. It\u2019s also easy to understand why some parents and individuals prefer the label \u201cautistic\u201d over comparative terms (\u201cnaughty\u201d, \u201caggressive\u201d, etc), and that various clinicians for various motives will accommodate those people. Add to that the increasing awareness and de-stigmatisation of autism, and it\u2019s really quite easy to see autism in terms of being \u201cfashionable\u201d and that fashionableness impacting noticeably on diagnosis numbers. How much all these factors play into the actual increase, is unclear and no doubt hard to establish. Made all the more impossible by the number of other factors also feeding an increase: Increased awareness, increased understanding, changes in the way autism is defined and counted, and real increase in incidence. Trying to figure out which of those factors is dominant, or the percentage of relevance of each to the whole in relation to each other, is a challenge (to understate it hugely). At the very least, there is good reason and evidence to not simply dismiss the notion of over-diagnosis and mis-diagnosis. So when we see someone pointing out that autism is popular or fashionable, it\u2019s a good idea to put aside the (fully understandable) emotional and defensive reactions that we\u2019ve developed as parents of children who are frequently misunderstood. Try to clarify whether the person is denying that autism exists. If they are not denying its existence, and merely pointing out that diagnosis numbers have increased \u2013 even for children who are borderline non-autistic or simply not autistic at all \u2013 then I think that claim has to be looked at seriously. There does appear to be evidence for shifting diagnoses depending on who\u2019s performing the diagnosis, and evidence that clinicians will choose a diagnosis based on services provided rather than what precisely matches the official manual they\u2019re meant to be working from. The quality and quantity of that evidence is something of interest, no doubt. But the existence of the problem, is not in doubt either. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/90058596@N00/4485330575", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/frances1/English"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/ill-call-a-kid-a-zebra-recognising-fashionable-autism/", "title": "\u201cI\u2019ll call a kid a zebra\u2026\u201d: Recognising \u201cFashionable Autism\u201d"},
{"date": "July 29, 2011", "body": "\n Image by TheAlieness GiselaGiardino\u00b2\u00b3 via Flickr \n Being confident and bold are no more signs of intelligence, than shyness and anxiety are signs of lack of intelligence. Yet the way a child\u2019s intelligence is measured, will often rely on how forth-coming and confident they are. I\u2019ve written previously about the  confusions and misinformation surrounding the intelligence  and the  testing of the intelligence , of autistic children. Today I came across yet  another piece  shedding light on difficulties in measuring a child\u2019s intelligence, which particularly shows how and why autistic children would under-perform on such tests (though the piece is not specifically written about autistic children, its insights clearly apply). When a test requires a timely response, or observed behaviour, a shy or anxious child is at a disadvantage; whereby part of what the test is measuring (or rather, being distorted by) is the social skills and confidence of the child. If one decides that social skills and confidence is what one is trying to measure \u2013 rather than the ability to reason, to use skills, and recall information \u2013 then that\u2019s fine. But clearly, that is not the intention of most intelligence tests. This doesn\u2019t mean autistic children are simpliciter more intelligent than the tests show (and it does not mean the more extreme proposal often made; that autistic people are inherently more intelligent than non-autistic people); but it does mean that there is an extremely good chance that autistic children\u2019s intelligence is being underestimated, and sometimes with serious consequences. Particularly when intelligence tests are being used to set up a child\u2019s future education and to set expectations in general for what our children can achieve. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/36613169@N00/103902134", "http://blogs.babycenter.com/mom_stories/7-25-2011-is-your-kid-unclever%E2%80%A6or-just-timid/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/bold-intelligence-how-shyness-and-anxiety-can-impact-on-tests-for-intelligence/", "title": "Bold Intelligence; how shyness and anxiety can impact on measuring a child\u2019s\u00a0intelligence"},
{"date": "July 25, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n When talking about my son, I will variously refer to him as \u201cautistic\u201d or that he is a child \u201cwith autism.\u201d My choice at any point in time depends on what makes the sentence flow better, and provides the clearest meaning. However, for a significant number of people, their choice between the terms reflects what they think of as a more enlightened perspective and awareness of autism, than people who choose the other option. But which one is \u201cmore enlightened\u201d, and why? It\u2019s not nearly as straightforward as some claim. Such terminology choices supposedly reflect attitudes and beliefs about autism. Specifically: whether autism is one trait of many in an individual, or central to their identity; whether its existence is permanent or transitory; and whether autism is something horrible or beautiful. Furthermore, is the relevant attitude towards autism that is supposedly reflected in the chosen words, a reflection of the views of the person using the word, or a reflection of society\u2019s attitudes towards autism as appreciated by the person using the word? Frankly, you\u2019re going to be damned no matter which term you choose, and I\u2019m far more interested in the substance of what someone says rather than getting hooked up on whether they used \u201cautistic\u201d or \u201chas autism\u201d. But I do think it\u2019s worth explaining the depth of confusion and contradiction involved in claims that choosing one type of terminology over another reveals something vital about your attitude towards autism. I\u2019m going to begin with the attitude that autism is just a trait of a person, rather than the whole identity of the person. Usually, those holding this view will argue for the use of the terminology , \u201chas/with autism\u201d rather than \u201cautistic.\u201d But is the trait a changeable one, or an inherent one? Is it something that can be altered with time (eg, is autism curable), or is it more like eye colour (you can make it look different externally but it is always there underneath)? If it\u2019s the former, you\u2019re more likely to use \u201chas autism\u201d, if it\u2019s the latter, you\u2019re more likely to say \u201cis autistic\u201d despite the fact that it is just a trait. So already we see that the idea of autism being a trait rather than central to identity, isn\u2019t a clear-cut answer to chosen terminology. But it gets worse. Let\u2019s accept that it is either transitory or permanent, but definitely a trait (rather than central to the person); that still won\u2019t mean one type of phrase is more accurate or enlightened than the other. For example, let\u2019s say my eyes are blue. You could say I have blue eyes or I am blue-eyed. Both is OK, though the former does perhaps feel more natural. But if you use the latter, you have not denied it is merely a trait, and made the error of equating my entire being with the trait (as many claim re using the word \u201cautistic\u201d), you are just making an observation about something I have. That hardly makes the person who calls someone else \u201cblue-eyed\u201d, cruel by equating my whole being with my blue-eyedness. Even if we accept that autism is just a trait, and it is important to not equate the whole person with the trait by referring to them as \u201cautistic\u201d (which I have already pointed out, isn\u2019t a particularly strong argument), the moral relevance of that equating it with identity, depends on your view of whether autism is a good thing or a bad thing. If the \u201ctrait\u201d of autism is seen as a negative thing, then you are far more likely to want to distance it from the person; it is just something they  have , not something they  are . Whereby using the terminology \u201chas autism\u201d might make more sense. But if the owning of the autism trait, is seen as a trait, but a positive one, you are more likely to have no compunctions about the phrase, \u201cis autistic\u201d, since it\u2019s not going to demean or mark out the person in some cruel way. But who\u2019s opinion towards autism matters? If you\u2019re worried about society\u2019s attitude towards autism \u2013 you know it\u2019s not the end of the world but society thinks it is \u2013 then you may push for the \u201chas autism\u201d designation. But if society\u2019s attitude does suck monkey balls, and you want to change it, you might actually encourage people to use \u201cautistic\u201d as a show of pride and intentional ownership of the supposed trait. The strongest position for consistently using \u201chas autism\u201d then, is reflected by the view that (a) autism is at least potentially transitory, rather than a permanent aspect of the person, (b) autism is a trait rather than a larger aspect of identity, and (c) it is a negative trait. As soon as you start to vary from those three parts, the argument for preferential use of \u201chas autism\u201d weakens even further (and it was pretty weak to begin with). Basically, the analogy of some unpleasant disease would be the strongest comparison. In the same way that you wouldn\u2019t call some one \u201ccancerian\u201d (unless you were referring to their star-sign), you would say they \u201chave cancer.\u201d What then, are the active (rather than re-active) claims for using the term \u201cautistic\u201d, and do these arguments fare any better in their persuasive force? \u201cAutistic\u201d, like \u201cJewish\u201d or \u201cAfrican\u201d can be used as a partial descriptor of identity. Except, autism is more than \u201cone of many\u201d aspects of someone\u2019s identity. Whether autism is transitory (potentially curable) or permanent, it affects so much of how the individuals observes, understands, and operates within the world, that referring to someone as \u201cautistic\u201d tells you a lot about them. Most people who actively adopt the word \u201cautistic\u201d in preference to \u201chas autism\u201d, see autism as something inherent to the person; that even if the symptoms of autism can be covered up with enough behavioural training and will-power, that autism still permeates the thought-processes of the person so that they remain \u201cautistic\u201d (even though autism is identified by its symptoms). Many people who choose to use the word \u201cautistic\u201d also adopt it as a power-term; signifying pride and belonging. Considering the largely negative opinions of society (at least historically) towards autism, this might be seen as a movement to own and redefine a label in a positive way \u201cyes, my son / I am autistic, you got a problem with that?\u201d. Alternately, it can just be seen as an acceptance of a truth about one-self at a more observational (less emotive) level: \u201cI am autistic\u201d much like \u201cI am female.\u201d Usually it\u2019s a mix of the two: A sort of acceptance of an observational truth. The attack that calling someone autistic, means you are ignoring the person behind the autism, is a presumption that the autism and the person are separable, which is not self-evident. It is also a presumption that calling someone autistic means we have forgotten the rest of their identity. This is rather absurd; it would be like saying that calling someone \u201cChristian\u201d means you have forgotten their gender, their hair colour, their relationship status, etc. This idea \u2013 that calling someone autistic appears to cancel out other aspects of their identity \u2013 again seems to turn on the notion that knowing or seeing someone as autistic, damages or hurts them in some way. And now we\u2019re back to the negative view of autism, and whose negative view is relevant (society\u2019s or the individual speaking) and how that attitude can be changed (by proudly adopting the terminology, or by fighting it by showing the person behind the label). It would seem that the strongest position for using the word \u201cautistic\u201d to define a person in preference to \u201chas autism\u201d is (a) when autism is seen as a permanent aspect of a\u00a0 person, (b) that is central to their identity rather than a trait (for example), and (c) autism is seen as having positive connotations. As soon as you soften any of these three notions, you\u2019ll strengthen the pull of the alternate phrase, \u201chas autism.\u201d Frankly though, a preference for the use of either \u201chas autism\u201d or \u201cis autistic\u201d isn\u2019t strong either way. And the presumptions people place on others about their beliefs, for using one term rather than the other, are usually poorly or inadequately thought-out (or at least, poorly or inadequately expressed). At the very least, attacking some poor soul for not using what you think is the \u201cright\u201d terminology, is not wise. Better to always read what they have to say; look at their content rather than their turn of phrase. Particularly if their message contradicts your assumptions about the beliefs expressed in the chosen phrase. Like I said at the start, I prefer to pick and choose the terminology as suits my writing style at the time. Sometimes \u201chas autism\u201d is cumbersome and drags out a sentence. Sometimes \u201cautistic\u201d doesn\u2019t provide the right emphasis or deliver the right punch. Hell, sometimes I choose which one I want purely cause it sounds great: \u201cThe awesome artistic autistic\u201d sounds better than \u201cthe awesome artistic person with autism.\u201d Or \u201cThe child with a beautiful mind, a soaring soul, and autism\u201d delivers a different feel and focus than \u201cthe autistic child with a beautiful mind and a soaring soul.\u201d Sometimes the message you are trying to get across with your writing is held back by being forced to choose a particular phraseology. There are times when there are objective and convincing arguments for the choice of one phrase over another, but in my own musings and experience, I do not think choosing between \u201cautistic\u201d and \u201chas autism\u201d is one of those cases. (I encourage you to attempt to convince me otherwise though.)

{"date": "September 7, 2012", "body": "Over the years I have tried to understand my son\u2019s obsessive interests; to get insight to what motivates and interests him, and to find windows into his own world. In past posts I have expressed my efforts to see patterns of meaning and evolution in his interests; theorizing \u2013 for example \u2013 that it was \u201cthe circle\u201d that intrigued him, as his interests shifted from spinning wheels, to clocks and time, and now indeed to an intense interest in the movement of the planets. I have shared the idea that perhaps it is the predictability of the circle \u2013 and of these manifestations of circularity (turning, time) \u2013 that draws him in, since that predictable circle movement perhaps appeals to his need for foreknowledge and order in a disordered world. I did wonder if I was imposing my own overly convoluted conceptions (this idea of him being able to see time as linked to circles), over the top of his more simple attraction to these things; if perhaps I was over-thinking something that was really far more obvious and / or simple, in my effort to understand this different mind. My theory might get in the way of really understanding what was driving him and interesting him so much in these topics. So as much as possible I try to maintain an open mind while I observe and love this boy, whilst also actively trying to make sense of why he does what he does. And so today, I was pleased to find myself challenged in my understanding of what might be driving my son, when I read a post called \u201c How do people with ASD really feel about novelty, \u201d by Emily at \u201cMosaic of Minds.\u201d In that post, Emily shares some very interesting questions about how to reconcile movements between intense interests, with the common thought that autistic people shun novelty. In the post she mentions the idea that types of interests evolve with growing intellectual maturity \u2013 say a movement from interest in an object to interest in a topic \u2013 which would make sense for my evolution-circle-theory I came up with for my son. But what drives that choice to move from wheels to clocks to planets? Is it that he lost interest in the previous topics (as Emily says, \u201cASD people periodically change their special interests, adding new ones and dropping old ones.\u201d) I don\u2019t see it in this way, at least not for my boy. He still loves wheels and clocks while his planet obsession grows, he just spends more time actively asking about and interacting with the latest topic. He hasn\u2019t dropped the old topics and moved on, per se. Of course this doesn\u2019t mean other autistic children (and adults) don\u2019t do exactly that: drop old topics and move on to unrelated new ones. But I would find it extremely interesting to see progression lists of intense interests. I know many autistic children start by obsessively spinning and collecting wheels. I also know there are strong stereotypes of older autistic children enjoying machinery and trains, which again, are variations on the wheel theme. Dinosaurs are an example Emily brings up, which would interrupt the pattern though. Perhaps we need to ask at exactly what point the new obsessions (and I make no apology for using that word,  obsessions  is the word I want), come to the fore. Why it was that the \u201cnew\u201d topic caught the eye and imagination. Is it a underappreciated desire for novelty that drives it, or is it really after-all just an expression \u2013 albeit an evolving one with intellectual maturity \u2013 of the need for predictability. To put it another way, is the movement  itself  between obsessions, merely just a modified expression of that need for sameness, rather than evidence of the contrary? Obsessions are just one aspect \u2013 one reflection \u2013 of the autistic desire for predictability, certainty, and order. There are many other ways my son seeks out certainty in his everyday life, and he copes much better in his daily life when it runs to a strong routine and when it comes with advanced warning of any breaks from routine (don\u2019t we all?) The way of course that his need for routine differs so much from joe-average, is that without it he can enter meltdown and have harmful anxiety reactions, and his ability to cope with change in general is significantly impaired compared to others. However, my son is just one autistic individual, and I have heard stories too \u2013 though far more rarely \u2013 of autistic children who actively and joyfully seek out newness. At its extreme, \u201cwandering\u201d comes to mind as a possible (and all too common) example of the desire to seek change and newness. It is hard to reconcile the urge to wander and obliviousness to danger, alongside some wider need for total predictability. I think it helps to remember (as an illustration) the divisions between \u201csensory seeking\u201d and \u201csensory avoiding\u201d to try to make sense of such differences, in that they\u2019re both sensory processing issues that a single individual can contain (my son is a supposedly mix of sensory seeking and sensory avoiding in differing contexts for example); that what matters is observing and understanding that information about someone, in order to better help them and keep them safe and happy. What I\u2019m trying to say is that in some ways autistic people might actively seek newness, and in other ways strongly avoid it, but perhaps they\u2019re both expressions of issues with coping with change in ways that are unhelpful or restrictive (or depending on your view-point and experience, supremely advantageous). I have more questions than answers right now (clearly). And if this post reads somewhat like a muddy stream of consciousness, that\u2019s because it is. I\u2019m trying to better understand my son, to better understand autism, and to better understand the human mind more generally along the way. Why my son obsesses over circles and wheels and clocks and planets is an interesting topic for me, but whatever the reason for his interests \u2013 and whatever deeper truths it might hint at about autism \u2013 I will continue to, and always will, share in his passions and be glad that he enjoys and learns so much from them too.

{"date": "September 8, 2012", "body": "Earlier this year I was reading a  national newspaper lifestyle story , about a family taking their Asperger\u2019s child with them on holiday to Fiji. As I read it I felt very uncomfortable about the family\u2019s attitude and approach to their child\u2019s debilitating sensory issues, but I couldn\u2019t quite pin-point why it seemed so very wrong. More recently I was directed towards  a piece, also written by a mother , about how she lives and deals with her autistic (PDD-NOS) child\u2019s \u201cfears.\u201d She treated and talked about the fears as if they are a grouping of distinct and irrational phobias, even though the what she describes is very clearly classic sensory issues. Both these writings left me with the same uncomfortable niggling feeling, that something was wrong and potentially harmful in the way they were dealing with their autistic children. Both also left me biting my tongue, because I loathe drawing negative attention to parents who are just doing their best to cope with their children\u2019s significant challenges; this world is already full of people criticizing others\u2019 parenting decisions from a position of ignorance. However, I have ultimately decided to write this post, because I worry that the information and approaches they support and encourage, may be unhelpfully distorting and misleading for parents who are seeking ways to cope with their autistic children. I write this post not from a perspective of \u201cI know best\u201d or \u201cthese parents are bad parents,\u201d rather, to cast a different perspective (and perhaps, a challenge) to those approaches to sensory issues. First, to clarify the problem: Sensory issues in autistic children, are not irrational fears. The well-meaning mothers in those two pieces seem to have accepted that their children will always carry these fears, and that as parents they just have to either force their children to face those fears, or must help their children completely avoid those fears. Both expressly talk about their children as either irrational or incapable of reasoning when it comes to talking about their fears. Both parents also expressly advise against preparing their autistic children for up-coming known stressors, preferring to give as little amount of time as possible to having to put up with the child\u2019s fearful responses. For example, in the first piece, the mother chooses not to tell her child they\u2019re going to Fiji until the day before they leave (and even then, they appear to have let it slip, rather than intended to tell the child)! They had a two month lead up during which they apparently did nothing to actually prepare him for what was going to happen on the trip, and yet the title of the story is \u201cHolidaying with autistic children all about planning ahead.\u201d The irony is disturbing. In the second piece, the mother says: \u201c in general we don\u2019t prep James for the \u201cscary stuff.\u201d If he knows there will be a fireworks show that evening, that\u2019s just more time for his anxiety to fester (and more times we have to discuss said event). \u201d If sensory issues are seen as inherently irrational and as primarily about fear, these approaches might make sense; though I have concerns that such an approach to phobias is also problematic: Both for sensory issues and for fears \u2013 especially when they are affecting daily life as it is for these families \u2013 it is surely best to try to decipher the cause, desensitize if possible, and at the very least provide the affected individual with coping strategies. Avoidance and lack of warning, achieve none of these things. And \u2013 particularly for autistic children \u2013 forcing encounters (\u201c Don\u2019t ask, tell. \u201cAfter the Ferris wheel, we\u2019re headed to dinner.\u201d If we ask, he\u2019ll say no, so why ask?\u201d ) can actually enhance the existing anxiety reactions and potentially make them much worse. So what might one do instead? First recognise the importance of figuring out the triggers and why they are triggers. Occupational therapists are excellent at helping families with this task. Once you know the reasons behind the reactions you are in a better position to equip the child to cope when these situations arise (blocking ears if it\u2019s the sound, looking away if it\u2019s the visual, counting to ten if it\u2019s the time frame or just as a \u201cget through this\u201d method, whatever). If the child can\u2019t cope in such ways, or you can\u2019t figure out the precise causative nature of the issue, preparing the child for the foreseeable stressor can actually be very soothing and reassuring, even though it alerts the child to the upcoming event. The use of social stories is great to this end, particularly because they can illustrate that there is an inevitable  end  to the stressor. For example: \u201cWe will get on the ferris wheel, it will go around, mummy and daddy will be with me the whole time and we will be safe, then we will get off and go to dinner.\u201d Just knowing the event is coming, and that it will end, can make the world of difference. Not knowing it is coming can actually increase the severity of the reaction, if only because lack of fore-knowledge  in and of itself  can be very upsetting for our kids, regardless of what it might be that\u2019s going to happen. Beyond these points, it is also better for the parent-child relationship, if the child is forewarned: Imagine what it does to a child\u00a0 \u2013 any child, not just an autistic one \u2013 to grow up in a home where they can\u2019t trust and rely on their parents to warn or prepare them for upcoming horrors. Having negative experiences sprung on you, deliberately without warning, would surely just increase anxiety levels in daily life, rather than reduce it. We need to help our children to find ways to cope in this noisy unpredictable world, and we must do so mindful of the specific challenges that come with autism. No I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single way to do this, I\u2019m sure there are multiple successful paths to the same joyful outcome. But when I read stories like in those two pieces, where the parents seem lost in the struggles and to almost have resigned to their children\u2019s fears, I feel the need to say something, even if only to offer up this alternative view-point; that treating and thinking of sensory issues as if they are irrational fears, is perhaps not in the best interests of the child nor their family. We all \u2013 including autistic children \u2013 do things for a reason. Figuring out that reason, is the first step towards a bit more peace for everyone involved. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=10783610", "http://www.childmind.org/en/posts/articles/2012-8-31-small-child-big-fears-living-sons-phobia", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/synet/3908410863/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/sensory-issues-are-not-the-same-as-irrational-fears/", "title": "Sensory Issues are not the same as \u201cIrrational Fears.\u201d"},
{"date": "September 15, 2012", "body": "I frequently search news sites for both local and international stories on autism. I prefer to use New Zealand sites, in order to pick up the local stories that otherwise go unreported from the larger international sources. I decided that it might be interesting to do my own analysis of what these stories are most often about; I had my intuitions and it turns out that my intuitions were largely wrong. For this analysis I used the  New Zealand Herald site  \u2013 the major national newspaper \u2013 and  stuff.co.nz  which allows you to search among Fairfax\u2019s many regional publications, including the prestigious Dominion Post. I searched as far back as 2007 for the regionals at least, but not that far back in the national because they ran so many more stories per month that it quickly got unwieldy. My search term was quite simply \u201cautism.\u201d  There is nothing terribly scientific about my research and analysis, it was just me and pen and paper and some time to spare. These are the results I got, for what they\u2019re worth: The most commonly reported stories were stories about charities and fundraising, with 19% of the total 124 stories I investigated. I had expected stories about cures, treatments and causes to come top, but on reflection it\u2019s clear why the charity stories got the most press: Part of their function is to keep autism in the public eye, and they need to fundraise in order to continue their own existence and to help their members. To this end they have to know how to work and access the media, which they clearly do with some success. The group of stories that came in second were those covering causes, cures and treatments, with the biggest proportion of those coming from stories about causes (11% of the total 124, and 63% of the stories in this grouping). Oddly, the \u201ctreatment\u201d or therapy covered the most often, was about how dogs can help people with autism. I can only guess these are attractive stories with wide-appeal; who doesn\u2019t like an uplifting story about animals and disabled children? The dog stories spanned the range of years, showing up in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. Crime stories came in third. These were dominated by stories about autistic people being the criminals, rather than being the victims of crime. The crimes most focused on were looting and hacking / cyber crimes. It is not surprising that looting figured so prominently on the local stage, emotions were very high around the Christchurch Earthquake, and Arie\u2019s story caused the whole range of emotions to erupt across the country: From anger and outrage, to pity, and love. His story became one about deeper issues of justice, police brutality, and the rights of the disabled. ( Link to my various blog posts on Arie. ) Next came the stories about what it\u2019s like to live with autism. The number of these stories came equal with those about education. Impressively (and surprisingly for me considering what is so often heard from self-advocates who claim the family perspective is always put above the individual\u2019s with autism) the stories were perfectly equally split between those told by or from family members, and those told by or from the individuals themselves. So at least in this forum there appears to be some equality. Education stories were largely negative, many about the exclusion of those with autism from mainstream schools. There was only one particularly positive education story, about  schools celebrating autistic pupils on World Autism Awareness Day . Looking at what stories trended each year, some clearly stood out from the pack as unusual or momentous. In 2012 it\u2019s been the year of the Marmite shortage (\u201cMarmageddon\u201d), with a remarkable number of children with autism needing regular Marmite intake as part of their restricted diets. (Culminating in the charity Autism New Zealand having too much Marmite donated to them!) On a more serious note, the number of Marmite stories sat alongside the number of stories about  the local boy who drowned  when he was meant to be in respite care. 2011 was the year of Arie, the Christchurch earthquake looter, who I mentioned already above. It was also a year that autism charities were particularly struggling to stay afloat, and making sure the media took notice of their struggles (which continued into 2012). 2010 was the year of  Wakefield\u2019s downfall . Preceded by stories in 2008 and 2009 about studies being unable to replicate Wakefield\u2019s findings, and finding no link more generally between vaccines and autism. Vaccine-autism stories made up over half of the stories about the causes of autism across the total number for all years. 2007 was an interesting mix of a scattering of stories; about the \u201cscary rise\u201d in autism numbers, about the extraordinary talents of an autistic savant, and the controversy over Janet Frame being labeled as autistic ( this blog  has extensively collected pieces about the Janet Frame/autism claim, including citing  my own blog post  that referred to related issues more generally, if you\u2019re interested in the detailed background to that story). All up, I found the task of going through past stories to be interesting and somewhat eye-opening. I was pleasantly surprised at the real variety of stories, and that they weren\u2019t dominated by stories of miracle cures, on-going vaccine fears, and limited stereotypes of autistic people. It\u2019s nice to be surprised by the media sometimes, when so often these days they leave you cynical, skeptical and suspicious when it comes to the reporting of autism stories. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/", "http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=newspaper&l=cc&ct=0&mt=all&adv=1", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/rodney-times/4848396/School-celebrates-talents-of-autistic-people", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/3733878/Doctor-who-linked-autism-to-vaccine-banned", "http://slightlyframous.blogspot.co.nz/search?q=sarah+autism"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/09/15/analysis-of-nz-media-autism-stories-2007-2012/", "title": "Analysis of NZ Media Autism Stories,\u00a02007-2012."},
{"date": "September 21, 2012", "body": "Imagine yourself sitting at a desk in a large hall with hundreds of other students. You\u2019re about to sit an important exam, the results of which are very likely to impact on your future education and employment prospects. Everyone is told to start their exams; you hear the scratching of pens on paper all around you, and the flicking of turning pages. But you can\u2019t see your exam paper. You\u2019re blind. No one has provided you with a braille version of the exam, and you aren\u2019t allowed to have anyone read you the exam questions. You fail the exam, even though you knew the material perfectly. But it\u2019s fair, isn\u2019t it, because you and all the other students sat the exam under the exact same conditions. Right? Everyone understands what\u2019s gone wrong here. We all appreciate that the exam was picking up on abilities that had nothing to do with the material being examined; the ability to see. The exam\u2019s result tells you nothing meaningful about what the exam was made to test: The subject matter. The exam conditions themselves \u2013 a quiet hall, a fixed length of time, etc \u2013 are meant to be equalizers, so no one is at an unfair advantage or disadvantage in a way that would ruin the meaningfulness of the score you receive. An obvious advantage would be having a textbook during a closed-book test, or having internet access when no one else does. Visible and familiar disabilities, the public understands. Of course we make allowances for the deaf, the blind, the physically disabled. Those allowances do not undercut the equality of the exam conditions, they establish the equality, so the exam can function properly. What then of those with \u201cinvisible\u201d disabilities? Those with autism, dyslexia, ADHD? Specifically, those with what we label, \u201clearning disabilities.\u201d A type of disability which doesn\u2019t necessarily impact on actual intelligence or the ability to understand a topic, but which does impact on the equality of the exam-room situation? People for whom allowing more time, allowing rest breaks, allowing reader-writer assistance, will enable them to be meaningfully examined on the topic. We already allow for this quite readily for people who have \u201cnormal\u201d functioning, but are under extra strain at the time of examination. For example, we review marks of those who were very ill at the time of the exam and may allow for the mark to be altered to better match their internal assessments. Or take the example of when I was seven months pregnant with my first son, and the university allowed me to take more time in a major exam, to allow for my frequent toilet-breaks while the little man sat on my bladder. This flexibility is a good thing, an honest response to relevant inequalities. Here in New Zealand, we do allow for those with learning disabilities, to sit their exams in special conditions, according to their need. But it is not treated like a right; you have to pay professionals to aid your case, and the school has to apply on your behalf. You may be refused, and have to appeal. You may be granted support one year, but not the next. You may also have to undergo intelligence assessment, according to a recent complaint by the Dyslexia Foundation of New Zealand, which is an organisation becoming increasingly concerned about  a strong trend this year of turning down applicants who have learning disabilities . The only place I could find reference to intelligence levels being relevant to whether someone receives special conditions for exams or not, was the Ministry of Education\u2019s statement  on its website , that low intelligence  by itself  is not grounds for special assistance. I cannot see how this would ever necessitate intelligence tests for those who have provided proof of learning disabilities. And yet that is apparently exactly what is happening. As the Dyslexia Foundation expresses the point so well: \u201c Beyond the obvious issue of how \u201cintelligence\u201d is relevant at all, the problem with this is that \u201cintelligence\u201d may be masked by learning difference, and any conventional test of intelligence based on a student\u2019s ability to concentrate, comprehend and respond to written material will be impacted by learning difference. \u201d There is growing anecdotal and professional evidence that an increasing number of students are being denied the assistance. The official word for NZQA (New Zealand Qualifications Authority) who run the process and make these decisions, is that there hasn\u2019t been a drop in approvals, just an increase in those applying. But they admit they don\u2019t have figures for the year yet. Compare this to  what professionals are experiencing : \u201cBut psychologist Lynn Beresford said she had seen a big blowout in the number of children being denied learning \u201caccommodations\u201d by NZQA. \u201cI have been doing this for a long time, probably as long as anyone in New Zealand . . . [and] I have been in overload for almost two months because of the declines in accommodations. I have only had about three or four [pupils denied exam assistance] in 15 years. And this year [there have been] over 50 \u2013 and I\u2019ve not done anything differently. It\u2019s totally unfair, and for the students the level of anxiety has been enormous.\u201d Cleary, something is going wrong, and students academic and career futures are going to be seriously impacted by all this. Waiting for end-of-year figures, isn\u2019t going to address the very real and growing concerns right now, and the impact (including costs, stress and time needed for the appeals) is being felt right now too. This issue has been simmering for a while, and has now being getting wider media attention. What does it take for an organisation to recognise and respond to a problem, to at least review its processes and make sure someone along the bureaucratic line isn\u2019t screwing over the future of a bunch of children? There are already numerous prejudices against those with invisible disabilities, in everyday society and within the education sector. Our children get denied access to schools, based on the ignorance of other children\u2019s parents and unfounded fears. Our kids get excluded, the parents get judged, nothing we do is right: We\u2019re evil for sending our children to special schools because it\u2019s segregating them, or we\u2019re cruel and delusional for sending our kids to mainstream schools because their needs are too high and they\u2019re a drain on the school. Obviously, as this latest issue shows, even once you\u2019re in the school door, you have to keep proving the existence and relevance of the disability. At the beginning of the post I asked you to imagine sitting a test, blind. Well imagine sitting a test where the letters keep jumbling together, or you can\u2019t coordinate your fingers to move a pen across the page, or the sensory inputs around you that barely register for the other students is setting off an anxiety response so extreme that the student starts harming themselves in the test room. These children might as well be sitting an exam in the dark too, for all the meaning the final result will carry about their ability to understand the subject material. For exams to be meaningful, exam conditions need to be equal \u2013 to be fair. Perhaps those refusing these children, need to be examined on the meaning of equality. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/zeligdoc/4536877667/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/7710081/Dyslexics-denied-exam-aid", "http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minedu.govt.nz%2F&ei=F7dbUPXgOK6viQeblYC4Cw&usg=AFQjCNFkIqBUa-hsphnvVIHMXuuMr2SkBA", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/7710081/Dyslexics-denied-exam-aid"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/sitting-exams-in-the-dark-the-growing-problem-with-special-assessment-conditions/", "title": "Sitting Exams in the Dark: The Growing Problem with Special Assessment\u00a0Conditions"},
{"date": "September 28, 2012", "body": "As my long-term readers will be well aware,  I have no issue with the word \u201cnormal.\u201d  Some people abuse and misuse the word, but some people abuse and misuse pretty much every concept ever conceived of, so I\u2019m not holding the word \u201cnormal\u201d responsible for that. Why am I bringing this up again then? Because something wonderful got figured out about my younger (non-autistic) son\u2019s behaviour, and about my parenting: We are normal.  My youngest son has a speech delay (he\u2019s not normal in that regard, by definition), and as part of working on the speech delay we got referred to an Early Intervention Teacher, then an Educational Psychologist: Under the theory that certain unhelpful behaviours he has were possibly getting in the way of his speech development. Long story short, the Educational Psychologist ran me through a lengthy questionnaire about my son\u2019s behaviours and my own parenting, in order to identify areas that might need work or intervention. Turns out, we\u2019re normal. Not even borderline normal, but snuggly within the normal range. My son\u2019s behaviours had been improving over the past few weeks anyway, as I suspected they might as he matured and gained more skills and understanding. Still, it is nice to know he\u2019s so very normal, and I\u2019ll tell you why: Not because this makes him better than those who are abnormal, but because this means any behavioural issues he\u2019s facing can be worked on by the usual methods. I don\u2019t have to drug him and balance side effects against non-drugged outcomes, I don\u2019t have to learn all about ADHD or ODD, I don\u2019t have to go through endless sessions of being watched and assessed, filling out forms, and educating everyone who works with him about his unique and challenging challenges. This  is why normal is awesome. And why the word is meaningful and important: It tells you to keep calm and carry on, which is quite simply something you\u2019d be ill-advised to do if your child has a disability (which requires you to turn your world upside down). For me, going through those questions and getting those results was immensely reassuring; it was reassurance I desperately needed after everything I\u2019ve been through with my first-born. Does the fact that my youngest is comparatively normal mean I love him more than my first-born? Of course not, that\u2019s absurd. But it does mean his life, and my life raising him, is that much easier. \u201cEasier\u201d also doesn\u2019t simply mean better, it means exactly what it says: Easier. Walking is easier than driving, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth driving, or that walking doesn\u2019t come with its own challenges. All of this should be obvious, yet parents who declare that their disabled child is harder to look after and is abnormal in a variety of ways, are all too often attacked for stating those simple truths. If those words offend you \u2013 if my joy at the fact that my youngest son is \u201cmore normal\u201d than his older brother, makes you angry at me \u2013 then I suggest you examine what you have personally built into that word, beyond its functional meaning. And don\u2019t extend the prejudices of yourself or those around you, onto someone who intends no moral judgment by its use. Recognising how much harder it is to raise a child who sits outside the normal range of behaviours \u2013 due to conditions like autism, ADHD, anxiety disorders, ODD, etc \u2013 is a good thing that we should always be honest about. The public needs to know how much more support and extra resources we need to do these children justice. If we try to cover over that reality, we just do our children and other families an injustice. People also need to understand that normalcy is not equated with \u201cbeing a better person\u201d or similar ideas; telling people to simply not use the word normal, doesn\u2019t confront those misunderstandings and judgments \u2013 people will just find a new word to capture their disdain (consider the abuse of the word \u201cspecial\u201d after that became widely used to denote these extra needs). I\u2019m sure there are other ways my youngest son will sit outside the normal range of things, as he already does in his speech. If that turns out to be the case, I\u2019ll adjust; it\u2019s what parents do. I\u2019ll learn, and I\u2019ll teach and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to help him through this world. But right now, for today, I am going to take this joy at his behavioural normalcy. Even when he thinks every toy in the world is his, simply waiting for him to assert \u201cmine\u201d loudly in its direction as toddlers do so well, I\u2019m going to take comfort in the fact that simple good parenting practices \u2013 and time itself \u2013 will get us to the other side of each challenge. And when my older son \u2013 my autistic son \u2013 gets home from his Special School within the next 15 minutes, arriving in his Special Taxi \u2013 I\u2019m going to hug him and love him just the same as I do every other day. These are my children, for all their normalities and abnormalities, and nothing could make me love them less. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/croma/557971148/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/certifiably-normal-keep-calm-and-carry-on/", "title": "Certifiably Normal; Keep Calm and Carry\u00a0On."},
{"date": "September 25, 2012", "body": "Autism does not affect each autistic individual to the same extent. For some it is extraordinarily debilitating on a daily basis, and even life-threatening at times (due to factors like self-injurious behaviours, and certain interests and inabilities meaning a  much higher likelihood of drownings  and wandering). For others, autism does create extra challenges and obstacles, but they can care for and communicate for themselves; they are not wholly dependent on others, and are even capable of having jobs and forming their own families. In an effort to recognise and respond to these diverse realities, people have been using \u201cunofficial\u201d severity scales. Some use the language of high and low functioning. Some use terms like severe, moderate, or mild, to describe the impact of autism on the individual. To a large extent, people have considered reference to different types of autism as  itself  a type of severity scale: Considering Aspergers and PDD-NOS as less severe versions of autism, for instance. The problems with these unofficial severity scales, are numerous, but there are two main concerns that come up in conversations on this topic: (1) References to severity scales in autism, over-simplify the diverse abilities and challenges each individual carries. For example, someone who communicates extremely well, both verbally and in the written word, but struggles daily with high anxiety, multiple sensory issues, and social interactions. Whereby in some ways autism is not impacting severely on their functioning, but in other ways it is, so that any single overarching reference to their severity level would be distorting and inaccurate. (2) References to severity (high, low, severe, mild, etc) are used inconsistently, since there is no official reference point that everyone is using. So when one person talks about their child being high-functioning, they might not consider someone else\u2019s child to be high-functioning even though the other parent also uses that term. There are a variety of tools one might use to rate the severity of autism \u2013  such as by using ATEC  \u2013 but these are not universally used and can also overly simplify the diverse strengths and weaknesses in each autistic individual. However, for all the problems that occur in references to severity, there still needs to be some way to identify and refer to the spectrum of needs. The fact is the differences are there, and often times the differences can be so profound that for some autism is clearly an extreme disability and for others it is viewed as a clear and desirable advantage. Trying to get appropriate and adequate supports to those who need it, cannot be achieved simply by the lable \u201cautism;\u201d professionals, governments, insurers, and newly diagnosed families, need some way to figure out how to respond appropriately to the diagnosis of autism. Even for those who believe there is never an appropriate reason to refer to the severity of autism, there must surely be recognition that if people insist on making such references, it should be against some sort of consistent scale, so that people are to some extent at least referring to the same  phenomenon  (however imprecise it may be). The DSM-5 \u2013 the updated diagnostic manual which is due to come into effect next year \u2013 introduces an official  severity scale for autism . The scale is split into two sections: \u201csocial communication,\u201d and \u201crestricted interests and repetitive behaviours.\u201d This reflects the  new criteria for a diagnosis of autism , which is also split into these two areas of challenges. There are three severity levels for each of those two sections: Level 3, requiring very substantial support, Level 2, requiring substantial support, and Level 1, requiring support. Under each section and level, are provided explanations and examples, to assist the application and provide some consistency. My son, for example would be between Levels 1 and 2 under both sections. He was once very clearly in Level 3. No one would have struggled to place him under Level 3 in both areas at the time of diagnosis, and for a good year afterwards: The most severe cases are typically the easiest to identify and to apply a severity scale to. As the severity of my son\u2019s autism has lessened, he has slipped down the severity scale, which makes it harder to place him exactly in one category or the other, but either way it is clear he is no longer at Level 3, and that is a meaningful observation. How the scale will precisely be applied, is something that will take time and experience to figure out, and is likely to differ somewhat between various professionals. It is however something which can be studied to identify if it has been applied consistently, and something which can be perfected over time with more guidelines and examples to aid professionals. Either way, it provides a more consistent and meaningful reference point than the current very wide-spread use of unofficial severity scales. It is also important to consider the impact that the removal of Aspergers and PDD-NOS (and other categories), will have on the category of \u201cautism.\u201d The introduction of an official severity scale allows recognition of the differences once recognised by those different groupings, as many of those individuals will now fold into the new single category of \u201cautism.\u201d (For those who are concerned more generally about the removal of reference to these other conditions, I have links to my other posts on these and related topics around the DSM-5, at the bottom of this post). I understand the concerns many have about the use of any severity scale for autism. But in light of the very clear fact that people are already using unofficial scales, and that multiple professional bodies require some sort of scale in order to get services to those who need them most, I am not opposed to the effort to introduce a severity scale into the DSM-5 section on autism. I think it is a reasonable response to the removal of other conditions from the spectrum, and an improvement on the status quo. I think it fixes many of the problems people have with an autism severity scale at all, by being split into two sections and by having examples and explanations built-in. I also know I am in the minority in these views, since I\u2019m yet to come across others praising the introduction of the severity scale, but I hope some who read my post will perhaps think twice about whether it really is a horrible idea, or whether the introduction of an official severity scale is perhaps a step in the right direction. \n**** My previous posts on the DSM-5: \n Autism in the ICD-10/ ICD-11 vs the DSM-IV/ DSM-5. \n Allen Frances on the Problems with the Primacy of Diagnosis, and the DSM-5 . \n Scientists or Service Providers; Critiquing the Choice of Targets in the Attacks on the DSM-5 Autism Changes . \n A Few Good Reasons to like the DSM-5 Autism Changes . \n Intent vs Effect re the Exclusion of General Developmental Delay under Autism in the DSM-5 . \n Drastic Drop in ASD diagnosis variations from DSM-IV to the proposed DSM-5 . \n Distinguishing Giftedness from Aspergers; will the DSM-5 help? \n The 4 Main DSM-5 Autism Controversies . \n Genetic Origins of Autism; when is autism not autism?

{"date": "July 3, 2011", "body": "\n Image by sergis blog via Flickr \n The virtual ink was barely dry on my previous post about law and autism, when my Twitter feed  threw this story  my way. A mother was jailed after her nine year-old autistic son missed too much school. She keeps him at home when his behaviour is too challenging for the school to handle. Though she considers the behaviour too challenging at those times, it is less clear that the school at issue shares her views; the report gives the clear impression that the school can and is willing to handle her child \u2013 even has teachers specifically trained for dealing with autistic children. Indeed, it would not have made sense for her to be arrested for keeping her son out of school, if the school had been unable or unwilling to have him attend class. She had a doctor\u2019s opinion outlining that there are times when her son is best left in her care rather than at school. She was told that she should have made that opinion known to the relevant judge in order to avoid having been arrested in the first place. Which is to say, it appears that the whole situation could have been avoided with better communication between the mother and the judicial system; as to whether that lack of communication is the mother\u2019s or the judicial system\u2019s fault, I\u2019m not sure. Chances are it was a mix, as these things often are; such as she didn\u2019t share the information but she didn\u2019t know whether or how she was meant to share it. It appears that she should have directly informed the school district of the doctor\u2019s opinion in advance too (if she hadn\u2019t already done so, I\u2019m assuming from the story\u2019s details that she had not done so). There is an apparent dissonance between the views of the mother and doctor on the one hand, and the school itself and the school district on the other, as to whether the school is the best place for the child at those challenging times. The judicial system appears to give particular weight to the doctor\u2019s opinion (which is in line with what I have thus far read about Florida\u2019s school attendance requirements. If someone reading this is more familiar with the rules and how they are put into practice, I would be happy to hear further detail.) The story highlights a range of common issues for parents raising autistic children, particularly lack of sufficient support at school to allow the parent to not have to be \u201con-call\u201d, and how this affects the life of both the parent and child. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s largely a non-story on the legal front.  The law surrounding regular attendance in Florida appears quite flexible and responsive to different circumstances , and is presumably set up with the aim of protecting the child\u2019s best interests. A doctor\u2019s note explaining absence is clearly an accepted grounds for lower attendance than is otherwise expected. The mother appears to have become quite accustomed to keeping her child away from school in the past, and was ultimately brought to task for it. Once the situation was further explained, the judicial system responded as it should. It\u2019s all quite frightening and close to home for some of us, that\u2019s undoubtedly so, but it does appear to have been an avoidable upset. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/91485322@N00/5885470924", "http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/199590/250/Mom-of-autistic-son-jailed-after-he-misses-school", "http://www.fldoe.org/faq/default.asp?Dept=107"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/mother-jailed-for-letting-autistic-son-miss-school/", "title": "Mother jailed for letting autistic son miss\u00a0school"},
{"date": "July 4, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My son is a big fan of the movie \u201cCars\u201d, so we know he\u2019ll be a big fan of \u201cCars 2\u201d as well, but he\u2019ll have to wait for the DVD. My husband was very keen to take him along to see it at the movies, but I sadly had to remind him of why it simply isn\u2019t an option: Our son stims up a noisy storm when he\u2019s very happy; flapping his arms and hands and stamping his feet and humming while his head waves from side to side. Occasionally peeking out to yet again view the item of enjoyment before returning to his stimming. This is particularly true of the first time he encounters something he really likes; if he was re-watching a DVD (for example) of a favourite movie or show, the stimming is less frequent. We can calm his stimming to a certain extent, though doing so does lessen his enjoyment because he has to then focus on the change in behaviour requested of him. I can handle that, he can handle that. But we can not completely remove the stimming, so it would remain an issue for other movie-goers. Other than the stimming, there is also the chatter-box factor. If he gets chatty during a film, telling him to be quiet almost always leads to a loud crying session. It\u2019s like he has a compulsion to talk and asking him to curve that compulsion is extremely upsetting for him. Even when he clearly wants to comply, he ends up in tears. It used to be that my primary concern with attending the movies with him was the knowledge that we\u2019d be lucky to even get him out of the car, let alone into a movie theatre and to sit and stay in a seat. But he can now handle those sorts of tasks; the school he attends has particularly made in-roads with these issues since they go on a fair few outings during the semester, they know how hard and important that set of skills are for autistic children so they actively teach them as part of the curriculum. It did cross my mind to try to take him to the movies and just having to leave when he inevitably stims or cries too loud and too long. But that seems extraordinarily cruel; taking him away from something he is enjoying because of behaviours he cannot control. It would also make for a very negative first movie experience; it\u2019s very important to make the first experience of something as positive as possible so it can be repeated, and so that new anxieties do not arise from the original bad experience. With all these issues and upsets in mind, I was so happy to see  this story  about theatres overseas specifically providing for the autism community to go to the movies (in this case \u201cCars 2\u201d, but it\u2019s  an ongoing service  too). I\u2019m not aware of something similar being done locally, but I have decided to make enquiries of the main local Autism charity, and see what I can do to perhaps encourage such a thing to be set up. I will let you know how those enquiries and efforts go. It does look like a wonderful event, and something to bring together autism families \u2013 who are otherwise usually so isolated \u2013 out into the open for a shared and joyful couple of hours. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LightningMcQueen.jpg", "http://www.dailypress.com/health/dp-nws-cars2-autism-20110703,0,4286163.story", "http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1977230,00.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/not-off-to-the-movies-yet/", "title": "Not off to the movies,\u00a0yet..?"},
{"date": "September 30, 2012", "body": "My son\u2019s school takes part in a gala each year to raise funds. The gala itself is not run by his school, or located at his school; it\u2019s part of a different (and extraordinarily popular) school fair. I hadn\u2019t been to it before, but I thought this year I\u2019d make the effort, in order to show my support for the fundraising effort. My autistic son and I headed off across the city to find the school and the gala. Everything was worse than I expected, and went better than I\u2019d ever thought possible. Best case scenario would have been close parking, no queues, easy to find the fundraising stall for my son\u2019s school, in and out in time to get my son to his afternoon soccer club. What actually happened: The parking situation was the sort of insanity that made me want to turn the car around and drive the 20 minutes back home. I eventually found a park three streets away from the gala, and asked my son a few times whether he was absolutely sure he wanted to walk the distance to the gala, otherwise we could just go back home then and there. He was sure, so we did the (thankfully only) ten minute walk to the school gates, and stepped into a noisy world of crowds and queues that made my own anxiety levels rise to distinctly uncomfortable levels. We weaved our way around the place, hand-in-hand so I wouldn\u2019t lose him within the shuffling masses. Despite doing a circuit of the school twice, we never located his school\u2019s fundraising stall. Lines to even get food and drink were too long for my taste, and it looked like the entire outing was going to end up being pointless. Except my son wasn\u2019t going to let it go down that way. He wanted very much to ride the small cars, set up within a large rink, $6 a ride. The line was long, so I\u2019d said no earlier when he\u2019d first spotted it. But he\u2019d asked again so nicely, and he assured me he could handle waiting in line, so I wanted to award his patience and politeness by giving it a go. He was happy the whole time we stood in that line, stimming his happy dance off to the side in an endless expression of his anticipation. When it was finally our turn, he didn\u2019t argue about the fact I had to be in control of the wheel and accelerator, despite how very much he wanted to do it himself (it was just too hard for him unfortunately). As we did the circuits I took so much joy from his own joy, that my stress over not being able to find the school\u2019s stall and over having to wait in line for so long, melted away into laughter. Riding with him in that car, just going round and round with four other cars on the circuit, was something remarkably special. Even though he\u2019d told me earlier that he never wanted to get off, he didn\u2019t make a fuss when the time was up. We left that rink tantrum-free, both of us still smiling. I was so impressed with his waiting ability that I decided to risk waiting in yet another line in order to get ice-creams for us to eat on the way back to the car. Again, he impressed me with his calm patience and lovely manners. Two (ridiculously expensive) sherbet covered ice-creams later, we were leaving the gala. Just to put a cheery on top of the experience, he managed to eat not just the ice-cream but the entire cone too; in the past he\u2019s refused to eat the cone. He was proud of his little achievement and it felt good to see him taking pride in extending his own experiences. Unfortunately by the time we\u2019d made it to the car, we were well behind my schedule for the time needed to get home for his soccer club. Throw in a few traffic jams and road works, and near-misses, and I was counting the seconds by the time I got him in the door and into his soccer uniform. Straight back out the door with his dad, and I got my breather. To truly understand the magnitude of this experience, you need to know that we hadn\u2019t planned to go to the gala that morning, my son had just mentioned it in passing, and expressed a desire to go along. There was no extended pre-discussion, no social story or visuals to prepare him, he made a spontaneous decision and when the plans kept going wrong (parking, can\u2019t find the stall, queues), he took each in its stride. The next morning I happened upon the fact that the local SPCA was having a fundraising event that involved hot-rods. On a whim, he decided to attend that too, and had a great time there with his dad. My son has changed so much in what he can handle and how well he can handle it, it\u2019s like having a different child. He\u2019s gone from being violent, mostly non-verbal, withdrawn, hyper-anxious and obsessive about strict predictability, to a gentle, non-stop-chattering, social child who enjoys unannounced outings, all in the space of about two and a half years. I set out to survive a gala, and ended up enjoying it with my son instead. A photo I took of the crowds at the gala (my son and I are not in the photo though, for those wondering). \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/p10904411.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/more-than-surviving-a-gala/", "title": "More Than Surviving A\u00a0Gala"},
{"date": "September 29, 2012", "body": "My son attends a special school, in both senses of the word: It is for special needs students, and it is an amazing school in its own right, staffed by caring, dedicated, highly trained teachers and therapists. I love his school, and so does the Education Review Office (ERO). The ERO\u2019s report on my son\u2019s school is glowing, and uplifting and very encouraging, which is not something I\u2019ve regularly come across in ERO reports of the many other schools I\u2019ve researched. However, according to recently released data, 100% of the students at this amazing school, are failing National Standards for reading, writing and maths. Reading that set of data, was like a slap in the face, for a whole host of reasons. It was the first I\u2019d heard that my son \u2013 as necessarily part of the 100% \u2013 is well below meeting any of the standards. I was quite upset that the school hadn\u2019t told me directly, at some point in time, that he was so below the standards. I meet with the teacher twice a year, and write to her and hear back from her via a notebook pretty much everyday of the school year. How does it not come up, why not even a \u201cby the way, the data is about to be released, and we thought we should warn you about what it will say\u2026\u201d Add to this the sense that my son\u2019s \u2013 and every child in that school\u2019s \u2013 privacy has just been breached big time. This is because there is no variation in the results; everyone knows that every single child in that school falls in that failing 100%. Not one single child sits outside of the grouping, so no one could think \u201cmaybe her child is that single out-lying child who\u2019s doing well in reading\u201d or whatever it might be. It\u2019s like having some part of my son\u2019s personal school report being splashed all over the internet for everyone to judge. It was a shock: Everyone in the school is not even \u201cbelow\u201d but \u201cwell below\u201d the standards. I honestly thought my son was doing well in some areas, that he might even be meeting some standards for his age. I had (what are apparently) delusions that he might one day do well enough to be able to attend a mainstream class. It\u2019s like someone took my hopes and threw a bucket of cold water on them. His is not the only special school with these results.  Another special school went very public recently  with it\u2019s 100% outcome, and why it doesn\u2019t reflect the school or the children\u2019s improvements and abilities. That makes me feel a little more settled, but it leads to the obvious question: Why are these schools being expected to match their students against standards that apparently it could be predicted no student would meet? Or if they must be tested against these evidently irrelevant standard (irrelevant in terms of what the students could and should be achieving in any meaningful sense), then why is the data presented alongside the outcomes of every other school; is this not a foreseeable broad breach of privacy, and does it not make a farce of the data in total? Back in August 2011, when  I wrote about National standards and special needs students , the government had decided it was going to provide data for special needs students separately. For some reason, in late 2011, it  decided to go back on this arrangement : \u201c As the Herald on Sunday has put it, \u2018despite being told they would be exempt from national standards\u2026many show a line of noughts for the numbers of pupils achieving at or above standards\u2019. This is referring to a change of Ministry of Education policy in late 2011 that saw all students, regardless of background characteristics, having to be entered for the National Standards. .\u201d Not only does this reversal in policy mean our schools are placed alongside other schools which are set up for entirely different types of students, it also means special needs students within mainstream schools will count poorly against the schools overall data, thereby also making special needs students \u201cundesirable.\u201d Which is to say, one of the key protective mechanisms that I thought would save students like my son from being unwanted and rejected from mainstream schools on the grounds of impact on National Standards, has been done away with. This feels like a threat against our children; they\u2019re already unjustifiably, and in some cases, illegally, excluded from entry to mainstream schools on the basis of prejudices and ignorance, and now there\u2019s one more reason to make the schools and other parents say \u201cno.\u201d National Standards in context, made sense to me; putting it in place alongside a student\u2019s IEP and overall progress, even if they didn\u2019t meet the actual standard. But it feels like that context has gone now, and in its place is a new excuse to exclude and attack our children. Yes I wish my son\u2019s school and teacher had told me about him failing to meet any standards. I would have liked to know so I had a more realistic over-view of his abilities. I know he\u2019s progressing well, and I am so proud of his progress and so happy with what his teachers have achieved with him. But I would have liked to have a broader context for those achievements too. It\u2019s not the sort of thing I want a twice or thrice yearly reminder of (\u201chey your son\u2019s doing great, but he\u2019s failing compared to normal kiddies\u201d), but maybe once a year just to be told whether he is advancing towards those standards. If he was never ever going to reach any of the standards by their assessment, then I would have wanted to hear them say that once, and never hear of it again; at that point the information will never change, so why constantly remind a parent of something they already know, and that will be painful for some. At first when I saw my son\u2019s school\u2019s 100% \u201cwell below\u201d rate (or \u201cfailure\u201d rate to use a harsher word), I went into a bit of denial; surely the school is just saying it\u2019s 100% as a form of protest? But no, this is just reality, as harsh as it is. And having to face that reality being read off a public website, available to everyone else in New Zealand too at the same time, hurt me. It made me cry. Even writing this I literally have tears in my eyes because this is hard. It\u2019s unfair. It even borders on cruel. I know my son has an intellectual disability, I get it, though I didn\u2019t realise how bad it was. But does everyone else in the country have to know how bad it is too? I\u2019m upset at the system, at the school, at the teachers, at the media. I need time to get my head around all this and whether it\u2019s worth my tears. My husband is calmer than I am about this, and he reminds me that our son has vastly improved since the data was last collected (last year). But are we both still just grasping on to the hope that our son will be the one person in the entire school to break out of that 100% failure rate? Isn\u2019t that hope itself poorly placed considering every other student hasn\u2019t reached that point either? Is the fact that we even carry this hope and expectation mean we should think differently about a school that hasn\u2019t produced that result for any of their kids? But even thinking that way means I\u2019ve fallen into the trap of forgetting what this school is all about, and their amazing and meaningful and contextual achievements with all their students. Like I said, this is confusing for me. And if it\u2019s confusing for me, imagine what it says to all vast majority of the population out there who have absolutely no appreciation of what schools like my son\u2019s do everyday, and about what our children are capable of in everyday life. Do results like these make them think even less of schools and people that they already didn\u2019t understand or appreciate? That\u2019s a definite possibility, and that scares me too; things are hard enough in this world for my son already, without people prejudging his deeper intellect and capacities based on the fact that he attends a special needs school. He is so much more than a number, or a failure rate. So how do I feel now about National Standards, having seen how distorting and irrelevant it actually is for children like my son, and schools like these? I\u2019ll let you know once I\u2019ve recovered from the slap, for now I\u2019m too emotional to be as objective as I\u2019d like to be. But I\u2019m interested in hearing your own thoughts and reactions, and whether now seeing the data has changed your previous opinions about the merits, and demerits, of National Standards. *** I\u2019d like to know how others feel about the application of National Standards to special needs children; I know not everyone feels comfortable commenting, so here\u2019s a poll for those who prefer that method: Take Our Poll \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/inspirekelly/5761025903/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/7723603/Special-school-is-failure-under-national-standards", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1209/S00134/national-standards-which-children-and-schools-will-be-hurt.htm", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/6569027"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/the-slap-of-national-standards-how-national-standards-made-me-cry/", "title": "The Slap of National Standards; How National Standards Made Me\u00a0Cry."},
{"date": "July 5, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Imagine a hyperactive child, whose behaviour is negatively affecting their learning and home life. Do they need a diet change, medication, and better discipline, or do they need a different learning environment and more accepting parents and teachers who embrace the child as is? Is the difference between those approaches merely differences in attitudes,\u00a0 or are one of those options perhaps distorting the reality to the detriment of the child? These issues apply to ADHD, ODD, and a wide range of other increasingly popular acronyms. Including ASD. The observation of behaviours is a potentially neutral initial step when faced with a challenged child, though even observations are coloured by what we think is noteworthy difference and pathological versus expected (take for example meeting eyes in a culture that considers it rude to do so, versus one that considers it rude not to do so). After the observation, some sort of value must be applied to what has been observed: Is it a good thing or bad thing? Then the professionals and family have to figure out what \u2013 if anything \u2013 to do about the behaviours. Even if the challenges the child faces are considered a good thing in someway, there are going to be a range of options available, such as whether to interfere to help grow and encourage the differences they possess. These different approaches are debated the most with borderline instances. If a child can\u2019t walk because of an obvious physical deformity, you\u2019re not going to have the same debates that you might about whether to interfere with a child whose feet or knees have an angle or weakness that noticeably affects their gait and sporting skills. Same too of the autism spectrum to a large extent, since it differs so much from one end to the other. However, there are those who think disability is only ever difference that has been pathologized by a particular society \u2013 whether that disability is physical, mental, or both. That opinion is also present within the ASD community. Putting a positive spin on disability so we learn to celebrate a child\u2019s strengths despite their weaknesses, and encourage acceptance and accommodation of the individual despite their differences, is embraced by most people. As you shift towards romanticism of the disability though \u2013 painting certain aspects of it as beautiful or admirable when they are actually connected with suffering and even pain \u2013 crosses the line for a lot of people. When you push that even further, towards actual distortion of the disability so that objective challenges that hold someone back from freedom and independence are either ignored or denied, and scientific findings are misused and abused to the detriment of the neediest people in the given population, then many people get understandably mad. The same passion that makes those parents and professionals fighters for the future and best interests of the child, gets directed against those who would paint a pretty picture over the daily reality. When you\u2019re already feeling marginalised, forgotten, and misunderstood as a parent as a special needs child, and then find yourself having to actively undo the misrepresentations of others who are supposedly fighting for the same people you are, it is a maddening position to be put in. To make it worse, by speaking out in response about the true horrors involved with dealing with the worst affected individuals, you can end up being labeled as a negative person and parent, when really you\u2019ve been forced into that position by people who took the Pollyanna a tad too far. Consequences of an overly positive spin / romanticism to the point of distortion, are serious. Including the diversion of much-needed research funds to find solutions to ease suffering, and a perception that the support on offer (by the government for example) is neither needed or appreciated by the affected community. These are no small matters for people fighting tooth and nail to increase the existing research and supports. And so there is a predictable and consequential split in the autism community, as indeed there is in many special needs communities. But perhaps a more serious one in some regards, since autism is still so widely misunderstood and still poses far more questions than answers about its origins and treatments. I think (and I\u2019ve said this many times before) that one of the main causes of the problems is when people purport to speak for everyone across the spectrum: \u201cAutism is always horrendous and a serious disability\u201d, or \u201cautism is always only difference and only a problem because of how others treat autistics.\u201d The truth about autism surely lies somewhere between the two: Some aspects of autism are made worse by society\u2019s reactions and expectations. But at the core, autism poses very real and sometimes extremely serious objective challenges, across the entire spectrum. I have learnt that the challenges faced by people at the \u201chigh functioning\u201d end of autism can also be incredibly disabling and threaten the person\u2019s wellbeing and independence; it is not just those at the severe end of the spectrum who are done a disservice by over-romaticizing autism. I am of course aware that there is benefit of painting a kindly picture of autism, so it is not so scary and foreign to potential employers and friends, for example. But those goals should not be sought via the further marginalisation (and to some extent, denial) of other people on the spectrum. There are so many diverse autism voices clamouring to be heard, that the message can become confusing for the public, indeed too for the people within the autism community, as they find themselves being asked to \u201cchoose a side\u201d: Is autism beautiful, or is autism ugly? It seems to me that the point that autism is a spectrum and that its manifestation can be very individualised, has got to be one of the most important messages: Just because Joey has autism, doesn\u2019t mean he is a savant or a genius who will take his place on the world stage, nor does it mean he must be restrained to avoid the physical dangers he poses to himself, others, and property. Autism comes with the full array of humanity within its bounds: The highly intelligent and the not-so-intelligent, the beautiful and the not-so-beautiful, the kind and the cruel. Autism does not pre-determine your intelligence, your looks or your personality. I remain ever open-minded to the experiences and perspectives of people living with autism; whether in themselves or living with it in their family members. I see truths in a wide variety of them, even when they conflict, since personal lives and values and experiences also vary, so of course experiences of disability naturally vary too. But in the current climate of so much more research and support being needed for autistic people and their families, compared to what they currently receive, I think it\u2019s incredibly important to not actively under-sell the challenges and realities of autism by romanticizing it to the point of distortion. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autismawareness.png"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/positive-spin-romanticism-and-distortion-of-autism/", "title": "Positive spin, romanticism, and distortion, of\u00a0autism"},
{"date": "July 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image by geoftheref via Flickr \n You may remember  my post from March this year , about the man with Aspergers who was caught looting in Christchurch after the major earthquake. He was made the \u201cface of looting\u201d at the time. His name is Cornelius Arie Smith-Voorkamp, though he is also referred to in some reports as \u201cArie Smith\u201d. The police were taking a hard-line with all looters at the time; too hard perhaps considering it is alleged that the vigilante justice he received at the time of arrest was at the hands of the police: \u201c Lawyer Simon Buckingham earlier said on the night of his arrest, Smith-Voorkamp was beaten by two officers and taunted by New Zealand Army personnel. At his first appearance in court, Smith-Voorkamp had a black eye. \u201d ( Link to NZ Herald story ). The police  deny the claims , and point out that no official claim has been made about the assault. (Though probable reasons for that lack of official complaint, were already discussed  back in March .) There are also conflicting claims about whether the owners of the property that was burgled want to see the matter taken further. With the owner allegedly saying he doesn\u2019t want the case to go ahead, and the police saying the owners are happy with how the police have handled the case so far. Once it came to light that Smith-Voorkamp had Aspergers, and the direct impact this had on his crime (stealing light-fittings; he apparently has a compulsion to do so), the courts took a kindly approach towards him and recommended the police allow for diversion. The courts made this recommendation more than once, but the police have declined. The police state the following: \u201c We have reviewed our decision against the diversion policy and we are confident we have been entirely consistent with it. One of the fundamental requirements of the diversion process is that the offender needs to be able to make an informed admission of guilt. \u201d ( Link to 3 News story ) Smith-Voorkamp has entered pleas of not-guilty. The decision to make those pleas, are based on the report of a forensic psychiatrist (see the extended  discussion with the defence lawyer at Stuff.co.nz ). The police have decided instead to proceed with the case; taking a hard-line approach consistent with other looting cases from the same time period. Smith-Voorkamp has one of Christchurch\u2019s top lawyers defending him, and the charity Autism NZ is aware of and keeping an eye on the case, so he and his concerns are well represented. There are of course high financial and mental health costs involved with the case proceeding. I will keep an eye on the case as it develops.

{"date": "July 7, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Slightlynorth via Flickr \n In March 2011, there was  a supplementary paper released updating the guidelines in New Zealand, for three pharmacological interventions  for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Those three interventions are aripiprazole, citalopram, and melatonin. This updates the 2008 government publication \u201c New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline \u201d (NZ ASD guideline), which includes the section on pharmacological interventions at 4.4 in the book. The book also contains a list of drugs used for ASD in appendix 9. (Both 4.4 and appendix 9 are accessible via the link above.) The NZ ASD Guideline is a comprehensive book made for the reference of families, individuals, and professionals dealing with ASD. It is a particularly good resource that looks at the entire life of the autistic person. The New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG) is tasked with updating recommendations and information in that book. It has recently released three updates that have only just come to my attention: The one I will be discussing in this post about  pharmacological interventions (March 2011) ; one about  ABA (May 2010) ; and one about  diagnostic instruments (April 2011) . I intend to do summaries of the other two later, but because of particular personal interest, I\u2019m starting by looking at the pharmacological update. This post aims to summarise that paper. It is not a commentary. The paper begins by pointing out that the primary interventions for autism are educational and behavioural interventions, rather than pharmacological. The pharmacological interventions cannot cure autism, but they can help manage conditions associated with, or comorbid with, autism. It was considered that the recommendations about pharmacological interventions included in the 2008 NZ ASD Guideline, may have been affected by recently published evidence on three medications, so the paper reviews and updates those recommendations where required. The researchers involved with the paper looked at controlled studies and systematic reviews, and graded them on quality, quantity, consistency, applicability, and the clinical impact of the studies. (1) Atypical antipsychotic  aririprazole  (also known as \u201cAbilify\u201d and \u201cAbilify Discmelt\u201d). Antipsychotics target irritability, aggression, self-injurious behaviour and severe tantrums (details of those problems are expanded on at 2.1 in  the paper ). Side effects of atypical psychotics include: metabolic and endocrine adverse effects, particularly in children; significant weight gain; and sedation. The existing guideline included risperidone as effective for aggressive, irritable and self-injurious behaviour, and as potentially useful for addressing restricted interests and patterns of behaviour. Aripiprazole has potential for better side effects, for example it doesn\u2019t impact on cardiac function, and has less impact on metabolic parameters; less impact on weight and less significant changes in glucose, lipid metabolism and serum prolatin. The guideline group looked at eight studies (six systematic reviews and two randomized controlled trials (if you have a look at 2.2 and 2.3 in  the paper  you can read details of those studies and their respective strengths). The studies showed aripiprazole to be helpful in 6-17 year olds with ASD, for irritability, global improvements, and quality of life. It is a well tolerated mediation. Their summary is that aripiprazole might be a good option where risperidone has not been affective, or has had bad side effects. (2) A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  citalopram  (known as Celexa, Arrow Citalopram, Celapram, Citalopram Rex, and Cipramil). SSRIs can be used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Direct quote: \u201cRepetitive behaviour can be a disruptive and troubling feature of ASD, and may involve stereotypic movements, inflexible routines, repetitive play, and perseverative speech. Interrupting such routines can lead to anxiety, protest, aggression, and self-injury.\u201d The evidence considered was as follows (again, a direct quote): \u201cThe review update identified preliminary open-label trials of the use of citalopram, for people with ASD, two good quality systematic reviews, and a high quality multi-centre, triple blinded study of 149 children and adolescents, potentially the largest randomized medication trial ever conducted in children with ASD.\u201d The Guideline Group\u2019s summary is that the evidence suggests citalopram is not effective in treating children and young people with ASD, with moderate or greater repetitive behaviour, and is associated with a small increase in mild to moderately severe adverse events, including increased energy, impulsiveness, decreased concentration, hyperactivity, stereotypy, diarrhea, insomnia and dry skin. Their conclusion was to not currently recommend the use of citalopram when considering the benefits versus harm for children and young people with ASD. And to be careful using it for comorbid conditions (eg OCD and anxiety) due to adverse effects in this population. (3)   Melatonin   (a hormone) Up to 89% of children with ASD have sleep difficulties, particularly dyssomnias (difficulty falling asleep and frequent night-waking). The risk with sedatives is daytime sedation and sleep-related breathing problems, and behavioural problems. The Guideline Group looked at four systematic reviews and one cross-over trial. They found good and consistent evidence for use for ASD, especially where behavioral strategies were not working. Side effects were minor and infrequent. The Group decided to strengthen their previous recommendation for the use of melatonin. They noted that there is no consensus on dosage level, and urged caution with long-term use due to a lack of long-term investigations. Behavioural strategies around sleep (\u201csleep hygiene,\u201d including looking at day-time activities and environmental factors) should be used in tandem with melatonin. I want to finish this post by pointing out that I have absolutely no medical training. If you would like more information \u2013 about the report or the recommendations it contains \u2013 you must click-through on the links I have provided, and of course, if you are considering any of these treatments for yourself or your family, talk it through with your medical professional. The purpose of this post was just to help make the updated information accessible and available, particularly to New Zealanders who may not have otherwise known about these changes. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/98092274@N00/5386464526", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0012/LGG_supplementary_paper_on_3_pharmacotherapies_FINAL.pdf", "http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/pagesmh/7561/$File/asd-guideline-apr08.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0012/LGG_supplementary_paper_on_3_pharmacotherapies_FINAL.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0011/Supplementary_paper_to_NZ_ASD_Guideline_Applied_Behaviour_Analysis_FINAL.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0014/ASD_Instruments_Summary.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0012/LGG_supplementary_paper_on_3_pharmacotherapies_FINAL.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0012/LGG_supplementary_paper_on_3_pharmacotherapies_FINAL.pdf"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/update-to-guidelines-for-pharmacological-interventions-for-asd-in-nz/", "title": "Update to guidelines for pharmacological interventions for ASD, in\u00a0NZ"},
{"date": "July 12, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n This is the final of the three supplementary papers updating the NZ ASD Guideline, that I have read and summarised for my blog. Please refer back to  the first post  for more information on the NZ ASD Guideline itself (published in 2008), and for links to the other two papers. This third paper was published in April 2011. The New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG) reviewed instruments for the screening, diagnosis and assessment of autism and Aspergers disorder. They have released both the  7 page summary , and the  main 30 page report . The 7 page summary serves as just that \u2013 a summary \u2013 that raised a lot of questions for me; so I found it necessary to go back to the full report for the answers. In effect then, this post is my own summary of the main report. For the sake of briefness and ease of accessing the key information, I will variously refer to either report in this post as suits (with supporting links for clarity). The main report begins by pointing out that these instruments are an important  aid  to diagnosis;  not  a substitute for clinical expertise. The NZGG reviewed 8 instruments for the screening and diagnosis of autism. These 8 were selected according to particular criteria: That they are \u201clisted as appropriate in the New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline (Ministry of Health, 2008); and, \nlisted in the \u2018Practice parameters for the screening and diagnosis of autism\u2019 by the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society (Filipek et al, 2000), current as of July 2006 (National Guidelines Clearinghouse, nd).\u201d The 4 instruments they considered for Aspergers disorder, were selected on slightly different criteria: \u201clisted as appropriate in the New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline (Ministry of Health, 2008); and reviewed in the Mental Measurement Yearbook Tests Online, from the Buros Institute at the University of Nebraska; the Yearbook provides independent, expert testing and review of instruments.\u201d This total then of 12 instruments, was reviewed using the following considerations: Administrative issues; comparison sample (looking at their trialling and development on people with and without ASD); performance statistics, including sensitivity (detecting someone with ASD), specificity (excluding those without ASD), reliability (including inter-rater reliability (whether different assessors get consistent results), and temporal stability (consistency across time), and internal consistency (the consistency of different items within the test)), and instrument validity (including content validity as to how appropriately it measures ASD, and construct validity as to how it reflects theories of ASD, and discriminant validity, as to whether it can discriminate between 2 distinct phenomena); and licensing arrangements. (After many re-typings, I\u2019m just crossing my fingers that I got all the brackets and semi-colons in the right place, check out the top of page 4 of  the main report  if you want the slightly lengthier bullet-point approach.) The main report then proceeds to review all 12 instruments in detail. For ease of cross reference if you\u2019d like to  look them each up for yourself , I have included the original paragraph references in bold in the following list of the instruments. First, the 8 autism instruments:  2.1  ADI-R;  2.2  ADOS;  2.3  CARS,  2.4  GARS-2;  2.5  SCQ;  2.6  SRS;  2.7  3di;  2.8  DISCO. And the 4 Aspergers disorder instruments:  2.9  GADS;  2.10  ASDS;  2.11  KADI (which particularly distinguishes Aspergers from high functioning autism); and  2.12  ASSQ. The summary table of each consideration for each instrument (table 1), can be found on page 19 of  the main report , or page 3  of the summary . They then consider particular combinations of the instruments for clinical use, selected on the basis of strength of research, usefulness, suitability for a wide range of disciplines, and allowing for both interviews and observation based assessments. (For a more detailed explanation of their criteria, see page 20  of the main report .) For autism, CARS and SCQ were the preferred  screening  instruments: \u201cThey are both brief and easy to administer and the research into the reliability and validity is strong. Neither instrument requires training, and both instruments can be used by a wide range of health and educational professionals CARS claims validity for children as young as two years of age, and SCQ for children aged four years or more. The SCQ may be slightly preferable on the basis that it is a newer tool and reflects more recent DSM classifications.\u201d For autism diagnosis, ADI-R and 3di were the preferred  interview -based instruments: \u201cResearch indicates sound reliability and validity for both. The ADI-R may be slightly preferable because of its larger research base. Training is required for both instruments, but they can be used by a wide range of health and educational professionals. For both instruments, interviews are time-consuming for both assessor and family. However, the 3di can be abbreviated.\u201d ADOS is the preferred  observation -based instrument for autism diagnosis: \u201cOn the criterion that instrument-based assessment should include clinician observation data, the ADOS, as the only clinician observation-based instrument, is preferred (as long as used in combination with information from other sources \u2013 see section 2.2.1). Available research findings suggest that it has sound reliability and validity. However, the ADOS can be difficult to administer and training of users is required.\u201d They specifically note that there is a controversy about using CARS as an observational tool for diagnosis: Despite being recommended for such use by other groups, CARS was developed for  screening , and from outdated diagnostic criteria, and doesn\u2019t include some constructs considered important for diagnosis of autism. This needs to be kept in mind for their table of suggested combinations of instruments for the screening and diagnosis of autism. That table of combinations for autism, is listed as table  2  on page 22 of  the main report , and as table  3  on page 4  of the summary . The strongest preferences for combinations are at the top of the chart (the least preferred at the bottom). The combination of instruments for Aspergers disorder is non-existent essentially, since only KADI qualified as a screening instrument on their criteria, but none of the instruments qualified as diagnostic tools: \u201cThe KADI appears to warrant consideration as a preferred instrument for screening for Asperger\u2019s disorder, although initial data only is available. It is brief and relatively easy to administer, and its publishers do not specify requirements as regards user qualifications. In common with all reviewed measures for screening for Asperger\u2019s disorder, further research is warranted\u2026 No instruments in this review are validated for making a definitive diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s disorder (see section 2).\u201d This leads to a rather sparse table  2   in the summary , also known as table  3  in  the main report . The report concludes by saying that professional bodies that include members who screen for and diagnose autism and Aspergers disorder, should direct their membership towards the review. I am going to end with the important reminder that these instruments are tools to  aid  diagnosis; they are not a substitute for clinical expertise. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tick-green.png", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0014/ASD_Instruments_Summary.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0014/ASD_Instruments_Summary.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0014/ASD_Instruments_Summary.pdf", "http://www.asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0014/ASD_Instruments_Summary.pdf", "http://asdguideline.com/content/documents/0000/0013/ASD_Instruments_Report.pdf"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/review-of-diagnostic-instruments-for-asd-updating-the-nz-asd-guideline/", "title": "Review of diagnostic instruments for ASD; updating the NZ ASD\u00a0Guideline."},
{"date": "July 9, 2011", "body": "\n Image by J_O_I_D via Flickr \n This post summarises changes to the recommendations about ABA (applied behaviour analysis), for the NZ ASD Guideline book published by the New Zealand government. (To see an introduction to the book itself, please refer to my  previous post .) These recommendations appear in a  paper published in May 2010  (yes I\u2019m a bit late coming to it, but it was the first I\u2019d heard of the paper, so I thought it worth sharing in the likelihood other parents were unaware too.) They are updates to the existing recommendations in the book, which was published in 2008. The NZ ASD Guideline defines ABA in the following way: \u201cthe process of systematically applying interventions based on the principles of learning theory to improve socially significant behaviours to a meaningful degree and to demonstrate that the interventions employed are responsible for the improvement in behaviour\u201d. In practice, ABA \u201crefers to a collection of methods and techniques designed to increase positive behaviours and decrease negative ones.\u201d Examples of such methods and techniques include reinforcements, establishing stimulus control, and fading prompts. Decreasing negative behaviours requires consideration of the  function  of the behaviour at issue. Careful considerations are also required around increasing \u201cpositive\u201d behaviours, including \u201cthe social validity or importance for the individual\u2019s development, its acceptability to the individual and his or her social network (e.g., family, culture).\u201d Behaviour changes are ideally maintained and generalised beyond the training situation, and behaviour changes must be monitored. The paper then clarifies that \u201c[i]t has become quite common for highly structured, intensive early invention programmes to be called \u201cABA\u201d however this is not correct, since ABA refers to a wide variety of techniques and principles.\u201d Then goes on to define what is meant by \u201cearly intensive behavioural intervention\u201d (EIBI). EIBI is not simply the \u201cLovaas Method\u201d. It has a variety of features, which are listed on page 5 of the paper (it\u2019s a long and detailed list, do  click-through  if you\u2019d like all the details.) Those features include that the programme is intensive, year-round, and at least 20 hours a week, usually running for two or more years, and usually starting around the age of two or three years-old. The paper notes that if you do not see progress by the three month mark, then the system used should be modified. They also note that physically aversive procedures should  not  be used as part of the programme. One of the new recommendations made is: \u201cInterventions and strategies based on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) principles should be considered for all children with ASD.\u201d They point out that there is a lack of knowledge though about the suitability of ABA for those with Aspergers, and for people over the age of 15. There is also a new recommendation about EIBI: \u201cEarly intensive behavioural intervention (EIBI) should be considered as a treatment of value for young children with ASD to improve outcomes such as cognitive ability, language skills, and adaptive behaviour.\u201d They again though point out a lack of knowledge about its usefulness for Aspergers, and for diverse cultures. There is also uncertainty about the \u201coptimal intensity of hours\u201d and whom it benefits. The paper also introduces some new \u201cGood Practice Points\u201d: That cultural awareness is important when using ABA, and that ABA interventions  can  be used before a confirmed diagnosis; there is no reason to delay access to effective treatment: \u201cServices should not wait for the diagnostic process to be completed but should be available as soon as a significant developmental need is identified.\u201d That is simply my summary of what I take as the key important points from the paper. Again, I encourage you to click-through to  the paper itself  if you\u2019d like more detail.

{"date": "July 11, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I have a personal policy of not writing posts when I am feeling overly emotional, since emotions change and intensity at one point in time can look extreme an hour later. But screw it. I am so sick of the misinformation and ignorance surrounding the \u201cAutistic Christchurch Looter\u201d case, that I\u2019m breaking my policy guidelines. Let\u2019s start with a little 101: It is not true that \u201cevery criminal has a mental illness and therefore mental illness is not relevant to crime\u201d. I can\u2019t believe how often I\u2019ve had to battle this crap-filled statement over the past 24 hours. I get that some people have never heard the term \u201cmens rea\u201d, and wouldn\u2019t know a statute book if it hopped into their lap and turned to the relevant section, subsection, paragraph and roman numeral. I also get that many people (think they) have never encountered a criminal; all criminals must be those crazies who need help and to be put away for their own and everyone else\u2019s benefit. But come on, really, all criminals have mental illnesses? I just.. really? I\u2019ve also seen one person boldly state (and then get cries of approval) that these mentally disabled people want to be treated like the rest of us normal people (he said he\u2019d even seen TV ads telling him they were his equals by golly), but then don\u2019t want to be to treated equally in the courts. As if he was some wise man. As if his reasoning and understanding of how the legal system operates wasn\u2019t deeply flawed. As if wanting to be able to have a job and have friendships and be treated like a human being, is too much to ask for if you dare ever try to defend yourself in a court based on a particular mental state relevant to a particular crime committed at a particular time. By that reasoning, people with inherent mental illness have less rights in front of a court than other members in society who don\u2019t have a mental illness, since the former can\u2019t raise the same available defences. Brilliant. And a topic I\u2019m tempted to do an entire post on because of the utter dumbassness of it all. And all this confusion over diversion, with so many people stating the police had no option to offer it; that the police were bound by the law to force Arie to a full-on court-case. Does it have to be pointed out that the judges would not have even suggested diversion for Arie\u2019s actions unless it had been a legal option? Do people out there really think the courts don\u2019t know when diversion is a legal option, and when it isn\u2019t? They think judges just toss the words around because they were on letter D that morning on their word-a-day calendar? How about \u2013 just a suggestion \u2013 people  look up the policy about diversion  before they claim the police had no legal option, especially considering that the police themselves never said they didn\u2019t have a legal option, but that for policy reasons they chose not to offer it. (The same policy resource that spells out that a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d does not bar the option of diversion might I add, for those who keep saying the opposite.) And then you\u2019ve got to deal with those who claim that a plea of not guilty is the same as Arie refusing to take responsibility. Oh really? So personally visiting the owners (who weren\u2019t, might I add, told until two weeks ago that someone had attempted to steal two light-bulbs from their ruined building), and admitting face-to-face that he had done the act and was sorry, isn\u2019t called taking responsibility? Guilty in the eyes of the law is a legal question, separate from taking responsibility in the broader and moral sense. I\u2019m not saying out-right that the police didn\u2019t follow their own policy by the way \u2013 they had a hardline policy with the earthquake looters, and they have a preference to get a guilty plea before granting diversion \u2013 but their own official policy on diversion did leave the door open for Arie, and that\u2019s what the judges were appealing to when they suggested diversion more than once. The police  chose  not to grant it. As for the police and / or army beating Arie up, and taunting him at the time for his disability. Gosh, I don\u2019t know, I hope that\u2019s wrong. The friend\u2019s evidence sounds believable to me, considering the evident black eye and attitude towards any and all looters at the time. I\u2019m not anti cops. I do think the police will tend to be anti-autistic people (another recent example is  this wrongful conviction of an autistic man ) because they rub police instincts the wrong way (lack of eye contact, lack of communication, unusual anti-social behaviours, isolated individuals who act funny), but I don\u2019t think the police are out to get them. I just think they\u2019re taking their looter hardline approach too far, and refusing to back down when they have good reason to do so. I\u2019m running out of puff now, which I suppose is a good side of blogging, right? Let it all out, get it out there then walk away. The public\u2019s comments surrounding this case just make me so angry, and so sad, and I genuinely care what happens to this man. I was in heart-felt tears watching Arie speak to \u201c Sunday\u201d last night on TV . I want so much for his pain to stop, and to see him get on with his life. He has been punished already, by being in jail for 11 days after the arrest (during which he was on suicide watch), and by this permanent damage to his reputation (\u201cthe face of looting\u201d), all for actions that were in all likelihood beyond his meaningful control (according to a forensic psychiatrist, details on that precise argument are pending). All because of two light bulbs. Not the \u201cantique light fittings\u201d his attackers are trying to claim; old, worn-out, light bulbs. He went in to get a socket on the wall, but it was too new (he prefers older models), so changed his mind to getting two light-bulbs. Not to sell, but because he wanted them on display in his home because he likes electrical things. Has a compulsion towards them. (I\u2019ve even seen someone conflate together his electrician aspirations with the attempted theft by saying Arie intended to turn selling lightbulbs into a business. Beggers belief.) He didn\u2019t even get out of the damaged building with the light-bulbs either, he was caught in the building. A building so badly damaged that it posed a danger to him. A building so badly damaged that the owners say they don\u2019t care that he wanted the light fittings. I\u2019m not an apologist for crime, not with my background, I could never be that. But he\u2019s clearly accepted responsibility and wants to make amends. Also, for what it\u2019s worth, there\u2019s this little thing we have in New Zealand called \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d which seems to have been forgotten. And when the media tried to run the story to explain that he wasn\u2019t the looting monster he had been made out to be in the courts \u2013 the \u201cface of looting\u201d \u2013 the media is now under attack for prejudicing and discussing a case before the courts. (A case that should probably have never even made it that far.) So it\u2019s OK to actively set out to make the public loathe him, but not OK to try to address the errors of that loathing. Disgusting. You can\u2019t have it both ways, surely. Surely..? Radio personalities and bloggers and forums are allowed to openly attack him, but no one\u2019s allowed to defend him? Whether Arie is declared guilty or not, remains to be seen. But there are some things I am willing to say now. He has been treated in an extreme manner, that has not taken into account his serious and relevant mental challenges (which go beyond Aspergers according to his family \u2013 he has other mental disabilities too). He has suffered already, hugely out of proportion to his supposed crime. This first-time offender, who has accepted responsiblity and is willing to make amends, does not belong in jail for attempting the theft of two light-bulbs from an already destroyed building. That\u2019s where I stand on all this. I know many people don\u2019t agree with me, and that\u2019s fine, but most of the attacks I\u2019ve seen on him so far are chock-filled of mis-information and factual errors. (If you see any such errors in my own post, I openly and honestly invite you to point them out.) I wish I could protect him. The mother in me wants him to be safe and happy. I see pieces of my son in his words and actions and it hurts me to see people attacking him in these unfounded ways. I fight the little fights where I can \u2013 on forums, and on my blog \u2013 but his fight is destined for the court. It\u2019s in the hands of his lawyer, and the legal and medical experts now. I just hope justice is swift, and he can get back to his life as soon as possible. *Rant finished* *** Previous posts on this topic:  My original post , and  the recent update . \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Light_Bulb.jpg", "http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/diversion_policy_2011.pdf", "http://www.3news.co.nz/Man-wrongly-imprisoned-for-rape-compensated-350000/tabid/1384/articleID/206941/Default.aspx", "http://tvnz.co.nz/sunday/s2011-e19-video-4292608"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/11/protecting-arie/", "title": "Protecting Arie"},
{"date": "July 13, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Autistic people in general, do crave and follow rules. Rules provide a certainty of action and consequence, to someone who finds the world and its social conventions, confusing unpredictable and upsetting. This attraction to rules is seen in the hyper-morality of many autistic people; the intense and unwavering dedication to \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d, to such a degree that often marks them out for bullying in the school environment, from peers who are far more ready and willing to bend the rules as suits. But autistic people are not automatons, blindly following rules without will-power or conscience. And neither are they incapable of breaking rules; or more specifically to the purpose of this post, the law: Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean an impossibility of criminal intent, and is not protection from legitimate criminal prosecution (though for particular criminal acts it may be a relevant consideration to both the guilt and the punishment). So, inevitably, there are some autistic people who end up in prisons. Indeed, they may be proportionally  over-represented in the criminal justice system , and / or  under-diagnosed within the prison population . What that means though can vary wildly; perhaps the numbers are higher because of inadequate understanding by judges and lawyers dealing with their cases, so that those who should get access to certain relevant defences, are unintentionally denied them. Perhaps they are victims of negative police attitudes towards autistic people (such as in the two cases I refer to later in this post, and discussed in a  previous post ). Perhaps their behaviours are more often dangerous to others, themselves and property (sometimes ending in  horrific outcomes  at the hands of the justice system). Or maybe autistic people are simply like anyone else; making bad decisions sometimes, and paying the price, and the higher numbers of them going through the criminal justice system are not strongly substantiated or not significantly higher. I came across a very interesting  Radio NZ podcast  today, which has one of the lawyers for Arie Smith-Voorkamp talking about the relationship between autism and the law. The lawyer speaks in part from personal experience, since he is on the spectrum too. There are a lot of very interesting points made in the podcast. One of those was that prison can actually provide the routine and predictability that autistic people need so much, in a way that the non-prison life has not. No one thinks this is a good thing in the broader context of a good life; prison is not a desirable location, and the fact that it may be viewed as desirable in some ways for some people, speaks about a failure within society at a number of levels. Of course, once within the prison system, autistic people need supports that other inmates may not. Not just to avoid undue and excessive cruelty, but  also for the purposes of effective rehabilitation . Prior to hearing the podcast, I had only heard particularly upsetting things about the experiences of autistic people within prison (though I have found other sources after that which refer to this aspect of routine as a positive one, including consideration of getting all of one\u2019s needs (food, shelter etc) met). Two prime examples of the particularly negative experiences, are recent New Zealand cases. The first is the autistic man who was wrongly convicted of rape, and spent his  two years in prison deeply withdrawn and literally living in silence . The other more recent example is of Arie who  was on suicide watch during his time  in prison, and is very afraid of going back inside (he is now even afraid to leave his own home). It seems to me that the \u201cpositive\u201d sides of prison \u2013 the routine, predictability and having all one\u2019s needs met \u2013 are only positives for a person who isn\u2019t been adequately cared for outside of prison. If someone has that level of need, that prison is a preferable option to life free, then clearly someone along the way has seriously dropped the ball for that individual. That problem \u2013 prison being a better life option \u2013 isn\u2019t just a message you hear about autistic people; it is more generally something you hear about any desperate or forgotten population (such as the homeless). It\u2019s often said in response to such claims, that the solution is to make prison less appealing, so it\u2019s not such an attractive option. However one may feel about that for other populations, it\u2019s hardly a solution to the problem for autistic people who are struggling day-to-day. However experiences of prisons, and prisons themselves, differ, there are some things you can say with a fair amount of surety for autistic inmates: Their autism makes them easy potential targets within the prison population, at the hands of both inmates and prison officers (though  this piece  does shed an interesting perspective on how the lack of eye contact and inner-withdrawal of an autistic person, can be useful traits in the prison environment). Their experience within prison could affectively amount to mental torture if their special needs are not taken into account. Their ability to access appropriate care and to demand their legal rights within that environment, is hampered more so than for your average prisoner. Their autism must be understood and taken into account, and that currently does not appear to be what is happening. I\u2019ve read of initiatives trying to correct this oversight, but these issues are still very present and very real. An autistic person behind bars, is still a person who has some basic rights within a civilised society. Those basic rights are less likely to be met, and their punishment is potentially much more severe, if their autism is dismissed or forgotten. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fence_of_Prison-BPO.jpg", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19538651", "http://blisstree.com/feel/in-jail-with-autism/", "http://ourtaxdollarsatwork.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/largo-florida-police-shoot-and-kill-autistic-teen-in-his-home/", "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpodcast.radionz.co.nz%2Fntn%2Fntn-20110509-0927-Autism_and_the_justice_system-048.mp3&h=4AQDeNWCz", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-13/20110713-govt-defends-prison-autism-support/2793208", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10719399", "http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/chch-quake-looter-living-in-fear-4295258", "http://www.scn.org/autistics/process.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/autism-in-prisons/", "title": "Autism in Prisons"},
{"date": "June 1, 2011", "body": "\n Image by \"SIR: Poseyal : KNIGHT of the DESPOSYNI via Flickr \n My son has been trying to figure out gender, and where babies come from (though I don\u2019t think he yet realises that these two issues are closely intertwined). The resultant discussions have lead to some\u2026 interesting conclusions and summaries on his behalf. He seems to have finally figured out that boys become men, and girls become women (at least, in the usual course of things). The other day he decided this was more than a question of fact; that this also meant he liked boys and men better than girls and women \u2013 quite possibly because he now understood that he was the former rather than the latter. He conveyed this to me in the following way (all of this was said with the cheekiest of smiles on his behalf): \u201cDon\u2019t like girls, don\u2019t like ladies. You in the rubbish mummy. 60 minutes, you go in the rubbish.\u201d As a friend pointed out, I should be glad I got an hour reprieve! Then yesterday, he decided he wanted a sister. He told me he wanted five people in the family, not four. I tried to explain (in a rather misguided fashion) that a sister was too expensive, that we couldn\u2019t afford another child; he knows what \u201cexpensive\u201d means, I wanted to use concepts I knew he understood. Before I really got the chance to clarify, he told me that when he is 18 \u2013 which is our agreed upon answer as to when he will be a man and can get a job so he can buy his own grandfather clock \u2013 he will buy a sister for himself. And then told me he would buy one from \u201cThe Warehouse\u201d (a local store). I said he couldn\u2019t do that, so he told me he\u2019d buy her from the \u201cPeople Shop\u201d. I tried to gently explain that it wasn\u2019t just a question of money when people had children; that children don\u2019t come from shops, they come from mummy\u2019s tummy. (We\u2019d had this discussion before.) I asked if he remembered when I had his younger brother in my tummy. He looked thoughtful and then gave an understanding of where babies come from, in his own words. To understand this, you\u2019ll need to know that he directly associates cake with birthdays. He said to me: \u201cMummy\u2019s tummy, then cake.\u201d Yes, I guess that\u2019s right. Birthday happens after coming out of mummy\u2019s tummy (or rather, at the same time as coming out of mummy\u2019s tummy). Maybe when we have lots more money, more time, and both the boys are at school, I\u2019ll consider trying to make him a sister. But for now, there\u2019s no rush to put our order in at the People Shop. \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/60053005@N00/5783373960"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/where-girls-belong-and-buying-a-sister/", "title": "Where girls belong, and buying a\u00a0sister"},
{"date": "June 10, 2011", "body": "One of the first things I was told about identifying autism, was that every autistic child exhibits the \u201ctriad of impairment\u201d: Impairments in social interaction, social communication, and imagination. My son ticked every box and then some. His imaginative play was non-existent. As a three year-old, when his peers were playing with anything and everything \u2013 including each other \u2013 my son would line up cars, lie down and look at their wheels, and not even make car noises for them. No one was allowed to play with him, or touch his cars. His play was alone, repetitive, and lacked variation or imagination. He was in a world of his own, where little was learnt or changed. So you\u2019ll know then why the photo below means the world. Tonight, my five year-old autistic son put a toy dog, on a toy bike, and then placed a mixing bowl on its head as a helmet. Then he pretended to have a conversation with the dog. And it gets better, he even drew our attention to what he had done. From a boy who didn\u2019t pretend or imagine or share his world, to a kid who puts a dog on a bike with a bowl for a hat, and tells us about it. You\u2019ve come a long way kid.

{"date": "August 2, 2012", "body": "Today I came across  a story from Minnesota , where voting rights for the mentally disabled has become a hot topic. Currently the law there presupposes their right to vote, unless a judge determines otherwise. There is a movement \u2013 and a legal challenge \u2013 that would like to see the presumption go against those existing rights; specifically that those under guardianship should not be allowed to vote unless a judge rules otherwise. Besides the questions this raises about discrimination and any legitimate reasons for excluding a group of people from voting, it made me wonder what the situation was here in New Zealand. Do we also take away people\u2019s rights to vote if a judge says so, solely on the grounds of intellectual or mental disability? The answer appears to be \u201cno:\u201d In New Zealand, people excluded from voting (besides those who are under 18 or do not qualify as citizens in the relevant sense), are only those who are either currently in prison, or \u201c who have been in a psychiatric hospital for more than three years after being charged with a criminal offence. \u201d This  website  further explains the relevance and function of this exclusion: \u201c This stipulation in the electoral law is mostly directed towards people who were found \u2018innocent\u2019 on account of insanity or people who would have normally been jailed for more than 3 years, but because of their mental conditions they cannot stand trial. (It should however also be noted that all criminals who serve a sentence for more than 3 years are not allowed to vote and therefore this last provision is not considered discriminatory towards people with mental disabilities) .\u201d If someone is in a psychiatric facility for something not linked to a crime, the fact they are in such a facility, does not impact on their right to vote. Naturally then, neither does having an intellectual disability, or any other disability, impact on the right to vote here. (For more details on the specific provisions and Sections that affect the right to vote for this group of people, click-through to the  key part of the Electoral Act . That page includes outgoing links to other relevant statutory provisions.) Of course there is a difference between having the  right  to vote and the actual ability to access a voting booth or to understand the voting process. To this end, the Government and organisations like IHC, have been proactive in supporting accessibility to voting booths, and in providing a  DVD and other means through which to assist  the mentally disabled to understand and take part in their right to vote. Which is to say, if anything, there is an active interest and intent here in making sure the disabled do get to meaningfully exercise their right to vote. I\u2019ve been reading some of the arguments for and against the mentally disabled being allowed to vote, as a presumptive right, around the Minnesota debate. I\u2019m thinking about doing a more in-depth post explaining and evaluating the arguments, but at this point I will say this: The right to vote was hard-won for women and various ethnicities and even for the poor. To choose to exclude a group of people from having a very important right like this, requires exceedingly strong arguments. Those arguments have to go beyond stereotypes, and fears of people being influenced by those who have influence over them (many average voters are already similarly influenced, and do not have to provide evidence otherwise). Neither do we test other voters for their understanding of Party Policies or their knowledge of each candidate, or even their functional logic and education level; to suggest that we require such things of the mentally disabled ( as suggested in the Minnesota debate ), smells like discrimination to me. Those who suggest we introduce these measures for all voters would have a comparatively stronger argument, but face very significant hurdles in the objectivity and implementation of any such test. As far as I understand the New Zealand position on the issue, I am satisfied that we currently have a respectful and fair attitude towards the right of the disabled to take part in elections (or, to choose for themselves \u2013 actively or by default \u2013 to not take part). Whilst I understand the arguments against it, I do not consider them strong enough to trump a presumption to the right to vote.

{"date": "August 5, 2012", "body": "I was previously reluctant to deal with this topic on my blog; I didn\u2019t want to re-share the claim that there was a link between autism and mass shootings, by even repeating the idea in a public forum. I had hoped that being geographically distanced from the country\u2019s TV show that originated the claim, would mean it wouldn\u2019t be heard or need to be dealt with here. But I\u2019ve changed my mind after reading  a pained post by a friend , about how the purported link between autism and mass murder is affecting her and her friends\u2019 lives. I\u2019ve come to the view that if my post is the first some people hear of the recently claimed link, then at least they hear it in the context of a rebuttal and refutation of the claim. What I am talking about, is the publically broadcasted claim by an American morning show host, Joe Scarborough, on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Despite being a father of a child with Aspergers \u2013 someone who should know better \u2013 he shared the view that there is a link between autism and the mass shootings that so appal and frighten the public. He stated \u201c You have these people that are somewhere, I believe, probably on the autism scale, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here, but it happens more often than not\u2026 \u201d Despite the fact that there is no evidence for such a link, either in general or more specifically for James Holmes, some of the public seem to have treated the mere statement of it by a show host as evidence in itself. We\u2019re human. We seek patterns to answer questions that confuse and scare us. Mass shooting confuse and scare us. But fixating on the wrong answer \u2013 and autism is, the wrong answer \u2013 does not help. In fact, it harms. Significantly. What does help, is to recognise that mass shootings are not all of the same kind, so to try to paint all mass shooters with the same brush is already to make an error, as so excellently pointed out by  Dave Cullen : \u201c Do not look for a unified theory of mass murder, a single coherent drive. It doesn\u2019t exist .\u201d As he goes on to explain, \u201cresearchers find that aside from terrorism, most of these mass murders are committed by criminals who fall into three groups: psychopaths, the delusionally insane, and the suicidally depressed.\u201d Note that in his article he references actual research, facts and figures, not some vague \u201cfeeling\u201d about what might be behind this terrible crime. In  another article , dated the 21st of July, Cullen explicitly warns against jumping to conclusions after these events: \u201cYou\u2019ve been bombarded with \u2018facts\u2019 and opinions about James Holmes\u2019s motives. You have probably expressed your opinion on why he did it. You are probably wrong.\u201d Only two days later, on July 23rd, Joe Scarborough made his own addition to the pile of badly misinformed opinions. Only his were more than about \u201cloners\u201d or other misapplied stereotypes; his tarnished a highly vulnerable and hugely diverse group of people, who already suffer under the public\u2019s misunderstandings and resulting ill-treatment. I can see where people who link autism and mass shooters, may have made a very simplistic and confused error: They take inflated stereotypes of autistic people \u2013 that they lack a capacity for empathy and keep to themselves for instance \u2013 then match that to the also erroneous stereotypes of mass shooters. Throw in the drive to have some all-encompassing explanation for the act, and it\u2019s not hard to see why they\u2019ve gone so wrong. That doesn\u2019t make it forgivable though, when the person \u2013 when Joe Scarborough \u2013 refuses to offer up a comprehensive apology and retraction, and the organisation that aired the piece doesn\u2019t do it either. Ignorance that needs correcting is one thing, refusing to acknowledge that ignorance and its dangerous outcomes after it\u2019s being pointed out to you by those with relevant expertise, is quite another. Whether someone who is a mass shooter, is also on the autism spectrum, is a separate question: Their autism or not having autism, is not pre-determined by the act they performed. I can\u2019t say autistic people are never going to fit into one of those three categories Cullen outlines, but none of those categories are synonymous with autism. Autistic people are not all psychopaths or delusionally insane or suicidally depressed, and even if a few of them are (as I suppose must be possible), that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re destined for mass murder.\u00a0 To treat autistic people like social outcasts, as an unwanted category of people because of one unqualified man\u2019s rather ridiculous theory, is evidence of not just a lack of empathy, but a lack of independent thought too. It reflects poorly on those who hold to such a view, and even more so on those who encourage others to think and feel the same. Why James Holmes did what he did, is yet to be determined, though from what I understand it looks like he\u2019s going to fit in the \u201csadistic psychopath\u201d category. In the search for logic in the madness, people are understandably going to keep sharing their theories and insights. When those theories lead to further tragedy \u2013 to the extreme and unwarranted stigmatizing of a large and innocent group of people \u2013 more damage is heaped upon an existing disaster. There is no justice in that, for anyone. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.disabilityandrepresentation.com/2012/08/04/bearing-witness/", "http://www.mediaite.com/tv/autistic-journalist-demands-joe-scarborough-retract-comments-linking-autism-to-aurora-shooting/", "http://www.davecullen.com/", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/29/aurora-shooting-what-does-a-killer-think.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/opinion/sunday/the-unknown-why-in-the-aurora-killings.html?_r=2"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/autism-the-wrong-answer-to-the-question-of-mass-murder/", "title": "Autism: The Wrong Answer to the Question of Mass\u00a0Murder."},
{"date": "August 6, 2012", "body": "This is a tale of contradictions, expectations, and of trying not to laugh in the face of a parenting coach. It eventuates in a lesson about how parenting an autistic child has impacted on the way I parent his younger brother. It starts, with an angel. My youngest son is an angel, and looks like the part too; he has golden curls, blue eyes, and dimples. Slap some wings on the lad and you\u2019ve got the archetypal cherub. He\u2019s got a couple of issues though, the one of most concern to me is his mild speech delay, which worries me less and less as the months go by and his speech continues to develop. At the start of the year though, I was worried enough to request an assessment and referral to a speech therapist. The speech therapist finally came on board a couple of weeks back. Her opinion is that his speech delay is not particularly serious, but is clearly there. She thinks he would benefit from being around other children his own age more, which has been problematic since he really doesn\u2019t like the play groups I\u2019ve taken him to so far; he\u2019s very active and sociable but he likes to do his own thing, and not surprisingly doesn\u2019t like it when other kiddies knock over his castles or steal what he\u2019s playing with. He doesn\u2019t react violently at these times though, he cries and tries to leave instead. He is a gentle wee thing. So the speech therapist gets an \u201cEarly Intervention Teacher\u201d involved. Don\u2019t ask me what an early intervention teacher is, I don\u2019t rightly know. My eldest son had one for years and I never quite figured out what she did, other than attend our group meeting with the other therapists and nod and smile a lot, which is fine; nods and smiles are great. To be a bit more charitable, I think they have something to do with behavioural issues. Anyway, so we got one of these lovely ladies on board and she has decided to help me transition my youngest into play-groups that are smaller and have shorter sessions than the ones I\u2019ve tried so far, and she thinks it would be good for my son to have some time without mummy around, so he can learn by frustration (since mummy pre-empts and helps him so readily, apparently). So I\u2019m quite happy to have her help me transition him (and myself), and identify quality groups to attend to this end. And then she mentions a parenting class. I\u2019m not interested in, or enthused about, parenting classes. Not because they\u2019re not useful, but because I already went through literally years of therapists telling me how to adjust my parenting to perfectly suit an extremely challenging child the first time round, and I got very good at it. I frequently get complimented on my parenting, people generally think I\u2019m doing a good job with both my boys. And I am. Damnit. So why did she mention a parenting class? Well, apparently to give me more strategies and to help me find ways to help my son. Blah blah blah. OK. I force myself to be open-minded. I say I\u2019ll meet with the woman who runs the class and see what she has to say. A few hours later, enter The Parenting Coach. She\u2019s a lovely lady, with her heart in the right place. She tells me about a 14 week course; it\u2019s free and it includes childcare while the sessions are running. Also, there\u2019s morning tea. I\u2019m sold! And then she un-sells it, completely. She needs to find out first whether my son\u2019s behavioural and social issues are severe enough for us to qualify. It quickly becomes obvious as we go through the check list, that his behaviour is not just good, it\u2019s very good. However, on the social questionnaire, he\u2019s not looking so great. Apparently he\u2019s still scoring reasonably well there though, because she ends up saying that she could still qualify my situation for severe enough if we add in my eldest son\u2019s social and behavioural issues. The son who attends a special needs school and has a very comprehensive team of therapists involved in his life already. The son who has a diagnosed condition which explicitly includes behavioural and social issues, by definition. I\u2019m thinking that sounds like \u201ccheating,\u201d and I know already how to parent to his issues, which are after all not things that can be \u201cfixed\u201d by a parenting course. At this point I\u2019m starting to lose a little respect for the woman. At some point during the questioning, I start to realize something new, then voice my realization to the woman: that one of the real challenges I face with parenting my youngest is that I don\u2019t know what normal toddler behaviour is since my experiential reference point is my special needs kid. I realize that I need a better idea of what I should realistically be expecting of my youngest. I tell her my insight, and she interrupts me to share a platitude: \u201cBut what\u2019s normal?\u201d she says with a condescending smile, and starts a rhetoric about the relativity of normalness, which I have heard a thousand times before, and which shatters in the face of real experience of dangerously abnormal behaviour.\u00a0 (I point out too that all the questions she was taking me through before and after this interruption, were themselves aimed at recognizing abnormal behaviours in need to intervention. That she could sit there and tell me there is no normal, while going through a list that would end up with a result about how abnormal my son\u2019s behaviour and social skills are, was a tad silly to say the least.) I ended up interrupting her back, in an attempt to explain yet again that my reference point for behaviour and social skills in a child was not \u201ctypical\u201d or \u201cusual\u201d or whatever word one might like to use there (since she\u2019s so opposed to the word \u201cnormal\u201d). I tried to make her understand something as I was still getting my own head around it: I\u2019ve been thinking the past few years that parenting my youngest is like being a parent for the first time in many ways, since the challenges are so different from with my first son, but now I realise that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s more that my parenting experience is distorted, affecting my expectations of my youngest child and in turn my reactions to some of his behaviours. I can illustrate this point by an example that came up in the evaluation with her: She went on to ask me if my child ever sasses adults. I must point out that the check list is for 3 to 8 year olds, my son is only 2 and a half. Anyway, I think carefully about the question and tell her it\u2019s hard to say since he has a speech delay, but he does tell me to shhh sometimes, and I ask if that counts. She gives me an incredulous look and says she would never have let her two grown sons shhh her. That the behaviour is unacceptable, and I shouldn\u2019t be putting up with that. I try to explain that he mostly does it when he wants mummy to stop singing over something he\u2019s trying to hear, and has only occasionally done it in a cheeky manner (which is to say, he\u2019s using \u201cshhh\u201d as a form of non-verbal communication). But she\u2019s still looking outraged and wants to mark it down as an \u201coften\u201d form of sassing adults, on the form in front of her. At this point I\u2019m rather amused, because she\u2019s making a big deal out of a two-year old saying \u201cshhh,\u201d and what I dealt with with my eldest child was  being physically hit in the mouth when I spoke at all around him for the better part of a year , a child that screamed and cried and bit when I dared to speak in his presence. And here we are worrying about a boy who puts his finger to his mouth and makes a \u201csh\u201d sound at me. This is why my past parenting experience is relevant, why a reference point of a violent autistic child matters, and why her telling me there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cnormal,\u201d was unhelpfully dismissive. Ironically, by the end of her hour with me, I was feeling like the last thing I needed was her parenting program, or any parenting program. Instead I was reinforced in the impression that my son would benefit from more time with small groups of kids, and with more time away from mummy (who happens to be a very good parent thank-you-very-much), as the early intervention teacher had suggested earlier in the day. I told the woman that I\u2019d call her, that I\u2019d think over whether the program was suitable for us and get back to her by the day of her choice. I hate saying \u201cno\u201d to people\u2019s faces (that is a personal flaw I struggle with, and makes me an easy target for door-to-door sales people by the way). She rang an hour or so later and reminded me that we could add in my older son\u2019s potential score to make sure we qualify as severe enough for the program, and told me my youngest had scored in the \u201crequires intervention\u201d category for social skills. I didn\u2019t remind her what had become obvious through-out the interview process: That she was pushing things to be marked much worse than they actually are, and that we had to keep twisting the criteria to try to make it relevant for a two-year old instead of a three-year old. As far as I was concerned, she\u2019d corrupted the process. I reiterated I\u2019d call her on the designated day for my decision. Oh I know I should be kinder to the poor woman \u2013 yes she just has my son\u2019s and my\u2019s best interests at heart, or whatever \u2013 but I\u2019ve swallowed more than my fair share of platitudes and best intentions over the years. I\u2019ve let people make me feel like a crap mother just because my son was born autistic. I don\u2019t need a parenting course to cure my oldest son\u2019s autism, or to make my youngest have better social skills with other children his age (reminding my readers that this assessor\u2019s idea of poor social skills included my son crying when other kids knock over his towers, and being upset when he doesn\u2019t always get his own way. He\u2019s two years old people,  two .) By the end of this day, I better understood why I think my youngest is heaven-sent; because I\u2019m comparing him to  the hell  I went through with my oldest son. So yeah, maybe my two year-old isn\u2019t a real angel, but he\u2019s still perfect to me anyway. And maybe I\u2019m not a flawless mother, but  I decided a while ago that no such thing exists . At the end of each day, I love both of my children immensely and beyond words, and that love serves them well in making sure I always do my best by them. I refuse to feel guilty for turning down a parenting course, in fact, I\u2019ll take my ability to say \u201cno\u201d to this woman as a sign of personal growth. The next door-to-door sales-man is getting one less yes in my neighbourhood. If I don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m not going to be guilted into saying yes, whether it\u2019s a trial of the latest vacuum cleaner, changing power companies, or a 14 week parenting course by a\u00a0 woman who thinks a two year-old should never say shhh to their mother. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/mharrsch/3683075742/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/of-angels-parenting-coaches-expectations-and-abnormalities-aka-a-shh-vs-a-mouth-slap/", "title": "Of Angels, Parenting Coaches, Expectations, and Abnormalities (aka, a shh vs a mouth\u00a0slap)"},
{"date": "August 9, 2012", "body": "A  friend of mine died in a car crash  on Tuesday night. There have been others who have honoured him with fitting tributes to his political influence and talents, and the immense impact he had on so many lives (links at the end of my post). I want to remember him by sharing our last ever interaction: The day I introduced him to my autistic son. My husband was driving me into work (I tutor law part-time at university). We\u2019d stopped at a bank in New Market on the way, so I could deposit a cheque. My husband and son waited for me in the car. I was filling in the deposit form when a man comes up close beside me, and tells me to hand over my money. For the briefest of moments I did actually panic, before I realized it was Graham. The bank tellers were sending me concerned looks because of his behaviour; Graham always had a talent for putting authority figures off-balance. He introduced me to a friend of his who was with him, he tells me he\u2019s helping his friend with some sort of bank issue, something to do with the bank not liking his friend and him being there to stand up for and facilitate his friend\u2019s access to banking services. Graham asks me if I agree that it it\u2019s an injustice. Graham always had interesting friends, and frequently challenged preconceptions, stereotypes, and the injustices that accompanied them. He had the eloquence and skills to do more than just complain about what was wrong with the world. I told him my husband and son (I only had one son at the time) were waiting in the car. He\u2019d known my husband from our mutual uni days a few years back, so he came out to say hello. I\u2019d gotten my son\u2019s diagnosis not long prior, and I told Graham\u00a0 as we approached the car that my boy had autism. Graham\u2019s opinion always mattered a lot to me, so I was weary of what he might say when he met my unusual boy; would he frown or make the judgmental comments I had gotten so used to, would he be indifferent or condescending, would he say anything at all..? In his car seat, my son (who was about three at the time) was stimming up a storm; rocking side to side and flapping his hands and humming loudly and happily. Graham pops his head in to see my son, and with his classic grin, he turns to me and says, \u201che\u2019s a happy kid isn\u2019t he!\u201d No judgment, no negativity, no \u201ccondolences,\u201d just an observation of happiness. That\u2019s the sort of man he was. He was open-minded and disarming and always seemed to know what to say. Making him a powerful ally (and conversely, a formidable opponent). His ability to persuade people and motivate people to action, was something rare and quite extraordinary. Dying in a car crash, at the age of 47, just doesn\u2019t do his life justice. It was said more than once that he could have been the Prime Minister of New Zealand if he\u2019d wanted it bad enough. He achieved great things in his life, but he could have done so much more if he hadn\u2019t left the world early. My sincerest sympathies go to his family and those closest to him, I can\u2019t imagine your grief. Graham will be remembered by many, and remembered well. *** Other blog post memorials to Graham: \n \u201c Graham Watson RIP \u201d Kiwiblog \n \u201c Tribute to Graham Peter Jules Watson \u201d Mulholland Drive \n \u201c Old School Friend Graham Watson Has Died \u201d The REAL Steve Gray \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.3news.co.nz/Police-name-man-killed-in-crash-south-of-Auckland/tabid/423/articleID/264802/Default.aspx", "http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2012/08/graham_watson_rip.html", "http://blairmulholland.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/tribute-to-graham-peter-jules-watson/", "http://www.therealstevegray.com/2012/08/old-school-friend-graham-watson-has-died/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/my-last-memory-of-graham-watson-introducing-him-to-my-son/", "title": "My last memory of Graham Watson; introducing him to my\u00a0son."},
{"date": "June 2, 2011", "body": "I always understood why it was cruel to make fun of intellectually disabled people to their faces. But until today, I didn\u2019t truly understand the deeper meaning and damage in using slurs about people  as if they were  intellectually disabled, when they do or say something stupid. The first glimmer of this realisation happened many months ago, when a close friend of mine made fun of her other friend for acting as if he should be on the \u201c short bus \u201d (a bus for special needs children). My son is on one of those special transits every school day, along with his class mates with cerebral palsy and Down syndrome and various other conditions. When I heard her comment and other people found it funny, I realised I was very much so on the outside now. They think comparing someone\u2019s idiocy to children riding on a special needs bus, is worth laughing at. They think comparing someone\u2019s idiocy to the behaviour of  my son , is worth laughing at. The behaviour he can\u2019t control, the words he can\u2019t say, the actions he can\u2019t perform, are jokes in the able-bodied and able-minded world. At the time I thought maybe I was just being hypersensitive. I made some comment about there being nothing wrong with riding the short bus, and my friend apologized, and then I felt like the kill-joy. I was the PC-brigade stopping other people having \u201cinnocent\u201d fun. I tried to make sense of this later, by thinking and saying it was just one of those things that only those on the \u201cinside\u201d were allowed to joke about; Jews make Jew-jokes, special-needs people make special-needs jokes. But it didn\u2019t feel quite right, and now I know why. I can joke with my husband about autistic behaviours (my son\u2019s obsession over clocks perhaps, or his happy dance), but that is different from referring to \u201cnormal\u201d people\u2019s behaviour as inferior or stupid by comparing it to intellectually disabled people\u2019s behaviour. Because that is short-hand for saying that intellectually disabled people\u2019s behaviour  is  stupid, inferior or worthy of ridicule. There\u2019s a line being crossed there. Those sorts of comparisons and parallels reveal ignorance and cruelty. Ignorance, because mental retardation / intellectual disability is not synonymous with stupid behaviour and words; and cruel because even if it was, making fun of people for something outside of their control is like laughing at someone because they cannot walk while you can walk. I hear it so often from people around me; \u201cdon\u2019t be so retarded\u201d; \u201care you mentally deficient\u201d; \u201cyour mum dropped you on your head too many times didn\u2019t she\u201d; \u201cget back on the short bus\u201d; \u201cwhat\u2019s your birth defect\u201d etc etc etc. All aimed at able-minded and able-bodied people, comparing their idiocy to those who are not. I can\u2019t wipe a word like \u201cretarded\u201d, out of the english language, especially when it already and continues to have a genuine use. But that\u2019s not the point \u2013 it\u2019s not the word that is the evil, it\u2019s the  use  of the word. You don\u2019t need to remove a word from the english language to change the way it is used. It is clear from the way it is currently used, and the lack of any guilt or worry about that use, that people don\u2019t realise that what they\u2019re saying is beyond offensive, it is \u2013 as I have already said \u2013 ignorant, and cruel. So what can I do about it? Well I have a couple of ideas. I can write this post for starters. Done. I can also hold people to account whenever they use the slur (or related terms and phrases) in my presence, or whenever I see them using it online. I might not be able to stop them, but I would have helped to raise awareness that what they\u2019re saying also reflects badly on them, and hope that others reading or hearing my reply will think about the issue and the hurt. I can help it become one of those things people feel bad about saying in public, and think twice about saying in private. I can try. I feel deep shame that I was one of those children who would stick my tongue in my lower lip and flap my hands, pretending to be intellectually disabled when making fun of my or others\u2019 errors. But at least I know to feel that shame. I can forgive myself it because I was young, and (ironically) stupid, and because adults didn\u2019t tell me not to do that; in fact they seemed to find it amusing too and sometimes laughed along. I haven\u2019t done such a thing in well over a decade, but I have seen other children and adults do it since then. Well no more. Because I get it now. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long. The post that finally made me get it was  Stuart Duncan\u2019s post , particularly his links to examples of dialogue:  Example one , and especially  example two . I will also follow his lead by placing the accompanying video at the end of my post.

{"date": "March 11, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Phil Scoville via Flickr \n The public perception of autism is that it is only about the mind or brain, there seems to be little or no appreciation of the impact autism has on the body. My son is one of the \u201c estimated 60%\u201380%  of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking.\u201d Because I learnt about autism primarily through him, I thought all autistic children suffered the same physical problems that he did. When I first took him to a preschool playgroup for autistic children, I was surprised and confused when most of the other children so easily and happily went to play on the playground equipment. They could climb, and slide and swing, while my son just stayed on the flattest surface possible and lined up trucks. The first question that arises then is whether he was simply not doing those activities because he didn\u2019t  want  to. Was it only because of his sensory issues (and in a weaker sense, his preferences) that he didn\u2019t do these things \u2013 ie, because he  chose  not to? But I\u2019d be told by his developmental pediatrician that he had poor muscle tone related to his autism. Indeed, his diagnosis of \u201cautism\u201d entitled him to access a physiotherapist and occupational therapist, so there was professional recognition of the physical impact of autism \u2013 it\u2019s not all just \u201cin his mind\u201d. The next question that naturally arises then is whether those physical limitations were themselves a result of him choosing not to do activities that would have  otherwise  built up the requisite muscle tone and co-ordination. For example, were his anxieties and sensory issues which stopped him from wanting to climb a ladder, the  reason  that he couldn\u2019t climb a ladder? That too though, seems too simplistic as an explanation for what my son physically can and cannot do, which becomes clearer when you consider the developmental delay aspect of autism. My son has general and wide-spread developmental delay as part of (not separate to) his autism. He was significantly late to sit, to walk, to jump. Not because those activities \u2013 sitting, walking, jumping \u2013 \u201cscared\u201d him on a sensory level. He did not  choose  to do those activities late, anymore than a \u201cnormal\u201d child  chooses  to sit at an early age. Of course it helps an autistic child\u2019s physical development if you can overcome the anxieties and sensory issues: The more my son climbs and walks, the more those muscles and co-ordination improve. However, this in no way means that forcing an autistic child to do activities they don\u2019t want to do, will magically solve the physical impact of autism. It takes very careful, thoughtful and steady progress to get an autistic child to try new activities; it takes a long time to overcome the barriers to \u201cnormal\u201d activities and action. Whenever we\u2019ve made the mistake of trying to force our son to hurry up and do what the other children his age were physically accomplishing, we would only succeed in creating whole new anxieties, meltdowns, and him withdrawing further into his autistic world. One step forward, two steps back. There have also been plenty of examples in my son\u2019s life of where he fully wanted to do an activity, trying to use the right muscles and do the right actions, over and over again, and still not being able to do the activity \u2013 activities that younger children seemingly master effortlessly and quickly. Again, the physical impact of autism is clearly more complicated than an issue of choice. It\u2019s not surprising that the physical impacts of autism can build on themselves too. For example, my son is a toe walker \u2013 he can walk flat on his feet but prefers not to. This is a classic behaviour in autistic children. We worked hard on getting him to stop it. Getting him into shoes can help, but not because it stops him going on his toes (it doesn\u2019t), it just makes it  harder  for him to go on his toes. Walking on your toes all the time affects muscle development (not surprisingly), and can also affects the joints, so this is not just a question of aesthetics. Add to this behaviour the fact that his \u201c happy dance \u201d has him in a wide unusual stance rocking from one side to the other a lot, and you have a recipe for further problems. He has ended up with severely rolled-in ankles. At their worst they looked deformed, and I wondered how he managed to stand on such intensely angled ankles. He now wears orthotics in his shoes, and is meant to wear those shoes at least eight hours everyday, to try to correct his stance. The physical impact of autism on my son is really quite wide-ranging. From the most simple self-care actions of getting dressed, drinking from a cup, using utensils, and toileting, to the more carefree play that he still struggles with in the playground \u2013 climbing, balancing, swinging, sliding, hanging. In some ways the impact on him is quite typical for an autistic child \u2013 such as the toe walking. In other ways they reflect the individuality of how autism has manifested in him; reflecting his own sensory issues and anxieties. It is easy to see how bad parenting gets blamed when uninformed people observe an autistic child. They see my son not able to feed himself or dress himself, and think it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t taught him these skills. Or they see him not climbing a ladder and sliding down a slide, and think it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been taking him out to playgrounds or have been restraining him from new experiences. In the same vein that they have seen his abnormal social and communication skills, and accuse me of not talking to him enough, and not socializing him enough. Over the years I have had these hurtful charges lain at my feet, and have had to defend myself in the face of such cruel ignorance. I have worked months and years \u2013 at times without success \u2013 to teach my son, things which came naturally in the course of development to other people\u2019s children. I now watch my own 14 month old son pick up skills that my five year-old still hasn\u2019t mastered. I do not deserve praise for my youngest son\u2019s achievements in these areas, anymore than I deserve damnation for what my five year-old hasn\u2019t achieved yet. Some people also dismiss my son as mentally deficient  because  of the impact autism has had on his physical capabilities. That is to say, as a consideration independent of his problems with communication and socializing. They see what he cannot do, and judge him accordingly. They don\u2019t see what he  can  do \u2013 and I don\u2019t just mean the mental feats such as his astounding memory, and his  eye for details  that pass most of us by. They don\u2019t see how damn hard he works to achieve what comes so naturally to others. My son is a Superman, for the effort he puts into his life and to learn how to function in this world. It is  him  who deserves praise for what he  can  do, not  me  who deserves criticism for what he can\u2019t do; such is the confusion and irony. I openly admit that I still have a heck of a lot to learn about the physical impact of autism \u2013 the whys, the hows, the what-nows. Whatever the explanation for the physical impact, it is there, for the majority of autistic people. Awareness of this aspect would help reduce the unjustified judgements that families like mine face, in a life that is hard enough already. Next time you see a struggling autistic child, trying to do the simplest of actions, remind yourself that there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re staring not at a lazy child of bad parents, but rather, at a Superman. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/97803271@N00/1305121392", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#Other_symptoms"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/the-forgotten-physical-impacts-of-autism-aka-my-son-the-superman/", "title": "The forgotten physical impacts of autism (aka, my son the\u00a0Superman)"},
{"date": "March 2, 2011", "body": "\n Image by geoftheref via Flickr \n This morning as I scanned my Facebook feed \u2013 catching up on my friends\u2019 most recent activities and opinions \u2013 I came across something that quite literally made my heart ache. A friend had put up a link to a  news story about a Christchurch looter ; someone who had looted a quake striken home after the major earthquake of last week. This looter had become the \u201cface of looting\u201d, and had been treated harshly by the court to \u201csend a message\u201d to other looters. (By the sounds of the news report, he may have also been treated harshly by some vigilantes, since he appeared in court with a black eye.) There has been a lot of understandable outrage at the looters, taking money, jewelery and valuables from people who have already lost so much. This man stole a light-fitting and two light-bulbs. My friend was outraged at the news story which explained that this man had autism and other unspecified mental disabilities, my friend\u2019s words were as follows: This is bullcrap. Gary Numan has asbergers too, and he doesn\u2019t steal stuff, he makes cool music with synthesizers. An inability to read human emotion and respond to it does not make you a thief. Being a thief makes you a thief. We\u2019ll ignore the mis-spelling since that is the least of the offences here. My response was: \u201cAn inability to read emotion and respond to it\u201d  doesn\u2019t sum up Aspergers either. Autism is very complex, and  having uncontrollable obsessions is part-and-parcel with it. Huge clue:  He stole lightbulbs. Not money. Not things he can on-sell: Light-bulbs.  Stealing is not acceptable, regardless of mental condition, absolutely.  But please don\u2019t compare him to someone else who has Aspergers and then  dismiss the poor man as evil, that\u2019s far too simplistic. I want to use my own blog to add further comment to those points. Part of the problem with the public\u2019s understanding of autism, is how much autism differs from person to person. There are the same underlying categories of impairment, but the way it manifests and the severity differs, meaning you can\u2019t simply compare one autistic person to another and use that as a basis for moral judgment. We also need to take into account that the other mental disabilities weren\u2019t specified; we simply do not know everything that this poor man was living with. Then there\u2019s the question of the impact of the quake itself, on someone who requires routine, predictability, and struggles with new situations. It\u2019s hard to have your world turned upside down for anyone, all the harder for someone who has disabilities. If this man was anything like my autistic son, he would have turned to his obsessions as a source of comfort and calm, and wouldn\u2019t have been able to control it in such a stressful situation. (I\u2019ve previously written about my son\u2019s current obsession, in  a post about clocks . I could easily imagine him collecting them in the same this man did his light fixtures.) This doesn\u2019t mean theft is OK if done by mentally disabled people. It doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be punished, corrected, and held to account. (Unless the person was mentally insane thus affecting their mens rea, but that\u2019s not the extreme we\u2019re talking about here as far as I can tell). But it sure as hell does mean they shouldn\u2019t be held up as \u201cthe face of looting\u201d, or held up as an example of how harshly the law will treat quake looters. I could imagine my own son, as an adult man, living his life as best he can, following all the lessons I\u2019d taught him, being totally thrown by something as life-shattering as a major earthquake. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d cope well, no, I  know  he wouldn\u2019t cope well. I would expect him to turn to his obsessions for comfort and calm. I would hope that if he did, the law and the courts would take his disabilities into account in sentencing. And I would hope that people wouldn\u2019t publicly comment about him in the way my friend did on Facebook. I\u2019m not mad about this, just sad, because I am yet again reminded of how the struggles of our children are made so much worse by the poor understanding of autism, and the prejudices which go along with that misunderstanding.

{"date": "March 11, 2011", "body": "\n Image by natalia & gabriel via Flickr \n There seems to be a lot of confusion in posts I\u2019ve been reading lately, about \u201crecovery from autism\u201d. Specifically, they confuse together the questions of whether recovery is possible, with the question of whether it is something we should want. The two questions can \u2013 and should \u2013 be dealt with separately. Both questions are complicated by issues of identity, terminology and definitions. The question of whether recovery from autism is possible, first requires you to define autism, which is hardly an uncontentious task. There is the diagnostic criteria, which essentially requires professional observation of behaviours and challenges. If that is all autism is \u2013 observational behaviours \u2013 then it makes sense to talk of recovery from autism, since behavioural interventions can lessen (or more contentiously, \u201chide\u201d) those behaviours. Behavioural intervention is unlikely to be sufficient to carry a child completely out of the spectrum though, since communication problems are part of the diagnosis. But is that really all that autism is? If so, why talk of genetics, why take blood tests, and map the autistic brain? Why talk of how the autistic mind sees and thinks in pictures, in a way fundamentally different from a neurotypical mind? Are these considerations only relevant to the debate when they manifest in autism (as behaviour); when they may otherwise be considered \u201cbenign\u201d? Perhaps recovery from autism \u2013 as corrected behaviour and communication \u2013 means the autistic mind has essentially being rewired. Or, as I introduced earlier, perhaps the recovery is only an observation; that the child has learnt to think about every move and word before revealing their natural inclinations \u2013 to essentially hide their \u201ctrue selves\u201d. I want to clarify here that I am trying to raise these oft-unspoken questions and assumptions in this debate. I am not (at this point) suggesting answers. Similar deep and unavoidable issues arise for that other key question in the recovery debate; whether we should even seek recovery from autism (independent of its possibility). Is autism so central to a person\u2019s identity, that trying to get them to recover from autism, is to try to fundamentally change who they are? Is autism just a part of a person\u2019s identity, and yet such an important part that again, to try to cure it is to try to destroy some central part of that person? Perhaps we should be celebrating autism and the uniqueness it adds to the neurodiversity of humanity. Perhaps we should be insisting that it is not the autistic people who should recover, but society which must cure itself of these negative, intolerant attitudes towards difference. Or are those \u201cfeel-good\u201d attitudes \u2013 this talk of tolerance and acceptance \u2013 the real danger to the neediest of autistic people? Does that just make it even harder to get desperately needed funding and support? Is it perhaps a form of denial \u2013 not just of an individual having autism, but of \u201cautism\u201d as a condition at all. There is a significant movement of people who believe autism is just another word for bad parenting, or a type of personality like any other, there is a danger of feeding that movement depending on how we approach the recovery debate. Throw into the mix issues of politically correct terminology, debates about the merits of intensive behavioural interventions (like ABA), or biomedical interventions, hidden agendas, and profiteering from therapies, and you have a right mess on your hands. These multi-issues don\u2019t mean the topic of recovery is too hard, or not worth discussing. Indeed, it throws into sharp relief the practical importance of therapies, attitudes and definitions. It is because of those important aspects, that it\u2019s worth taking a step back and spelling out assumptions, but more specifically, of spelling out exactly what aspect of the debate is been addressed. Talking at cross purposes just furthers confusion and bad-blood, rather than progressing the debate. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/87718749@N00/273867675"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/clarifying-the-recovery-from-autism-debate/", "title": "Clarifying the \u201cRecovery from Autism\u201d\u00a0Debate"},
{"date": "March 6, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I\u2019ve been meaning to post on the topic of jaundice for a while, but I\u2019ve finally been spurred to do this by a recent post at  Left Brain / Right Brain . That post gave a nice summary of the current scientific wisdom about a link between jaundice and autism, concluding that at this point in time there\u2019s no strong evidence for one. I had a very emotional time dealing with jaundice with my newborns, and as a desperate mother I even blamed it (and in-turn, myself) for my son\u2019s autism \u2013 that was before I\u2019d ever heard of research into such a link. So I think it\u2019s topical that I share my story. I had a difficult pregnancy and birth with my autistic son. (That story in itself is too long (and upsetting) to be thrown in with this jaundice story \u2013 I\u2019ll deal with that separately in a future post). Those difficulties had left me feeling incompetent as a mother, even before I was one: I can\u2019t even get pregnant and give birth without stuffing up, how can I possibly parent? Add to these irrational thoughts, the utter exhaustion and extreme blood loss, and it\u2019s not too surprising that I reacted as I did when I received that phone-call after finally getting my new-born son back home. My midwife called to say the blood test that had been taken before we\u2019d left for home with our son, showed his jaundice was severe enough that he had to be put \u201cunder lights\u201d back at the hospital. I just went into uncontrollable tears, and pleaded with her to tell me what I\u2019d done wrong \u2013 why did my son have jaundice? She explained it wasn\u2019t my \u201cfault\u201d but didn\u2019t seem interested in dealing with my emotions, just in getting the baby back into hospital. Jaundice is very common, especially in boys, and if one brother has it the next is likely too as well. As would be the case with us a few years later. (For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with the condition of neonatal jaundice,  wikipedia can do the honours for me .) So my baby and I went back to hospital, and they put him under lights, and it broke my already fragile heart. He was placed in the incubator, significantly sound-proofing him from the world. His eyes were covered, so he couldn\u2019t look around either. I had to leave him in there as much as possible, so he wasn\u2019t getting cuddles and touches, except for the breastfeeding. It was sensory deprivation on a range of levels, and it just felt and looked wrong. There are significant risks with jaundice though, so it had to be done. He also came out of that incubator for regular blood-tests to see if his jaundice was improving. Hardly a pleasant and loving start to his life. A couple of days in there and his jaundice was improving. But I was going insane, and increasingly desperate to just be able to hold my son when I wanted, and take him home. They decided his jaundice was to the level that he could be taken out from under lights, but it was made clear to me that this decision was more to do with the fact that there was a shortage of phototherapy incubators and another child\u2019s jaundice was worse than my son\u2019s currently was. So we were told we still couldn\u2019t leave the hospital, I had to keep his cot by the window to get what little sun he could that way (sun exposure being the regular way to combat less-severe jaundice). They told me to wait on one last blood test, and that would probably show he was OK to leave by the end of the day. They\u2019d get back to me within two hours. Five hours passed. I made enquiries, what was going on? Where were the results? They told me to be patient. About another two hours passed, I got stroppy. I wanted to know what the hell was going on. They admitted that they had lost the blood, and were trying to find it / the results. I had had enough \u2013 my son wasn\u2019t even under lights, what was the benefit of being there. With the support of my husband, I took my baby and left the ward, saying I\u2019d come straight back in to hospital when they found the results, and if they showed my son required more lights. They finally took us seriously and gave up on the missing blood test, and gave us an immediate blood test and result (it only took a few minutes); our son was OK to go home. That was largely the end of the jaundice issue \u2013 there were just more blood-tests and home-based measures. Years later I would wonder what impact that early sensory deprivation had had on my child. Rationally, I knew the answer was likely to be \u201cnone\u201d. Emotionally, I was still raw from the whole experience. When I was pregnant with number two, I asked the midwife if there were any known factors for pregnancy and birth, that increased the likelihood of autism. She mentioned that jaundice came up in the literature. My heart just sank. Great. She gave me all the medical journal articles to read for myself, and I reached the same conclusion she had \u2013 it was an unlikely link. It was also unclear from the research whether it was the jaundice or the treatment of the jaundice that was the problem (though it was more likely to be the former if it was either). My second son was born (after a normal pregnancy and birth), and he got jaundice. Because of the emotional toll of putting a baby under lights in a hospital \u2013 instead of having him at home with me \u2013 I fought to do anything and everything to not have him go under lights. I also couldn\u2019t simply forget what I\u2019d read about jaundice and autism. I breast-fed him like crazy, and I exposed him to sunlight whenever possible. His bloods showed he was at the point where it would be best for him to go to hospital, but I wanted a second opinion this time. I was told I could keep him at home, on the condition he got a blood test every morning to monitor him for now. The bilirubin level peaked then slowly, steadily, fell. The jaundice had been bad but we\u2019d managed to keep him out of hospital. As it turns out, my eldest has autism, my youngest doesn\u2019t. But I don\u2019t make that tempting and popular error of thinking my anecdotes prove anything. They are just part of the story of my sons\u2019 lives. I got over blaming myself for the jaundice, and I got over blaming myself for my son\u2019s autism too. These things take time. Getting over those feelings and thoughts also required information about both autism and jaundice. Maybe a strong link will be shown in the future, and then maybe they will figure out how to address the link, if it can be addressed at all. All of that appears unlikely for now though. I would be very interested to hear your own jaundice / autism stories too. Sharing made me feel better, maybe it can do the same for you. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jaundice_phototherapy.jpg", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/03/jaundice-as-a-cause-of-autism-maybe-not/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice#Neonatal_jaundice"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/a-tale-of-two-brothers-jaundice-and-autism/", "title": "A Tale of Two Brothers, Jaundice, and\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "March 9, 2011", "body": "\n Image by roxeteer via Flickr \n Autism has been linked with  difficult births . So it doesn\u2019t surprise me that I\u2019m often asked if there was anything unusual with the pregnancy or birth of my first-born son. I\u2019ve decided to do some posts that answer that question. As to whether the difficulties I had with my son, have anything to do with autism, I do not know. But they\u2019re here for the record anyway. Warning, these are not nice stories. The story I am about to share is particularly disturbing. It\u2019s quite personal too, so I may be tempted to remove the post with the benefit of hind-sight. Part of why I\u2019m sharing it is for the catharsis of getting it out, because carrying this around with me is hard. So here we go, for better or worse\u2026 I thought it was over. I was finally holding my newborn baby to my chest. He was now breathing, after help from the team of doctors and nurses. He was safe in my arms and all I wanted to do was hold him, for hours, for days, forever. But something was wrong with me now, and it wasn\u2019t registering through my happy haze. They kept giving me instructions, something about lower this body part, relax that body part, push a little\u2026 why couldn\u2019t they just let me alone \u2013 I\u2019d given birth, right? I thought it was over. But there was the placenta delivery \u2013 the \u201c afterbirth \u201c. It wasn\u2019t coming out. I remember a woman trying to literally heave it out of me \u2013 my husband told me later that she had trouble keeping her footing while she slipped on my blood on the floor. There was a lot of blood. Too much. And it just kept coming out, but the placenta wasn\u2019t. I could sense their growing panic, then they started trying to talk to me about what was happening. They told me that they were going to have to take me to have my placenta removed, and that I might have to have a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding if the placenta removal didn\u2019t go well. It\u2019s still a blur, trying to remember the words, but I remember the emotions with horrible clarity. That\u2019s when they started the endless questions. The same questions would be asked of me, over and over. I can\u2019t even remember all the questions \u2013 something about blood type and what my name was. Later, right before surgery, I would simply refuse to answer them anymore. They took my baby from me, and gave him to be bewildered husband, as they wheeled me from the delivery room off to surgery. I remember the ceiling, some lights passing by, a faint memory of wondering what I must look like, being wheeled bleeding at pace through the hospital. The horror of what was going on piling in on me. While they got the surgery room ready, I started begging for my baby, I wanted to go back to him. I told them I\u2019d get up and walk back if I had to, they held me down. I started to vomit. With the force of each retch, I could feel the blood rushing out the other end of my body. I was terrified at the feel of the fluid leaving me, I weakly tried to tell them I was bleeding, but they already knew that, and my voice was ineffectual anyway. Once the surgery room was ready, they gave me something to control my nausea and to try to calm me down. They transferred me to a new bed, with my arms out to the side. So many things were hooked up to me, and going into me, I couldn\u2019t keep track of it all. The midwife held my hand as I quietly cried. And then they did something so unusual, so surreal, it was beyond my imagining. I was well and truly in nightmare territory now. A room full of people \u2013 nurses, midwife, who knows who else. One female doctor with a very long glove on. She put her entire arm up me, to manually remove my placenta. Piece, by piece. Because it was in pieces, and it was not coming out by itself. Finally, she thought she\u2019d got it all out. But it wasn\u2019t over. She had to put her arm back in and massage my uterus to get it to contract. That took a while too. I was fully awake, and I had an epidural in. So I wasn\u2019t in pain, but I could \u201cfeel\u201d everything. Every tug, every motion. I was utterly miserable, but all I could do was just look away and cry, and think of my baby. When it was over I was wheeled to recovery. I was meant to sleep now, but I kept asking if my baby was OK, and if I could hold him soon. I couldn\u2019t stop asking. I fell asleep still asking. I woke up in a room with my baby asleep near by. I couldn\u2019t go to see him because my legs weren\u2019t working \u2013 it would be over a day before I was able to use my legs and even pee for myself, again. I was offered a blood transfusion, I had lost a significant proportion of my body\u2019s blood. I stupidly turned it down \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t\u2019 have let me make that particular decision. My husband, or my mother, or anyone but me should have made that call for me. I was too exhausted in every way imaginable to be asked anymore questions that expected rational answers. I paid the price for saying no, with an extremely long recovery time, while also trying to look after and feed a newborn. Instead they put me on large doses of iron tablets. Later, they asked if I wanted to keep my placenta, and asked if they could otherwise use it for teaching purposes because it had been so unusual. I hated my placenta, the idea of keeping something so cruel, seemed absurd. I was happy for it go off and be their freak show, as long as it was nowhere near me. Years later, after I\u2019d given birth to my second son, as I held him to my chest, I knew it wasn\u2019t finished. Until that placenta was out of me, it wasn\u2019t over. That time the placenta came out as it should, when it should, and I even got to see it. It looked like a giant roast-sized chunk of meat. I didn\u2019t want to keep it that time either, but this time it wasn\u2019t going off for scientific purposes, it was just another placenta. The functional normal version, that had sustained and nourished my baby for nine months. Like so many other things in my first-born\u2019s life, I would look back over the years and wonder whether he wouldn\u2019t have been autistic \u2013 or his autism would have been less severe \u2013 if things had gone differently. I\u2019ve even thought that  if only  I\u2019d held him for longer, instead of being wheeled away for surgery after birth\u2026 But those thoughts are irrational, desperate, and unhelpful. All it does is add guilt to a situation I had no control over \u2013 unfounded guilt. As I write this my five year-old autistic son is happily running around the room, stopping occasionally to snack at his after-school meal. A school that he loves. A home that he loves. Even a mother that he loves. I must have done something right. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/78175970@N00/2195742890", "http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20040608/autism-linked-birth-problems", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental_expulsion"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/the-evil-afterbirth/", "title": "The Evil AfterBirth"},
{"date": "April 2, 2013", "body": "Each year, on Autism Awareness Day, I try to go with a slightly different theme.  In 2011  I did a piece based around how much I love my son,  in 2012  I looked at the difference in awareness campaigns in NZ compared to overseas. This year, I asked myself what is the most common misunderstanding about autism that I encounter and would like to change. By mattbeckwith, via Flickr For me, at this time, that is the ignorance around the enormous diversity within autism, especially because that ignorance leads to unhelpful stereotypes and all the damage that stereotypes can cause to a vulnerable population. First, you need to know that there are five types of autism. When someone tells you they have autism, they might mean PDD-NOS, classic autism, Aspergers, Retts or CDC. These are known as \u201cautism spectrum disorders.\u201d The symptoms required for a diagnosis of each do vary somewhat, but essentially autism affects communication, social behaviour, and is associated with restrictive interests and repetitive behaviours. Even once you know the types of autism someone has, the severity with which it affects an individual changes not just from person to person, but also over time. There are a number of ways in which we try to capture that diversity, some refer to functioning level for instance, but it is hard to capture the multiple ways in which autism can affect so many different parts of someone\u2019s life: In one area of symptoms the autistic person may appear to do very well, but in another area they immensely struggle on a daily basis. Even once you know the type of autism, and the severity, there are other aspects of autism that impact on the way the person can operate in the world. For example, autism is very frequently accompanied by OCD, ADHD, sensory issues, seizures, and anxiety. Some people treat these as pure by-products of having autism, some people treat them as separate conditions that co-occur. The point remains the same: Living with autism brings many challenges well beyond those you find listed in a diagnostic manual. There is another aspect of the diversity within autism that is also frequently over-simplified in the public eye, and that leads to huge misunderstanding about what autistic people need, and can do in life: Their intelligence. Some autistic people have an intellectual disability or clear brain damage, others are extremely intelligent or gifted. Some seem to bridge both worlds by being savants, with very strong and astounding skills in perhaps a singular area of life, but otherwise facing immense challenges in other areas of life. Figuring out how intelligent an autistic person is, is a difficult challenge in itself. Standard intelligence tests  measure things other than only intelligence , which skews the meaningfulness of the results. (Like asking someone to take a test in a different language, and concluding they have low intelligence because of their low score.) One last thing I want to add to this not-exhaustive list of the diversities within autism: Individualism. Autistic people are individuals. They have their own interests, their own personalities, their own life experiences. Though autism can and does shape how they perceive and experience the world, it does not dictate how they will respond to those challenges. For some they become deeply cynical and angry. Others are full of joy and light and hope. Some are rude, some are so polite it sets the standard for everyone else to follow. Some become experts in a field and get professorships, some prefer to play video games all day. They\u2019re people. They\u2019re babies, they\u2019re children, they\u2019re adults, they\u2019re parents, they\u2019re lovers. They\u2019re people. So next time someone tells you they or their child has autism, please don\u2019t assume they shouldn\u2019t be able to talk, or are savants, or whatever other stereotypes you may have picked up from movies, books or limited interactions. Autism is a real condition, that has various types and various severities, and it doesn\u2019t predetermine who the person is or will become. Autistic people have a lot in common with each other because of their autism, but they also have untold differences because they are individuals. If you\u2019re not sure what to do or say on hearing someone has autism, ask them what it means for them, rather than assuming, and you are bound to hear some amazing tales of how incredibly different an autistic life can be to what you may have imagined. So that\u2019s my message this World Autism Awareness Day: Autism is beautifully, challengingly, devastatingly diverse. This autism day, consider seeking out and listening to their diversity through their own stories and the stories told by those who love them. They are all so much more than their diagnosis. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattbeckwith/4485330575/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/101-on-autism-diversity-for-autism-awareness-day/", "title": "101 on Autism Diversity, for Autism Awareness\u00a0Day"},

She was my first autism parent friend. Today she launched  a fundraising page , to help her family reach the $20,000 goal that will allow them to get an assistance dog for her son Matthew. The money goes to the charity that especially trains these dogs, but doesn\u2019t cover the full costs of training \u2013 which is $48,000 \u2013 so you\u2019d be helping out a charity as well as helping out a special family by giving to Matthew\u2019s cause.

My family has made a donation of $20 already, we are not in a good financial position right now but that is what we can afford. If you could give $5 or $10 or more, or even just help promote her fundraising page for those who can\u2019t afford to give right now, you\u2019d be helping out both a good family  and  a good charity, \u201c Assistance Dogs New Zealand .\u201d (I\u2019d have loved to say we were the first to give, but that honour goes to the wonderful Jill Smo from \u201c Yeah, Good Times. \u201d She doesn\u2019t even know this family personally and lives in another country altogether, so I think that makes her doubly awesome.)

{"date": "April 4, 2013", "body": "World Autism Awareness Day was on April 2nd. It\u2019s come and gone, and you wouldn\u2019t have known it even existed in New Zealand. I searched the following sites, for either written or video content: NZ Herald, Stuff.co.nz, Scoop.co.nz, as well as TV3 News and TVNZ. Not a single mention. In fact, in performing a search for \u201cautism\u201d on many of those sites, the most recent stories that are sourced, are ones about the shooter in the USA. Which is to say, one of the recent prime examples why we need people to better understand autism \u2013 in the face of fear and ignorance \u2013 is what comes up  instead  of any piece promoting autism awareness.

Portugu\u00eas: Logo do Dia Mundial de Conscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o do Autismo, 2 de Abril, criado pela ONU (Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas). (Photo credit: Wikipedia) What a lost opportunity. And frankly, what an embarrassment. But embarrassment for whom..? I\u2019m going to point a finger at the most well-known autism charity in New Zealand, the very same charity that prides itself on being the \u201cgo-to\u201d source for the media for perspectives on autism stories. The same charity whose name appears in the stories and news items and radio interviews from previous years for autism awareness days. So what happened in 2013, and was it just some major anomaly? I don\u2019t want to be mean to Autism NZ; they\u2019re a charity, right? And god knows I don\u2019t want to alienate myself or my blog from the biggest autism charity in my little country. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen, heard and experienced of Autism NZ, since my son\u2019s diagnosis brought them to my attention: Autism New Zealand runs a help line. My friend with an autistic child once rung the help line for advice about helping their child, and was told by the person who answered that she wasn\u2019t meant to officially say it but vaccines were the major cause of autism. How many people had this person being \u201chelping\u201d in this way over the years? When I personally sought help from Autism NZ because of struggles I\u2019d been having with a government agency, they promised in person to have a talk to the agency on my behalf, and never did, even when I enquired into progress it was never actioned. There was only one service I ever received from Autism NZ, which was taking part in a preschooler playgroup. Half way through the first term of the playgroup, internal frictions caused the group running the event to splinter off from Autism NZ, so the service was ultimately run and funded by that other charity. I won\u2019t go into the sordid history of public constitutional disputes that made headlines for months, or the funding lost to other agencies because the government thought other agencies would better provide services to the public than Autism NZ could or had. The details of all that are complex and messy to say the least. There were also cries of foul play over how Autism NZ presented itself and the issues to the media during that time, but that\u2019s to be expected I guess. But what happened more recently that could have caused Autism NZ to seemingly forget World Autism Awareness Day? Oh no wait, they do mention it on their Facebook page, where they said this, and only this: \u201cHappy World Autism Awareness Day to everyone. Don\u2019t forget to help Awareness by sharing this status and getting people to donate to Autism New Zealand.\u201d That\u2019s right, no substantive message about autism itself, essentially just a self-promoting call for funds. Which is exactly in keeping with the tone of the charity of late: Last year they went from a voluntary membership donation, to a compulsory membership fee. I was very upset at the new fee and the way it was introduced, and at the time I wrote an extensive post that I never published, entitled: \u201cAutism NZ\u2019s new membership fee; at a cost beyond money?\u201d Wherein I also lamented the lack of publicly available information about how Autism NZ spends its funds, compared to other disability charities which are very open about their expenditure. I am now contemplating whether I should retroactively publish that post. The reason I didn\u2019t at the time was the same reason I was reluctant to write this post: Who wants to be seen as bullying an autism charity? They do so much for people like my son, right? Right..? Autism NZ did manage one other Facebook comment leading up to World Autism Awareness Day, requesting schools to volunteer to take part in  Multicoloured Mayhem Day . Yet I haven\u2019t seen a single story about any schools or businesses that took part in it. Not one. I don\u2019t know of any that did either. I\u2019m sure someone somewhere did, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. OK, so if their own Facebook page is a bit of a bust, surely they brought it to everyone\u2019s attention on their own website? No.  See for yourself . Try to even find mention of World Autism Awareness Day for this year. The most recent news story is about their book sale in December. (I do wonder if the fact that the story before that is \u201cnew board members announced\u201d hints at what\u2019s gone wrong?) You know what you will find though? On their \u201c what we do \u201d page, they state their top role is to \u201cRaise awareness of autism spectrum disorders.\u201d Um, oops? (As much hatred as Autism Speaks gets over in the USA, at least they loudly acknowledge that special day of the year.) I have another issue I want to raise about how Autism NZ has recently conducted itself. It decided to rebrand itself, it had the chance to move away from the puzzle piece so many people in the international autism community find offensive and belittling. The puzzle piece that has led to people pointing out that they are not something to be solved, they are not incomplete, they are not some sort of puzzle. It is very easy to find pieces written about this concern, and its all over Facebook at this time of month too. And yet  Autism NZ\u2019s  new logo is a green puzzle piece representing a human, within an \u201cA\u201d shape. I don\u2019t understand how they can be so disconnected from these issues and concerns, to intentionally adopt something considered so upsetting by so many in their community? There are quite a few autism charities and general disability charities here in New Zealand, but Autism NZ carries the highest profile and gets the most media attention for autism issues (at least in the past), so I feel like they need to serve our community well. I feel like the least we can expect from them each year is to grab the headlines on World Autism Awareness Day, when they have the right to make national and local news listen and share a message. A day when autism has an excuse to be celebrated, or at least better understood, instead of only coming up in the context of looters, hackers and murderers (each example should ring a loud bell). I see it as a huge lost opportunity, and I feel let down. I really do. I want to be nice, and understanding, and give the benefit of the doubt, but what happened, what is happening? I know Autism NZ has helped a lot of families (well they keep suggesting they do in their newsletters), but the silence on World Autism Awareness Day was deafening. And so I end on this simple perplexing question: Where was Autism NZ on World Autism Awareness Day? \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-autism-awareness-day.jpg", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/about_us/what_we_do", "http://www.facebook.com/AutismNewZealand?ref=ts&fref=ts"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/where-was-autism-nz-on-world-autism-awareness-day/", "title": "Where was Autism NZ on World Autism Awareness\u00a0Day?"},
{"date": "April 20, 2013", "body": "\u201cUnwritten Rules of Social Relationships; Decoding Social Mysteries Through the Unique Perspectives of Autism,\u201d is written By Temple Grandin and Sean Barron, with input and editing by Veronica Zysk. This is a remarkable book. It is quite unlike any other autism-related book I have read. It is challenging, confronting, and important. I\u2019m going to try to explain why I highly recommend this book, and to which part of the population. Cover via Amazon First though, a warning. When you start the book you may not want to finish it: It starts off highly repetitive, and rather disjointed, not least of all because there are three voices throughout the text. I found it very irritating at first, until I started to appreciate the brilliance of the approach: Through the use of multiple voices, there is the chance to appreciate and understand the diverse experiences and perspectives of those with autism. Both Temple and Sean have autism, but their internal lived experiences of autism are very different, with Temple being highly logical and Sean being highly emotional. Though they come from such different perspectives, autism created the same group of social challenges in their lives; reading about those different experiences of the same challenges, creates one more tool for better understanding where your child\u2019s (or your own) issues arise and how to best deal with them. Even the initial high repetition in the book serves a purpose: Repetition is a key method of learning for autistic individuals, and this book is as much aimed at them as at therapists, teachers, and parents. It also helps to generally drive home the points made. (I do think the book suffered from some poor editing at the start quite independently of these considerations, but the book improves as it goes regardless, so please don\u2019t give up in the first few chapters.) What this book has to offer, is of benefit to a wide group of people. It is going to be of  most  use to those who work with people who have autism, and autistic people themselves, if the autism at issue is of the high-functioning variety, where the individual is \u201cadvanced\u201d enough for social relationships to be a key and perhaps  the  key issue in the person\u2019s life. Having said that, related barriers of anxiety and sensory issues are also frequently discussed and put into the broader context of how they can impact on social success. The use of medication in teenagers and adults also comes up a lot, again in regards to how it can ease the road towards better social relationships for some autistic individuals. As a parent, I do suggest getting and reading this book to help you better understand your autistic child, well  before  they become autistic teenagers and adults. As the book emphasizes, the skills needed to do well socially, can and should be identified and taught from a young age, and most especially before adolescence when many social issues become more intense. The book is useful to a much wider audience too. It will be eye-opening for those unfamiliar with autism, and will be useful to those who struggle with social skills quite independently of any link with autism as a condition. The message that  everyone  should be taught social skills and coping strategies, is one quite rightly emphasized a number of times in the book. There are more lessons to be learnt from this book than I could do justice in a review, but there are a few I want to briefly introduce, to show you how valuable this book is as a resource. First, recognising the difference between teaching a child (and expecting them to understand) social behaviour, versus expecting them to understand the emotional relatedness behind / attached to that behaviour: It is important to learn and know social rules if you want to succeed at school, at work, and in relationships (and generally have a happier and more successful life). Those rules can be taught without requiring someone to also grasp the \u201ccorrect\u201d emotion behind it and to experience the right emotions for the social situation. Conflating the two together can overcomplicate the teaching task, and potentially set the child (or adult) up for failure. I found that point very insightful and important, and very obviously underappreciated in many situations I have seen and read about when it comes to teaching social skills. Some other interesting points made throughout the book, that I found particularly helpful to read about: The importance of teaching an autistic child that everyone makes mistakes; that rules are not absolute (but are rather situation based); and the division between public and private behaviour. Those are just three of the \u201cten unwritten rules\u201d that guide the book\u2019s discussion. There is a very useful discussion at the end of the book about understanding and coping with anger, which many autistic people experience and deal with poorly. The perspectives of other autistic adults (beyond Temple and Sean) are pulled in at this point to talk about why and how they experienced anger, and how much their lives improved when they found ways to diffuse such an unhelpful and isolating emotion. There is discussion about the \u201crighteous anger\u201d I\u2019ve very often encountered from autistic people on the internet, in an opinion by Jennifer McIlwee Myers, that I found enlightening. Jennifer talks about how this righteous anger harms the person carrying it around, to no benefit, and how raging at those around you makes you into your own enemy, and will turn people away from your cause. She also identified how hard it is to get autistic people to understand this point: \u201cIt has to be explained very carefully and in a gentle, non-accusatory way. Sometimes even the best explanations don\u2019t help. For me there came a point at which I had to decide which I loved more: my self-righteousness or my happiness. You can\u2019t have both.\u201d Reading about these levels of anger and the fact that they frequently are a result of social challenges and \u201cattribution error,\u201d has very much improved my understanding of what I am encountering when I come up against this  very  aggressive hard-line attitude online. It\u2019s also helped me understand that I am better off walking away from people caught up in that level of hatred, rather than attempting to engage and change minds, no matter how good my intentions; helping them is beyond my level of expertise. I need to focus on helping my own son, not least of all to try to avoid him taking on an understanding and view of the world that would similarly leave him vulnerable to such destructive anger. Don\u2019t expect this book to offer you miracle solutions (there are none), or give you a step-by-step guide to fixing the social skills issues. What it will do is help you to understand and identify the challenges, and suggest some methods and further reading to find those solutions. What works for one autistic individual, may not work for the next, and that is part of the value of the multiple writer format of this book: The multiple perspectives and experiences that helps you to understand both the diversity, and the similarities in autism. The last message I want to share with you from this book, is an important one, and again is reinforced throughout the text: Social skills are a life-long journey. It can be hard to gain them, hard to use them, and the journey never ends; there is no \u201cend point.\u201d But the rewards for trying and achieving social skills, can be life-changing, in more ways than I previously understood. This book will change how you view social skills, it will give you insights to your child and yourself. You may not like everything you read in it, but you will learn from it, in ways that I think are incredibly helpful and hopeful. *I bought this book with my own money, from  The Book Depository UK, where it happens to currently be on special for $27.72 NZ.

{"date": "April 11, 2013", "body": "Two days ago I  spotted a story  about a family who were unable to get a decent home \u2013 even to get a home through the State housing system \u2013 because of the behaviour of their three autistic children. Predictably, when I turned to a large local forum to see how the public was reacting to the story, I found people attacking the couple for breeding at all, and for not stopping their breeding after the first two turned out autistic. There were also the usual ignorant comments about how the parents just need to control their animal children. The comments I read made me feel ill and depressed me to such a degree that I put the story on the back-burner, telling myself I\u2019d deal with it when I was feeling stronger and less emotional. By 401K 2013, Via Flickr Today, Campbell Live \u2013 a local current affairs show \u2013  ran a story  about an elderly mother in Christchurch trying to find a temporary home for her two autistic sons. Her sons are in their 50\u2019s, and have the mental age of toddlers. They look to be lovely men, with big hearts and gentle souls. The story their mother told of their history was very similar to Temple Grandin\u2019s story, from the harsh coldness of the diagnosis so many decades ago, to the diagnostician\u2019s insistence that their only future could be in an institution and that their mothers would be better off forgetting they ever had them. In both stories too, the mothers did everything they could to love and care for their children in the face of such cold pessimism. But where Temple became an expert in her field, these two boys have intellectual disability alongside their autism and so their story goes a different route, still it was interesting to see the historic parallels in such different countries. All that aside, the point of the Campbell Live story is these two lovely men \u2013 who have full-time carers, and who only need a home for 6 months while their home is rebuilt \u2013 can\u2019t find a home in Christchurch. The reason they can\u2019t find a home appears to be one of discrimination, as the mother explains in the piece. They appeal for anyone with a home available in Christchurch to please offer it to these lovely men (the email, if you can help, is campbelllive@tv3.co.nz .) All that reminded me of  a third story , one I shared only in passing in  a post I did in 2011.  In that story, a family was being kicked out of their home and having trouble finding a new one, because of their autistic son\u2019s destructive behaviour. Again, the behaviour was beyond the child\u2019s ability to control. Again, the parents were deeply loving and dedicated to their child. Again, the housing options available to them were as good as non-existent. Here\u2019s what I want to say about these stories and what they tell me: New Zealand has a very serious gap in meeting a fundamental need (and arguably a fundamental right) to have a place for people to live; even when the people have the money to pay for board (all three examples have families who are willing and able to pay board, this is not a matter of pure charity). If the private market refuses to respond to the needs of these families and individuals \u2013 whether it is because of discrimination or founded fears about what may happen to their homes \u2013 then where must these families turn? For the Christchurch men, they simply need people to stop discriminating against people who are different, but for the other two families, they need an option that doesn\u2019t seem to exist; someone willing to take on tenants who are likely to cause some damage, but  through no intention or fault of their own . What you need (I hear some of you say), is a State Housing system, that is willing to take in those who the private sector turns away! But we have that here already, and even  they  turn away these hard cases (see the three autistic kids story in particular for where this is made abundantly clear). Why do we even have a State back-up safety housing option, when it won\u2019t deal with the hard cases, where totally innocent disabled children face homelessness? What\u2019s the point? It\u2019s OK to look out for the poor, but the disabled are on their own..? I\u2019ve seen the public voice the alternative of sticking these kids in institutions \u201cwhere they belong.\u201d You need only watch the Campbell Live piece on the Christchurch family, to see the hurt and damage that can do (and I do urge you to watch the video, it will break your heart though). You need only see the love and dedication of these parents of all three examples, to know that sticking these kids in institutions will create more problems than it solves; they are already in loving homes, why would you encourage tearing them apart, rather than encourage proper available housing that allows the family to stay together? The stories that make it to the news, are only ever a portion of the reality out there. It takes a certain level of personal fortitude and know-how to get the media to hear and share your story. I can only imagine how many other families with autistic and disabled children, are struggling through a similar situation. My family too, are renters, not home owners. It\u2019s hard to earn enough money for your own home when you have a child with very high needs. Not only do they require your time more, they cost more to care for too, there is no way a disabled child will not significantly impact on your finances, and government support doesn\u2019t ever come close to matching the costs. That\u2019s reality, you live with it, you make it work, but it can leave you stuck in a position of renting for that much longer, and thereby leave you very vulnerable to just this housing problem. When you have a child with high needs, you also tend to be restricted on what areas you can live, because services availability and Special Schools or mainstream schools with appropriate supports, can force you to move to or stay in particular areas. I know of many families who have moved to access appropriate schooling or support for their autistic child, and again, we are a family who have had to face this issue too. The point being, that between lost wages and having to live in the \u201cright\u201d area for your child\u2019s needs to be met, this housing issue is foreseeable and will not go away. If anything, under the current high-pressure housing market, it is only going to get worse. Something has to change, whether it\u2019s in people\u2019s ignorant attitudes towards the intellectually disabled, or in the government\u2019s attitude towards why it bothers to be in the housing market at all. (Personally, I\u2019d also love to see change in the current  highly  restrictive zoning on schools and support services, but one thing at a time!) If things don\u2019t change, there\u2019s going to be a growing underclass of the poor and disabled, without decent (or any) accommodation. Or we could just stick them all in institutions and tell their parents not to breed, since so many New Zealanders think that\u2019s an adequate response to a family in strife. It makes me fearful, for my son, for myself, for all those other families, when I read those sorts of responses. When did we become a country that sees a call for understanding and compassion, as a good opportunity to threaten people instead? Autism is a barrier to getting a home in New Zealand ( it will even stop you being allowed to stay in the country ). Can we find a way to turn that sentence into a lie? \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10876280", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6877045981/", "http://www.3news.co.nz/Finding-a-home-in-Christchurch/tabid/817/articleID/293893/Default.aspx", "http://www.3news.co.nz/Teens-autism-driving-family-into-homelessness/tabid/817/articleID/147963/Default.aspx", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/6760786/Residency-on-hold-as-son-denied"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/autism-as-a-barrier-to-housing-in-new-zealand/", "title": "Autism as a barrier to housing in New\u00a0Zealand?"},
{"date": "April 6, 2013", "body": "My seven year-old son has been attending a mainstream school for about three months. He spent the first two years of his schooling at a Special School. When his academic and social skills had advanced to a point where that environment was no longer in his best interests, it was decided by his principal, teacher, and myself, that it was time to try mainstreaming. In consultation with his new mainstream school, it was decided that it would be best to hold him back a year \u2013 begin him in Year Two instead of Year Three \u2013 to give everyone a chance to assess his skills and competencies in an environment that wouldn\u2019t challenge him too much from the get-go. As it turns out, that was a good decision. By naraekim0801 via Flickr It was decided that we\u2019d give him at least a term (about three months) to settle in before deciding whether he\u2019s ready to be shifted into Year Three. Apparently it was clear from early on that academically he was ready (which is an extremely positive reflection on the fantastic teaching team he had at his Special School, don\u2019t let anyone tell you those schools aren\u2019t about meeting academic needs as well as special needs). The problems that have become more obvious to the teaching team as the months have gone by, are his social challenges. Initially his new teacher had been full of glowing praise for his all-round abilities and saw little area for extra work and support, I tried to warn her and others that the real challenges hadn\u2019t had a chance to expose themselves yet. Sure enough, they came to see and understand what I\u2019d feared from early on. My son struggles to make friends and understand friendships. He does not grasp the subtleties of relationships and of everyday interactions, in ways that his peers already do. The admirable and inspiring thing about my son though, is his willingness and ability to extend himself. Everyday we have conversations about social skills and knowledge: What\u2019s the line between a stranger and a friend; what\u2019s the difference between polite and friendly; how do you join in an activity that\u2019s already underway; what do you do when a friend wants to do something you don\u2019t want to do. I support these discussions with examples, role-playing, and books that show suggested scripts with pictures to support his visual learning style. Sometimes we go to his school playground in weekends to practice what to say to the other children and how to handle it when others want to do something that scares him; he really enjoys these outings and they help build his confidence. For all this though, he still hates playtime at school. He loves the learning, and doesn\u2019t like to leave the classroom environment. He tells me that at playtime he\u2019s started wandering the grounds by himself, sometimes watching friends. I asked him if that made him sad, he says no, but he also told me that he\u2019d join his friends if they weren\u2019t doing things that scared him. I and his teachers and his support staff practice his social skills with his friends too, but it\u2019s obvious this is hard for him and it\u2019s going to take time. And it\u2019s these issues \u2013 with his social skills \u2013 that are ultimately why he\u2019s going to have to remain in Year Two instead of Year Three, at least for another term, and possibly the rest of the year. How can that be, you might wonder. Why do social skills matter more, it seems, than his academic skills and capabilities, since those are at Year Three level? The answer touches on the general complex importance of social skills that I didn\u2019t used to understand at all, and am still getting my head around, though I am reading and talking my way to a better understanding every single day; this is my journey alongside his. The reasons these social skills matter so much to his education, are many, and some I know I don\u2019t truly appreciate or fully comprehend yet. His challenges socializing with children his own age, make group work difficult, and requires lots of scaffolding to make sure he gets turns and learns from group activities, which are inevitable at school. Basic social skills are also required for him to get the most from the chance to communicate with the other children in and out of class time: One of the key reasons we decided he needed mainstreaming was because he couldn\u2019t get the daily and frequent verbal interactions he needed from his special classmates anymore, so we want to make the most of that opportunity within a mainstream school. His social skills also of course impact on him getting the most from the teachers too. He needs to know how to do what he\u2019s instructed without responding to requests in a way that takes up class time (by, for example, always requiring an in-depth explanation of why he must do what he\u2019s told: Respecting authority figures and doing what they ask of you is important at home, school, and the work place; it\u2019s not appropriate to question every direction, particularly in time-poor scenarios). He needs to learn to stop and listen rather than walking away mid-way through someone\u2019s sentence. He needs to learn how to ask and answer questions that will get him what he needs to further his own learning. He has the basics of these skills, but they need a lot of work yet, and it requires a team effort from his teachers at school and me at home. The lovely thing is that, for all this, he does have at least one close friend at school. That one close friendship gives him a feeling of belonging and acceptance and someone to practice social and communication skills with. If we were to advance him to Year Three, he would lose that close daily friendship, and the other friendships we have been working on. He would have to re-establish a relationship of understanding with a new teacher too (his current teacher really cares about and tries hard to understand him and his challenges, she\u2019s just lovely). I\u2019ve been warned from many quarters that in Year Three, social relationships with peers becomes more dependent on emotions and communication, rather than a shared classroom and shared interests, that currently at least give him a shot at making progress. So all up, it could do his confidence a blow if we advanced him. His ability to take part in group activities, and feel included and accepted would potentially be damaged by going up a year. Academic performance at school is not a wholly separate issue from social relationships and skills, and school is not just about academic performance. Thankfully, his teacher is mindful of giving my son advanced studies, to help stretch his academic abilities anyway, so he is not being \u201cheld back\u201d as such, though no doubt this increases her work load as she has to accommodate not just his special needs, but his academic successes. A week or two from now I will be having his next Individual Education Plan meeting, where all this will be discussed in more detail, and I can figure out how to support him further at home to match their efforts at school. As is I am in almost daily contact with his teacher, and have the chance to talk to his old teacher once a week when she comes in to help support his social skills in the classroom. Still, I am looking forward to the chance to get into a more in-depth discussion about where we see him going, and how to get there as a team. I share all this not just because I find it interesting and I hope others will too, and not just because it\u2019s the sort of thing I wish I\u2019d known and read about a year or so ago. I share it because I know some of you reading this have already had this journey, and will have insights and experiences that may help me and my son. I want to know what worked for you, what didn\u2019t, why, what you wished you\u2019d done differently if you\u2019d known then what you know now. Help me, so I can help my son. He is an amazing kid, but we both need all the help we can get. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/15267290@N03/2083329049/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/04/06/social-skills-in-a-mainstream-school/", "title": "Social Skills in a Mainstream\u00a0School"},
{"date": "January 4, 2014", "body": "The \u201c B4 School Check \u201d is an interview process that is meant to identify any issues a child may have before they begin school. The interview is done through a family\u2019s usual GP, and includes forms that are filled out by the parent (and potentially forms filled out by a teacher in the child\u2019s life too). The main controversy over the B4 School Check is around the inclusion of the SDQ, that\u2019s a \u201cStrengths and Difficulties\u00a0Questionnaire\u201d that aims to identify behavioural, emotional, social (etc) issues, beyond the other screenings for basic health that are included as part of the B4 School Check. By marsmet tallahassee via Flickr The B4 School Check is meant to be voluntary, but the official aim is for every child in New Zealand to take part, and there is plenty of pressure placed on parents to do so. Indeed when forms are sent out to parents and medical professionals talk to parents about the B4 School Check, the wording and behaviour is very much of the sort that you are expected to take part, and are expected to explain why you won\u2019t if you refuse. At this point you may be feeling a sense of  deja vu . Haven\u2019t I already addressed, and somewhat come out in favour of the SDQ in the B4 School Check? Yes, I wrote  two   posts  to that effect (though I did openly acknowledge important concerns even back then) in 2012 when it was doing the rounds in the national news. So why am I returning to the topic, and why am I now very openly and unambiguously advising you to not put your child through the SDQ component of the B4 School Check? First off, the issue has arisen for me again because my youngest (who has just turned four) is now being expected to take part in the SDQ, which was sent out to be in a very presumptuous manner (\u201cfill out the B4 School Check and bring it with you to his immunisations\u201d). Immunisations I of course intend to do, but I shall be openly refusing the SDQ, and I intend to refuse to engage with them in explaining why since I owe them no explanation and don\u2019t want to put up with their rote-learned counter-responses. It then occurred to me to see if any further news items had come out about the in/appropriateness of the SDQ in the B4 School Check. Yes, there was a news piece from  June 2013 looking at the positive and negative aspects of the SDQ , and noting some shortcomings of related data collection, but the piece that really got my attention doesn\u2019t appear to have made it to major newspapers or news feeds (at least not that I have been able to find yet).  Robert Miller, who has an impressive academic background in Psychiatry and Neuroscience  (particularly around schizophrenia) \u2013 as well as relevant personal experience and insights \u2013 wrote an article in December 2013, called \u201c B4 School Report: A Critique of a Child Health Screening and Intervention Program. \u201d It is a 65 page beast, but absolutely eye-opening, and pushed me from largely sitting on the fence about the SDQ\u2019s use in the B4 School Check, to being firmly against it. It made me see my earlier posts on the topic in an entirely different light, and I feel obligated to correct the record on my views on the SDQ\u2019s use, and to explain why I have changed my position. The summary on pages 4-5 of  the article  are an excellent overview of the very serious flaws in the B4 School Check\u2019s utilisation, monitoring, and intent for the SDQ. I will highlight some issues that are new and key from my perspective (and in response to my earlier posts), but I strongly encourage you to at least read those two pages for yourself, and then read the related sections in his article to find out more on the areas you are concerned about too. The first issue I want to raise is the very concerning level of \u201cfalse positives\u201d that come from the questionnaire; where it identifies a possible or probable issue with the child that is not  in fact  an issue. I  originally thought  this wasn\u2019t the genuine concern it was made out to be; that surely a false positive would only really matter if it was a diagnostic instrument, not when it was simply a screening tool. I thought a false positive for identifying a potential concern in a child was just an over-cautious good, not a bad thing\u2026 The problem is I didn\u2019t understand the broader context of why these false positives would be of such serious concern. As Miller puts it: \u201c The problem of the high rate of false positives using the SDQ raises\u00a0ethical concerns. Given the personal sensitivity of issues about mental health\u00a0data, the history of abuse in state mental health facilities in New Zealand, and\u00a0the lack of ethical scrutiny of the B4 School Check (and therefore the lack of\u00a0transparency on the fate of data collected, and its possible future uses), this is\u00a0a cause for serious concern. \u201d I hope you see how that casts a very different light on the false positives. Neither did I realise just how bad the false positives rate was: \u201c\u2026 nearly half of those where any disorder is judged probable by SDQ (in a community\u00a0sample) did not merit any diagnosis .\u201d (He provides a study reference in the article.) Making this even more worrying, he notes that we need to be mindful of the growing international concern over diagnostic inflation, which brings with it issues of overmedicalisation. Which is all to say that taken in true context \u2013 the potential abuse of the SDQ findings, their poor success percentage, and concerning modern medical trends \u2013 those false positives are a lot more serious than I thought they were. I also had an incomplete understanding and appreciation of the retention of the SDQ data. I understood that it was going to stay on a child\u2019s record for 10 years, but Miller says the following in his article: \u201c In modern health research, a routine\u00a0requirement on which ethics committees insist, is that the future of personal\u00a0data be specified. Often a date should be specified by which time the data is\u00a0shredded. However, there appears to have been no ethical scrutiny of the\u00a0SDQ. \u201d This prompted me to search again through the actual Government guidelines, to find clarity. They state, rather ominously, that identifying data must be held for  a  minimum  of ten years . When you take this fact in combination with the very concerning points Miller raises about the lack of protection, potential for misuse and abuse, and lack of firm or ethical barriers around interdepartmental access to the data, it\u2019s hard not to be worried about who will get the data and how it may be used. Miller points out not only the recent many instances of the Government mistakenly leaking and purposefully cross-using data, but also the problems that can arise when different styles of governments may come into control of the data: \u201c.. .[G]overnment policies and how they reflect public perceptions\u00a0can change. Once an assessment of a person\u2019s mental health status is written down\u00a0in official documents, it is hard to rule out the possibility of its being used unfairly\u00a0against the person concerned at a future date. What often happens in bureaucratic\u00a0systems is that data systems which initially are subtle, nuanced and non-categorical\u00a0come to be taken, on the basis of their black-and-white and seemingly-objective\u00a0nature (however subjective and error-prone they really are) to be more solid as\u00a0statements about individuals than is justified. Data can then gradually be \u201cmorphed\u201d\u00a0into more simplified categorical systems. It is a real danger .\u201d Miller also raises concerns about the true intent of the data being gathered, which all ties into cross-departmental access and use of the data: \u201c The motives behind use of the SDQ within B4 School are not\u00a0transparent. What is presented as a screening tool for incipient mental health\u00a0issues appears, on closer examination, to be motivated mainly by an attempt\u00a0to identify at an early age youngsters with potential in later years for\u00a0disruptive behaviour, delinquency as teenagers, and, as adults, criminality .\u201d If you want to understand how and why he reaches that view, further detail is provided in the body of the article (for example see  pages 17 to 19 ). In  the second of my original posts  on the B4 School Checks, I was not impressed by the argument against the SDQ that turned on concerns about the stigma of mental health. I did a solid and righteous attack on those who think stigma concerns are a good reason to avoid using the SDQ. My arguments, in the context they were presented, were sound (I believe). However, the true context again varies from what I understood back then. I thought the data would be protected from wider access and thereby possible misuse, that is clearly not the case since there are inadequate barriers to protect from cross-department use and from the data being accessed wrongly by the public. I thought the SDQ was primarily for screening rather than diagnosis and therefore stigma wasn\u2019t a crucial concern for the SDQ itself, I neglected to appreciate the importance of SDQ results themselves being recorded regardless of whether they lead to a diagnosis, and the huge false positive rates of the tool. I thought the benefits of potential treatment far outweighed the negatives of stigma, but again the huge false positive rate and longevity and accessibility of the data, tips this balance for many children. There is concern too about flooding an already under-resourced system with the further step of figuring out whether the child really does have a condition that needs help, in the face of all those false positives. Here I want to add a major point that I think I underappreciated when I first tackled this issue: If a child does have a real concern \u2013 something that has made early childhood teachers and parents worried \u2013 it is extremely likely to have been already identified at an earlier age. If it is a borderline issue or one that the parent and teachers are not actually concerned about, then there is an argument that perhaps it does not require intervention in the first place. Again, in the current environment of overdiagnosis, overmedicalisation, and the general \u201cmedicalisation of normality\u201d that turns natural variation into a diagnosis and label, we should perhaps be weary of the rush to identify and \u201cfix\u201d individual differences. Even if you are not convinced that we are in such an overdiagnosing society right now (fair enough), you need to be aware that the SDQ is not some fantastic and strongly reliable test for identifying these issues in the first place (thus all those false positives I keep going on about). There is likely a better \u2013 and more appropriately targeted \u2013 way to approach and deal with these worries about the children who may otherwise slip through the gaps. The way the SDQ is being administered and the data collected and stored, appears to be  far  from ideal. One final point for your consideration: The Government does not appear to be collecting data with the purposes of finding out how well the SDQ is operating; how accurate, helpful, or effective it is. It is collecting data about numbers of participants and numbers of referrals, but that appears to be as far as it goes. This is just one more flaw in the ethics and monitoring of the SDQ use in the B4 School Check. These are only some of the issues Miller raises. If you find them unconvincing, or inadequate reason to discard the way the SDQ is currently being used, I can only suggest again that you read his article and form your own conclusions by looking at the research he uses and references. For myself though, I am concerned enough that not only will I not let\u00a0them apply it to my sons, I am also advising you to not let\u00a0them use it for your children either. If you are worried about your child\u2019s mental or behavioural welfare, I suggest independently talking to your GP or some other appropriate specialist. You can also raise your concerns with their kindergarten teacher, and if necessary seek a referral to Special Education services to get your child assessed and to get them help through that portal. I will also remind you of what they will not tell you clearly: You don\u2019t have to do the SDQ. You can at least request to only do the other health checks and immunisations as you see fit. If you do choose to take part in the SDQ for your child, do so with full knowledge, make your consent meaningful, and encourage other parents to do the same. I hope that this post has gone some way towards helping to make your consent that much more informed. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/life-stages/child-health/b4-school-check", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/71902107@N03/7807178742/in/photolist-cTTQf3-9NEtYQ-8GifK6-aqRdm2-9NKVq9-7GMfSH-94MQLu-egFRpW-cTLqyE-a1WC7n-97uTdG-a5oF29-hLQqaR-9NDy6B-9hR3h5-fAdMBD-8FvUvv-hLarzm-9NAqQe-9NF42G-b6Ey3p-9NFjzr-88iEXz-7ZteX7-7Zteto-9NwoJ9-9Nvx5p-9Nw61o-9NDUEY-9NGokq-9NtsXt-98USB8-9NyTno-9NED8w-i5YBD8-7EToDC-a2tYv5-9vZZpR-958yHh-7UbPtJ", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10893809", "http://www.robertmiller-octspan.co.nz/", "http://robertmiller-octspan.co.nz/octspan/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/B4School-Report-final.pdf", "http://robertmiller-octspan.co.nz/octspan/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/B4School-Report-final.pdf", "http://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/policy-b4school-check-information-system-users.pdf", "http://robertmiller-octspan.co.nz/octspan/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/B4School-Report-final.pdf"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/why-you-should-refuse-the-sdq-as-part-of-the-b4-school-check/", "title": "Why you should refuse the SDQ as part of the \u201cB4 School\u00a0Check.\u201d"},
{"date": "August 10, 2013", "body": "The question of diagnosis, is a separate question from the existence of the thing that is being diagnosed. To put it another way: Whether someone has received a diagnosis or not, will not definitely tell you if that person has the condition. People without the condition may receive the diagnosis, and people without the diagnosis may have the condition. This is especially true of a condition like autism, which is currently still defined by its symptoms (though more is discovered\u00a0every year about what causes those symptoms and how those causes may differ\u00a0or be the same). By Javier, via Flickr All this may seem trite, or obvious to the point of redundancy. However, the process and consequences of a confirmed diagnosis is neither. In this post I\u2019m going to introduce some of the factors that interplay with the role and importance of diagnosis, and why that leads to my disagreement with the popular view that Diagnosis Manuals should take such factors into account. The first is insurance. In some countries, key treatments for autism are not covered by the Government, but by private insurers, and in many situations\u00a0those insurers require a diagnosis before covering treatment. Requiring a diagnosis very early on in the process, puts understandable pressure of medical professionals to make a quick and early diagnosis. A quick and early diagnosis is not good practice, particularly for a condition like autism which requires a thorough consideration on other possible conditions and contributing factors before reaching an accurate (and therefore helpful instead of harmful) diagnosis. Next we have education. Again, in some countries, getting adequate services at educational facilities requires a confirmed diagnosis. In other countries, services are provided based on actual needs of the child, independently of a confirmed diagnosis. Obviously, there will again be pressure placed on medical professionals \u2013 both by families and by themselves wanting to do the best by their patient \u2013 to reach a diagnosis that itself will help the child access services, even if the diagnosis is not as careful or accurate as they would otherwise require in their professional practice. I\u2019m not a fan of placing blame on \u201cBig Pharma,\u201d but it is important to note the potential and actual impact of the ability for pharmaceutical companies to influence medical practitioners and consumers directly. In the USA and New Zealand, it is legal for these companies to advertise directly to the consumer; this is not the norm internationally. There is concern that new drugs developed for conditions, encourages pharmaceutical companies to raise attention, concern, and ultimately diagnoses of those conditions, partly through creating paranoia and fear about what could happen to the otherwise undiagnosed individual. All these factors, any one of which could pressure or persuade towards a diagnosis rather than towards caution and longer investigations into an individual, are further complicated by societal and cultural attitudes towards both diagnosis itself, and more generally towards autism. In some societies and cultures, diagnosis and autism carry very positive effects of finding answers, finding like-minded individuals going through the same challenges, and the freedom from guilt that the parents are somehow solely responsible for a child\u2019s difficulties, allowing them to take positive and meaningful steps towards helping the child and the entire family. In other societies and cultures, a diagnosis and autism are considered evidence of parental failure and of the child\u2019s inferiority. The impact can be so extreme that the family may keep the child hidden and try to battle very difficult behaviours without adequate or any training and support. All these factors are at play even before you take into account the difficulties a Diagnostic Manual faces purely in scientific terms of trying to identify the core and differentiating features of a symptom-defined condition like autism. The people who construct these Manuals must decide whether their criteria should only reflect known information on the condition, or should act as a forward-looking guide to how they think research should progress. They have to draw a line between what is and what is not relevant, to what severity, and in what combination. They have to figure out how to express the criteria in words that capture exactly what they mean, and nothing unintended. As if all that wasn\u2019t hard enough, they are also expected to take into account how their chosen words and criteria will impact on the people who receive the diagnosis. They are aware that insurers, educators, Governments, and pharmaceutical companies, as well as charities and various awareness and identity movements, are all interested and invested in the diagnoses they construct. In the vast majority of opinion pieces that I read leading up the DSM-5 changes, I encountered the public pleading and demanding that the people writing the Manual be mindful of such organisations and interest groups. But I have come to wish quite the opposite, which may seem harsh or naive. The reason I wish the writers of these Manuals would ignore all factors other than pure scientific ones, is because they cannot control how all these other various organisations will react and change over time, and there is no consistent way to write a Manual that could capture and respond to so many and often contradictory concerns. Some of the interest groups put pressure in the direction of broader and looser diagnoses, other groups advocate for much tighter or even removal of entire diagnostic categories. Even if the makers of these Manuals could make key interest groups happier, they still cannot control for how individual doctors, families, and patients will view and react to diagnoses. Surely the writers of Diagnostic Manuals should play their role \u2013 one of scientific accuracy \u2013 and leave these various and hugely differing interest groups to fulfil their own roles. If insurers and educators and Governments have policies that require a fast and early diagnosis before helping families and individuals, does it not benefit more people if they are pressured and required to change how they operate, instead of insisting that writers of a Diagnostic Manual change to reflect those injustices as if they are universal and stuck-in-stone? If a Manual is written by the members of a particular country, but is used world-wide, perhaps the Manual should explicitly state it only applies in the USA (for example) instead of actively trying to incorporate purely national concerns in a way that changes the criteria. I would prefer that each organisation and interest group did the best within its realm of responsibility, instead of trying to guess and dictate how each other organisation will respond. This may not always be possible, or wise, but it seems to me that the current system is very far from perfect, and what I see and hear going on right now is doctors and Manual writers tweaking and choosing diagnoses in response to external organisations. This just creates a spiral effect of those organisations then changing their practices to (for example) further limit the number of people with that diagnosis who would have qualified for services anyway. It\u2019s a lose-lose that doesn\u2019t openly confront existing injustices and endemic problems that should themselves be forced to change. The diagnosis question is the diagnosis question; how Governments and other organisations dole out services and funding is is an important, but ideally separate, question. Diagnosing the problems with diagnosis, is a difficult but important problem, that itself reflects many of the issues and diverse attitudes towards autism and autism services in societies across the world. *** Links to useful background used towards this post: \n Interview with Dr Allen Frances, on \u201cSaving Normal.\u201d  Coffee Klatch, May 2013. \n \u201c Understanding Special Education from the Perspective of Pasifika Families .\u201d Report to the Ministry of Education, 2013. \n \u201c Making a Strawman of the DSM .\u201d Psychodiagnosticator, July 2013. \n \u201c\u201d I\u2019ll call a kid a zebra\u2026\u201d Recognising Fashionable Autism .\u201d An earlier post of mine citing other sources.

{"date": "July 4, 2013", "body": "Getting past a wheelchair that\u2019s blocking the path; putting up with the screams of an intellectually disabled child in a restaurant; changing what\u2019s in your child\u2019s lunchbox to avoid the presence of deadly allergens that some other child reacts to at their preschool; not being able to use the closest car parks because they\u2019re set aside for the disabled; teachers spending more time having to deal with the challenged child while the \u201cnormals\u201d wait. By Marcel Oosterwijk Disabled people are often treated as an inconvenience for the rest of the public. They get in the way, they slow things down, their participation in society \u2013 in education, in eating and entertainment establishments, etc \u2013 is a nuisance for those who are just trying to enjoy themselves and get on with their day. I have often heard it said that these disabled people shouldn\u2019t be in shopping malls and restaurants if they can\u2019t do what everyone else does, that they should be put in different educational establishments \u2013 or taught at home \u2013 rather than inconvenience normal children and families. Their existence and desire to take part in the world, is treated like a privilege they don\u2019t deserve, by people who did nothing to \u201cdeserve\u201d it themselves. Essentially, inconvenience of the \u201cable-bodied\u201d and \u201cable-minded,\u201d is rated as a higher consideration than the well-being and freedom of the disabled. The fact that 90% of the day they don\u2019t have to accommodate people with disabilities, is considered irrelevant. The fact that 90% of a disabled person\u2019s day is spent putting up with a world that is structured and preferential to others, is not considered part of the equation. The presence of small inconveniences \u2013 an altered lunch, a higher noise level, a longer distance to walk \u2013 are considered big enough issues to exclude disabled people from taking part in the same world. The message is plain: Life would be so much easier for those without disabilities, if they just didn\u2019t have to put up with the disabled. Tuck those with different and special needs away where they won\u2019t bother others: They can eat in a restaurant, just not this one; they can attend a preschool, but not the same one as my child\u2019s; they can get on a bus, but it will have to be the next one. And when that other restaurant, that other school and that next bus don\u2019t exist or say \u201cno\u201d too? Well what does the able-person care, they\u2019ve got on with their day in the meantime and that\u2019s what matters. Such an inconvenient existence. Just like people with different coloured skin, and different sexual preferences, and different beliefs; so \u201cinconvenient.\u201d\u00a0 Just getting in the way of normal people and their normal lives. Until the parameters of \u201cnormal\u201d shift again, or accident or age suddenly place you in the wrong category, and suddenly you\u2019re the inconvenience that no one wants to see or work around, and your very existence is treated like a nuisance to those who don\u2019t want their perfect lives interrupted. Perfection is fleeting, illusionary, subjective. Disability tends to be life-long, real, and objective. Just change your perspective, instead of expecting someone else to change their very existence.

{"date": "July 6, 2013", "body": "I\u2019m giving you the chance to win three high-quality games from  Funnybone Toys . I\u2019m going to tell you why you want to win them, and tell you how to win them. The three games are called  Cubu ,  Spectrix , and  Array . They are all card games, but they\u2019re not the run-of-the-mill type you may be used to. Each game plays on the simplicity and attraction of colour, which is an easy concept to work with when trying to explain game rules to a young child. The suggested age range on the box of each game, is 8 years to adult, but I wouldn\u2019t view this as a restriction, since my 7 year-old autistic son managed to grasp the basics and enjoyed each game. (Spectrix in particular will appeal to younger players, because you can simply convert it into a memory match game or as flash cards to help a child recognise and learn colours.) The website also gives \u201cadaptive play\u201d variations for each of these games, to allow you to change game-play to suit different abilities and developmental levels. For me this was a highlight of this product: The awareness and responsiveness to the differences among children, I wish more companies had this level of consideration and insight when it comes to products for our kids. The benefits of playing any game with any child, apply even more so to an autistic child: Learning about turn-taking; dealing with losing; and the social interaction itself that is part of playing a game with others. All these games can be played with only two people if you like, which is a good starting point for coping with waiting your turn! An added benefit for my son, was being able to watch clear video instructions for each game on the website, which he finds an enjoyable and accessible way to learn something new. My husband and son playing Spectrix (my son is excitedly standing on a chair in the background). My son\u2019s favourite of the three, was also my personal favourite, and the one that I thought he would struggle with the most (I was wrong): Cubu. Like all three games, what starts out as a seemingly simple concept, becomes more nuanced and enjoyable the more you play it. He did struggle with some of the finer rules of each game, but considering he has some developmental delays and is only 7, that\u2019s not surprising (and as I mentioned above, game-play and rules can be altered to respond to any such issues). I do think he will enjoy them even more so as an older child. (As a side point, he loved the word \u201cCubu\u201d from the start and repeated it a fair few times, and when we got the cards out he did his \u201c happy dance ,\u201d so the joy was on multiple levels.) If I have any critique of these games at all, it would be that some of the colours needed to be more sharply defined / distinct from each other, but I soon got used to the spectrums with more game play, and the different shades of colour can be seen as a strength of the game: requiring more attention and awareness to those differences. As they put it on their own website, \u201c younger players will develop a deep appreciation of color and develop a relationship with the different hues that exist in the world, while having so much fun they won\u2019t even realize they are learning .\u201d I guess that applies to some of us older players too! Funnybone Toys sent me my three games, and have very kindly offered one of my readers a set too, of  all three games . (Which is good, because I have no intention of giving away my own set; they\u2019re keepers.)  This is what you have to do if you want to win Cubu, Spectrix and Array for yourself: Comment on this blog post telling me who you would play these games with (maybe your own child or grandchild, someone you work with in therapy sessions, or simply a friend who loves card games). You\u2019ll get a bonus entry for sharing the post on Facebook, and a bonus entry for sharing the post through Twitter. You will need to tell me that you have shared them to get those extra entries. That\u2019s a maximum of three entries per person (yes, you can have other members from your household enter the competition too). For each entry, I will write your name on a piece of paper and put it in a bowl. Two weeks from now I will get my 7 year-old to draw a name out of that bowl, and that\u2019s the winner! Easy, right? I will even take a photo of my son drawing the name out, and post the photo back here after it\u2019s drawn when I announce the winner. Please make sure you use a valid email address on the comment form (don\u2019t worry; the comment form doesn\u2019t publicly share your email address), because I will forward the winner\u2019s email address to Funnybone Toys who will then arrange to send the games out to you wherever you may be in the world (they managed to get a set out to me in New Zealand, so they can get one out to you too). By the way, they are simply lovely people to deal with, this company is doing all the right things, they even donated 50 game sets to the Colorado Autism Society; like I said, good people.

{"date": "July 12, 2013", "body": "The Education Review Office (ERO) has now published  a follow-up report on the inclusiveness of mainstream schools in New Zealand . The original study back in 2010 did not return good outcomes about how inclusive our schools are, with only 50% considered to have \u201cmostly inclusive practices.\u201d (There are three key categories of performance here: \u201cmostly\u201d, \u201csome,\u201d and \u201cfew\u201d inclusive practices.) The report that has just been released looks at the progress since then, and will be followed next year by a broader study to see whether we have reached the aim of 80% of schools being mostly inclusive and 0% having few inclusive practices, by 2014. By charamelody. via Flickr The summary of findings is that over the past three years, there has been an increase from 50% with mostly inclusive practices, to 77%, which looks well on target for the 80% by 2014. The \u201cfew\u201d inclusive category has dropped from 20% to just 7%, which is also an encouraging improvement (keeping in mind of course that no school should only have few inclusive practices; I\u2019ll be looking at what\u2019s happening with these schools later in this post). As I go through the core pieces of information I found interesting and useful in this latest report, you need to keep in mind some very real limitations to this study.\u00a0 It was only of a small sample of schools (81), all schools included in this study are Primary schools, and the children focused on are those with \u201chigh needs\u201d (defined as those being in the top 3% of need for additional learning support). The inclusiveness concern is in relation to all special needs students (not just the 3% most needy), and at all schools, including Secondary schools. The broader study next year will take into account these much broader categories. Still, I think there are important insights that we can take from this interim report, in particular I found it highly educational on what to look for when you\u2019re trying to figure out whether a particular mainstream school will be a good fit for your special needs child, which I will be looking at throughout this post too. There are six elements that give insights to how inclusive a school is for our children. These are useful not just to understand the outcomes of the study, but to know what to look for when you\u2019re researching a school for your own child. So I will spend a little time explaining what each mean: (1)  Coordination . This elements is about the relationship between all involved parties; that\u2019s the student, family, teachers and support staff. A good relationship begins before the child even starts at the school, with transition visits and meetings to get to know those involved. Coordination involves recognising that the child is the responsibility of all the staff (and in particular here, not just the teacher aide). Good coordination also evidences good attitudes from the school staff towards the child, and is often linked to the presence and skills of the SENCO (Special Education Needs Coordinator). (2)  Achievement . This element reflects staff having high expectations of the child, and positive attitudes towards what the child can achieve. (It is interesting to note under this element, that some schools expressed concern about the achievement levels of special needs children being tested and reported as part of National Standards.  This is a concern that I have too , but the ERO report simply reinforced that schools are obligated to perform this testing and reporting regardless.) (3)  Professional Development and Learning . An interesting consideration here is whether the school focuses on just extending the learning of affected staff (perhaps the specific classroom teacher), or believes and acts in such a way that all staff should be educated about special learning needs of children, regardless of whether they have a child with the specific disability in their class at the time. (4)  Transitions . A good transition practice would allow for multiple visits before starting school, and the open sharing of information between relevant parties. It may even allow and encourage parents to be present in the classroom, and class teachers to visit the child in their home environment, as part of the transitioning process. The focus should be on the school fitting around the child, not the child fitting around the school. (5)  Outside Support . Accessing external specialists to assist the student, and the teacher\u2019s understanding of the child\u2019s needs too. This outside support can take various forms (which can be found  on the report itself  if you\u2019d like the list of possibilities / suggestions.  All elements are expanded on in the report itself , do click through for further information and context.) (6)  Teacher Aides . The focus should be on keeping the child within the classroom setting, rather than frequently removing them from the classroom (of course, this is about inclusion after all!) The teacher aide themself should be a part of relevant conversations about the child. The 77% of schools that exhibited mostly inclusive practices, besides doing well across these elements, also showed a particular and note-worthy trend that was again notably  absent  in the schools failing these students: Positive attitudes from those in leadership positions towards the inclusion of children with special needs. In the \u201cfew inclusive practices\u201d category, you\u2019ll find Principals and other core staff who do not believe mainstreaming is appropriate or possible for our children, so it\u2019s hardly surprising to see these attitudes affect other staff and practices across the school. Another strong indicator of a school showing good inclusion of our children, is the existence and the skills of the SENCO. If there is no SENCO at the school, or the SENCO is inadequately trained or inexperienced, this can significantly impact on coordination. A third key marker of a well-performing inclusive school, is the attitude towards teacher aides: Understanding that they are not solely responsible for the child in school, and are not being overly relied on by the school and class teacher. The schools falling into the \u201csome inclusive practices\u201d category often had low coordination between relevant parties. They also needed to reduce their reliance on withdrawal strategies when issues arise with the high needs child. In the schools in this category, you may find parents being forced to pay for fundamental resources like teacher aides. (It is worth noting that some schools complained that funding was a key issue, however the ERO report found that strong leadership and differential teaching was more vital than the lack of funding, when it came to inclusiveness.) There is also evidence sometimes of \u201csmall-scale\u201d bullying at schools in this category. The schools with few inclusive practices, were generally  not just failing their special needs students . The report found that these schools tend to be performing poorly on broader measures as well. A consistent finding regardless of how well the school scored, was that there is a need for better self-review processes; the schools need to do better at monitoring and understanding how they are performing in these areas. So this is what I think you should take away from the report, if you are a parent trying to figure out if the school you\u2019re looking at (or your child is already at) is providing an inclusive environment: Talk to the Principal, teacher and teacher aides where possible, to figure out their attitudes towards special needs children attending mainstream schools; find out whether the school has a SENCO and try to find out about their training and experience; and look at how the school views the role of the teacher aide (are they there to assist the classroom teacher who remains responsible for including the entire class, or will they be expected to do most of the teaching and to remove the child from the classroom as a key strategy to coping with issues that arise). There are some very interesting issues and points raised in this report that I would like to go into further (such as inclusiveness as a value, as an indicator of success, and how well I see these things occurring at my son\u2019s schools), but for now I leave this post as is: A summary of the report, that contains suggestions of what you may want to look out for when looking for a school for your child. I hope you found it useful, and I\u2019d be interested to hear how well you think your child\u2019s current school performs on these markers. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ero.govt.nz/National-Reports/Including-Students-with-High-Needs-Primary-Schools-July-2013/National-Report-Summary-Including-Students-with-High-Needs-Primary-Schools", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/23628513@N00/4757913318/in/photolist-8frxSf-oSq1m-ea4rKW-e9XMdk-ea4siY-ea4s2w-e9XLRH-e9XM7Z-ea4rSu-e9XMvZ-e9XMvk-e9XM7e-ea4rUd-e9XM1p-e9XMkp-e9XMan-e9XM7H-e9XMb2-ea4rEq-ea4s49-e9XMj2-e9XLKT-e9XLXP-4aduSo-4a9r7x-81jfsM-8aXQEx-uTJTS-dMLnqh-6JdG8f-PXUbG-cJpjCd-4MT4C1-264UtA-621uDA-5zqUoC-621vwd-621v7b-61WgVk-8Z1pWh-8YXmvx-8Z1pEJ-7iizic-aC6Kxi-99Xy2s-8iMEkj-9cLSzr-e56JMu-7Jg3R6", "http://www.ero.govt.nz/National-Reports/Including-Students-with-High-Needs-Primary-Schools-July-2013/Findings/Schools-with-mostly-inclusive-practices/Elements-of-good-practice/Outside-support", "http://www.ero.govt.nz/National-Reports/Including-Students-with-High-Needs-Primary-Schools-July-2013/Findings/Schools-with-mostly-inclusive-practices/Elements-of-good-practice", "http://www.ero.govt.nz/National-Reports/Including-Students-with-High-Needs-Primary-Schools-July-2013/Findings/Schools-with-few-inclusive-practices"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/report-on-inclusive-schools-and-what-to-look-for-in-a-school/", "title": "Report on Inclusive Schools, and what to look for in a\u00a0school."},
{"date": "July 27, 2013", "body": "The furthest I studied science was to Sixth Form Chemistry, that was so long ago that these days they don\u2019t even call it \u201cSixth Form\u201d anymore. Science didn\u2019t feature much in my tertiary studies; the closest I got was courses on the history and philosophy of science, and a couple of courses in psychology. I had little meaningful or thoughtful interaction with it as a topic for many years, besides what the mainstream media felt it worth sharing. By epSos .de , via Flickr And then my son got a diagnosis that further changed my already unstable world, and I did what most parents in my situation do: I started looking for answers to what had caused, and what would fix autism. The answers belonged in a field I felt little prepared for: Science. Of course the first suggested cause I encountered was also the most controversial: Vaccines. But it quickly became apparent that even though this proffered answer supposedly came from science, it was also scientists who were most vocal against the claim. This necessarily required me to confront and attempt to come to terms with the very nature of scientific controversy and what it means to make a scientific claim. I came to autism claims with an open mind; back in the year of my son\u2019s diagnosis the vaccine debate hadn\u2019t been enlightened yet by the revelations that would later ruin Wakefield. I had to figure out why disagreement existed, and how and whether the disagreement could be resolved in such a way as to access \u201ctruth.\u201d Years later, my search for understanding of where scientific controversy comes from, has reached the point where I now find the very topic in itself \u2013 quite apart from the initial autism concern \u2013 a personal passion that I pursue by regularly reading entire books dedicated to the topic. The books I get excited about these days are non-fiction ones that don\u2019t just teach me new information, but specifically address how we learn, incorporate, and make sense of information; where that process can go wrong, why, and how to be alert to those errors. This venture has refined my own thinking processes and given me a much heightened awareness of how my brain will naturally seek out patterns and meaning where there is none, and how the scientific process is the best system we have at this point for trying to counter those quite natural inclinations and short-cuts; how the scientific process can be perverted and misused, and the role media in particular can play in the sharing and furtherance of misinformation at the societal level. I have become enamoured with reality. With the search for truth, and the tools we use to access that truth. I take joy in reading about how magic tricks play on the shortcomings of our senses and preconceptions; more joy in that than I ever found from simply watching and being confounded by magic tricks themselves. More joy from the complicated beauty of evolution, than from any elaborate creation story. I openly stare at and acknowledge the huge abyss of the unknown, and no longer cling to some more reassuring version of false certainty. Coming to terms with science, is a matter of facing what we don\u2019t know, just as much as what we do know. Before autism and my search for its answers, I did not appreciate any of this. And now I have an autistic son with an astounding mind, that thirsts for knowledge and has an almost pathological craving for utter certainty in all matters, a certainty that reality and life can\u2019t realistically meet. But because of my growing passion in understanding science and how we perceive and make sense of reality, I feel that I am better placed than I ever was to help him make sense of the world, in a way that acknowledges its uncertainty but also offers him a foundation for attaining and using knowledge to be successful in his life. That is a topic I will expand on in Part 2. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/36495803@N05/4370721677/in/photolist-7Ee6hi-p5HRD-4NyEAA-CQfYR-Snqu-4sz3rv-b9KZ1X-9oWDWB-892P2Z-892P4H-eeEkR-7JhcvS-4WsE65-9nhHta-5sVbu-7xqQth-7xn2Dg-9FZqRF-avqVVt-adYcbG-bE64Jq-7BLLNG-4qMn5s-4qMnzJ-4qMna1-cnPwx9-aCzAjC-4qMmY3-96eij5-96bj9M-96biNg-96ekA5-y28fo-4qHhot-4qMnMs-4qHi8v-4uy5Gk-7mxz5m-96bjCz-3bgN6-dDKGcm-aDuxq-qLN98-3tJ8B-4wbE2e-5nyzRZ-5nCQch-5ZAgqF-53MAYm-892PkK-8964Bs"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/how-my-sons-autism-brought-me-to-science-and-how-i-brought-science-to-him-part-1/", "title": "How my son\u2019s autism brought me to science, and how I brought science to him (Part\u00a01)"},
{"date": "April 13, 2013", "body": "Raising a child with autism has made me a better person. How many times have you seen a statement like that, and what is your reaction when you do? I\u2019ve never felt comfortable with the statement, I\u2019m not even a fan of the oft-repeated notion that  having children  would make someone a better person. The fact is many people remain just as rotten (if not more rotten) after having kids as before having kids. But there\u2019s an extra kick in these statements when we talk about children with disabilities making us better: The subtext that their suffering and hardships is in some sense \u201cvaluable,\u201d because it leads to another person\u2019s personal growth and betterment. To put it another way, it  objectives the disabled child into holding worth in relation to what they can make happen to other non-disabled people ; implying (at its extremes) that the disabled child\u2019s true worth is not within them or intrinsic. But here\u2019s the rub: My son\u2019s autism  did  make be a better person. Wait, I hear you say (and I have had people say this to me when I tried to explain myself); how could I possibly know that his  autism  is what lead to my personal growth? Could it not be, perhaps, the fact that he was my first child and therefore the growth is that which comes of having children at all (ie, disabled or otherwise)? Or perhaps my growth is something that was going to happen anyway for me; that I am just one of those people who were already on the road towards whatever enlightenment I found? Or maybe it was just what happens when a person is under hardship and has to either grow or get towed under in order to cope, and I happened to grow rather than drown, but the autism itself was incidental as just one of many possible catalyst hardships? I\u2019m going to say no, those are not correct; it  was  his autism, it  is  his autism. No, I don\u2019t know what person I would have turned into without having had an autistic child, but my confidence in saying that it was his autism that made the difference, is because my growth is in my attitudes towards everything that autism touches: My respect for and understanding of intelligence; my attitudes towards disability and intellectual disability; my patience, coping, and problem-solving skills that I\u2019ve had to develop when faced with daily interaction with a mind and perspective so new and challenging. My views on special education, and what is of most value in a human, and how I could and should interact with everyone from family to friends to strangers: All this and more, changed in me because of the daily lessons and experiences that come from raising a (once severely) autistic child. Those are not \u201cmere\u201d lessons of parenthood or incidental personal growth (not least of all because I find myself fighting to get other parents and seemingly compassionate people, to reconsider their own (often unconsciously or incidentally formed) attitudes and views in these specific areas). I don\u2019t think I could satisfying enumerate the myriad of ways in which my son and his autism \u2013 especially  because  of his autism \u2013 have improved me as an individual. I am stronger, more compassionate, more aware, more accepting, and all those other good words. I  like  who I am now much more than who I was before, I feel like a more fully realised human being. I know I still have a long way to go, but it feels like he was what started the growth. I\u2019m going to be extra annoying and say: That\u2019s my truth. That\u2019s what happened to me, and why, as I lived it. But I don\u2019t go around telling it to everyone I meet, and I\u2019m still going to cringe when I hear it made as some sweeping statement from anyone else. Because it\u2019s equally a fact that autism will not make everyone \u201cbetter.\u201d And I am very aware of and concerned about that subtext I referenced earlier about objectifying autistic people, into this tidy little inspirational package that exists to make the rest of us better. I must say that I am also very conscious of the problems and distortions that arise from this romanticising of what is in fact a very serious condition; there is real harm that can come from pretending autism is something harmless and sweet, most especially for families and individuals living with the most severe forms of autism: It is frustrating, upsetting and unhelpful to be told you should just embrace and love autism, when your daily life is violence and exhaustion and fighting to access basic rights and services. I have become increasingly aware of the daily hardships for adults with even very mild forms of autism too, so the romanticising idea that autism is instrumental to wonderful things, can overcast very real issues and concerns at both ends of the spectrum. Any good things that might come from me telling people his autism \u201cmade me better,\u201d are far out-weighed by these other concerns. People will falsely generalise my truth, into something it isn\u2019t for others, and into a distortion of the condition itself, and an undercutting of the internal and intrinsic value of an individual with autism. So that is why his autism made me a better person, and why I should never say that it has. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/why-his-autism-made-me-a-better-person-and-why-i-should-never-say-that-it-has/", "title": "Why his autism made me a better person, and why I should never say that it\u00a0has."},
{"date": "July 17, 2013", "body": "A month or so back, I was having a friendly chat with a neighbour. He was a nice man, who has only ever been accepting towards our family. He\u2019s seen my son move from a rather severely impacted autistic child, to the rather more mild impact autism has on my son\u2019s life today. My son was with me during the conversation, happily buzzing around in the background in our yard, and the neighbour commented on how well my son appeared to be doing, and then asked \u201cwill he ever be normal?\u201d By Astrid, via Flickr My brain and my mouth froze. I wanted to scold the man for asking such a loaded question right in front of my son, but I also wanted to act like the question didn\u2019t matter and smooth it over because the more attention I brought to it the more my son would think the question was important. I wanted him to un-say it. I also wanted to lecture him about him assumptions and valuations of normality, but I wasn\u2019t sure how I was meant to package that lecture, or if it was worth the confrontation, because I knew the man\u2019s heart was in the right place even though his wording choice was offensive (and stupid). Eventually I decided to just say my son would always struggle with certain things like social interactions, but that he\u2019d be fine. Which was when the second stomach-punch was delivered. He asked how the \u201cnormal kids\u201d at my son\u2019s school got along with him. Again, my brain felt like it was misfiring. Why did he keep packaging the world into normal versus my son, and why was he more interested in what the normal kids thought than how my son was finding the school? At this point I\u2019d had enough of the conversation and didn\u2019t want to continue to talk to the man in front of my son, so I answered rather dismissively that they were fine with my son, and very deliberately changed the topic. Since the conversation, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what I should have said and done differently, if anything. Would it have been a waste of time trying to get this man to understand, when his view of the world was so binary (normal, abnormal, and my son fitting into the latter), is it the sort of conversation you can even have \u201cin passing\u201d with a neighbour? Surely I should have at least attempted it (at the time I was rather shocked and having trouble coming up with an appropriate response). Should I forgive his ignorance and the upset it caused me (and potentially my son), considering his apparent lack of experience or understanding of disability, disability rhetoric, or autism? Are his good intentions and apparent concern, more important than the harm he does with such views? Was I too caught up on the word \u201cnormal,\u201d when the man was probably struggling to find the right words for his questions? Should I just be happy he took an interest and asked his questions in the first place? These questions have been going around in my mind since then, because the conversation and what was said in front of my son still upsets me. I want to keep my son away from this neighbour, to avoid any more such views and rubbish molding his lovely young mind. But should I be actively confronting and correcting the man instead, did I miss a great opportunity, and should I actively pursue the chance to fix the man\u2019s future views? A friend shared a post with me today, which drove me to write this down.  The post was about a mother taking a very open-minded and educational attitude towards annoying and ignorant questions about autism.  (I like the post, and it\u2019s worth a read.) So now I find myself thinking out loud about the best way to deal with those brief encounters with people who don\u2019t take an active interest in disability and autism \u2013 instead bringing along their prejudices and presumptions \u2013 but who do appear to care about my son. I think, as a matter of integrity and the betterment of attitudes towards my son and his peers, that I must be willing to confront people when this happens, but find a way to steer the confrontation away from an expression of my righteous indignation, and towards a genuine learning opportunity. I think this is something I will get better at with time, the more chances I have to explain and express these issues to others in person. I wish I didn\u2019t know this situation will arise again. I wish I didn\u2019t have to get good at dealing with these things. But I can\u2019t un-wish attitudes, words or conversations; I can work towards changing them though. I must, and I will, I\u2019m just still trying to figure out how. Facing and dealing with such situations, is becoming my new normal. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/44712381@N00/4301290092/in/photolist-7y6eG1-e8AJHN-5Yvv1J-hN1zF-5Qsfn-76ibP6-6qxSZA-9CqYkM-e3iH9T-9CtSPJ-5mgKt1-dpJbqX-74gDKT-4s4vMb-4nNLrb-9CXrwb-4A6Guj-4A2vuk-5K85C4-6HXeSE-5Ba86K-eJzBF3-65m99E-5uxziL-3n2Ld-8YaYF4-5gEBDX-8Ye1UY-PDBUG-5YvuQ9-brxB4U-9Z6aU5-4Va7fj-5LcuEN-71s2X2-6WGrHK-aJdrcX-brxzqJ-brxz7Q-9fsDUU-8YaYve-9v5QbN-5kgyXV-6SAzGr-arte11-5xH64X-8FF6B1-EcEfd-8YaYzi-6AfBdG-6Afydu", "http://livefromthewangofamerica.blogspot.co.nz/2013/07/ten-questions-i-want-you-to-ask-about.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/will-he-ever-be-normal/", "title": "\u201cWill he ever be\u00a0normal?\u201d"},

At first he most needed to know about routine, expectations, and rules; without this knowledge he was prone to anxiety and meltdowns. Those were questions I could answer, they were relationship and authority questions, where I was the relevant authority. Over time his questions expanded beyond this most basic need for certainty about day-to-day routine, and became more about the world he could see around him.

He moved on to an all-consuming love of calendars, to the point his room walls were covered in them and his first question when visiting relatives was whether they had a calendar he could take home. Perhaps predictably (and rather delightfully), his interest shifted to the planet Earth, the place where all distance and time that he was familiar with, was measured and most meaningful. The calendars in his room were slowly replaced by world maps (he currently has four world maps on his room walls, and three globes at last count). And so you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that now he is utterly consumed by the Universe. His favourite apps, his posters, his books, and of course his endless questions, are now about space, the solar system, the exoplanets, and so many things I know so little about. I could no longer rely on my own memories and experience to answer his questions, and even Google couldn\u2019t keep up, because now his questions were about the size of the Universe, if the Universe would ever end, whether and when our sun will die, and the number of galaxies and stars and names of the biggest this or that celestial body. Sometimes there were answers, increasingly there are not, but he still craves the knowledge and has a need to understand why there are no answers when I could always give him them before. And this is where science and the scientific method, observations and discoveries of knowledge, became crucial to how I was to help my son. He had already encountered a book sent home through school as part of his reading class, that explained how our knowledge has changed, refined and advanced over time in regards to the dinosaurs; looking at how we do know certain things about these ancient creatures, that the way we come to know these things and the way we make sense of our observations, can change over time. I thought the idea might scare or confuse him, with his intense need for clear guidelines and knowledge, but we discussed the idea introduced in the book between us, and he appeared to follow the general idea and even found it quite interesting. I was able to expand on what we encountered in that book, by confronting the problem of Pluto: Old books and old posters told my son that Pluto was a planet, books and posters are meant to be reliable sources of truth and facts. How is it Pluto lost its designation, when, and why? It was a great chance to explain to him how seemingly fixed knowledge can change, as we look out for new information and refined understanding, as new observations and new knowledge helps us to be more accurate. He could now recite when Pluto lost its designation as a planet, and places that knowledge in reference to his own life span; it doesn\u2019t bother him, in fact it appears to make him quite happy. (He loves quizzing me on the Universe, to see what I understand too. One of his favourite lines is \u201cdid you know that\u2026\u201d followed by his latest space fact. He talks to himself everyday, as if he\u2019s absorbing new ideas out loud, a form of learning for him, and I recently overheard him say \u201c\u201dDid you know\u201d means \u201clet me tell you.\u201d\u201d My boy is more insightful than some adults I know!) His love of the universe, and his growing understanding about how new knowledge is found and incorporated into existing knowledge, has been a great foundation for me to encourage him to see a future occupation in the field (should he so choose). I\u2019ve told him that if he wants to know even more about the Universe than we do today, then he should become a scientist who studies space. I\u2019ve spoken to him about how studying science at school now is the first step on that journey, and that maybe he\u2019ll want to choose physics at highschool level too. We\u2019ve spoken about how he could pursue a job at the local planetarium (his favourite location in school holidays), and how one day he\u2019d like to be an astronaut (an unlikely occupation for a New Zealand boy with his challenges, but I see absolutely no reason to stamp out his passion and desire, so far it is only achieving good things for him. In the past he has wanted to be a policeman, a teacher, and a few other things; his interests and passions shift over time, and that\u2019s fine. I see it as my job to help him to understand how to reach his chosen goals, and to help him along that path. Who knows; maybe he  will  be an astronaut, that\u2019s decades away and things change so much over time.) Science is a perfect field for my son. Not only is it the study of reality (which he finds far more interesting than fiction), it is also a great way for him to come to terms with uncertainty. His intense desire for certainty has driven him down this path towards wanting and needing to understand the Universe, and straight into the arms of the realisation that there is still so much unknown and uncertain about some of the most important things in life. And that\u2019s OK. Each day still begins, still ends, mum still loves him, the season still change; there is enough certainty to allow him to function, but enough uncertainty to drive him to become the one who will help fill those gaps in our human knowledge and understanding. Science, autism, life. So much uncertainty, so much yet to find out, but we know how to best pursue that knowledge, and in the meantime we live the best lives we can. For me, the best life I can lead right now includes learning about the Universe alongside my son every single day; so much beauty and magic already right there in the world, and right there between us. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/58782395@N03/5519580228/in/photolist-9pKhUm-9pGfXt-9pKiho-9pGgQg-9pKiEC-9pGgw8-9pGhd4-9ND4FA-ec3K2A-2ARhsT-9Nzwzk-9ND1jY-9NxSCr-cSwg6q-9NAfyg-ebWWRK-9NA8FD-9NyoX4-9NBPeQ-9NwrEg-9Nx7VU-9NyvJB-9NxAvg-9NH9LR-9NvNDw-9NztJe-9NAW5w-9NzPxJ-9NwU2R-9NzJVv-9NwACM-9NzwBG-73zAEn-9NxKaD-9M2DZZ-b1Ra8r-9NvF6h-9NwY8N-vzWsm-9NCQG9-bpixTw-9NzRNa-62cviZ-dcVGQv-9oZ92u-7H8mjJ-5x8jwp-abp29e-9NCYCL-8LMLfZ-8QKvoN"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/how-my-sons-autism-brought-me-to-science-and-i-brought-science-to-him-part-2/", "title": "How my son\u2019s autism brought me to science, and how I brought science to him (Part\u00a02)"},
{"date": "September 1, 2013", "body": "Update : KFC has backtracked under public and political pressure, and is finding ways to re-employ their disabled employees! Thank you to everyone who shared the news story, shared my post, and boycotted KFC with us over the past month. We did it! \ud83d\ude42 I will consider writing an entire post update, but for now, here is a link to a news story covering the turnaround: \u201c KFC calls back disabled staff \u201d\u00a0NZ Herald, Sep 29th 2013. And another good story I just found in the NZ Herald on this issue; an opinion piece on what KFC did, and on employing the disabled more generally: \u201c KFC gives way for the disabled \u201d Opinion Piece in NZ Herald, Sep 29th 2013. ******* KFC New Zealand has chosen to restructure its workforce, with the new policy that all workers need to be capable of all duties.  The effective result being that their disabled employees are being made redundant in stores throughout the country . There are so many apparent problems with this \u2013 legally, ethically, and simply in the area of basic compassion \u2013 that it\u2019s hard to know where to start, but I\u2019ll begin with discrimination and go from there. By Tom Asher, via Flickr How can it not be discrimination, when the people targeted by your change in policy are the disabled, who were otherwise doing their jobs well and held a strong work history with the company? If the majority of people affected by the new restructuring policy are the disabled, and very few if any other groups of people in the business are affected, it\u2019s hard not to view the policy as aimed at that specific group of people. I\u2019d need to see statistics on who has lost their job under the new policy, information that is not publicly available, so all I can do at this point is rely on the news story and on common sense, which makes it hard to see this policy in any other light than ultimately aimed at removing their disabled employees. And if it is not aimed at that group, but that group is the primary one affected, the point is still the same: Effective discrimination. Whether it is legally justified discrimination is the next question, and a question that I feel belongs in the courts. Furthermore, it is hard to imagine that KFC took all appropriate procedural steps in the restructuring and resultant job losses, including full and fair consultation with the workers most likely to be affected, and attempts to retrain and ascertain if they were capable of doing the work required. In fact, based on the information in  the news story  \u2013 including the surprise devastation of a worker who only received three days notice, and another family\u2019s view that the store did not try to figure out if the worker could do the work required \u2013 it looks like KFC has completely failed in this area. Taking into account the employees most likely to be affected \u2013 the disabled \u2013 I would have also thought that any consultation process should have been that much more involved with external support people, such as union representatives and family, I see no evidence of this involvement in the personal stories. It\u2019s hard to figure out exactly what KFC has and has not done here, because they\u2019ve chosen to not respond to the media questions about the process: \u201c Restaurant Brands general manager of people and performance Jennifer Blight refused to answer questions about the policy .\u201d So I can only go on the information made public by some of those affected. All of that information says to me that this matter belongs in the Employment courts, not just before the Human Rights Commission. But the disabled are notoriously dis-empowered when it comes to representing themselves to the courts. So I\u2019m happy to see that a Union is involved, and that family members and the media are publicly and loudly supporting the workers; at least they think it is an issue worth talking about, even if KFC doesn\u2019t. The effect of the lost work on these people is huge, not just financially, but emotionally too: \u201c Staff put in their own money to buy Jared a farewell gift and dinner. \u201cIt was really sad. He was sitting out in the restaurant trying to eat his meal and he burst into tears.\u201d \u201d\u00a0It also affects their sense of personal worth: \u201c \u201cThe work makes them feel worthy,\u201d Steve said, \u201cand all of a sudden they\u2019re unworthy.\u201d \u201d It is hard to quantify what the process (or lack of process) and resulting job losses, have done to these individuals. KFC has done itself huge damage too. My very first memory of seeing a disabled person employed, was at a KFC restaurant, it was a very positive thing for me to see as a child. KFC has also received very positive press in the past for its willingness to employ the disabled: \u201c Jared Dixon, who has autism, was restructured out of his job at KFC in Greymouth.\u00a0He\u2019d worked there for 16 years doing three hours a week \u2013 making the local newspaper in 2006 when the company presented him with a long-service award for 10 years on the job. \u201d Yet here they are undoing all that good will, by now restructuring them out of the business. I, for one, am so disgusted with KFC\u2019s attitude and approach to the situation, that my family will no longer buy their products until the situation is resolved (we did buy from KFC at least three times a week). I will ask the same of my extended family and anyone else who listens to me. At the very least, I would like to see \u00a0KFC publicly acknowledge the issue and its importance. They can speak to the matter without breaching any laws surrounding confidentiality, they are choosing not to give it the time it deserves. This is unacceptable. Even if it isn\u2019t discrimination, even if it isn\u2019t a breach of correct employment procedures, it is still a complete failure of basic compassion. Disabled people find it difficult to overcome existing societal discrimination against them. Taking away the job they eventually got, is so much more than a lost job, it is the loss of their place in society, the place where they have friendships, the place where they were respected and seen and appreciated. If there was any way at all that KFC could have retained their positions in the business, they should have done so. These would have been their most vulnerable employees \u2013 at least one of which was using the income to support other family members \u2013 so KFC surely should have been all the more careful and considerate with how their decisions impact on this group of people. Please help me put pressure on KFC to review what it\u2019s doing, by sharing the news story, sharing this post, boycotting their products, or / and writing to KFC to express your disgust. You don\u2019t have to be in New Zealand to put pressure on them, feel free to let your national KFC know how deeply New Zealand\u2019s KFC restaurants are damaging the brand. This is not OK. Let them know this is not OK. *** Useful links: \n \u201c Disabled Staff Forced Out of Job .\u201d NZ Herald, 1st Sep, 2013. \n \u201c Employment Court decisions signal new path in restructuring and redundancy .\u201d Mondaq.com, 13th Aug 2013. \n KFC New Zealand\u2019s Facebook Page \n KFC New Zealand\u2019s Twitter Account:\u00a0 https://mobile.twitter.com/kfcnz \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11131722", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=11131663", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11117584", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/37616948@N00/5266944083/in/photolist-92qsYK-92qsT6-92tA8G-92qu7a-92qsse-92tziJ-92qtii-dqjAjH-dqjyHV-8rNcYS-92qwvi-8rWm3r-8rWuFT-8rWxUZ-8rZENb-8rW7Ea-8rZvDL-8rWwMk-8rW6SV-8rWA8k-8rZqBW-8rZzuQ-8rZu8f-8rZxsJ-8rZsnN-8rZFEj-8rWz4v-8rWsC6-8rWkdv-8rWnE8-8rWr34-8893mW-7JcSk4-8yKyqN-8twoa5", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11117584", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11117584", "http://www.mondaq.com/NewZealand/x/257502/Redundancy+Layoff/Employment+Court+decisions+signal+new+path+in+restructuring+and+redundancy", "https://www.facebook.com/kfcnz", "https://mobile.twitter.com/kfcnz"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/restructuring-the-disabled-out-of-a-job-why-i-am-boycotting-kfc-new-zealand/", "title": "Restructuring the disabled out of a job; why I am boycotting KFC New Zealand\u00a0(updated)."},
{"date": "July 21, 2013", "body": "There are some pieces of personal writing that I want to love, because they push an important point into the spot-light or provide a new take on a worn issue. A particular issue that concerns me when it comes to autism, is the glorification of autism as a gift or as inevitably associated with genius, or as mere difference and that the only thing that needs fixing is societal attitudes. This glorification or romanticising of autism, may be done with the best of intentions (to lessen stigma and encourage acceptance), but it always comes at the price of shuffling those in the highest need off to the side, even to deny their existence and severe challenges, when it is exactly this group of people who need the most attention and resources. By Jack Keene, via Flickr Here\u2019s the problem though: The pieces I most often encounter that highlight this important concern about the side-lining and ignoring of the most needy, almost always come hand-in-hand with other highly controversial or damaging views about the nature and existence of autism. Of course the people who write the pieces don\u2019t think their views are particularly damaging, otherwise they\u2019d hardly be writing and sharing them with the open aim of support and help for those with autism. But the upshot is the same, their opinions get rubbished for the points people disagree with, instead of paying attention to the issue they are highlighting; the twisting of autism into something it isn\u2019t, to the detriment of those most in need. Three particular regular autism bloggers come instantly to mind as fitting in this category, though I won\u2019t name them because I move in the same blogging circles and I have no interest in alienating them in this post (they are good people in my personal opinion, despite the disagreements). Today though I came across a piece that once again fits the mold: Someone raising the issue I\u2019m talking about, but then doing something so utterly cringe-worthy in the post that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to share it (on Twitter, Facebook), and even hoped it wouldn\u2019t be seen too widely because of the negative light it casts on the otherwise important core concern. The piece is called  \u201cAutism in the Shadows,\u201d  and since it\u2019s on a very public website \u2013 The Washington Post \u2013 and not simply a personal blog, I feel that it\u2019s more than fair to very publicly share my concerns considering it can access such wide readership through that forum. Most of it is fine: tackling how the media and certain high-profile people love and dwell on the high-hope stories of the high-functioning, whilst ignoring the intellectually disabled and most in-danger on the spectrum. (I know some will think the most severely autistic get plenty of coverage in the news, but try to understand that the ability for those with the most severely affected children and family members \u2013 not least of all the individuals themselves \u2013 to share their stories, is necessarily lesser compared to those who can communicate and express themselves clearly in some form. I see this at play more and more in the media, and at least some of the public has swallowed the view that all autistics are geniuses and types of savants.) The problem comes in at the end: The writer of the piece pleads with us to see the  pain of the parent  whose child smashes their head against the concrete wall, to feel the  anguish of compassionate caregivers  while people stare and judge the autistic person, and the  grief of parents  who have to accept their child may never be able to care for themselves. When I read that, I was astounded. Why isn\u2019t she highlighting the pain of the  individual smashing their head , of the person  being judged and stared at , of the  person  who can\u2019t care for themself? It can\u2019t simply be because they can\u2019t speak for themselves, because we have the ability to empathise with physical pain and humiliation and powerlessness; even those with intellectual disability and severe autism are capable of feeling and understanding such emotions (arguably not all at the very worst end, but the vast majority show they feel and suffer from these things.). Should not we be expecting people to empathise with those who hurt and suffer, not solely with their caregivers? As hard as it is to watch your child smash their head to the point of damage, is it not worse to be the person driven to such behaviour (be it by sensory issues, frustration, or something else outside of their control)? Yes the stories and perspectives of their carers matter and yes they are often how we\u2019re going to hear of these experiences, but to empathise so strongly the suffering of the watcher over the experiencer, strikes me as somewhat bizarre and even twisted. My problem with this is all the stronger in the context of the broader issue, because it is exactly this sort of prioritising \u2013 of the carer over the autistic individual \u2013 which is the frequent attack made on those who bring the issue to the spotlight: That they aren\u2019t interested in the perspective of the autistic person, and if they were they\u2019d stop wanting a cure and just learn to accept the autistic individual. When we see these perspectives thrown together in the same piece \u2013 autism is romanticized and let\u2019s focus on the pain of the carers \u2013 it just drags the discussion off in another direction instead of focusing on the point that matters: Helping those most in need as a priority for autism care (for unfortunately,  it is a world of priorities in many senses when it comes to autism support ). And so I cringe, and so I don\u2019t share the piece because I know the attacks it will receive, and so I find myself wishing once again that autism politics wasn\u2019t so out of control in the way it is, in the way that frequently silences people\u2019s genuine experiences and concerns out of fear of unintentionally upsetting some sector of the autism community. I suppose that is what I\u2019m also cringing at then; what autism politics does to our voices. I find that point hard to dismiss though (and I won\u2019t), because paying respect and using the right language are important and powerful tools for the rights of  all  autistic people. There is no single accepted version of the right words in the autism community though, you will always offend or disgust someone, at some point you just need to speak the truth (or your truth, if you prefer), and let the public consume or spit it out accordingly. When it comes to personal opinion pieces, they are, after-all, personal opinion pieces. And this is just my own then, feel free to attack or love me as your mood takes you, but spare a thought anyway for the autistic individuals who cannot speak for themselves, because in all the politicking, their voices still too often remain undervalued and unheard. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035739227@N01/11784370/in/photolist-23p5N-bm7toe-3uNLjb-AnJTo-6VR88r-5pmXfC-wkAo1-RQUE-5WDAmR-8haiS-7CyJPx-4pFpAE-99fCU-kPQrn-cXz1L-7jvbRi-eD7Bq-bZSJB1-qoxz6-ejHAcT-87skBK-irGqL-6uRsA-8v6sZs-4PcKKB-7HBd2L-5MSyss-4vN4t5-3KNXMy-a6Qzz-dyfX6r-76y9ft-6EZTPS-6aurKE-4majt7-dnJsLM-dmZkv3-7HUFH9-4ket25-4bss3V-bfo3gP-9hzx4s-6RutCx-7uqLWu-5uQWVA-6fdr11-b3BPmr-9ThaNW-8DRP24-AobgW-6UERkV", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-autism-stories-no-one-hears/2013/07/19/64bcb33e-e500-11e2-aef3-339619eab080_story.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/07/21/cringing-at-autism-in-the-shadows-and-autism-politics/", "title": "Cringing at Autism in the Shadows, and Autism\u00a0Politics"},
{"date": "November 4, 2013", "body": "The summary of the story I\u2019m about to tell you, goes like this: You will no longer find the National Standards data for Special Schools on either the Ministry of Education or Fairfax\u2019s websites, because of a successful argument that sharing the data was a breach of privacy. The longer story goes a little something like this: By Alan Cleaver, via Flickr When I became a Board of Trustees member of my son\u2019s new school, I became aware that no school should publish National Standards results that could be used to identify any specific child\u2019s achievements. \u00a0The Ministry of Education\u2019s (\u201cMOE\u201d) own guideline, is that any grouping containing 4 or fewer children should not be published, due to this privacy concern. In their own words aimed at Trustees: \u201c Where the total number of students in any cohort you are reporting on is small (4 or less) it is likely that the school community will be able to identify this group and their individual levels of achievement. Therefore this data needs to be excluded from any public reporting.\u201d It occurred to me that by the same logic, neither should any school publish an 100% result across the entire school, because that automatically identified the achievement results of  every single  child in that school. For example, an 100% \u201cwell below\u201d achievement result for a school tells you they all effectively failed that subject. Yet this is exactly what happened when both the MOE and Fairfax decided to publish the results of Special Schools on their respective websites. The MOE\u2019s website is called \u201c Education Counts ,\u201d and Fairfax\u2019s website is \u201c School Report \u201d\u00a0via their stuff.co.nz site. I always felt the publication of my son\u2019s school\u2019s data was a cruel breach of his privacy \u2013 a sentiment I shared  in a post from September 2012  \u2013 but now I felt I had an argument I could confidently present to get the data taken down from both of these widely used and easily accessed sites. I had to decide who to approach and in what order. Ultimately I decided to first approach the MOE, because getting them to remove their data would give me a stronger argument that Fairfax should do the same; I figured Fairfax had sourced its data from the MOE site and so showing that data was erroneously published would make Fairfax rethink its own sharing of that data. But because MOE would later insist that the data Fairfax had could only have come directly from the school, my son\u2019s old school would also get pulled into the communications along the way. Some of these parties were apologetic, some compliant, some borderline combative, and it was interesting to see which organisations fell back to what types of communication when dealing with me; after all, I am just one mother approaching them out of the blue. Why though, why did this matter to me? (And why should it matter to you?) This wasn\u2019t just about the breach of privacy (though that was always my primary motivation). And this wasn\u2019t just about  my  son \u2013 I wasn\u2019t just arguing on behalf of my son or only for his school. To me this was also about the misuse and inappropriateness of that data when applied to Special Schools in the first place: I might not to able to stop the MOE demanding the data for themselves, but I felt I could and should stop the public and other organisations misusing and misinterpreting this inappropriate data. Anyone who looks at an 100% failure rate in Special Schools and thinks that reflects the learning, progress or achievement within those schools, is already being given a wrong impression about the value of the work these schools do every single day. The first email I sent was to the MOE on August 22nd 2013. They originally claimed they would never have published data that would breach any student\u2019s privacy even when I explained the issue (though they were willing to check his specific school if I named it, which I refused to at that point), and told me to take the matter up directly with the school. I had screenshots of the MOE\u2019s own website \u2013 Education Counts \u2013 that displayed the 100% \u201cwell-below\u201d figures for a number of Special Schools, so I confidently yet again pointed out they  were  in fact making privacy breaching data public, and pushed them further to investigate the matter. At this point they did decide to have the matter further investigated at their end, and ultimately decided they should have blanked out all the 100% figures for the Special Schools and set about fixing the data accordingly. They even ended up apologizing for any upset caused to me, and thanked me for bringing the matter to their attention. So far, so good. During our correspondence, MOE claimed they were not responsible for the data that was available through the Fairfax website though \u2013 which I openly took issue with, since the data Fairfax was using was clearly readily available through the MOE website. Still, there were two more parties I apparently had to deal with: My son\u2019s school \u2013 which the MOE claimed was responsible for Fairfax\u2019s data access (and therefore the privacy breach at that end) \u2013 and of course Fairfax itself. Here\u2019s where it gets messier (and I am doing my best to un-messy this thing for you along the way): My son\u2019s old school then stated very clearly that they never provided that data to Fairfax. In fact, they had the same concerns I had about the information breaching privacy, so had chosen not to respond to Fairfax\u2019s Official Information Request for the National Standards data in previous years. You see the hole, right? Where did Fairfax get the privacy breaching data then? MOE stated it wasn\u2019t them, the school stated it wasn\u2019t them, what would Fairfax say? I should add that my son\u2019s old school was very supportive of what I was trying to achieve; they agreed with me that the National Standards data isn\u2019t really relevant to our kids, and that it shouldn\u2019t be publicly available regardless. Their communications with me were swift, polite and supportive. I was left wondering though, that considering their own awareness of the fact that announcing an 100% failure rate would have been a privacy breach, why were some\u00a0 other  Special Schools ( this one for example ) publicly using the 100% failure figure to make their case against National Standards in news stories? Announcing to a news organisations the exact results of every student in your school, with the purpose of it turning into a National news story, is hardly respecting those students\u2019 privacy. I understand what those schools were trying to achieve through the publicity, and sympathize with their cause obviously, but I do think the point and story could have been told without announcing the 100% figure. That aspect of this whole thing still bothers me. Anyway, back to Fairfax\u2026 Fairfax was a bit slow to respond, but after a couple of my emails I did receive a phone call assuring me that they are concerned about privacy issues and had tried to be hyper-vigilant with what data they published (for example, whereas the MOE wouldn\u2019t publish 4 or fewer people groupings, Fairfax was apparently using a \u201c10 or fewer\u201d guideline to add extra levels of protection). However, just like the MOE, they hadn\u2019t realized the logic worked at the other end of the scale too: Where you have an 100% outcome of any sort across a school. They were very polite and were glad I\u2019d brought the issue to their attention, and removed all the relevant data for all Special Schools. Job done. The story should end there, but you remember how the MOE claimed Fairfax could only have got the data directly from the schools? Well in the meantime \u2013 while waiting on Fairfax\u2019s reply \u2013 I had gone back to the MOE and requested that they also approach Fairfax to remove the data since the school wasn\u2019t the source of the data Fairfax was using (meaning, the MOE website was the (or a) likely source). The MOE insisted I first give them the name of my son\u2019s school so they could investigate the issue, which was a piece of information I had so far withheld from them since the issue affected all Special Schools and I didn\u2019t want them placing pressure or stress on my son\u2019s school. At this point I felt I had to name the school, and I then warned the school too that they would be hearing from the MOE. Later, the MOE returned to me saying they would approach Fairfax and ask them to remove the data, but\u00a0 only for my son\u2019s school . At this point it should be clear that I am not impressed with how the MOE has dealt with the matter on the whole: They initially claimed they\u2019d have never allowed the data through, even though it was there in black and white for all to see; then they claimed the school was the source of Fairfax\u2019s data, even though it wasn\u2019t; then they said they\u2019d only approach Fairfax to remove my son\u2019s school data, ie not all affected Special Schools, which strikes me as unfair and hard to justify considering everything they knew by that point. If you\u2019ve read and followed the details of this post, you\u2019ll understand why I feel like they\u2019re the villains of this piece. Nevertheless, the MOE did eventually remove the offending data and did apologize and thank me, so if they\u2019d just admit the data was irrelevant for these schools in the first place everyone would be happy! (No, I\u2019m not holding my breath.) Was it worth two and a half months of my time (and over 20 email communications) \u00a0to pursue getting the data taken down? Yes, absolutely it was. As I said above, I think the data is a privacy breach and ripe for misuse and abuse, as well as being fundamentally irrelevant data on our kids. I do believe that by acting to protect my own son\u2019s privacy, I have also acted to protect the privacy of all the other students in those Special Schools. I do think that as someone with a law degree and a little bit of time on my hands, that it was suitable someone like me take the time to argue and force the issue. I do hope too that raising the concerns about the relevance and potential misuse of this data will get these organisations yet again pondering what the point is of collecting data that doesn\u2019t actually represent the achievements or progress of any of the students in those schools. National Standards data doesn\u2019t tell you if a nonverbal child learnt to talk, if a child with limited fine motor skills can finally hold a pencil, or if a child who used to be violent and out of control is now able to sit at a desk for more than 5 minutes. The 100% failure / \u201cwell-below\u201d achievement data for these schools, only tells you that they are Special Schools with challenged children, which you already know. It casts all their achievements as teachers and as a school and as students, in the form of a negative. It screams \u201cfailure\u201d to the public and to parents, when it should be shouting its version of \u201csuccess,\u201d or at the very least, should be trying to  identify  those successes in some meaningful way. It\u2019s like a kick in the guts as a parent, and I have felt that kick take my breath away and leave me in tears, I\u2019ve felt it make me momentarily lose sight of all the wonderful things these schools do with our children. Accomplishing this outcome from the MOE and Fairfax has given me back some of the confidence and motivation in life that I\u2019d been lacking lately: I can make a change for the better, what I say can matter. I may have only got some data taken down off two websites, but I\u2019ll take my victories where I can get them, and I am proud that I successfully stood up for my son. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/11121568@N06/4105726930/in/photolist-7fNVzm-7nW4CQ-7w4KEW-7ZRTUP-dZ2y6b-asybHk-82CQEX-9tczCJ-8b15Y2-9dnduD-9dqiRJ-9dqjCo-9dndng-9dndfV-9dqiUS-9dnd16-9rg8Mb-9L7oz3-9L4ABR-9L4AB4-873F1R-82CQRP-889TVV-9r2dSX-9B5FUv-87a9UW-821ssM-9L4ACp-8tdwxg-8346Yd-85bWmT-bjYdrL-aPorZi-dYNa6w-85bY2g-7RGZiU-7RGZ4d-7RGZ9f-7RDJjT-7RDJ6D-7RGZrh-7RDJGV-bjYdrb-dYH1Gc-7X2H7E-dYNdhU-aovqDn-8Xiqe7-8t8yb3-asJz1c-dHuer6", "http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/find-school", "http://schoolreport.stuff.co.nz/2013/index.php", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/7716661/Case-study-Hamilton-North-School"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/protecting-the-privacy-of-special-students-a-case-study-of-a-fight-won/", "title": "Protecting the Privacy of Special Students (a case study of a fight\u00a0won)."},
{"date": "June 10, 2013", "body": "Everyday my Facebook feed is littered with the latest miracle stories of how an iPad (or similar device) has helped an autistic child to communicate. Some of those stories are shared from the web, but most of them are from my friends sharing their latest successes with their own child. Example of assistive technology for communication. Picture by stephanie vacher, via Flickr. Does the research actually support this miraculous outcry though, and even if it did, should we be getting our kids to put down that iPad and pick up that PECS box? This post is my first effort to answer that question. First a brief look at some of the existing research. There is a study specifically looking at PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) as compared to using the iPad to achieve the same ends. It is useful to compare iPads to the PECS system because PECS is a well established communication system for autistic children, with a good reputation. This 2012 study ( Flores et al ) was a small study, of only five children, but found that those children either improved or had no comparative improvement when using the iPad versus using PECS (ie, an overall positive outcome for iPad use).\u00a0  Van der Meer, Kagohara, et al. (2012)  only looked at four children, and at the iPod versus manual signs, with implications for the use of other assistive technologies. Again, it found positive outcomes for those children involved in the study. A  recent systematic review  of 15 studies on the use of such devices, also found a largely positive outcome. A theme that comes through the research is that success using these devices is quite individualised; whether a child responds well to the use of a device is not predetermined by their diagnosis. Nevertheless, it appears to do no harm and potentially much benefit, to give it a go. But what does \u201cgiving it a go\u201d entail? The biggest hurdle for many is simply the cost. We are a two iPad family, but we didn\u2019t pay for either (I won one, my husband got his through work). If we had to purchase an iPad specifically for my autistic son, I don\u2019t know that we could have afforded it (or have chosen to do it). But for those families that can, and those families that have other general reasons to have an iPad in the family, it would seem to be worth a try. I do not think though that it is worth putting pressure on publicly funded services to supply an iPad (or similar device) to a family with an autistic child; the fact is there are still traditional and excellent alternatives available. Similarly (and even more so) I do not think there is strong enough reason to  demand  a family acquire such a device in order to help their autistic child. Ultimately, any therapists working with a family should be willing and able to adapt to what both the family can afford, and what the child responds best to; that individualism focus is itself what comes through the research. Where other methods have tried and failed or had limited success, there would be a strong reason to try these new devices, and the sooner the better; early intervention is well documented to make a significant difference in an autistic child\u2019s life. There are those who seem to rebel against the use of this new technology merely  because  it is new technology. I have the same leaning; I do not like trying new things as a general rule, and I prefer to stick to what I know best, especially if it already works for me. I think, for people like me, it helps to remember that these technological aides are not about turning known and proven methods on their head, it is about making those known methods more accessible and building on their principles; extending rather than turning away from what works. My own son had huge communication leaps  using PECS . We still have his PECS box, full of laminated pictures, Velcroed backs, sentence strips, and category cards. If we\u2019d had and used an iPad app instead, the primary difference I can imagine for us would have been time and convenience: Access to pictures without having to print them off and get them laminated by his therapist; not sitting on the carpet for hours cutting up and applying Velcro to the back of each picture and sorting them into usable categories; and not having to desperately sort through a box trying to find just the right picture while my son tried to contain his frustration. Even the process of learning how to properly use PECS, could have been assisted by having an appropriate app; one that step-by-step helps and guides the parent through what to do and when to move onto the next learning level. As was, I had to read manuals and be carefully guided and instructed by a speech therapist when using manual PECS. I don\u2019t think it would be wise or recommended to remove the role of the therapist \u2013 you still need someone to guide you to what to use for your child and how best to use it, and to help gauge successes and consider alternatives \u2013 but you can\u2019t have a therapist with you all day everyday, whereas an iPad\u2019s app might be able to help fill that gap. We\u2019ve tried my son on computer programs to assist his learning and communication before, and he struggled hugely with coordinating the mouse to do what he wanted on the screen. The iPad and similar touch devices bypass this common coordination issue, and frankly makes the whole experience more fun for all of those involved (the simple value of \u201cfun\u201d should not be underestimated). Swiping a finger and using a finger to move between and select options, is also highly intuitive. In a practical sense though, how much sense does it make for a child to carry around an expensive (and sometimes large) device at all times, in order to communicate? The size issue to me is redundant here, because that PECS box and folder under my son\u2019s bed was hardly easy to carry around, and the time required to tidy up and reorganize the pictures as we\u2019d go through the day, was no small thing. As for the price of the device in the hands of a child, I think that\u2019s a fair concern, but outweighed by the value of them having constant access to it, and can be offset by getting older or smaller models of devices that cost less. Choosing the right apps is no small task, but again that is where having therapists who know the child and are familiar with the options, is always going to be valuable asset. On our iPad we have many apps that have been of no use to my son, and get removed the same day we download them. We also have apps that we\u2019ve used to help our son deal with an issue he\u2019s been facing or to extend his skills in a concerning area. I never just download such apps and leave him to it, I sit beside and help guide him through and discuss arising issues with him, just like I do any traditional forms of intervention (such as using social stories). An iPad can\u2019t replace all intervention types of course, but that\u2019s not the claim for those who sing the virtues of their use. Occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social skills, as well as communication skills, can all be worked on without an iPad, but an iPad could also be used to enhance and reinforce that learning. It would seem a shame to not use one more option that might be the one that helps that child make a break-through in a skill or in their communication. When I set out to write this post, I was not strongly in favour of the use of these devices, but the more research I do into their use and successes, it is hard to not become strongly pro their use, for those families that can afford them and are willing to try them. I think there is potential for abuse and misuses of iPads, but the same potential exists in all interventions improperly or ignorantly used (PECS for example has strict guides for what steps to go through and when, it is easy to go wrong and further frustrate and misteach a child using standard PECS without appropriate guidance). Perhaps that is where the danger lies: Perhaps there are too many options and too little guidance when it comes to using the iPad for communication purposes. In that case, it is just an argument for therapists to embrace and acknowledge the role and use of this technology, to help families avoid those pitfalls and to help them get the most out of it: To turn a potential problem, into a very real solution. I also think therapists should actively encourage families to problem-solve their child\u2019s challenges. In the first few years after an autism diagnosis, it makes sense for the role of therapists to be very heavy-handed, to help parents avoid common errors and to not throw their money away on untested and unproven interventions. But as the years go by the parents must be empowered and encouraged to think-through and find the solutions themselves; the presence and ability to use an iPad does \u2013 I believe \u2013 extend those options for a family. My summary then: Research, personal experience, talking to other parents and teachers, and simply thinking through the issues (for what that\u2019s worth), do lead me to see great potential benefits and few dis-benefits in iPad use, particularly as an assistive technology for communication. I can see issues with their use (such as cost, and poor selection and use of apps), but I think the key concerns can be addressed by appropriately supporting a family on how to best use an iPad in their child\u2019s life. I think we need to acknowledge that families are going to try iPads anyway, and be willing to help them make the most of it, and acknowledge further that studies so far are quite positive about the potential benefits. As always, it is essential to take into account the individual child\u2019s strengths and preferences. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/98736785@N00/4927743011/in/photolist-8vrYjp-8vv1x7-dUSc9a-8aE2JB-2wc7bZ-9NAw5D-9NDUEY-9NDgMs-9NJybd-9Nz3As-9LPBnH-9NAqQe-9NyTno-amRRFm-7E4pg8-fq9kn", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=flores+ipad", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22554812", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Van+der+Meer+ipad"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/put-down-that-ipad-pick-up-that-pecs-box/", "title": "Put down that iPad, pick up that PECS\u00a0box?"},
{"date": "June 13, 2013", "body": "Private, public, mainstream, special,  high decile, low decile : Between my son\u2019s and my own education, I\u2019ve seen all these types of schools in action. I attended a private school, then high decile public schools. My son attended a mid-decile Special School then a low decile mainstream public school. I had preconceived notions about the value of a school and its schooling based on these various categories. But what I\u2019ve learned, is this: The most important factor for the quality of education, is something not measured by any of these terms. By Forty Two on Flickr My son has high needs (as a fact, and as an education funding category). In order for him to do and be his best in a school environment, he needs access to costly resources and therapists. So what happens when the Special School environment \u2013 where he spent two years well-resourced and surrounded by experts \u2013 is no longer appropriate for his level of development? When he needs to be surrounded by peers able to communicate and socialize with him at a higher level than found in a Special School? By shifting to our local mainstream school, we lost that expert access and those special resources, and I knew that was the trade-off. It was a hard decision. Even more so because the school he would now attend was a low decile one, with a reputation too for having more than its \u201cfair share\u201d of troubled children on its roll. It\u2019s apparently known as a \u201cmagnet school,\u201d because it appears to attract higher numbers of special students. My own son comes with a dedicated pool of funding, but many special kids with less severe issues are left to access the general pool of special needs funding that each school has to make the most of. This means the school\u2019s personnel and funding is all the more stretched and stressed. Just to make things worse, the school had a less-than-stellar Education Review Office (ERO) report, and had just had the upheaval of a changed Principal. It looks like a recipe for disaster, doesn\u2019t it. But there is a factor that can help compensate for having access to less experts, and for less funding and general resources. A factor that is very hard to meaningfully access through the ERO reports. A factor too that can make the highest decile private school look like a poor alternative if it fails to get it right: The people; the Principal, and most especially, the teacher. In this way, I am empowered because of my son\u2019s special needs: I can expect and have the school allow me to meet with my son\u2019s intended teachers before deciding where to send him, and to allow me to educate his future teachers year to year. When I chose his first Special School classroom \u2013 and yes I was explicitly given the choice of classrooms \u2013 I chose the one with the teacher who had the most energy, passion and interest in my son, and warmth towards me as his mother. We made the right choice, she was the best thing that could have happened in my son\u2019s early education. When it came to a teacher for his mainstream school, I was not given the explicit choice, but I was clearly told that there were a range of teachers to choose from and much time and thought had gone into choosing the right fit for my son, based on the experience and opinion of people who had already worked with my own son and who knew the teachers there well. Similarly, looking ahead to next year, the right teacher for my son is already a talking point among those with the power and influence to make the choice; within the school they recognize the importance of matching my son to the right teacher. This level of consideration and care is immensely reassuring, and sets my son up for success. It makes the most of what resources the school has, the most important resources, the people themselves. I feel so close and so grateful to my son\u2019s teachers, that each year I find myself hugging them in tearful gratitude. They have always gone above and beyond to try to understand my son and make the most of his strengths, while recognizing and working on his challenges. He is not the easiest student \u2013 he needs sameness, he questions authority with \u201cwhy\u201d a lot, he doesn\u2019t always understand or is able to follow instructions, etc \u2013 but he does love learning and enjoys school, there is a lot of good material there for the right teacher to mold and encourage into successes (and not just academic successes). So yes, it\u2019s a low decile mainstream public school. On the surface, it ticks all the wrong boxes for my son. But what makes it work is the same thing that made his mid-decile public Special School work; it\u2019s the thing that\u2019s hard to measure and difficult to control; it\u2019s the thing that makes the difference between a threatening and closed environment versus a safe and inclusive one: He aha te mea nui o te ao? \n  He tangata. He tangata. He tangata. What is the most important thing in the world? \nIt is people. It is people.

{"date": "June 5, 2013", "body": "The idea that those involved in the lives of autistic individuals should focus on the strengths instead of the deficits of the person with autism, is a well-spread and well-known one. In this post I\u2019m going to challenge that notion, not because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to see the strengths of those with autism, but because (I believe) the strengths-based focus is ultimately exclusionary and unhelpful to broader positive goals and to what is in the best interests of autistic individuals. I know many people reading this are going to disagree at the outset; by the end of the post I hope to have made you reconsider your views, even though you may yet continue to hold those views. The first time I encountered the \u201cthink and focus on the positive\u201d approach to autism, was in my own son\u2019s early intervention therapy forms. Every time we filled out a form about where he needed help, we also had to fill out the inevitable section about what was great about him, which I found immensely irritating. I had my hands full with my son on a minute-by-minute basis, and dealing with endless government and medical bureaucracy, yet I was expected to spend time recounting information that was never used in his therapies and which I already knew as his mother: Why my son was great, what he was great at. Therapies were aimed at helping him overcome his  deficits , that is the point of the interventions. All the feel-good stuff didn\u2019t belong on government forms, it was a waste of my time and theirs, and rather belittling to me as his mother \u2013 the notion that I wouldn\u2019t appreciate his awesomeness unless someone else made me write it down every time I sought help for his challenges. Figuring out his motivators where relevant for a therapy was always worked out as part of the therapy process anyway, not once did I ever see them utilize the sections of the forms where I had to say why I loved my son despite his autism. This positive approach to autism \u2013 shifting focus from deficits to strengths \u2013 is most commonly seen in trying to fix damaging and ignorant public attitudes towards autism. In this particular realm it makes sense, as long as people don\u2019t try to universalize such strengths to every person with autism; that is just as incorrect as the basis of existing negative attitudes. Along the same lines, the positivity-shift is also an approach often used in getting people to understand and treat autistic people as individuals, and not as merely an instance of a diagnosis. Again, this makes sense, autism  is,  after all, a diagnosis. The problem is when people \u2013 including professionals \u2013 try to push this further into the very act and process of diagnosing and treating autism. A prime example is  this blog post , by someone who professionally works with autistics and would like to see a strengths-based model at the clinical level. She gives examples of replacement terms in place of deficit-focused language. As I went through her list, the problems with a strength-based model became striking. By the end of the post, I\u2019d shifted from being open-minded about the potential benefits, to being more firmly  against  such a shift. First off, such a model is highly exclusionary. A model that looks for and focuses on strengths and gifts, excludes those who function at a lower level or don\u2019t have those gifts. There are a large proportion of autistic individuals who are intellectually disabled and / or struggle daily without some off-setting \u201cgift\u201d from their autism. Any model that excludes the worst affected, is surely of limited use in a clinical context. A deficits based model will capture those across the spectrum, in the way that a strengths-based one will not. Similarly, the model perpetuates incorrect stereotypes \u2013 such as that all autistic people carry savant skills or have high IQs. Claims like this are simply incorrect and have not been shown to be the case. Saying and acting as if it is, denies reality, and further frustrates and confuses desperate parents, and places high expectations on autistics that many cannot and will not be able to live up to. Surely it would make more sense to focus on the individual with autism as an individual, rather than creating yet more difficult and nuanced criteria that they must meet before they can be considered \u201ctruly\u201d autistic..? Furthermore, the point of a diagnosis is to identify where an individual requires help. Shifting to a strengths-based model seems to overlook this central function of diagnosis: If someone is doing just fine and exhibits a wide range of strengths rather than deficits, why does it make sense for governments and insurers to shell out millions to help them and their carers and families? We\u2019re already in a battle to make these governing bodies appreciate the difficulties and be willing to help us address them. You may reply that the point of such a model is to get a more rounded picture of the entire person. But since when has \u201ccapturing the entire person\u201d been the point or function of a diagnosis? It\u2019s meant to identify an aspect of the wider person, the aspect that needs assistance. If we start placing all the strengths and other aspects of a person into a\u00a0 diagnosis, we turn a diagnosis into someone closer to an identity, which is not necessarily (and I would argue, not generally) healthy, helpful, or accurate. In fact it goes towards a notion that needs to be widely fought in my opinion: The notion that autism somehow defines the entire person (see  a previous post of mine  of the individuality of autistics). There is a something further than concerns me here, which I think goes little appreciated too: When we redesign language (and criteria) to be more upbeat, positive, and strengths-based, I see the furthering of a very concerning attitude that is already prevalent in wider society; the attitude that mental conditions are not real conditions, they\u2019re just bad personalities, poor choices, or excuses for everything from bad behaviour to poor parenting. If we say that autism is really quite \u201cOK\u201d (or whatever positive term you want), we would seem to be reinforcing the all-too-common view that it\u2019s just a condition in the minds of un-accepting and attention-demanding parents, and of money-hungry psychiatrists who like inventing conditions so they and \u201cBig Pharma\u201d can get their pay check for helping children who have nothing particularly \u201cwrong\u201d with them. I don\u2019t need autism clinicians to have a positive view of autism, because their job is to help what my son  struggles  with, not to address his entire personality. They don\u2019t need to know every nuance of what he\u2019s good at, or why he is awesome, that\u2019s  my  job at his mother, and I know those things so intimately and expansively that no list could ever hope to capture my son, and any list that sets out to do so will always fail. When it comes to working with one-on-one therapists, it may seem important that they focus on the strengths and not just the deficits since they are dealing with an entire child. But every therapist who has ever worked with my son, has first dealt with him with me right there, and every single time I have seen evidence that they don\u2019t look at him and see \u201cautism,\u201d they look at him and see a person, just like I do. They find things to laugh along with, they enjoy and revel in his triumphs, they are distraught when he is hurt or distressed; they are human, dealing with a human. No more do they than I need someone telling us how awesome this kid is and what he\u2019s good at; we see it everyday. Those who  don\u2019t or choose not to , are unlikely to be made better people or better therapists because you changed a few words on a list. (After all, therapists are not the ill-informed and untrained public, with no personal interaction with \u201creal life\u201d autistic people, they know \u2013 or should know \u2013 that a diagnosis does not define an entire person.) Do I think language matters? Yes. Do I think people should be more aware of the complexities and variety of autistic individuals? Yes. Do I think these ends are served by changing diagnostic lists and forcing already stressed and exhausted parents to fill out sections in every form about how great their child is? No, I do not. Nor do I think that the outcomes of changing language around autism to a strengths-based one, is always or necessarily helpful, accurate, or beneficial to the individuals affected. I know I won\u2019t have changed many minds with this post, and believe me when I say that I understand why, I really do (but go ahead and tell me in the comments anyway, that\u2019s fine, I am open to having my own mind changed). I also know that the people promoting this strengths-based approach have their hearts in the right place. I\u2019m just concerned that the down-sides of such an approach don\u2019t get much consideration, and I wanted to put forward some of the very-real concerns. When we make a change for what is perceived to be the better \u2013 when we choose different words, different focuses, different attitudes \u2013 it makes sense to examine whether they really are a change for the better for the people most affected by the term at issue in the first place. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20130424020529/http://taniaannmarshall.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/label-this-and-say-what-building-a-strengths-based-descriptive-model-for-individuals-with-autism/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/pitfalls-of-a-strengths-based-model-for-autism/", "title": "Pitfalls of a Strengths-Based Model for\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "June 20, 2013", "body": "My son does not enjoy reading fiction, which is hardly surprising to me, considering his autism. He struggles to understand social interaction and it\u2019s only in the last couple of years that he\u2019s started exhibiting and enjoying his imagination; both social interaction and imagination feature prominently in fiction. Getting him to read the fiction books that get sent home for homework, is hard work, getting him to read the occasional non-fiction ones that turn up is a lot easier. By Eunice, via Flickr I was generally OK with his strong preference for non-fiction since I figured he\u2019d learn more from it. I was aware though that the fact he found fiction more challenging was itself a good reason to press him to continue with it; that it was a way he could perhaps learn more about people\u2019s interactions and other less-familiar topics. But now, thanks to a couple of very recent studies out of Canada, I have more concrete and highly relevant reasons to push him to engage with fiction, and I think they are reasons worth sharing. The two studies used a group of 100 university students, but  the researchers consider the benefits they found would apply to those both younger and older , and I think that is a fair assumption. The  first study  replicated previous findings that cognitive empathy is higher among regular readers of fiction; in particular, it found that there are significant boosts in empathy for those who are closed to experience and not particularly curious. Though it is not true of all autistic children, it is true for a significant portion (including my son, particularly when he was more severely autistic) that they are \u201cclosed off\u201d and generally anxious about the world and change, preferring the familiar and predictable where-ever possible. It is also true that autistic individuals frequently struggle with cognitive empathy. So on both these points \u2013 the tendency to be closed off and the need to develop cognitive empathy \u2013 there are good reasons to encourage my son to engage with fiction according to this first study. My son has had huge growth in cognitive empathy and his interest in the world over the past few years regardless, but if reading fiction will contribute to this growth, then all the better. The  second study  found that \u201c [a]fter you read a piece of literature, it seems your discomfort with ambiguity lowers, and your need for order lowers. \u201d This also apparently bodes well for decision-making abilities. Again, it is a common feature of autism to struggle with situations that are ambiguous and out-of-routine, both being areas that my own son still struggles with. That\u2019s a few more good reasons to encourage him to read fiction, both because he has autism, and frankly just because he is a human being \u2013 we all could benefit from such outcomes of reading fiction. Neither study or the article specifically mention autism, but as a mother steeped in autism literature on a daily basis, I couldn\u2019t help but see the links. The broader message about the benefits of fiction for everyone, is a good take-home message, and gives me one more excuse to now go bury myself in one of the fantasy books piled on the side-table.

{"date": "June 26, 2013", "body": "Not long after my son\u2019s autism diagnosis, I found myself attending a meeting in a WINZ office (that\u2019s the benefits arm of the Government, for the non-New Zealanders). I had the paper-work from my son\u2019s Developmental Pediatrician, confirming that I as his parent met the requirements to receive an ongoing disability payment that was meant to help me afford all those extra expenses that come with raising a high needs child. I knew that was about $40 a week, but I was positive there would be other benefits or supplements that would help me care for my son. By Natasha Mileshina, via Flickr I had quit a part-time lecturing position at a local university, to be home full-time with my boy after the diagnosis was confirmed, so I could put all my effort into his therapies and provide him with the intensive and consistent level of care that he required. I\u2019d never left him with a babysitter, I\u2019d always shared the care between my husband and I, as I\u2019d learned early on that my son\u2019s communication and behavioral difficulties meant other people couldn\u2019t understand or cope with him. So I sat at that WINZ meeting knowing there were benefits for the unemployed and benefits for single mums, I had no doubt there would be some sort of benefit or assistance for a mother who couldn\u2019t work because she had charge of her disabled son. I was wrong. At first I didn\u2019t believe the WINZ worker when she said there would be no more than $40-something a week available to me. I told her to go make sure. But no, I qualified for no other financial supports. I couldn\u2019t qualify for an unemployment benefit because I wasn\u2019t actively looking for work, and I lived with my husband so I wasn\u2019t a single mum. We were reduced to living off my husband\u2019s income, and what little I could bring in from working one evening a week as a tutor. We earned such a little amount between us that we did get a yearly lump-sum payment under the Working For Families scheme, but there were no actual benefits directed at parents who had had to quit their job to become full-time carers for their disabled child. How is it that what I was doing, was worth nothing? I tried not to get too bitter about it, and we got on with life. We lived in a cold mouldy home for years with our son, unable to afford anything better. My health suffered badly over the years, both physically and mentally. I was isolated, under-supported, and not getting enough money to live well or to do the best by my son, but I did the very best that I could. But not everyone accepted that this was fair in our society. At the time, I was unaware of the families going to court, fighting to get the Government to pay them for the care of their disabled children: A Government that would pay total strangers to do the work, but refused to pay family members to do the exact same work for the same people, even when the family members were the best or only suitable carer available. One of those fighters is Margaret Spencer, an elderly woman who is the full-time carer of her 44 year-old son Paul who has Down syndrome. Her case is still going through the courts, but the possible outcome for her seeking financial recognition or her work and those in similar positions, has been hampered by the current Government with their recent legislation (I won\u2019t recap all the details of that legislation, you can learn more about it from  my previous post ). The reason I find myself writing about this topic again, and felt I had to share my own story above, was because of this particular quote from someone who works for the Ministry of Health, in relation to Margaret\u2019s case. The quote was in an internal email, clearly not intended for public eyes, but shared in the court via Margaret\u2019s lawyer: \u201c She really laid the sympathy vote on, right on, dragging poor Paul around like a tatty teddy bear, telling the committee what a martyr she was .\u201d Here\u2019s the position that us carers are in then: We either quietly work without financial recognition or assistance, or we dare to speak up about it and share our stories whereby we are labelled \u201cmartyrs\u201d in a derogatory and condescending manner.\u00a0 The very people who are meant to be helping us to help our children, apparently think that we should shut up and sit down and not fight for our rights (and this  is  a matter of legal rights \u2013 not a matter of simply asking for a hand-out \u2013  as made clear in the earlier court cases in regards to discrimination ). This is to say nothing of the reference to Paul as a \u201ctatty teddy bear.\u201d Would we be OK with other adults being referred to as inanimate, worn-out property of another human being? Why was it considered OK to do this to a disabled adult? Whatever you may think of the case and the money at issue, be very clear on this: What parents of disabled children do, is more valuable to this society and to their children, than the huge number of other situations our government thinks worthy of regular sizable allowances. If you don\u2019t think we deserve a living wage, then be very clear about the consequences for these families; you are only shifting the financial and health burden further down the line, and making it a lot worse for all involved. Also then have enough integrity to say that neither should a huge number of other situations (many of which are actually voluntary situations) receive financial support from the Government. The way things currently stand, is indefensible, and the heartless quote from that Ministry of Health worker helps me see that the problem is not just one of money: it is one of attitudes. We deserve respect. We deserve recognition. Asking for these things does not mean we see ourselves or want others to see us as martyrs, we just want people to understand the huge value and worth of what we do every single day, into our elderly years when everyone else\u2019s children are off starting their own families, and most elderly are cared for by their children instead of still being the primary carer of those children. We shouldn\u2019t have to argue this before courts, it should be obvious. My own family is becoming less impacted by my son\u2019s autism as the years go by, so years from now I hope to be in a situation that will allow me the time and money to be able to help people like Margaret fight these injustices. For now, all I can offer her and others in her situation, is my understanding and support, which is more than she appears to have received from those best positioned to make her and her son\u2019s life better. So thank you Margaret, you speak for thousands of others, and the country is listening. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/78199439@N00/1457832053/in/photolist-3dPLFp-dgTwWX-p3Lxp-ebHaKC-65SRC3-F1jTJ-5SzwoW-Bd3Gs-4PMbaT-bKTqui-8TZopq-5WcVyV-513Pvg-Muyfs-9BeHXq-7mKvyR-9zyF8W-2NZT1X-63p3Zx-jEfdr-5akSUP-7SiFUf-bmNGFw-aMme9F-6afcPD-6BiyF9-5DqzBY-xmpje-6fq2C6-7SiBLd-68v8Ae-9W9aom-55Ywhk-5HcYRr-bSyrsR-4U8S9Z-9Tf3AE-6mPrUi-4CTbhL-3P3tP-56cGGi-6uYeDf-5Qosfm-4siD7u-bkCa6-dBXKJB-9ftG4q-6pyGLQ-5HQH4e-5cBquY-7fkFKV", "http://t.co/o719VTgXh1"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/of-tatty-teddy-bears-and-martyrs/", "title": "Of Tatty Teddy Bears and\u00a0Martyrs."},
{"date": "November 8, 2013", "body": "I\u2019m going to start with a deceptively simple statement: Good parenting can lessen the severity of autism. If I just stop now, I\u2019ll have left you with the groundwork for a huge number of the misconceptions I see almost everyday when I deal with other people\u2019s attitudes towards what causes and cures autism, so I better explain myself. From Andy Magee, via Flickr I said good parenting \u201ccan,\u201d not  will , lessen the severity of autism. Any intervention to help a child cope with the challenges autism brings to their life, must always necessarily involve advising and training the parent: If the parent is not understanding and committed to the intervention, it will not be applied consistently or appropriately in that child\u2019s life. Furthermore, teaching a parent to better understand autism and how autism impacts on their child, will help them be the parent that specific child needs, and often make them a more patient, aware, responsive and hopeful parent. For example, understanding how to deal with a child\u2019s anxiety, sensory issues, or how to advance their social skills \u2013 and being aware in the first place that the child is struggling with these specific challenges \u2013 inevitably helps you be a more effective (and empathetic) parent. The problem is that autism\u2019s severity and prognosis varies hugely; a good parent or a bad parent is not a predictive determinant for that child\u2019s eventual outcomes in life. It can help, and in itself good knowledgeable parenting is always best, but you cannot look at an autistic child\u2019s severity and use that as evidence of the parenting the child has received. But this is what we do with other (non-autistic) children all the time in society. We meet a rude, violent (etc) child, and we can legitimately look to the parent as a major source to explain and address the behaviour, and parenting interventions usually do provide great improvements for your average troubled child. So the rude, violent (etc) autistic child is similarly often blamed on poor parenting. This view is made a whole lot worse by families like mine: Our son\u2019s autism severity has dropped away noticeably. Extended family members and friends know that we worked very hard on adapting our parenting to help our son, so they reach the conclusion that the good parenting was key and the other more severely autistic children also just need better parents. It\u2019s an almost irrefutable claim, because the child\u2019s behaviour itself is taken as evidence that not enough is being done, and parenting is done mostly behind closed doors so there can always be speculation about what the parents must be doing wrong when they can\u2019t be seen. (In turn, people will sometimes reach the conclusion that poor parenting must have caused the autism in the first place, since good parenting can fix it.) This is part of why I cringe now when people tell me that I should  personally  be proud of how well my son is doing, or that I should write books to tell every other autism parent what they should be doing too. (I\u2019ve even had people proudly inform me that they publicly told off other parents of a misbehaving autistic child by arguing that they knew someone else (me) who had learnt to control their autistic child by parenting them \u201cproperly.\u201d) As always, the facts are far more complicated than that. We don\u2019t know which therapists, which therapies, which teachers, which parenting decisions, which genetic determinants, which individual factors (such as intelligence), which environmental inputs, all played what part towards his current outcome. Along the same lines, neither do we know if he\u2019d had been even  better off  than he is now if we\u2019d just done something differently along the way. Maybe we\u2019ve actually screwed it up; that thought used to haunt me in the early years before I learnt to just focus on doing the very best I can right now without torturing myself over the endless \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d of parenting past. I will say though that we have a pretty good idea of what worked well and why, and I have always tried to track new interventions alongside severity scores to give me a sense of how things are progressing. But I am fully aware that my son does not live in a controlled environment where all other factors remain static. Scientific studies attempt to isolate what works for whom and why and how, but autism is such a broad and diverse grouping still that it can make it hard to successfully generalise from those studies too. I feel that those sorts of studies these days are pointing in directions of future needed research at this point, rather than answers; until we better understand the types, causes and related prognoses of autism, it\u2019s hard to see how helpful that information will be. I also believe it\u2019s vital to take into account the entirety of the child \u2013 their personality co-morbities, etc \u2013 in order to figure out what will help them. Parents are just doing their best with the information they are provided by the current experts in the field. Do parents get mislead, confused, and make poor choices? Yes, but that is true of all parents in all societies; autism parents are not somehow infallible super-beings. We\u2019re just people, with all our own neuroses and challenges that we\u2019re also trying to deal with, but there is no doubt in my experience that we are held to a much higher standard than average parents. We are under constant scrutiny by the media, medical professionals, adult autism advocates, and society in general; that\u2019s a lot of pressure when you\u2019re going through a learning process about bringing up children and about autism. We do not leap perfectly formed into our roles as autism parents, we evolve into them over time and through experience. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do appreciate when people praise me for my parenting, but I do not appreciate when they follow it up with attacks on parents of more challenged children. I also feel that focusing so much on the impact of parenting, detracts from the huge effort of all those other professionals in the child\u2019s life and of course the child themself. Which all brings me back to where I started: Good parenting can lessen the severity of autism. It is important, it is valuable, but the best parenting course in the world could never promise to parent the autism away. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/84272941@N00/5592404719/in/photolist-9wbx62-azJMFu-edSAoL-azJM2L-eYrB55-99Gvbx-9zhJGd-dk72vp-9UrgZY-9JAWG4-85fPba-d7thHq-bXkP6s-eDshEq-drRaKe-83hN6U-a8ooc7-e1G66d-a86bsP-927Bgi-gC6ySc-85iVYq-85fNg6-cfrq2b-8fee63-bAdBEA-hhY6YS-cBMJaE-bXdiTu-bXiiWL-7LGsgF-85fSrt-akp5KN-8dSKR6-bp5JUu-azavWa-fgxM91-9sNZQF-aBPtAB-85fNoc-85iWGC-boTARr-aP8p5B-7GaWqQ-9ZJRnV-9urGhw-beaNAe-c3F5Y7-8Z75bQ-dYWhck-9LdnRL"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/parenting-the-autism-away/", "title": "Parenting the Autism\u00a0Away\u2026"},
{"date": "November 16, 2013", "body": "Today my son and I have decided to do a blog post together, about autism. This has come from recent discussions on what blogging is and what I blog about (originating from a \u00a0discussion about his teacher\u2019s school blog). I figured it\u2019s also a good way for me to gauge where his perceptions on autism currently lie, as well as to share my son with you. This is the result (italics are my questions): What do you want to say about autism? Autism can sometimes be better and sometimes be worse. What do you mean? Because you can know more stuff, and sometimes you don\u2019t know what to do. Like what? Extremely hard maths problems. But is that because of autism? I think, I infer. Do you like having autism? Yes, sometimes I like it, sometimes I don\u2019t. Autism can be sometimes good for your brain to think, and sometimes you can make a lot of mistakes with your brain, sometimes. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say about what it\u2019s like having autism or what you think of autism? Autism is sometimes cool and sometimes not cool. I wish we had more so I could learn all about autism. It can sometimes be misunderstanding\u2026 I was sometimes talking you don\u2019t understand and sometimes talking you do understand, mostly yes, and least no. [He\u2019s wriggling and flicking his hands.]  What are you doing there? When I flick, when I jump up and down on my bum bum, and sometimes I wiggle my legs, mostly the fingers and leastly the hands. And why do you do that? Because that\u2019s what I do when I\u2019m very happy or excited, about half yes and about half no. What do you mean \u201chalf yes and half no\u201d? Sometimes I can just smile and sometimes I do this. Do other people do that when they\u2019re happy? I don\u2019t know, do you know? When I\u2019m happy do I flick my hands about? No. Sometimes, about, you should only do that, people with autism should slow down with about a quarter to none\u2026 so sometimes you can flick, about the maximum you can do it is a quarter of the time, and the minimum is none of the time. Why can\u2019t you just do it all the time when you\u2019re happy? Because it can ruin the chair or the couch. Any other reason? Because it can be annoying for autism people, but especially without autism, or for humans. Why do they find it annoying? Because it can be just not understand what they want, the parent doesn\u2019t know what they want. So what\u2019s a good way to let parents know what you want then? Very very happy. What are your favourite things? About the human bodies and space, space about 1% more and the human body 1% less or the space more or a weeny tiny bit more. And what do you like the least, what don\u2019t you like? I don\u2019t like [brother] going to my room. Going upstairs, sometimes a bit less, and [brother] going to my room 1% more\u2026 no, it\u2019s not 1% more, it\u2019s about 40% to 60% more or a weeny tiny tiny bit more. If [brother] destroys my stuff, I\u2019ll be very very angry or sad. And what would would you do if you were very angry or sad? Tell my Mum and ask me to buy a new thing, if she says no I\u2019ll still be very very very very angry or sad, if she says yes I\u2019ll get very very happy or excited.

{"date": "November 13, 2013", "body": "\u201cAutism Speaks.\u201d Such an ironic name, considering the number of autistics and their families who wish Autism Speaks would shut up. I had concerns about Autism Speaks before, but I have concerns about a lot of autism charities. I often find these charities too dedicated to a singular view of autism and too ready to dismiss and exclude the types of autism that don\u2019t fit their message. That stands true for some self-advocate autistic groups as much as it does for groups advocating for the worst affected by autism; I wish both extremes would just be more open and honest about the varieties in experiences and needs of autistics and their families. I do think it is possible to have a strong message about the realities and needs around autism without denying its diversity, in fact I think respecting and recognising diversity is in the interests of everyone on this planet, just perhaps even more so for groups with more obvious differences in society. But then an Autism Speaks co-founder  recently released a statement \u00a0about autism through the Autism Speaks website, and it reads like a confirmation of all the worst things I have ever heard about this charity, and upholds some very damaging and distorting views on autism, to the point that I think the statement does damage to families and children like mine. So I want to address it from my own little corner of the world, on my own little blog, to speak for myself and my son against Autism Speaks. By Josie Lynn Richards, via Flickr The message we get about autism from the statement is one of utter crisis. Autism is first compared to crises of millions of children going missing or getting gravely ill, both types of events that are objectively terrible and deeply tragic. Just like autism\u2026 right? Apparently my family isn\u2019t living because of my son\u2019s autism; we\u2019re breathing and eating and maybe sleeping, but we\u2019re only existing, not  living . I\u2019m apparently living moment-to-moment in despair and fear about my son. And apparently raising a son like mine will cost 2.3 million $US (apparently there\u2019s no need to either explain where that figure comes from or how it compares to the costs of raising anyone else\u2019s son). Emergency;\u00a0urgency; monumental health crisis. WON\u2019T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN! Oh the irony that the writer asks us to consider what message we are sending, when the message she is sending is just so damaging. She makes it abundantly clear she is talking about \u201cautism.\u201d \u201cThis is autism\u201d she says a number of times. She throws in the occasional \u201cmaybe\u201d and the occasional \u201cmost,\u201d but almost always she talks about autism as a singularly horrible event. The numbers she uses to scare the public include the whole spectrum from the most severe to the most mild, yet clearly her message of doom, gloom and despair applies to only ever a proportion of the autistic people across America. How hard would it have been to say \u201csevere autism\u201d when that is what she\u2019s talking about, or some other \u2013 any other \u2013 way to indicate that what she is talking about is a proportion of the autistic population rather than autism itself? Not only that, but even the most severely affected children are not automatically a cause of \u00a0utter despair; it\u2019s damn hard work, I know I\u2019ve been there. And that\u2019s another point: Many of our children do not remain in the same severe state as they start out, but the way the Autism Speaks message is packaged clearly makes autism out to be very much like a life-sentence of horror. Yes the provision of adequate services and supports can and does help that progression and makes autism easier to live with, yes I appreciate that Autism Speaks sees itself here as advocating for the proportion most in need. But no, I do not think the only way to package that message requires lumping all autistics together in this way, labeling them as some sort of horror for both families and societies, and generally scaring the living heck out of any newly diagnosed family. I think a message of what wonders and fantastic outcomes can be achieved with good attitudes and supports towards autistic people, would have been a far more effective and accurate message. Highlighting studies that evidence the benefits of early and appropriate interventions, and the difference it makes to have a more inclusive educational system and society, is a good approach too. These messages would have given hope and motivation, rather than the better-off-dead undertones that come through their existing approach. As it stands, their approach divides and upsets the autism community, rather than unites and reflects their lived realities. I don\u2019t see how that is a good thing. At the end of the day, Autism Speaks is free to package their message as they see fit, and if they think packaging autism as a devastating crisis is the best approach then I suppose we must disagree on what is in the best interests of autistic individuals and their families. I\u2019m sure Autism Speaks provides some lovely and useful services and advocates well for autism families on occasion, but to see such a divisive and deeply negative view-point being proclaimed on their own website by a co-founder, says to me that there is something wrong with the way that organisation views the very people it sets out to speak for. Maybe Autism Speaks should stop speaking for a bit, and listen to what the rest of the autism community has to say too: \n \u201c Autism Speaks does not speak for my son. \u201d Mostly True Stuff. \n \u201c No more \u2013 a letter to Suzanne Wright .\u201d A Diary of a Mum. \n \u201c This is not our autism. \u201d Reinventing Mommy. \n \u201c Autism Speaks does not speak for us \u2013 THIS is autism. \u201d Living on the Spectrum. \n \u201c A mouse that roars \u2013 standing in defiance of Autism Speaks .\u201d The Autism Wars. \n \u201c Dear Ms Wright, Autism Speaks, and any others out there who may read this.. .\u201d Mama\u2019s Turn Now. \n \u201c My son is not lost .\u201d Dmitry Laughs. \n \u201c Autism Speaks is not and has never been listening, despite their slogan .\u201d Autism From A Father\u2019s Point of View. \n \u201c A view of Autism Speaks from afar .\u201d The Tumultuous Truth. \n \u201c @AutismSpeaks does not speak for this family. \u201d Yeah.

{"date": "November 17, 2013", "body": "What if you believed your teacher at school was trying to make you forget how to speak? What if when you tried to resist their efforts, you were lectured about diversity and acceptance? Confused? So was my son, so was I, so was his teacher, but I finally cracked what was happening and found a way to fix it. By Antonio Pavon, via Flickr We live in a country where the native language is not the one we speak as a family. Most people here can and do speak English, and it is the dominant language in terms of usage; but Maori is the native language and one of our official languages, and children are exposed to Maori from their earliest years. This language exposure is part of the school curriculum. Furthermore, my son\u2019s school is a highly multicultural one, where Mandarin, Hindi, Maori, Samoan and many other languages are children\u2019s first languages instead of English. Within this multilingual environment, my son is constantly exposed to people who cannot speak English well, and where people often turn to speaking in their own native tongue. Not only does this confuse my son at the simple level of not being able to understand some of his peers, it turns out it has also created the premise for him to fear and resist other languages altogether. But my son\u2019s fear of other languages does not stem from non-acceptance or resistance to diversity and difference; he is not being racist or elitist or a bigot. I\u2019ve put up with people suspecting his home environment is anti other languages or other cultures, which is very far from the truth; I actively promote empathy and positivity towards difference within our home. I\u2019ve also told him that I have been taught three other languages, and his own extended family can speak other languages. Yet as teachers and parents we weren\u2019t able to break through my son\u2019s seemingly irrational fear (and even hatred) of other languages, all our talk about difference being OK and not a threat to him got us nowhere. But tonight I finally got it and found the solution. The problem was my son was working with this piece of information: People who can speak more than one language, speak English poorly (which will typically be true of young children adapting to a new second language). Add to that his own experience that English is the first language people speak, and he reached this conclusion: Learning more than one language will make you speak English worse, or more generically as he understood it, learning more than one language will make you worse at your first language. I only started to figure this mess out when he argued strongly against my claim that learning a second language would make you better at the first (while I tried to convince him of the many benefits and advantages of learning other languages). He was adamant that it would make him worse at English; he didn\u2019t want to speak, hear, sing, or otherwise interact with other languages because it would make his own English worse. (Considering how hard my son had to work to even get and use the spoken language in the first place, and how hard it can still be for him to use his own language, I can easily see how he may be that much more sensitive to anything that might be a threat to his current speech and comprehension.) Once I knew the problem, I was able to find a way to redirect his thinking, to correct his premises. I created pictures of people who started off speaking various languages, and used a chart to illustrate each of them learning a new language (and then a third language). I used percentages to represent how well they used and understood each language they knew or learnt (he loves percentages). In this way I was able to illustrate that getting a new language doesn\u2019t impact on the percentage of how well you understood a previous language (except in as far as it may improve that initial language usage). I was also able to show that just because someone might not be very good at a second language doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not completely fluent in a first language. I used a stick-figure to represent him and his future language proficiencies\u00a0(letting him choose what language he might choose to learn one day; he went with Spanish then French). I showed how he might only be 80% good at one of those other languages, he\u2019d still be 100% good at English (for example). Similarly I got him to tell me the name and languages of a child in his class that he doesn\u2019t understand (and therefore finds a bit threatening). I showed how just because the other person doesn\u2019t speak English well as a second language, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not great at the first language. I used cross-over lines to show how someone speaking Mandarin to his school friend would find his school friend perfectly fluent. After all this \u2013 and a few more questions and examples \u2013 he simply, clearly and happily said to me: \u201cI learned it.\u201d He understood. He got it. He spent the next half hour writing down ridiculously high percentages of how good his own English could get if he learns other languages, and playing around with the figures. When he gets back to school this week, I\u2019m looking forward to explaining the breakthrough with his teacher. I think understanding the problem (and its solution) sheds light on the way my son\u2019s mind works, and on why it\u2019s just so important to pursue an understanding of how he\u2019s seeing the world instead of presuming he approaches things like every other child. You can\u2019t take things for granted with my son, his minds works in interesting ways that both fascinate and confuse me, but I constantly endeavor to keep an open mind to how he views and is experiencing the world. In doing so, I can help others do the same for him. It\u2019s a good reminder too that if the solution you\u2019re trying to use over and over with a child isn\u2019t working, then don\u2019t presume the problem is with the child: Consider that the stumbling block lies in how we understand the problem in the first place, and that the first place to start to better understand the problem, is by letting the child find their own voice; in whatever manner or language that voice may take. We need not fear those other voices; just like learning a new language, those voices may even enhance the strength of our own. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/11525798@N00/4628293241/in/photolist-83Zdkk-9GDuVe-8xyi94-asRw61-c8wU1j-9t78qF-9GDmtx-874kCc-9sDiNF-9iHT22-9GGpvU-9GDmd6-9YQ7LA-9GDsD4-asPu2n-9wsrZ6-ao1ZHm-9ed5Cd-8TLoPS-9GGd2C-9GDyE8-dMbW6N-9UhNiv-8vwqnz-dFhUhB-b9jFAF-f3eYxj-bFB4VX-9GGmty-b936Un-9HmH8D-cN5YUY-abxJfN-9ZVycx-ap6hDe"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/11/17/fear-of-new-languages/", "title": "Fear of New\u00a0Languages."},
{"date": "October 19, 2013", "body": "I recently came into possession of two children\u2019s books that are so delightful on so many levels, that I think they\u2019re worth sharing. They are written by Bec Oakley (who is the well-respected author of the \u201c Snagglebox\u201d blog ). Both books are written in rhyme, from the perspective of an autistic child called Jake, and have such lovely messages of inclusion and understanding that they managed to bring me to tears. I\u2019m not sure what an official age range would be for these books, but as a mother of a three year-old and eight year-old, I consider the books worth sharing from preschool age to all the way up through the primary school years. I think older children could benefit from the messages of inclusiveness too. \u201cJake Learns the Tooth\u201d is about Jake coming to terms with the losing of his first tooth. He misunderstands his father\u2019s comment about the tooth fairy, and various comments made by other people throughout the book; Jake takes their comments very literally which creates anxiety (and some amusement at their literalness). Other children with differences \u2013 such as using wheelchairs and being hearing impaired \u2013 get a mention in the story, but the story doesn\u2019t turn on their differences which is part of the beauty of this book; they are just part of Jake\u2019s diverse world. By the end, Jake loses his tooth and has a happier outlook and a new friend; what ending could be better? My son currently has a wiggly tooth that he\u2019d been told by the dentist to wiggle everyday; while he was reading the book he laughed and kept wiggling that stubborn tooth, which was fantastic. \u201cJake Rides the Rollercoaster\u201d has Jake facing his love, intense interest, and ultimately fear of rollercoasters. The story covers how different people have different fears and preferences, and how change and sensory overload can impact on people. It shows how knowledge and giving things a go can help you face your fears, and how accommodating difference can help others to join in. Bec even manages to slip in some lovely instances of stimming as an alternative to how children usually experience and show their emotions, which allows autistic children to be drawn into the story, while encouraging non-autistic children to be more open-minded and accepting of these differences. As if all those points weren\u2019t endearing enough, the pictures throughout have been drawn by children in Australia, and the money from the book sales go to support the Australia charity \u201cTherapy Focus\u201d which has a strong interest in promoting inclusion. You can find out more about  Therapy Focus here , and buy the books together or separately through the same website,  on this page . The cost is very reasonable, at $Aus 14.95 for one, or $Aus 24.95 for both. I was so taken with the many beauties of the books, that I have since ordered another set, to gift to my son\u2019s primary school. When I told his teacher the books I was going to gift, she said she\u2019d like to share them around the classrooms for discussion too, not least of all because they have a number of autistic children throughout the school. In ordering the books I noticed the website only had an Australia postal option. I had to message them to ask for a New Zealand postal option, they replied quickly and were very happy to create the option for me. So if you want to buy the books too and you\u2019re outside of Australia, don\u2019t hesitate to  contact them directly through the website  to arrange a postal alternative. They tell me they are working on creating an international option as standard, so if you\u2019re reading this post a few months from the date of me publishing it, that option may already exist (let me know if it does so I can update the post). I really can\u2019t recommend these books highly enough; for the writing, the pictures, the message and the ability to donate to a worthy charity in the process.

{"date": "October 16, 2013", "body": "You may have noticed I haven\u2019t posted in a while. I want to explain why, and it goes to an issue that has been all too current in the media in the past couple of months: The importance of caring for the carer. Carers of highly dependent people are often expected to fit a very particular mold: That of a person who is tireless, highly capable, and selfless. In being all those things, it then makes sense that we are meant to be silent too, since we are not the most important people in our own lives and we spend most of everyday dedicated to someone else\u2019s well-being. When we do speak up we are meant to only talk of the person we care for and their needs. By gaspi *yg, via Flickr In the world I experience, I see carers treated like shadows of the person they care for; the dependent person must always come first. The problem is, the longer you live in someone else\u2019s shadow \u2013 at their beck and call and existing largely in relation to them and their needs \u2013 the more you become a mere shadow of yourself too. Your own mental, physical and emotional well-being can become strained in the way anyone\u2019s can, but because we have dependents we can\u2019t just sleep at night or go on a holiday to recharge. There is no end of the tunnel when you know your child (for example) will eventually be old enough to care for themselves. You can\u2019t take the milestones of starting school or moving out of home as guidelines for when you\u2019ll get to rediscover and care for yourself; it\u2019s like you\u2019re on hold, indefinitely. I\u2019ve been lucky, of sorts, in that my autistic son has moved from being so violent, non-verbal, and very limited in his social and physical skills, to being the increasingly competent (and amazingly complex) child I have today. (Though it\u2019s hard to call that \u201cluck\u201d when so many years of effort from him and I went into the transition, still I think there is some \u201cluck\u201d to the matter because I know full well that many families do the same as we have (and more) but don\u2019t get the outcomes we have had. There are no prognosis promises in the autism world.) So now that I (and him) have come so far that I\u2019m no longer in such an intense minute-to-minute carer role, I find myself suffering what feels like a highly indulgent crisis of self. I look back over everything that has happened and changed since my son\u2019s initial autism diagnosis, and I feel like I completely lost myself along the way. I feel like I\u2019m walking in the shoes of someone else, because they don\u2019t fit me anymore. I seem to have lost the ability to experience joy in personal self-directed activities such as art and computer games and even just the prestige of holding a job. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m depressed per se, rather that I don\u2019t know who I am anymore or even what I want to be. I keep adding tasks and roles to my life in the hope one of them will feel right and make me feel fulfilled, and conversely letting go of various other commitments in the thought that maybe they\u2019re what\u2019s making me feel so misdirected, but it\u2019s not working so far. Ultimately I keep coming back to growing my knowledge about and dedication to my sons (and to autism), because that is something I know has given me purpose and is useful still, but how much of that is still just me living through and in shadows, how much of that is just hiding from whatever is causing this sense of loss and confusion? I think part of this picture is my diagnosis at the start of the year of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). My IBS was caused by a few too many bouts of severe gastroenteritis late last year. At the risk of giving you too much information, I was living with daily and at times explosive diarrhea (even severe tummy pain), for months after the gastro, until the diagnosis of IBS and accompanying major diet changes settled my digestive system down to something closer to normal (though I still take two pills each day to help regulate and control my symptoms). Whenever I deviate from the highly restrictive diet I am on, my symptoms return. There are not many foods I can now eat, and those I do give me little pleasure. The foods I can eat that I like, have to be had in small amounts, few and far between. I have lost much weight, and people say how much healthier I look now because of that weight loss, but it\u2019s been miserable. One of the reasons I think my IBS is quite key to my current crisis of self, is because I spent many of the past years telling myself one day my husband and I could again indulge in eating out at fine restaurants which we so used to enjoy together, and maybe we could even travel and go overseas one day \u2013 that we could spend time together as a couple doing these enjoyable things once the high dependence of our children was more under control. That was one of my lights at the end of the tunnel, and with my son\u2019s improvements with his autism, it finally seemed possible. But it\u2019s too late now; there are some foods and meals I will never experience at all, and travelling or eating out have become complex (or even impossible) tasks because of my current state of health and dietary restrictions. All those times I refused to get in babysitters or to accept respite care or to put my son through the stress of holidays \u2013 all because I considered it to be in his best interests \u2013 and now the chances to do those things I hoped to return to, are gone. It sounds so petty though, doesn\u2019t it? Some people are fed through tubes, and some can\u2019t even afford fine restaurant food, and some have diabetes or other conditions causing life-long dietary restrictions, and here I am complaining about my newly arrived IBS. I keep telling myself to harden up, get over it, but there are only so many years you can keep telling yourself to harden up about so many things, before you realise you\u2019re constantly beating yourself up and telling yourself to shut up. I have become my own strongest critic and silencer and I feel paralysed by myself worse than anyone else who could have tied to control my thoughts and words. The IBS issue is just the latest thing I keep telling myself to \u201cdeal with.\u201d Just like I told myself to get over and deal with my loss of my barely-begun career as a lecturer, when I quit to dedicate every waking moment to my autistic son; there\u2019s no one to blame but me, but it still feels like a deep personal failure and I\u2019m so tired of losing things I once cared about and telling myself to just deal with it. And so that\u2019s where I am now. Trying to figure out a way to re-take my honesty and my voice \u2013 and more essentially, my very self \u2013 because along the way I lost sight of who I am. I am more proud of who I have become since autism (and of course, my sons) entered my life, but I am so very confused on what I am meant to do with that person now. I don\u2019t know how to reconcile who I was with who I am, and I feel like those around me don\u2019t see or understand that split. My values and ideals and desires for life and for the world, are in conflict right now, and I feel in flux. Because of that flux, I also feel extraordinarily vulnerable and sensitive to others\u2019 views; like an exposed empty shell because I\u2019m having trouble filling it up with what I supposedly am and what I want while those around me are trying to tell me what  they  want me to be and who  they  think I am. (If you\u2019re having trouble following what I\u2019m saying, imagine how confused it is inside my head right now!) Because of all this self-doubt and confusion, I have been turning down fantastic opportunities lately, such as a chance to talk on National\u00a0Radio recently about disability issues, and then I beat myself up for saying no to those opportunities. It\u2019s like opportunity knocks and I inform it to come back when I know who I am, but we all know that Opportunity is rarely that obliging. I even recently quit a job I\u2019ve had for almost a decade, even though we need the money, because I\u2019m just so misplaced; I suspect I will greatly regret that in time too, but for now I think it\u2019s something I had to do. I think. So yes, I\u2019m quiet of late, because I\u2019m lost, and blogging is something that requires strength and certainty which I lack right now. Please be patient though, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find my self soon, and when I do, it will be the best self I can be, and maybe I\u2019ll have finally learnt my lesson about the importance of caring: no matter how much I love my children, I can not do best by them if I am unwell in these ways \u2013 part of loving them, is remembering to love myself. \u201cSelf\u201d is not a dirty word. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/92981392@N00/6037111/in/photolist-wWC8-KBAw-6L6ac-6MA7L-6PQNr-8zRUG-8Kkw2-9UKCH-9UKDp-an494-cgKSa-cD3Vk-dsq2o-gkQSq-oCgN2-oEWyd-oNFkp-q3nQZ-q3nRi-wUdVA-zU2oz-AmaUX-AWJe5-M5BnJ-MqDzH-MqDAP-PHe9K-2K2YET-3dXQB9-3wJ7vA-482LKM-4adUhr-4f7qf8-4hB8At-4s2RrF-4tybEg-4v7kg9-4zBg23-4zBg3N-4BvD9K-4DhyJm-4DSbZL-4GvERg-4QUpmP-4ZGz4U-5ncWjH-5pjpzv-5qd55E-5tbtAj-5xhdvJ-5CDxVM"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/self/", "title": "Self"},

All my blog stats have basically doubled over the past year: My blog now sits at 235,805 hits for all time, my  Facebook page  now has 442 fans, I have 1052  Twitter  followers, and 203 people are signed up to email notifications for each time I do a new blog post. My most viewed post is finally no longer the one about  autism and violence , it is now \u201c Distinguishing Giftedness from Aspergers; will the DSM-5 help? \u201d The most commented on post is now no longer  my post on marijuana , but my post called \u201c The Privilege Game \u201d written in February this year. \u201cThe Privilege Game\u201d is arguably my most controversial and most deeply misunderstood post of all time; people came to it with preconceived ideas about what I was attacking and trying to say, and launched personal attacks on me for claims I never even made in the piece. If you want to read the post and haven\u2019t done so before, please read it with an open mind! I\u2019ve reread it many times since I first published it, and I still consider it a valuable post about misuses of \u201cprivilege.\u201d (Feel free to make up your own mind on that though.) Other people\u2019s blogs that have been capturing my attention and heart of late, are \u201c Yeah, Good Times \u201d by Jill, \u201c Mostly True Stuff \u201d by Lexi, and \u201c Snagglebox \u201d by Bec. All of whom are amazing women as well as talented writers and great advocates. If you haven\u2019t encountered their blogs yet, it\u2019s worth your time to have a look. As for where my blog has come from and where it is now heading, I have seen the shift in focus on my blog move along with the shift in my own son\u2019s autism. I have moved from sharing the horrors and amusements of my early years with him, to focusing on diagnostic instruments and trying to comprehend the autism community, to the gradual shift I\u2019m experiencing now more towards advocating around autism news stories and looking at the more subtle yet important challenges of living with autism as a child ages. I\u2019m happy for my blog to evolve along with my personal interests and experiences, and I hope you will continue to find reasons to read and enjoy my blog too. I really do very much appreciate my readers and their comments, so thank you yet again to each of you who have taken the time to share this blogging experience with me over the years \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/31699569@N00/2836828090/in/photolist-5jFua9-5otTpp-5prChJ-5qwKq2-5qPdx9-5rx3Dh-5rX38s-5tBAg4-5vr8AD-5w2mwv-5xbY2a-5GVN1w-5HyZSU-5NHnof-5RbTTe-5Rga3q-5RqFJM-5Rv1K1-5Rv1Nf-5Rvbyf-5SJAmx-5XSXEv-5YntQy-61KwMM-63GEXQ-66qVDF-67Ucku-6aDd8B-6bXF19-6i7qAL-6mKCmE-6nWUNt-6o3m1R-6pR1KK-6pToQJ-6s1k7Q-6vAWFJ-6xcwtK-6xoGu9-6yYnyC-6zduH3-6AqsMp-6E6mf1-6JcGrk-6XuBtA-6Ywc9L-77FKxF-7dufDX-7nRt5N-7ocq94-7vZh83", "https://www.facebook.com/autismandoughtisms", "https://twitter.com/AutismOughtism", "http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.co.nz/", "http://www.mostlytruestuff.com/", "http://www.snagglebox.com/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/review-of-my-third-year-of-blogging/", "title": "Review of my Third Year of\u00a0Blogging."},
{"date": "October 26, 2013", "body": "The following is a letter I have just written that I shall be giving to my son\u2019s teaching team next week. He has attended a mainstream school since the start of this year, prior to that he spent two years at a Special School. I think it is worth sharing on my blog, because it touches on issues relevant to all autistic children, and on the problematic issue of dealing with seemingly\u201dnon-compliant\u201d behaviours. The only change I have made to the letter, is my son\u2019s name; to protect his identity and privacy I have changed his name to \u201cJoe.\u201d Joe can appear to be a non-compliant or stubborn child, but in my experience the non-compliance is almost always a reaction to something he can\u2019t or hasn\u2019t verbalised. By Jonathan Reyes, via Flickr His autism means he struggles with communication, anxiety, social interactions, and understanding instructions (for example, because of his literalness). He also continues to have issues with physical fine motor, gross motor and general coordination skills, he has been diagnosed with a weak core area and weak ankles, he wears orthotics to correct the position of his feet which then affects his movement and gait. These challenges are often masked because he is a smart child who has learnt to cope and hide many of these issues \u2013 often by avoiding the activities that highlight them. In the autism community we call this \u201cpassing:\u201d It is a common tactic and significant issue for higher functioning autistic individuals, they \u201cpass\u201d as neurotypical by utilising strategies that hide but do not eliminate their struggles. It can be mentally and physically exhausting for them to pass every day, which can and does lead to burn out. The underlying challenges and issues are still there, but they aren\u2019t been dealt with or expressed so the person may be considered more capable and less affected than they actually are. This issue impacts on adequate provision of support services too, and is a well-known and significant issue for the autism community. When Joe says he doesn\u2019t want to or won\u2019t do something, it could be for any number of non-expressed reasons. In order to help him join-in and do as instructed, it is vital that someone makes the time and effort to figure out why he is saying no. Joe is not fundamentally a non-compliant child, quite the reverse; in my experience he is eager to please and to get praise (often too eager). So it is worth taking the time to figure out where the \u201cno\u201d is coming from\u00a0 \u2013 for his own mental and physical growth, to encourage his social communication, and to long-term increase his class participation. The short-term of asking each time why he says no, even though it may be time-consuming, is an important step in helping him towards a more interactive and compliant class experience in the future. Two actual examples may help to illustrate the point. Joe came home from school on Friday pale, weak, nauseous and with a fever. The first sign to me that he was unwell was not the physical symptoms themselves, but the fact that he was incredibly non-compliant to my requests that he wash his hands and get dressed as he usually would after school. When I took the time to talk to him and listen to him it became clear how sick he was, the non-compliance was just a marker to the issue. I asked him if he\u2019d been OK at school, and he started crying while he told me what happened during \u201cdancing.\u201d He said that he felt like he was going to throw up during the dancing, and he kept trying to lie on the floor because he felt so bad, but the teacher kept telling him he had to join in and do the dancing. I asked him if he told the teacher he was feeling sick, and he looked very thoughtful for a while and said \u201cno, I forgot.\u201d This is typical of Joe: He forgets or doesn\u2019t know to fully communicate the information that people need to understand what he is doing. It is a classic and strong symptom of autism that they struggle to understand others\u2019 perspectives; it is hard for Joe to understand the way we take for granted that the rest of the children do, that a teacher needs to be expressly told why he is doing (or not doing) something. He needs reminding and even prompting, this is all part of his educational requirements, and should be adequately supported to allow for the encouragement of this type of communication. If the teacher has too many students to deal with at the time, Joe needs more individualised support to facilitate the time and effort required to help him communicate better in class. A second example may also help illustrate the issue. Joe had been told by me that he didn\u2019t need to see the school dental nurse because he had his own dentist, and I had signed a form denying consent for him to see a school dental nurse anyway. The form was misplaced by a teacher, but regardless Joe knew he didn\u2019t need to see the nurse and I had expressly told him that if anyone makes him go along, he can tell them that Mummy said no. Despite these clear instructions to him, when it came time for him to be taken to the dental nurse, he apparently simply told the teacher \u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d Which was interpreted as \u201cI don\u2019t want to / I have a choice in the matter,\u201d and he was made to do it anyway. Instead of assuming non-compliance \u2013 as with the dancing example above \u2013 the teacher should have asked more questions and made the effort to encourage Joe to communicate why he felt he didn\u2019t have to. That way, he would have had the chance to be reminded to say what I told him, or to better express his reasons for not going along. In such situations it may indeed turn out that Joe is simply being non-compliant, but that is not my principle experience with my son; he is not a fundamentally non-compliant person just for the sake of being difficult. He is almost always reacting to anxiety, fear, confusion, lack of information, illness, or something else unspoken. If no one makes the effort to figure out why he is being non-compliant, then it is impossible to figure out the appropriate response to the situation. For example, if he is ill he should be allowed to non-comply; if he is scared he should be reassured and given emotional support; if he is confused or has a lack of information he should be further informed and given more certainty and detailed instructions; if he is simply being non-compliant he should be reminded of authority figures and the importance of doing what is asked of him, etc. The older and more skilled he becomes at communicating and performing tasks, the less intensive the extra support that will be needed. But he is only 8, has only been talking for 3 years as opposed to the typical 5 years experience of his peers, he has physical weaknesses and challenges that are literally hidden (in his shoes for example!), he was once so severely autistic that it was declared he\u2019d be unlikely to ever speak in a sentence and would be dependent on us for the rest of his life. It needs to be kept in mind how hard it is for Joe to be \u201cjust like everyone else,\u201d to \u201cpass.\u201d His autism is not all-consuming of who he is (though it once very much was), but just because it\u2019s not always obvious doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there impacting on his brain and body every single day. He is an incredibly loving and good child, but if you ignore the impact autism is having on his communication and skills it is easy to see him as a \u201cproblem child.\u201d He needs help to understand what is required of him and to do it, and he needs reminders though-out the day. The more time and effort that goes into this now, will mean less is gradually required over the years. If he is receiving inadequate support to allow the teacher to deal with him in the way he needs to flourish, then we need to review his support allocations now rather than later. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/38308378@N05/5034760960/in/photolist-8EUt2s-9fXoDo-9fXoCq-9fUhNg-8irSab-9kfD6p-8sugXv-aZ1rfi-aWhTrk-aZ1rDV-aZ1qQa-aZ1quT-9U9grL-a6wehu-9TZquU-92e9ph-dL11wd-8ZLz8s-8ZLyVj-8ZLzjy-dRr3ND-9TZfDE-dpTCKw-9csJtH-9sTUKE-9fXoyo-9fXowC-9fXoAU-aPtTUZ-dQC51v-fwDiGE-fwp2gV-aj56Eh-bv1U1S-e2dNyW-8iSh8c-eabyKu-anQSez-boh2Ck-7Yobqk-9kdLJs-9kdLLf-9kdLKo-9kaHg6-dDJmSF-8Bmru9-8BijQ8-8ffMZT-8ffN5x-8ffN7n-8fj4CW"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/understanding-and-reacting-to-non-compliance-a-letter-to-teachers/", "title": "Understanding and Reacting to \u201cNon-Compliance:\u201d A Letter to\u00a0Teachers."},
{"date": "December 31, 2013", "body": "There is an ugly, nasty, and logically incoherent view-point that I prefer not to dwell on, because I like to think it is so extreme that no one would provide a public or reputable forum for this view to be heard: The view that parents of autistic children are abusers and murderers in-waiting. You may think I\u2019m referring to our old friend Bruno Bettelheim and his thoroughly discredited and despicable  notion that autism is caused by cold distant mothers . Or maybe I\u2019m thinking of the all-too-many ignorants in society who believe autism does not exist and is really just a parent\u2019s way to refuse to take responsibility for their own poor parenting, allowing the parent to drug their unruly child into submission. Photo by Kristy, via Flickr But no. I am referring to the view that you will readily find on a few (all too popular) blogs and Facebook pages: that parents of autistic children are actively abusing their children everyday by using  evidence-based therapies like ABA ; and  comparing parents who disagree with particular view-points or who  dare  to share the hard reality of raising children, to the deeply disturbing examples  of parents who have tried to take their autistic child\u2019s life (and often their own life at the same time). And what group of people share such outrageous, upsetting, misguided views as these? Surely they would be people we can dismiss out of hand because they\u2019re just trying to bully or troll? The key group sharing this view, is made up of autistic adults. That is to say, a group of people we should always be keen to hear and understand and support; parents more so than anyone else want to hear them, because they grant us a window into the lives of the people we love more than anything else in the world \u2013 our own children. Thankfully, and I hope obviously, those who say such things are an extreme few, and not the thoughtful majority of autistic adults. The vast majority of autistic adults I have ever met in person or online or through their own books, are so kind and thoughtful and considerate that it would distress them to know they had caused pain to others. In my experience \u2013 and this is only my experience \u2013 they will go to pains to make sure people (including themselves) act and speak respectfully and do the right thing by others. I am glad my son has these kind autistic role-models, and I would be so proud to have him turn out to have their same level of humanity and empathy. Indeed, my son doesn\u2019t like to make others upset or angry or disappointed, and actively seeks an understanding of what he may have done to cause the distress in others and how he might avoid it in the future; not because he is some lap-dog or mindless follower, and not because he is weak or has no strong opinions, but because he is just a sweetheart with a sweet heart who genuinely cares about people. How then do we make sense of these few autistic adult extremists who seem very ready to treat all parents of autistic children as would-be abusers and murderers, who treat women like me who dedicate our daily lives to our children as if we need to be carefully scrutinized because at any moment we might crack and kill our kids (and I wish that was an exaggeration of their views!) We should surely treat them the same we treat anyone who holds an extreme and unsubstantiated view that groups others together under a damaging stereotypes: As themselves non-typical of that group, as rather an extreme and dangerous example that can and does damage the wider group at issue. That is to say, the exact same way we should treat the minority of autism parents who do actually abuse or kill their children: As extreme and dangerous and a-typical. But isn\u2019t that just dismissing the views of some autistic adults? I guess it is, in the same way that we may wish to dismiss the views of the few autism parents (or whatever other group you like) who also wish to cause others harm based on unfounded stereotypes. But maybe it isn\u2019t unfounded, maybe these extreme views are the deeper truths that we must hear and take to heart. From what I\u2019ve read, these few extremists are grouping together all ABA therapy as if it was the worst examples we had decades ago, and are grouping all autism parents together in a basket with the mentally ill. I am not mentally ill, and even if I was, I wouldn\u2019t appreciate the mentally ill being used to political ends by others to argue a wider point about how people should parent their children. That would strike me as cruelly dismissive to the complexities that people face when they have reached a point where they would even contemplate killing their own child and themself. By even saying that sentence, I would similarly be attacked for daring to show \u201cempathy\u201d to a killer, but to understand the ill mind is not to excuse or justify what it does within that illness. (Please understand\u00a0that I am not saying all who kill themselves and their child are mentally ill \u2013 though some clearly are \u2013 to see further on those complexities, please  click through to my post on the point .) If we try to focus on the relevant facts of what autism parents are actually like and actually likely to do, we can surely work up from these grounds (none of which support the extremist views I am upset about here): (1) The people in this world who most love and most want the best for an autistic child, are almost invariably the parent of that child. The few cases where this is objectively not true, are arguable no different from those where parents of non-autistic children abuse and hate their children; they too are aberrations, not the norm. (2) Many autism parents are themselves either autistic or have enough autistic traits to have insights to their child\u2019s behaviours. We are not some group of solely non-autistic people, raising a bunch of mysteriously autistic children; we are cut from the same cloth. Indeed I think if you helped autism parents to see the autistic type behaviours they already are intimately familiar with in themselves and their own family as they grew up, I think you\u2019d be doing much good. Rather than treating them like a group that \u201cjust doesn\u2019t get autism.\u201d (3) We know our child like no one else, even when we don\u2019t have the insights of personal autism. We have carried that child since before it was born, and given it every comfort and listened to its every coo from that moment on. We know what gives them blissful joy, and what might leave them screaming and in sensory pain. We may not always know the why, but we know the what and we know the \u201cwho:\u201d We know our child intimately, we know their personality, we know\u00a0 them .  Who  they are. The individual, that is not and never could be wholly defined by  any  label or diagnosis. To ignore this individualism, this aspect of personality, to downgrade its relevance to a diagnostic term, to ignore the parents deep understanding and knowledge of that individualism and the value of that knowledge, is doing no one any favours\u2026 unless you\u2019re trying to argue that your view is the  one true  autistic viewpoint, in which case it helps to depersonalize other autistic people I guess. (4) We, as parents, are almost always guided in our decisions by specialists and charities which have been set up to operate in the best interests of autistic people, and they in turn are meant to be guided by studies that provide evidence of what works in the best interests of our children. If we as parents have been mislead, then surely the focus should be on who mislead us and why, not on labelling all parents themselves as the evil-doers. We as parents do not make money or get joy from harming our children, so how about the focus be on who does get profit from such options? If anything, we as parents are also victims of these charlatans (if that is what they are), as they take our money, our limited time, and they harm our children. There is no greater pain as a parent than to see or think you have needlessly harmed your child. Many of us torture ourselves over trying to figure out what the right thing to do is for our kids, the parents I know agonise each day sometimes over figuring out if they have made the right decision, and who pull their child out of any therapy or school that doesn\u2019t meet high expectations for the child\u2019s well-being (just see  my previous post  for a single personal example). (5) Raising any child is hard. Raising twins is super hard. Raising a disabled child is\u2026 well\u2026 also hard. This parenting thing isn\u2019t easy, no matter what child you get. Just how difficult it is is affected by where you live, who you live with, your income, your other children, as well as expectations, previous experience, the list is endless. So when someone points out that raising an autistic child is painfully, terribly difficult, what sense does it make to attack them for speaking a truth? \u201cShut up, only normal parents are allowed to say how difficult parenting is\u201d? \u201cHow dare you express yourself and seek help and understanding as a parent, you just be quiet and listen to  my  pain instead\u201d? Here\u2019s the deal: Parenting my son when he had severely debilitating self and other injuring extreme autistic traits was  hell . For me,  and  for him. Telling me or others not to say this, is absurd, it doesn\u2019t change the reality, and is in fact likely to make the reality harder, because living in silence brings its own terror and dangers. I would hope that all that didn\u2019t need to be said, but somewhere along the way these truths, these basic building blocks of parenting and life and genetics, got pushed aside to make way for a politicized message whereby autism parents are treated like barriers to their child\u2019s well-being rather than advocates of the same. I suspect it\u2019s because it\u2019s easy to pick on parents, it\u2019s easy to make us cry and make us shout and make us react colourfully, when someone accuses us of intending to harm our children. It\u2019s so damn easy to push our buttons, and why is that? Because we  love our children . Even when we are exhausted and have had enough and need a break, we  love  them. No other \u201cself-advocate\u201d autistic adult with the types of extremist views I am addressing here, loves my child. They are so full of self-righteous misplaced hate, that I would actually fear to have my child near them (or anyone else who was so ready to attack people they don\u2019t even know). Their hate and anger may exist for an excellent reason, but to direct it at innocent loving parents, is bizarre and cruel. Direct it at the specific specialists, at the relevant\u00a0charities, at the actual killers, at the high-profile celebrities, but extending such nasty stereotypes to all autism parents is to create fear and anger where it doesn\u2019t belong and shouldn\u2019t exist. Why can\u2019t we all just get along? Because some people \u2013 including some autistic adults \u2013 think autism should be completely eradicated. Because some people \u2013 including some autistic adults \u2013 think all autism parents need to be watched lest they assert their naturally abusive ways. Because some people \u2013\u00a0including some autistic adults \u2013 think autism is mere difference and an adjusted society would address many key concerns. Clearly, autistic adults are not all the same in their views. Autism parents are not all the same in our views. It\u2019s OK that we can\u2019t all get along, it\u2019s OK that we engage in dialogue to understand why. It is not OK to stereotype all people \u2013 whether by their autism or the fact they are an autism parent \u2013 as all being inclined to think the exact same way as the worst each group has to offer. Autistic people are  not all would-be murderers . And neither are their parents. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Bettelheim#Autism_controversy", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035603401@N01/21838191/in/photolist-2VVJx-9fasT-4eJQ7N-4CDocA-8Evezc-dnqaf8-bCpffb-7QfZjm", "http://theconnorchronicles.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/boycott-the-thinking-persons-guide-to-autism/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/the-non-murdering-parent/", "title": "The Non-Murdering Parent"},
{"date": "December 28, 2013", "body": "My eight year-old son has completed his first year of mainstream education at the local school, after having being in a Special School for his first two years. There are so many good and bad aspects of mainstreaming him, in terms of what is in his own best interests; I guess the most I can say with it all in mind, is that we made the overall right schooling decision with the options we had available. But there is something I can say with more certainty: mainstreaming my autistic son is burning me out. By 2KS4 via Flickr When he attended a Special School, all his therapies were built into his daily learning curriculum. We would work on the same therapy areas at home, but the plans and expertise and key implementations were coming from the professionals that interacted with him everyday at school. Furthermore, they were in constant contact with each other through the school system, so all his areas of need were quite well-coordinated (the physical, with the social, with the communicative, etc). Twice a year I would meet with the head teacher who oversaw him each day, to go over his achievements and identify more areas for improvement. Every day I was able to communicate with her through his notebook, and she and her team were very understanding and well-informed on what would help solve arising issues. At his mainstream school, he has no therapists. There are no autism and other experts at my fingertips each day. I feel like someone cut a bunch of strings that were connecting me to knowledge and insights, and now I\u2019m just some surprised string-less puppet who has had to learn how to do it all by myself. Now I have to identify areas that need work, I have to find solutions, I have to keep a constant eye that they are being adequately implemented. These are things I have always being part of, but now there\u2019s no one to turn to to ask \u201cam I doing this right?\u201d and expect an experienced and expert answer. My son has ended up in the oddest situation where he has lots of support within his school \u2013 in fact it looks like too much support \u2013 but none of it is really or effectively helping him with his autism challenges (as far as I can see). The support appears to be more focused on relieving the teacher to free her up, since my son can need more time than other children, or more generally, on \u201cmanaging\u201d my son. Of course I understand the value of this support, but it seems teacher rather than student oriented; it feels like it\u2019s not about advancing or improving  him . I attend lots of meetings about him, talk to his teachers and support people, but I feel like we\u2019re just treading water; we say the right things, we tick the right boxes, we smile at the right time to the right people. We make charts and we pat each other on the back over the small successes. We\u2019re doing this right according to the rules and regulations. But I\u2019m dealing with the fallout behind the scenes and I feel like screaming with the utter frustration of it. I want his therapists back, I want the expertise back, I want people who understand that his home life and his school life are intertwined; what they do with him at school impacts heavily on what we have to put up with at home, and we always get the worst of it at our end. To compensate for the lost therapists, I do a lot more with him at home, but half the time I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it right or should be doing it at all. I buy him resources on social skills and work on them with him everyday and take him to social skill classes after school. I try to figure out where his new anxieties are coming from, and what to do about it. I work on his socially-isolating stims, wondering all the time whether I am wasting my time trying to counter them, and whether I\u2019m doing the right sort of countering to the right degree at the right times. I wonder weekly whether we should have him on meds for the anxiety, and have no one on hand to talk to about it; our regular access to his developmental pediatrician was through the school. I am in the constant cycle of identify issue, find solution, address issue, try different method, etc, but with no one on hand to guide me anymore. Through this whole thing I\u2019ve felt a loss of control over his schooling and therapies and social interactions, compared to what I used to know and have a say in. I wanted to be more included and knowledgeable about his schooling, beyond what was available to me, which is what drove me to run for and become a member of the school\u2019s Board of Trustees. But all that\u2019s really achieved is a higher work load for me, more stress, and no gain on the front of feeling more in control of his schooling (not yet anyway). I can\u2019t even say that I believe his actual education has improved having moved to a mainstream school, in truth I feel he has slipped backwards in some regards. The heavily personalized, intensive and tailored attention he received at a Special School was not just benefiting him around his autism challenges, but also bearing fruit for his standard educational achievements. I am so aware and concerned about this (perceived) lack, that I have taken on actively teaching him subject matter outside of school hours, which is happening to such a degree that it notably impacts on my time, energy, and finances. Of course I extended his education when he was at Special School too, but back then it just felt like actually  extending  him, rather than trying to teach him the basics I feel should be coming through the classroom. So one year in to this mainstreaming experience, I am increasingly concerned and tired. I can already see the possible need to home-school him years from now, particularly when his current issues become more obvious and less \u201cacceptable\u201d to the children around him. I feel like all this extra therapy and education work I am having to do, is turning out to be practice for something that will only become more intensive. And yet, for all this, I still feel we made the right decision to mainstream him instead of leave him at the Special School considering the developmental point he had reached; the problem, rather, is with the options I was presented and the failures in the way mainstream schools are resourced. I\u2019m going to have to aim much higher than \u201cBoard of Trustees\u201d if I want to see  that  change come about. In the meantime, I\u2019m trying to focus on thinking only one year ahead. Each year I will \u2013 as I always have \u2013 re-evaluate if the school he is in continues to be the best for him. I will continue to work with him at home, ever mindful that no matter how burnt-out I get, my job as a mother includes not letting him get burnt-out alongside me; just because I\u2019m getting exhausted, doesn\u2019t mean he has to be. For all of this, he is still only an eight year-old boy, who needs and deserves fun and down-time like any other child. Like any other human\u2026 like me. Maybe I\u2019ll get some in next year. And on that note, I hope you all have a good New Year, see you in 2014 \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/2ks4/3779081697"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/12/28/why-mainstreaming-my-son-is-exhausting-me/", "title": "Why mainstreaming my son is exhausting\u00a0me."},
{"date": "September 5, 2013", "body": "Every week lately I encounter a story that attacks the \u201cspecial treatment\u201d that the disabled receive. Whether it\u2019s attacking the way that those with disabilities are \u201callowed\u201d to skip queues, make more disruptive noises or movements than others, or in areas such as employment or education. I\u2019ve seen counterattacks of course, where other writers have pointed out that this isn\u2019t \u201cspecial treatment,\u201d rather it is a way of reaching meaningful equality, or that these allowances for the disabled are a product of the difficult and misunderstood lives of the disabled (whereby it\u2019s not so much about equality as it is about deserved benefits for difficult lives). By Evan Leeson, via Flickr I don\u2019t see those counterattacks making much headway though; all I see is those already aware of the inequalities and difficulties of being disabled, supporting the arguments we\u2019re already well aware of (which is not to say the counterattacks are worthless, it\u2019s good to be reminded why we at times treat the disabled differently). Well I\u2019m going to take a different approach to try to get through to those who think the disabled don\u2019t deserve \u201cspecial treatment\u201d in so many areas of daily life. And maybe I\u2019ll fail too, but I think it\u2019s an under-appreciated point by the majority of society: For the non-disabled people of this world, society  is  their special treatment. The rules we create and how we disseminate them; the social expectations we hold of each other and the way we enforce them; the way employment is gained, held and sought; the way education is made available and experienced, and the results of that education tested and regarded. Life in this society is already set up to advantage those who don\u2019t need the advantages; the non-disabled majority. Beyond the most basic set of rights (and even those are still being fought for the world over), there is nothing pre-determined or un-artificial about the way we structure our society; that much is obvious by the way different cultures, in different countries, over the centuries, have chosen to run themselves. There is little that is not actively created about society and the way society is run and experienced. Guess what mass majority populace? It was created to make  your  lives easier and convenient. That\u2019s  your  special treatment that you simply take for granted. As soon as another group \u2013 usually a disadvantaged group \u2013 wants society restructured to be more inclusive or responsive to the realities of those trying to exist within it, you label that \u201cspecial treatment\u201d as if what already exists is somehow perfectly as it should be. This world is far from perfect. And a society that expects and requires its most vulnerable citizens to either adapt or stay at home locked up because they\u2019re too noisy or a nuisance or too hard to accommodate, is a deeply imperfect society. Instead of telling the disabled to stay out of the mainstream of life \u2013 the restaurants, parks, events and schools that were created with their and their families\u2019 money and time too \u2013 how about you take the challenge as an opportunity to make society better. Because a society set up so that it provides \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to those who least need it, is a society that desperately needs to change. And a society where people dismissively label attempts to bring real equality to the disabled, as \u201cspecial treatment,\u201d are people who need to confront personal change for the better too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/41864721@N00/3398391216/in/photolist-6biDj1-6AqsMp-6NqHWL-72zRzr-72AP4g-72Mz5G-78gEJU-7kabEc-7w37p2-a3iMrt-aounGe-8BgnrM-aPAmFe-9woxW3-8A32GJ-7Bu8hZ-eJSanP-eD1XqW-ea95Bi-e9tZjh-bCpfEi-bqukrL-a1sCvo-9Ca9XB-9BQuMp-99WK9X-8F4uUX-8fRxKB-7Eb33R-bocgVH-9QcMhM"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/society-is-your-special-treatment/", "title": "Society is your \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d"},
{"date": "September 9, 2013", "body": "Kelli Stapleton attempted to kill her teenage daughter  who has severe autism, and to kill herself at the same time. She did not succeed in either task. Her daughter is  apparently recovering well , and the mother is in custody. This much you know. You also know that the  international autism community  has variously turned it into a platform for existing causes; such as highlighting the lack of support for autism families, or the negative attitudes towards autistic people. Both approaches are actively drawing on Kelli Stapleton\u2019s previous  blogging  and social media sharing, as evidence to support their position. I quietly read the attacks, defences, counter-attacks, ad hominems and break-downs across the autism community, until I got to the point that I realised silence at this time is also being misconstrued as support for one or the other \u201cside\u201d of the arguments. Does my own silence imply I stand with other mothers who understand and support Kelli? Or does the fact that I\u2019m choosing to not speak up and stand beside those mothers at this time, imply that I think they are wrong to support Kelli? In truth, it\u2019s the almost-lawyer in me that keeps me quiet. I prefer to comment after cases have gone through the courts (or after it has been decided they will not make it to court), because it is through those legal proceedings that the facts are drawn out and tested. I am weary of trial-by-media and the damage it does, and the defamation that usually arises in such a process. Still, there is a particular aspect of this whole public debate that I want to comment on, because I see two sides arguing about one event but as if it contains very different key elements, and I think ignoring those differences is leading to a lot of the subsequent fall-out. The debatable difference, as I see it, is not the action or the intent per se \u2013 it appears clear that the intent was murder and the actions were towards that end. Rather, the questionable aspect, is the motivator, or if you will, the  type  of filicide we are seeing. I want to explain what I mean by that, and why I think it is crucial in these debates. It appears to make sense of the filicide here, as  one of three types : \n Altruistic filicide , performed in the perceived best interests of the child, either because (a) the parent perceives the world as too cruel to leave the child behind (and thus often accompanied by the parent\u2019s suicide), or (b) to alleviate the child\u2019s suffering (such as due to a disability). \n Psychotic filicide , where there is no other seemingly rational basis for the act, than the parent\u2019s psychosis \u2013 those who attempt suicide are also more likely to be mentally ill \u2013 or \n Unwanted child filicide , where the parent kills an unwanted child viewed as a hindrance, including the situations where personal gain such as insurance money accompanies the death. \n From what I have seen, those supporting the mother assume Kelli fits into some mixture of altruistic filicide and \u00a0psychotic break, and those who attack Kelli as someone not deserving any sympathy or support, assume Kelli was motivated in accordance with something closer to the \u201cunwanted child\u201d category (or perhaps as altruistic type (b)). Based on the facts that we do know \u2013 including the child\u2019s autism, the mother\u2019s attempted suicide, the (arguable) premeditation, and her views of the lack of compassion from those she turned to for help \u2013 one might be lead to suspect this is altruistic filicide of type (a). But you may think the facts better suit type (b), that seems a reasonable conclusion too. The point being, whichever it may be, the type of filicide speaks to the appropriate attitude and punishment. If we use the three categories above for example, we are lead to at least these possibilities: (1) Kelli acted out of self-serving intent to benefit from the child\u2019s death, (though this would appear highly unlikely since she attempted suicide), then your attitude to her should be utter unequivocal outrage, no question. Or (2) she did it out of some confused (or justified) version of altruism. If so, that may affect your opinion, or at the very least complicate the situation, and perhaps such motives will be relevant consideration in any court case. Or (3) she had a psychotic break. Again, this affects the punishment and public attitude, because she would thereby be lacking meaningful intent and deserves and needs help \u2013 and potentially sympathy \u2013 in an institution rather than a prison. Until you have enough facts to figure out what you\u2019re looking at, how can you meaningfully judge, defend, or attack; let alone turn the situation into a platform for one cause or another? I simply don\u2019t know enough to know how to feel about the specific occurrence. I think the confused and conflicting emotions that many have right now, are because they don\u2019t actually know what situation they\u2019re looking at here. Some reactions and emotions are clear, and I have seen them on  all  sides of the debates and responses: Sad horror at the fact that a mother tried to kill her own child. That emotion is relevant regardless of the mother\u2019s motives or state of mind. Beyond that though, the people who know best what they should feel and how they should respond, are those closest to the family because they have more information than the rest of us, and from them I have seen only outpourings of love and support. For me, at least, that tells me it is not time to condemn the mother as evil just yet. Yes, her actions were \u201cevil,\u201d but whether  she  is also evil is yet to be determined. The child is alive, and recovering. The mother is apart from the child and any other children right now. Let medical intervention do its part, then let the law play its role, then let us also judge if required. No one thinks what happened was OK, no one thinks the mother is more important than the daughter right now \u2013 even the staunchest Kelli supporter hasn\u2019t said such a thing. So before we let the attacks tear our already fragile community any further apart, how about we have the humility and compassion to take a step back and see what we  don\u2019t \u00a0yet know, and in turn resist the urge to turn an unquestionable human disaster into a highly questionable platform. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2013/09/teen_with_autism_and_her_mothe.html", "https://www.facebook.com/TheElbertaAlert/posts/506304816104528", "http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2013/09/holdattempted_murdersuicide_ac.html", "http://thestatuswoe.wordpress.com/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922347/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/altruistic-pyschotic-or-unwanted-child-filicide-the-question-of-kelli-and-issy/", "title": "Altruistic, Pyschotic, or Unwanted Child Filicide?

{"date": "September 10, 2013", "body": "I happened upon two interviews today, that aired on August 25th on Radio New Zealand, covering issues affecting autistic adults (in New Zealand, but it\u2019s clear these issues are international ones too). They made up a regular segment that Radio NZ does about disability, the segment is called \u201cOne in Five.\u201d The  audio recording is 28 minutes long, do feel free to have a listen to the entire piece . What I am going to do in this post though is summarize the main points that came through the interviews, I think they are worth contemplating and sharing (and this post will take you less than 28 minutes to read, so I\u2019m hoping those who are time-poor will at least take the chance to read this). The first interview is with an autism advocate who has Aspergers, Matt Frost. He speaks about the need for Government autism funding to also be turned to the needs of autistic adults (ie, in addition to the current focus on the needs of autistic children). In particular, he wants to see more funding and support directed at transitioning, whether that transitioning be the classic situation of moving into work and independence after high school, or lesser appreciated areas of common transitioning (between living accommodations, for instance). Matt believes we need to be more honest about transition needs, less judgmental about those who need the help, and begin transitioning processes earlier than they currently begin. He also argues for the existence of \u201ccommunity visitors\u201d who would help bring the care and awareness and protection of the local community, into the lives of autistic adults. These people could also assist in transitioning needs. The second \u2013 and longer \u2013 interview, is with Tanya Breen, who is a Hamilton-based clinical psychologist who frequently works with those in the legal system. Tanya begins by debunking ill-founded myths about autistic people (and indeed, about different and disabled people more generally) been dangerous. She moves on to talking about her work in the legal system, which I found eye-opening and fascinating. She talked about the situations where autism is or can be relevant for the legal system, for example around the question of intent where intent is part of the definition of a crime. She had some interesting insights on how autism can affect court processes, such as the providing of evidence in a court-room (eg, is it best to use a one-way screen, will the individual cope with the stress of a packed court-room), and commented on the importance of being aware of how certain questions may affect the autistic individual\u2019s testimony and ability to testify in a court. Tanya provided an excellent example of the incredible importance of recognizing and understanding autism\u2019s impact on legal proceeding and evidence: The story of a person who had echolalia and would thereby repeat the last word of the sentence someone else had said every time before he spoke his own replies. This had apparently lead to a highly misleading transcript where the man was asked if the person that abused him knew the man didn\u2019t want to engage in the activity. The sentence he was asked ended with the word \u201cknow,\u201d to which the autistic individual responded and repeated \u201cknow,\u201d which was recorded in the transcript as \u201cno.\u201d The crime at issue turned on that answer, and the answer thereby provided was incorrectly recorded and vital to the case. Tanya also talks about and illustrates the issues with theory of mind, for example that asking an autistic adult to speculate on what someone else thought and knew, is a particularly difficult but nevertheless important task in the legal system. She talks about how autism can affect the prison experience, and how prison routines can be a blessing for some autistic people, but the change in routine on being introduced to prison can be devastating for autistic people too. Tanya laments the fact that there are not enough people available to do the important work she does in this area of the intersection of law and autism. She highlights the big gap in research when it comes to autistic adults, noting that there are huge numbers of un-diagnosed autistic adults in the community, and how much we could learn from finding and researching these individuals. She says there is a lot of assumed knowledge in autism, such as around empathy and obsessions, where more research is needed, again especially for the adult population. Such research being key in courts where opinions backed by research are more important and weighty than opinions just backed by personal (albeit it professional) experience with autistic adults. Tanya also notes that it is not true that there is a much higher proportion of autistic people in the prison population than in the community; that the proportions are pretty much equal. She also makes the important point that what we can learn about adults with autism by researching those found in prisons and institutions, is going to skew findings; again, it is important to find and talk to autistic adults living successful lives in the community, and finding out too what works for them in their lives. I found it very interesting and educational to listen to the speakers, most especially Tanya who was a very clear and thoughtful speaker who is clearly passionate about learning more about autistic adults from autistic adults. Understanding the lives of autistic adults in the community is clearly an important and under-appreciated area of research. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/oneinfive/audio/2566332/one-in-five-for-25-august-2013"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/autism-grows-up-issues-for-adult-autistics-highlighted-in-radio-nz-interviews/", "title": "Autism Grows Up: Issues for autistic adults highlighted in Radio NZ\u00a0interviews."},
{"date": "September 29, 2013", "body": "There is a  concerning statement released from the Autism Action Network  (AAN), that claims there have been losses of services to autistic individuals because of the DSM-5. In response to this loss of services, AAN are trying to block the use of the DSM-5. I have a lot of issues with the claims AAN make in their statement, and I do not think the DSM-5 is the key culprit; allow me to explain why. By Jussi Mononen, via Flickr First, a brief attack on AAN\u2019s claim that \u201c All the studies on how the DSM5 will affect people with autism have shown huge numbers will lose their diagnosis .\u201d That is a misleading claim at the best. Compare  the following statement from the American Psychiatric Association : \u201cDSM-5 criteria were tested in real-life clinical settings as part of DSM-5 field trials, and analysis\u00a0from that testing indicated that there will be no significant changes in the prevalence of the disorder.\u00a0More recently, the largest and most up-to-date study, published by Huerta, et al, in the October 2012\u00a0issue of American Journal of Psychiatry, provided the most comprehensive assessment of the DSM-5\u00a0criteria for ASD based on symptom extraction from previously collected data. The study found that\u00a0DSM-5 criteria identified 91 percent of children with clinical DSM-IV PDD diagnoses, suggesting that\u00a0most children with DSM-IV PDD diagnoses will retain their diagnosis of ASD using the new criteria. Several other studies, using various methodologies, have been inconsistent in their findings.\u201d OK, we can get past that hiccup and focus on the rest of the points made in the AAN piece; what is going on with the loss if services to people with autism?\u00a0I have no doubt there has been loss of service, but is it the DSM-5\u2019s fault? At the most superficial level, the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d because various organisations are  claiming  it is under the DSM-5 that they are making these changes. But I suggest it is not a correct \u2013 or at the very least, a highly debatable \u2013 application of the DSM-5 criteria, specifically because of  a particular provision that was introduced to the DSM-5 criteria  that addresses such concerns. That provision was that anyone with an established DSM-IV autism diagnosis, could still be considered to have a DSM-5 autism diagnosis; which is to say, meeting the DSM-IV autism diagnosis but not the strict DSM-5 criteria, shouldn\u2019t have meant a loss of diagnosis (and therefore, of services). The exact application and meaning of that provision is debatable and highly controversial, but it nevertheless exists (unless it\u2019s recently been changed, but I am unaware of any such change) and should have protected many people from the loss of services. So have the organisations that have taken away the services perhaps misapplied the new DSM-5, and if so, is it because the DSM-5 is too hard to understand and apply, or is it the intentional fault of the organisations that are choosing to read-down the DSM-5 criteria? We can ignore all that and  still  I take issue with the aims of organisations like the AAN that want to shut down the application of the DSM-5 because of loss of services. I take issue because the DSM-5 is intended to be a scientific manual not a political one (even though it has an eye to public application\u00a0and political pressures).  I have written before  about how attacks should be aimed at\u00a0political and private organisations in the way they choose to use otherwise scientific manuals. For example, should those governmental and insurance (etc) organisations be addressing actual and real need, not simply diagnostic labels? I suggest that a system that requires and depends completely on a diagnosis before providing needed services is the flawed one that should be receiving political and public pressure to change. I write that coming from a country where need is treated as primary when it comes to services \u2013 the diagnosis is helpful but not definitive for what help is received (for example, through the special education and beneficiary system). Don\u2019t get me wrong please, I\u2019m not saying the DSM-5 is perfect and only the organisations applying it are problematic, but I do strongly think and feel that the change needed here and at issue here, is around those who decide how to dish out services. Those are public or private (and either way, publicly paid-for) organisations; why attack the professional scientists whose work is being misused? Does the DSM-5 need to be clearer and better researched? Yes. But even the best researched and constructed diagnostic manual would not solve the problems of a public system that insists on a confirmed diagnosis before it helps people in clear need. My final point of contention with ANN\u2019s claims, and with this area of concern in general, is that the new categories invented and clarified by the DSM-5, need to be taken into account. For example, many of those who may no longer get the DSM-5 autism diagnosis, will now come in under the  Social Communication Disorder (SCD) area , or may find themselves better fitting under other headings (perhaps around anxiety or related symptomatic areas). If an organisation has stopped providing autism services to these people, has it also taken the DSM-5 seriously and created new services for\u00a0those who now come under SCD? If they haven\u2019t shifted these people from one support system to the other, is that not again the problem of the organisation denying the service, and not with the DSM-5? Is it not inconsistent and unethical to deny services  based on the DSM-5 , but at the same time refuse to create services for new diagnoses  created by  the DSM-5? This what I\u2019m trying to say here: The DSM-5 is problematic, but the deeper problem surely lies with the organisations that either misapply, under-apply, or solely rely on the DSM-5. It is my opinion that public attention and pressure should be placed on how those organisations run themselves, rather than pressuring the scientists behind the DSM-5 based on how public organisations then use their (otherwise intended for scientific purposes) manual. At the very least, does it not make sense to pressure these organisations to change how they are being run,  alongside  complaints about the DSM-5 itself? Regardless, the situation is unacceptable, and the human need cannot be ignored. Something has to change, but we need to be very thoughtful about what that is, otherwise the underlying problem will not go away, no matter how many manuals are created. *** My thanks to  Jill at \u201cYeah.

{"date": "September 26, 2013", "body": "Our Government appears to be laughing in the faces of the severely disabled and their carers with its new support system. As I read through the requirements, steps, and parties involved in the new system, my jaw just kept dropping open, and I kept making incredulous noises at my husband who also found the whole system absurd. You want to see just how badly a Government can misunderstand the disabled and their carers, and what lengths it will go to in order to avoid meeting its Human Rights obligations? Well then, allow me to present to you: By itsabitblurry via Flickr Funded Family Care ! I will first give you just the briefest of backgrounds, because I\u2019m eager to get to the guts of this utter farce. Basically,\u00a0 our courts  found our Government was discriminating in a manner inconsistent with human rights, because the Government blocked people from receiving pay for work caring for family members only because they  were  family members. Non-family members could and would be paid by the Government to provide support, but if the person was related to the disabled individual, they were not allowed to receive the funding, which lead to many desperate families struggling to get by and finally taking the matter to the courts. The decisions of the courts were read down to their smallest possible subset by the Government, whereby they decided they would pay only for the highest needs individuals (that\u2019s  about 1600 nationwide ), and only if the disabled individual was an adult, and not at all if the person seeking payment was a spouse or partner. So only family members of highly disabled adult individuals can get paid under the new scheme. The way in which the Government wrote up the legislation outlining this caused immense upset in the disabled community and in legal circles, and with many other societal groups too. (The details as to just how bad that legislation was,  can be found in my earlier post .) OK, let\u2019s then get to the funding scheme that has finally risen from all this. Ready to laugh or cry? Cause here we go: The most glaring aspect of the entire scheme is the contradictions throughout, as to who can qualify for the scheme, and what they must be capable of to access the funding. Specifically, only the most highly disabled will even qualify to pay family members, but in order to get the funding they must do very many things that would be automatically outside of the capabilities of the severely disabled. For example, the disabled person must be able to understand all their obligations under the funding agreement and all key aspects of the agreement. If they cannot, the funding is not approved. Those obligations include all core areas of employment law since the way the scheme is set up is to make them the employer of their family member, as funding is deposited in their bank account which they are then responsible for using to do the following: Pay the family member who is supporting them, pay ACC levies, pay tax, and pay the Kiwisaver scheme. The disabled person is  explicitly  put in the position of an official employer, and  explicitly  expected to be able to understand and meet all employer obligations, which are extensive and highly complicated in their own right (I\u2019ve taught Employment Law, this stuff ain\u2019t easy!) Allow me to give you another example of the contradictions inherent in the scheme, because it gets worse. In order to meet the scheme requirements, the disabled individual must be able to \u201c explicitly confirm \u201d their preference for a family member to do the work. This is not a negotiable requirement, it is a necessary one. A secondary requirement is that the disabled individual would not otherwise be able to remain at home without the support of the family member, but this secondary requirement can be waived in exceptional circumstances where, for example, the disabled person has \u201csignificant communication issues\u201d that mean the relationship between the family member and the disabled\u00a0individual is going to be hard for other carers to replace. But wait\u2026 how can the scheme on the one hand acknowledge that individuals may have severe communication difficulties, but insist as a necessary requirement that the disabled individual must be able to explicitly confirm a desire for an employment relationship, and must be able to show an understanding of the employment relationship..? (Answering that their guardian can give consent of their behalf is going to be problematic for many reasons, not the least of all being that the same person is likely to be the person seeking the funding in the first place.) Hey, it\u2019s OK, the scheme is going to introduce all sorts of mandatory support systems to help the disabled person make sense of this all (keeping in mind that even with all the support systems in the world though, you might never get a severely disabled person to be able to express and give meaningful consent to something as complex as a legal employment relationship, but let\u2019s ignore that crucial detail for a second). The scheme makes sure there are no less than\u00a0 five  parties involved in the funding set-up and ongoing review process: The disabled individual; the family member who will be paid; the Ministry (sure, it\u2019s their money); the NASC (the what..? Oh yeah, those guys that receive endless  complaints  about  the way they treat disabled families and their funding ); and the \u201cHost\u201d (staring blankly at the screen yet?). And I haven\u2019t even touched-on the role of \u201cadvocates\u201d and the \u201ccircle of support\u201d (that\u2019s  their  official term by the way). When  I made a submission  to the Government about how it might want to set up the scheme, I \u2013 like many others \u2013 strongly argued they not include the NASC (Needs Assessment and Coordination Service) in the process, because of the extra layer of bureaucracy, time, and money-wasting involved with their presence (quite independently of how poorly NASC currently operate). Not only did the Government decide to include the NASC, they invented more bodies that must be consulted and included (and obviously paid for somehow). Reading through the scheme is like watching money flow down a drain \u2013 into the pockets of gate-keepers, and held back from the very people for whom the scheme is meant to exist. I see a lot of job creation for anyone but the person who is after the funding; it is a maddening read. I\u2019ll give them this much: They do, at one point, acknowledge how complex and extensive the scheme is: \u201cThe requirements of the FFC arrangement are quite extensive and complex and understanding the obligations and responsibilities of being an employer in this arrangement can be quite daunting.\u201d Yah think..??  [Head-desk.] All of what I\u2019ve said so far, barely scratches the surface of the problems I see with the scheme. (The fact that the wages are at minimum wage, and questions of how many situations would actually get the 40 hour maximum and whether that is a realistic maximum for full time care, are also issues upsetting the disability community already.) It appears to be an inherently contradictory, self-defeating, bureaucracy-laden, impossible to negotiate scheme, that achieves little more than creating a bunch of new roles and organisations which will benefit far more and far more definitely, than the families this was meant to help. It\u2019s as if the scheme was designed for not just a very able person, but an exceptionally able person who can understand more than your average non-lawyer about employment law, and negotiate a very lengthy and convoluted number of steps to get the funding (which is thereafter constantly reviewed and re-assessed). The support systems created to inform and guide the disabled individual to overcome the hurdles the scheme itself creates, do not and cannot replace the requirement they insist on: that the severely disabled individual can understand and legally sign-up to the agreement and its huge number of responsibilities and obligations. I could give the Government the benefit of the doubt: I could say they only created so many hurdles to make sure the disabled individual has full and ongoing say in the arrangement, and as full control as possible over the funds. Which is a lovely and respectable aim, but it seems to me that they have created barriers to meaningful consent and control, not removed those barriers. And the deeper (and well justified at this point) cynic in me, thinks they fully understand just what they have done, since this is the same Government that argued against paying these people in the first place, created a tiny group of people who could ever qualify for it at the get-go, and rushed through legislation without debate, all the while loudly complaining to the courts and in the media about how much it will cost them to stop their own illegal discrimination. I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again: I want to be wrong. I want the Government and the operation of the scheme to prove itself to be fair and well-intended, I want to smile when I hear success stories about how the desperate families are now receiving sufficient support to do the best by their disabled family members, I want to be proud that New Zealand took a step away from discrimination and towards the well-being of disabled people and their families. But I think that I \u2013 like so many touched by disabilities in this country \u2013 am going to be left wanting. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/71274209@N00/500233888/in/photolist-LcQ7d-2Jw4cB-2Jw4zB-2Jw4Pn-2Jw5Wi-2Jw6CD-2Jw7qB-2JAo9h-2JApRm-2TTgHy-36tZK5-39dZsB-39dZGv-39e1zn-39iwYo-39ixgo-3AAvDg-4aVdEJ-4c7GpN-4BtkQf-4BtqVj-5Gecdn-65UsL4-6rMBrP-6rREpQ-6rRF3d-6rRHnQ-6rRHW1-6McVMM-6Md2ZM-6Md38D-6Md3dD-6Md3jR-6Mh7Eo-6Mh8Po-6Mh9Ro-6Mheed-6MheTh-6MheYY-6MhfeQ-e1khVY-8nq2FW-dnhxjf-dAaHrC-g1fsFy-g1fkhp-g1fd7S-e1khWb-bh2Rck-cFv7XQ-efuEEp", "http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/disability-services/disability-projects-and-programmes/funded-family-care-notice-and-operational-policy", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/9214236/92m-for-family-carers"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/whats-so-very-very-wrong-with-funded-family-care/", "title": "What\u2019s (so very very) wrong with \u201cFunded Family\u00a0Care?\u201d"},
{"date": "August 27, 2013", "body": "First, some necessary background: Prior to writing  my previous post , I had attempted to contact the researchers involved in the New Zealand study which is gathering autism DNA. After receiving no response for a few days, I had decided to go ahead with my post (which was, after all, my own reflections on these types of studies and why we do or don\u2019t sign up to them). Since I published that post, I received the email of someone responsible for PR of the study, through which I was then able to make contact with one of the researchers who was willing to answer my questions (let\u2019s call them Researcher X). After sending off my questions to Researcher X, I then received a response from the original email, but written by a group of other researchers involved with the study. This new response appears to have been written after reading my post, since they referred to something I only brought up in that post. By Esther Simpson, via Flickr By this point, I had four different contact emails (the generic one for\u00a0inquiries, the PR person, the single researcher I sent specific questions to \u2013 Researcher X, and now another generic one that contained replies from other researchers). The response from the group of researchers doesn\u2019t address each of the questions I forwarded to Researcher X, but does incidentally touch upon some of the key issues and concerns. So I have no idea whether I\u2019m still waiting on a reply from Researcher X, or whether this is their collective reply. Rather than spend another few days trying to sort that out, I have enough material to go ahead with a second post at this point, and the issues I\u2019ve had communicating them itself becomes an important part of what I have to say. The email response from the researchers started and ended with the gratitude they feel towards those who have chosen to take part in their studies. It is clear throughout their response that they are interested in and concerned about the well-being of the participants, in terms of protecting the identity, privacy and samples of the individuals (eg, \u201c[t] he DNA can only be used for this study and no other. Patients and their families can withdraw from the study at any stage (no reason is required) and their sample will either be returned or destroyed depending on their wishes\u201d ), and in the way in which those sample are collected: \u201c In some cases a DNA sample may already be stored because the person has undergone a previous test (such as a molecular karyotype). High quality DNA can be isolated from saliva and lower quality from a cheek swab. The other option is a blood sample. We are very aware that this could be a traumatic experience and, if so, it may be possible to collect a sample when another medical procedure is undertaken (i.e. under general anaesthetic). This is going to be a long-term study so we can wait. We absolutely do not want to cause undue stress .\u201d They also point out that the studies are being conducted in the context of a multidimensional approach towards autism, to \u201c encourage collaboration between researchers, clinicians and the community to investigate the causes of autism .\u201d The specific studies they are conducting, are then best understood within that broader framework. \u201c Our aim is to try to identify either causes or predispositions to autism. Through this work we hope to better understand the biology of autism and ultimately head towards improved diagnosis and therapies .\u201d Not everyone who signs up may meet the criteria of the studies, and funding will affect how many people can take part in the research, so signing up is only the first step in a long process between registering your interest and having a sample taken. Consent forms are of course part of that process too, and those forms will give potential participants more information and choices. This will include the choice to find out about any incidental findings with potential therapeutic responses: \u201c If a result relating to another condition was found during the testing, and was actionable, it would be reviewed by a clinical geneticist and subsequently tested via an approved clinical testing\u00a0laboratory, not by our research laboratory.\u00a0 This would only occur if the individual had consented to receive incidental findings. \u201d (From my point of view, the possibility to identify and respond to these incidental findings, is very attractive.) Towards the end of their email, they state something which of course particularly caught my eye as a blogger; \u201c [w]e are not particularly fluent in the use of social media.. .\u201d And it is this point that I want to briefly address too: One of the challenges science faces is communication with the people. In a world where people refuse vaccines because of autism fears, turn to homeopathy, and hear daily conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and the evils of national health agencies, it has become increasingly important that scientists find a way to convey information in a way that is accurate, accessible, and interesting. Many scientists maintain their own blogs, allowing them to communicate with both scientific peers and joe-public. Relying on mainstream media to do a good job of conveying new findings and information on studies, does not always turn out for the best, as media enjoy their sensationalist headlines and take-away style stories with punchy conclusions. (I have only become aware of these issues ever since I started blogging myself and took an interest in where scientific misinformation came from and the growing movements to counter those misinforming sources,  Ben Goldacre  is a good example of such a crusader.) The information I wanted on the studies at issue, I couldn\u2019t find either via the  Mind for Minds  page or the  ARNNZ  page (and I struggled to see the relationship between the two pages on top of that). My efforts to find out more information from the researchers took a while to get results (which is understandable considering they have jobs that don\u2019t include communicating with random bloggers). When I did get responses, it was confusing as to who I was meant to be communicating with and through which contacts. Going through this process has highlighted for me the sorts of communication issues that scientists can face. But I think it also shows why it matters to make the effort, because their answers have changed my mind, and I hope in turn I can change others\u2019 minds too. I have gone from having doubts and concerns and not wanting to be part of the study, to feeling like it would be an exciting privilege to be part of the study. I have been reassured about the protections in place for my son and any samples taken from him. I have a positive view of what the researchers hope to achieve, and the way in which they are going about it. And I am reassured that the down-sides of participating are less than I thought, and the upsides are more than I\u2019d anticipated. I am still very aware of others\u2019 concerns about misuse of the resulting data in such a way that may ultimately hurt the autistic population, but I am also aware that the scientists have no intention of damaging \u2013 but rather of helping \u2013 that population. Are all my own concerns and worries addressed and gone? No, but they are significantly allayed, so that I will be talking to my husband tonight about signing our son up to the studies. I am grateful that the researchers took the time to respond to me, and gave me the chance to share it through my blog. I may just be an unpaid blogger, but I am also a Tutor, a Board of Trustees member, a mother; a member of the autism community. In their willingness to communicate with me about the study in the way that they have, the researchers evidence their multidimensional approach of wanting to involve the community in their research. A final reminder; that you can find out more about the study, the researchers, and register or donate,  via this page . I may yet receive answers to the specific set of questions I forwarded to Researcher X, if I do and it adds to what has already been shared, I shall be posting on that too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/78364563@N00/38541060/in/photolist-4pwV3-5skAV-76Tn3-8TPwj-dqaKB-ecncY-hhRhx-hi1Ap-j5TCu-oSiC9-qsLkf-qG7Ze-s7vbS-tSurr-whokH-ypv6D-yNaU3-CnQx4-CZrWC-29R4Pc-34zecD-3atq8S-4DAcxX-4DErFh-4DEzS3-4DEAZJ-4G5Web-4V91dM-54F4yx-56hb6Q-5e9imY-5nkV8C-5nuZhP-5sUrQc-5xX6Tb-5ys7Kr-5zCXQx-5D3wMu-5HQH4e-5HURN9-5Rk4Nn-5UXTEf-5YCde7-62Yv2h-65UcxU-69CWn2-6abfwj-6aw2GK-6hNzeY-6kPCop-6kPCMp", "http://www.badscience.net/", "http://www.mindsforminds.org.nz/", "https://www.arnnz.org/", "https://www.arnnz.org/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/gathering-autism-dna-part-two-researchers-respond/", "title": "Gathering Autism DNA, Part Two: Researchers\u00a0Respond."},
{"date": "August 24, 2013", "body": "There have been a fair few  local news stories  lately, about the new project here in New Zealand to gather and study the DNA of autistic individuals. The research project is currently actively recruiting people and seeking much-needed monetary donations. (You can find out more about the project and how to register  here. ) By Lawrence OP, via Flickr My initial reaction was a disinterested interest; I found the project interesting at an intellectual level, but I quickly dismissed the idea of involving my own family in the study. After that I largely put the issue out of mind, until one of my Facebook page fans asked whether I was aware of the study and what I thought about it, while she let me know that she personally had concerns. After that I decided to reach out personally to the researchers, to ask them whether they\u2019d be interested in answering some questions and addressing some concerns, that I could then share on my blog. I haven\u2019t yet received any sort of reply or even acknowledgement of my email \u2013 which in itself is fine, they no doubt have floods of emails to work through \u2013 but I still want to write this post rather than wait on their possible reply for an unspecified amount of time. (If they reply later in time, I will provide an update.) Part of the reason I initially dismissed the study in terms of my own family\u2019s involvement, is because we\u2019ve taken part in these sorts of things before, and received only pain without any real benefit (pain of a blood test, waiting on appointment times, etc). The benefits that come from taking part in these sorts of long-term information gathering exercises is often so far in the future as to be of no personal benefit to the person or family contributing, and there is no doubt from what I\u2019ve heard from the researchers themselves, that this is a very long-term project that would take many years to harbour any even potentially useful results. Ultimately it may just be a matter of improved knowledge, that itself does not directly lead to any improvements in interventions. Of course knowledge in itself is not to be dismissed, that knowledge can be used to better understand and thereby better address various hardships of autism. It could be used to create more accurate diagnostic systems with associated flow-on benefits. It could be used to better predict how autism will impact an individual\u2019s adulthood. It could of course also be used \u2013 as many fear \u2013 to isolate autism markers that could then be used as information relevant to an abortion, as  we currently see with Down syndrome . The abortion issue brings with it a scary raft of associated concerns of what it would mean for those who live with autism already; will they come to be seen as people who should have never existed too? However, I am still strongly of the view that knowledge itself is a good that should be pursued, the ethics of what is done with that knowledge is always an important issue, but all the unknown goods that could come from it should not be thrown away in fear. We may find there are different types of autism, where some are natural variants which bring great benefits on the whole, while other forms come about by some sort of environmental insult that causes the individual to go through otherwise avoidable and serious suffering. If we can\u2019t even see the difference between the types, we\u2019re doing both versions a huge disservice. Considering my personal views then, why wouldn\u2019t I let my son and my family go through a bit of short-term pain and annoyance, for these grand potential benefits? The answer, for me at least, is that I have no right to put my own lofty ideals above my son\u2019s present well-being. In the calculus of benefit versus disbenefit and my obligations as a mother, this is not something we choose to take part in. As an adult one day, that is a decision he could make for himself, and I respect and understand why many autistic adults can and will choose to donate their DNA to such studies. I completely understand why caregivers will volunteer their children too; I don\u2019t want to come across as attacking those positions. For us though \u2013 for me, and for my son at this age \u2013 it is not the right thing to do. If there had been public reassurances and open consultations to address these concerns, others would not be so strongly against the study. Or if there was little pain and much immediate benefit involved with providing the DNA. But neither assurances can be realistically given; you simply can\u2019t promise data that will become public won\u2019t be misused, and (as I understand it) you can\u2019t provide high benefits for those involved in studies because that too is considered unethical (think of issues around paying people for their blood and organs). I make the right decision for us, you need to make the right decision for you. There should be no pressure or fear involved in that decision-making either way. I would be interested in hearing whether you are going to or would take part in a study that gathers \u201cautistic\u201d DNA, and why.

{"date": "August 29, 2013", "body": "There are two versions of the hardship-olympics that I see at play on Facebook on a daily basis, both are equally obnoxious and pointless. The first is when someone sharing their latest woe (eg, \u201cmy car won\u2019t start and I need to go pick up my kid from kindy\u201d), is responded to by the hardship-olympian (\u201cjust be glad you have a car and kids, I\u2019m too poor to own a car and I\u2019ve been trying to have kids for years!\u201d) The second sort are the passive aggressive status updates that follow the hardship-olympian reading someone else\u2019s woes but choosing not to respond directly (eg, \u201cdon\u2019t you hate it when people moan about their car not starting, but you\u2019ve never even owned a car to complain about!\u201d) Both sorts are a claim that the first person lacks perspective, and that the hardship-olympian is the enlightened person with \u201ctrue perspective.\u201d By Eric Beauliue, via Flickr All it really achieves is treating the other person\u2019s life and emotions like they\u2019re unimportant, and should be kept to themselves. It also makes the hardship-olympian look like an ignorant self-righteous individual, because you can just as easily attack their own \u201clook at me\u201d complaint. For example, with \u201chow about you stop complaining about your friend having a car and a child, at least you live in a country where women are allowed to drive cars and you have a partner to try to conceive with.\u201d There is no natural end to the hardship-olympics. (Even \u201cat least you\u2019re not dead\u201d can be countered with \u201cI\u2019d rather be dead than experiencing endless suffering.\u201d) The hardship-olympics are huge in the autism social community. It\u2019s obvious at the internal level; where those with children experiencing severe autism try to put those with milder symptom \u201cin their place\u201d (\u201cat least you can talk, my child is non-verbal\u201d). But it is also ever-present in the Mummy Wars, where if a \u201cnormal\u201d mother ever dare complain about, for example, taking her child to soccer, she is told to be glad her child can even leave the house. I get it, I really do, because I feel the frustration too. A\u00a0lot. But I realised very early on that those other mothers live in a different world than I do, a world they are unaware of but can\u2019t be held morally responsible for their lack of awareness. Before I had kids I was unaware of the hardships of motherhood, and before I had a special needs child I was blissfully unaware of what it was like to be part of a community where disabilities are the norm and not the exception anymore (and an awareness that in reality, they\u2019re never really an exception so much as an inevitability the longer you live, the more things you experience, and the more people you meet). The latest all-purpose \u201cget some perspective\u201d attack, is referring to the children in Syria to put someone else in their place. And the most common use of it over the last two days, has been an attack on anyone who dares to mention or have an opinion on Miley Cyrus\u2019 twerking episode. \u201cStop going on about Miley Cyrus, there are children dying in Syria!\u201d This is just another version of the hardship-olympics; you\u2019re trying to tell someone their perspective, opinion and experiences don\u2019t matter, because someone somewhere has life harder. Here\u2019s the problem with such grand-scale \u201cget some perspective\u201d attack: They\u2019re making the same errors over and over, that apply as much as to autism hardship competing as to Miley Cyrus opinions: (1) You\u2019re assuming an inability of the person you are attacking to care about more than one thing: Guess what, they can both care about Miley Cyrus AND care about the children in Syria! (2) There will always be someone or some place in the world that is worse off; right now Syria is on our radar, but those standing on their righteous podium about Syria need to be aware that there are plenty of other countries and people facing daily suffering too, and by the same reasoning, neither do those hardships mean that Syria doesn\u2019t matter. Suffering and\u00a0caring are not competitions. I could just as easily attack people who care about autism and disability issues, by telling them they should stop that rubbish and focus on Syria. (3) The idea that we must all be deadly serious all the time. That it is some personal failure to take a momentary interest in something not serious or not important. People are allowed to have diverse interests and shifting priorities from hour to hour, or day-to-day; judging them on what they like or care about this very second, is just ridiculous. There are times when the hardship-olympics, or the Miley Cyrus versus Syria issues, do matter: When there are  limited resources to go around . If you\u2019re trying to figure out whether funding should go to those with severe or mild needs for autism, then it may make sense to focus time and efforts accordingly, but even then it wouldn\u2019t negate the issues faced by those with different needs. Or if you think a newspaper sacrificed headline space to Miley Cyrus when it should have been talking about Syria; depending on the type of newspaper, that may indeed be a fair critique, due to why the newspaper exists and what priorities we expect to be highlighted when we pay for the paper. But neither of those sorts of more legitimate concerns are at play in forums like Facebook and in everyday conversations, where it is actually OK to deviate from constantly focusing on the worst events and experiences the world has to offer. It\u2019s actually OK to care about your own children, it\u2019s OK to worry about your mother\u2019s cancer, it\u2019s OK to wonder about Miley\u2019s ethics; it does NOT make you a bad person. The person attacking you for daring to care about something different from\u00a0what they do, for daring to live your life and worry about those closer to you;  that  person lacking compassion and the perspective of a real friend, is closer to a \u201cbad person\u201d in my books. Why do I care enough about this to write a post? Is it because someone attacked something I said or wrote on any of these topics recently? Not at all. I see it happening between my friends all the time lately, but even that nuisance factor doesn\u2019t go to the heart of why this upsets me enough to blog on it, it just pushes it to the forefront of my mind. The reason I care so much is because I\u2019ve seen what this \u201cforced perspective taking\u201d has done to some very sensitive people who I\u2019ve known throughout my life. I\u2019ve seen them in tears because they feel guilty for even worrying about something that matters dearly to them \u2013 because they think that made them bad people in others\u2019 eyes and evidences their selfish flaws. I\u2019ve seen people be too afraid to talk openly about and seek help for their troubles, because they think their troubles don\u2019t matter more than everyone\u2019s elses and they\u2019re just being self-involved or stupid. I\u2019ve seen and heard people second-guess whether they and their views matter at all, because they get told they don\u2019t and that what they think doesn\u2019t count in the grand-scheme of things. I\u2019ve had enough of seeing the most sensitive people being told they dare not care about themselves and their own lives, because someone else somewhere in the world has it worse than they do. When you get close to burn-out and need help and reassurance, you\u2019re told to think of the children in Syria instead, as if that\u2019s going to solve your problems or make your day better. All it does is push you closer to burn-out, and someone fragile and needy can\u2019t do anything to help Syria anymore than the people yelling at them that they should. Syria matters. Autism matters. Motherhood matters. A broken-down car matters. None of these things mattering, negates the others. It\u2019s OK to care that Miley Cyrus doesn\u2019t twerk very well. It\u2019s OK that you exist, and that you sometimes have feelings and experiences that aren\u2019t as bad as your neighbours. Someone suffering more than you doesn\u2019t make them a better person than you, and someone yelling at you on the internet for not suffering enough to matter, is not a better person than you either. A friend who hears about your inability to pick your child up from kindy that day, offers to help you out, they don\u2019t take the opportunity to belittle you. You matter. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/30888219@N03/4730529801/in/photolist-8d2cGD-dWsWa8-9YWgQG-bNZPXe-bNZPTM-cMEWeQ-8kiu4R-8SbC79-9r5DQN-8ZJ42A-a2YSmX-7VjCh9-9FJL3F-9Z3GWC-87kNuc-8Tjavn-deAUe8-dxu6jX-82ZFDp-7Dd4Hd-9dyKsN-8Pi7MU-8Pi7Qw-bqhtxw-egdCHF-dX8pGj-89Jba5-89EVCt-89EVBc-dsDGn2-8Pr9Qq-8Pr9Ph-9EDVaQ-9EAZsv-9EDVsw-9EDVks-9EAZqa-9EAZuv-9EDVe7-9EDV8Y-9EDVqd-9EDViQ-9EDUVG-9EDV5s-9EDUUh-9EAZGr-9EDVgs-9EDVn3-dGcEzj-86Fyer-dGcqcC"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/hardship-olympics-miley-cyrus-and-syria/", "title": "Hardship-Olympics, Miley Cyrus, and\u00a0Syria."},
{"date": "March 15, 2011", "body": "\n Image by assbach via Flickr \n Non-verbal (or developmentally delayed pre-verbal) autistic people, don\u2019t have a \u201cvoice\u201d. Various therapies (such as facilitated communication) and organisations (such as ASAN) purport to find them that voice, albeit it through other people. There is always a danger in claiming you speak for someone else. The dangers range from \u201csimply\u201d misrepresenting their views and opinions, all the way to actively endangering their long-term well-being. The examples I mentioned above \u2013 facilitated communication and ASAN \u2013 are  controversial  to  say the least . But is there more danger in  not  providing non-verbal autistics a voice, than in providing them a contentious and incorrect one; would their interests go unacknowledged and over-ridden without such controversial measures? There are some vital considerations that seem to get side-lined in the passionate rhetoric that supports providing a voice in those ways. Two that I\u2019m going to expand on a bit here are that the autistic person is very likely to already have someone providing an informed and caring voice, and that there needs to be a focus on providing autistic people with means to express their  genuine  voice (which need not be verbal or written). At the risk of stating the obvious, every autistic person comes from a family. From the moment of birth, parents are given the role of speaking on behalf, and making decisions in the best interests, of their children. They are uniquely informed to do these tasks: They have the unrivaled life-time of knowledge and experience. If someone else speaks on behalf of their children \u2013 whether young or grown into adults \u2013 and it clashes with their own intimate understanding of their child\u2019s views and needs, then it makes sense to listen respectfully to those parents. Parents aren\u2019t around forever, but you hope that siblings and extended family will step up and continue to speak in the best interests of the non-verbal family member. Where there is a possibility \u2013 however remote \u2013 that an autistic person will be able to find their own voice with time, then that must be the focus. There are no short-cuts to finding their genuine voice; it\u2019s a long hard road to teach verbal and written communication. Communication is not just in the form of words either \u2013 as every parent of an autistic child well knows. Communication comes in the form of sign-language, facial expressions, eye-movements, gestures, touching, and even meltdowns. It is far better to grasp at and build on these efforts to communicate, rather than to try to artificially speed up the process by claiming to be their actual \u201cvoice\u201d. There remain problems though, of genuinely understanding the \u201cautistic perspective\u201d, and of protecting autistic people from well-meaning but misguided family members. However, the \u201cautistic perspective\u201d is not some singular thing. The idea that one person from within such a broad spectrum, can speak on behalf of all others, is absurd. Yes, there are some seemingly universal experiences that autistic people have in difference from neurotypical people, such as thinking very literally and in pictures. But the way autism manifests, and how severely it affects a life, differs hugely. And, more importantly, being autistic does not rob you of your individuality. Autistic people can and do vary in their political beliefs, their life-goals, their preferences and priorities. Even in their attitudes towards their own autism and how it impacts \u2013 both positively and negatively \u2013 on their lives. To claim to speak on behalf of all autistic people, treats them like some hive-mind. There is also the concern that family members speaking for non-verbal people, do not have their best interests at heart, or are seriously misguided in their attempts to do their best (such as resorting to chelation as if it could cure autism). But this is not a problem unique to non-verbal autistic people; even verbal children can suffer such indignities and errors. The government and the law is set up to protect the interests of the vulnerable people in society. Bad medical decisions can be questioned in a court of law, and systems are in place already for caring for abused or neglected people. These systems are not perfect, but they do exist for the small percentage of people who are not looked after by their own families the way that they should be. The vast majority of families like mine, do everything we can to set up our children to be happy and flourish. Listening to the perspective of autistic people \u2013 about both their own lives and about autism more generally \u2013 is very important. But when their voices are co-opted \u2013 and replaced rather than revealed \u2013 by other people (no matter how well-meaning), we need to speak up for them. We must not let our children, our family members, our friends, become pawns in other people\u2019s agendas, whether that be to further the popularity of a highly questionable therapy, or to promote a particular ideology. It is wonderful to respectfully represent the interests of those who cannot speak for themselves. It is far from wonderful to do it in a way that robs them of their individual voice. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/41534655@N00/262165233", "http://www.science20.com/countering_psychology_woo_and_science_asds/facilitated_communication_price_too_high_pay-75597", "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/03/does-ari-neeman-believe-parents-of-low.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/supplanted-voices-speaking-for-non-verbal-autistics/", "title": "Supplanted Voices: Speaking for Non-Verbal\u00a0Autistics"},
{"date": "March 13, 2011", "body": "\n Image by EadaoinFlynn via Flickr \n \u201cBad Science\u201d is one of the most important and impactful books I\u2019ve read: In the weeks since I\u2019ve finished it, it has changed my perception and reception of science media stories, advertising claims, and everyday conversations. I first took an interest in the book because of autism, specifically, because of the MMR-autism \u201cdebate\u201d. In particular, I wanted to better understand why and how the supposed link between MMR and autism had wormed its way into collective consciousness; why and how the media had picked it up and run with it, and why the story so appealed to the human mind in face of opposing evidence. It did answer those questions, but in doing so it also educated me about topics that I think we all need to better understand and be aware of. Such as the placebo effect, and how science finds \u201ctruths\u201d. In explaining and examining the scientific method, Goldacre could have easily lost his audience with technical jargon. He manages to keep the discussions interesting and relevant, though I did get a bit bored and overwhelmed when he got into the deeper details of statistics. (I have an irrational emotional reaction to the topic of statistics though, due to experiences with the subject at highschool and university, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that.) I didn\u2019t agree with everything he had to say \u2013 with every detail of conclusions and suggestions (such as his views about such topics as inequality of income, and cot death). But that didn\u2019t detract from the purpose and lessons of the book; essentially enabling people to be meaningfully critical of scientific claims. I say \u201cmeaningfully critical\u201d because there is a difference between blatant scepticism, and being able to pinpoint  why  one should be sceptical. The MMR chapter was right towards the end of the book, as it was an excellent example of all the things he tries to inform and warn you about in the first chunk of the book. (It\u2019s important to read the whole book, and in order \u2013 not just skipping to the parts you are most interested in. It\u2019s not a huge book, so that\u2019s not too much to do.) Not only did I find that key chapter interesting, and informative, I also found it quite emotional. I got near tears at one stage as I read it, because he so well understands what it\u2019s like to live with these children and live through these controversies. Again, I didn\u2019t \u201cagree\u201d with every detail of what he had to say in the chapter about MMR and autism, but the small points that annoyed me were gnats in a forest: They didn\u2019t detract from the brilliance of the whole. If I could \u201cmake\u201d people read any book, it would be this. Not just people interested in science, or autism, or the media. It will help you to not just better understand the claims of others, but also your own reactions to those claims. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/87305017@N00/4866544737"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/review-of-ben-goldacres-bad-science/", "title": "Review of Ben Goldacre\u2019s \u201cBad\u00a0Science\u201d"},

This was particularly true of playgroups and playgrounds.\u00a0 Other adults and children would steer clear of us, despite my best efforts to make us appear welcoming and non-threatening. But that\u2019s hard when your child hums and rocks and doesn\u2019t play, act or talk like the other kids. I did though feel welcome and understood, when I started being in situations with special needs children and their parents. Even when our children didn\u2019t have the same condition and challenges, we had all been through similar trials. We\u2019re all extra patient, we know we don\u2019t have to constantly apologise and explain to each other our children\u2019s unusual language and behaviours. Now that my eldest is attending school, I spend more time alone with my youngest (who doesn\u2019t have any special needs). Today I took him on two outings, to two local playgrounds. He did what normal children did, and so did all the other children at these playgrounds. I spoke to the other parents, and we talked about normal things, \u201cwhat\u2019s your daughter\u2019s name, how old is she, oh she has lovely hair\u2026\u201d. At first I felt like an imposter, pretending I wasn\u2019t a mother of a special needs child. But gradually I slipped into the role and got the hang of it, and even started to quite enjoy it. I felt like shouting, \u201chey look at us, we\u2019re normal!\u201d No one was avoiding me or my son, if anything they were actively engaging with us, in a way I\u2019d never really experienced with my eldest because his behaviour scares people off. Whereas I once felt like I belonged nowhere, I now oddly feel like I belong everywhere. I am a mother of a special needs child. I am a mother of a child without special needs. I\u2019ve had the usual concerns for a normally developing child, and the usual concerns for a seriously developmentally delayed child. I am usual! I haven\u2019t yet felt like these two mothering worlds are integrated; when I\u2019m out with both children I have to of necessity, resort to a mother of a special needs child because the eldest requires so much extra attention and care to avoid outing-ending meltdowns. I suspect as my mothering life progresses, that I won\u2019t notice the differences so much, but for now I am keenly aware of it and of how people treat me differently depending on which child is with me. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Children_trkali%C5%A1te.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/mothering-and-belonging/", "title": "Mothering and Belonging"},

{"date": "March 20, 2011", "body": "\n Image by REMY SAGLIER - DOUBLERAY via Flickr \n Before I started blogging about autism, the most controversial therapies I\u2019d come across were  ABA  and the  GF/CF diet . I knew there must be therapies I hadn\u2019t heard of yet, but I had no idea they were  in the hundreds , or how shocking some of those therapies would be. Sometimes I discover that what I thought was an interesting and harmless therapy, is actually quite destructive and largely disproven, such as  Facilitated Communication . I\u2019ve also stumbled across some therapies that look like more extreme versions of therapies we already use with success with our son, that make me wonder where the line gets drawn; such as the way we use  deep pressure with our son , but find \u201c packing \u201d highly disturbing. Every so often I hear of a therapy that makes me wonder just how desperate and gullible some parents are, such as  fecal transplants . I thought I was a desperate parent, but I will not try anything and everything in the unfounded hope that it will \u201ccure\u201d my son\u2019s autism. Fecal transplants might sound just silly and gross, but they\u2019re  also dangerous . Speaking of dangerous, I hadn\u2019t heard of  giving an autistic child chelation  before I started blogging either. If you\u2019re not shocked enough yet \u2013 and maybe you\u2019re not \u2013 then how about electric shock treatment, which is still being used today: Shocking autistic people many times a day as a behavioural intervention. To really understand all the horrors and abusiveness of this treatment, you\u2019ll need to  read about it for yourself . If you have experience with, and understand, autistic people, you will find it even more disturbing. And just when you think you\u2019ve heard it all (though by this point in my post you should know better than to think that), there\u2019s  chemical castration . By now I should be desensitized to writing all of those therapies down, but they still deeply upset me. That anyone would consider doing these things to my own son, endangering his life, or seriously damaging his long-term mental and physical health, takes my breath away. And yet, I do understand what those parents are thinking. From a parenting perspective, autism is hell, it is exhausting, and it can feel like a prison you\u2019re locked into for the rest of your life. Those feelings are particularly deep and strong in  that first year  as you adjust to the diagnosis. During that time the parent is also very unlikely to have done previous research into autism therapies, and will be vulnerable and open to suggestions about how they might reveal the child they\u2019d hoped to have. Add to all that, the fact that just about any idea can be made to sound rational with enough sciencey talk and confidence in its presentation. Perfectly rational human beings get sucked into what look like utterly irrational acts, whether that be hurting other people or hurting themselves. Which is why we have to be ever vigilant, with a healthy dose of skepticism. Especially when we have seemingly limitless power and control over the bodies and minds of such vulnerable people. There seems to be no limit to \u201ctherapies\u201d, so it is up to us to set our own limits. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/26866338@N04/5147547622", "http://www.autisable.com/706727084/jon-mitchell-an-autistic-says-no-to-neurodiversity-aba-and-special-education/", "http://www.asatonline.org/suggreading/reviews/elder.htm", "http://autism.healingthresholds.com/therapy", "http://www.science20.com/countering_psychology_woo_and_science_asds/facilitated_communication_price_too_high_pay-75597", "http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/01/packing-autistic-kids-french-scandal.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/12/bring-the-crazy-fecal-transplant/", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=299", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9074208/ns/health-mental_health/", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/12/electric-shock-school-matthew-israel", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/why_not_just_castrate_them_1.php"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/therapies-without-limit/", "title": "Therapies without Limit"},
{"date": "March 21, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n It is hard enough to understand and cope with autism. When your child has other conditions comorbid with the autism, it can both greatly increase the challenges you face in managing your child, and muddy the waters for understanding autism in the first place. Many of the controversial claims and treatments for autism, appear to stem from confusing together autism with those other conditions. For example, some autistic people also have  mental retardation . Yet how many times have you had to explain to people that being autistic doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re mentally retarded? (You see the same attribution error in regards to genius; some autistic people turn out to be geniuses, leading to unfounded claims that every autistic person is actually of well above average intelligence, a claim I still often see on parenting forums and have  written about previously .) Sometimes people mix together the fact that their own child has allergies or sensitivities to certain foods, with the fact that their child has autism, and go on to claim that every autistic child would benefit from a similar change in diet (even when you point out that your own autistic child has been tested for such food sensitivities and does not have them). Quite predictably, the list of conditions and problems that co-occur with autism, looks endless (though some conditions are not meant to be co-diagnosed with autism,  such as ADHD , although this  may change in the future ). Some co-conditions are common (such as  seizures ), and some comparatively rare (such as  Tourette Syndrome ). For each of those variations, you may need to make adjustments to therapies and medications. Though from my own reading thus far on the topic, it would appear that autism is considered the \u201cdominant condition\u201d: It\u2019s hard to treat other conditions if you don\u2019t take into account the autism, and the autism so widely affects a child that it can often hide or disguise other conditions. That is not necessarily a problem though, if the therapies already in place to improve autism, also address the other complications. A good developmental pediatrician, will do their best to figure out every condition affecting your child, by a range of tools (including blood tests and extensive questioning and observations). This is one of the reasons it is so important to not simply self-diagnose or diagnose your child without professional guidance. It can be hard to tell the difference between autism and other conditions, let alone between certain common aspects of autism and similar behaviours that are independent conditions (for example, is your autistic child obsessing, or do the have  obssessive-compulsive disorder ). In turn, that understanding can affect whether you should try to eliminate, modify or ignore various behaviours. Being conscious of this problem of figuring out what \u2013 if anything \u2013 is comorbid with your child\u2019s autism, helps to untease many of the otherwise avoidable confusions and disagreements in the autism community. It\u2019s part of why we have to be so careful about moving from the statement \u201cmy child improves on this treatment\u201d to \u201call autistic children will improve with this treatment.\u201d For all the anecdotes, for all the studies, we must first and foremost always respond to the child in front of us. Those are good starting points (obviously studies rank above anecdote), but we must be ready to observe the results these approaches have on our own children, and respond accordingly. (For those of you wondering how you are meant to measure the impact of various treatments on your autistic child, I\u2019d point you  in the direction of ATEC  as a great option.) I\u2019d be interested to hear about if your child has a diagnosis of \u201cautism and\u2026\u201d, and how this has impacted (if at all) on the therapies or medications you use with your child. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_comorbid_to_autism_spectrum_disorders#Mental_retardation", "http://www.mugsy.org/connor112.htm", "https://sfari.org/news/-/asset_publisher/6Tog/content/researchers-probe-genetic-overlap-between-adhd-autism?redirect=/news", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_comorbid_to_autism_spectrum_disorders#Seizures", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_comorbid_to_autism_spectrum_disorders#Tourette_syndrome", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_comorbid_to_autism_spectrum_disorders#Obsessive-compulsive_disorder"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/autism-and/", "title": "Autism And"},
{"date": "January 21, 2014", "body": "My son\u2019s relationship with the spoken word, is a combative one. Combative not just in his own attempt to master the use and meaning of language, but also in his attempts to control others\u2019 use of words. The most alarming example is one I\u2019ve shared in a previous post called \u201c A Silent Mother ,\u201d which I find shocking to reread even though I lived through it. In that post I recount how my son used to hit my mouth and bite and attack whenever I tried to talk to anyone but him. With a background of him once being largely nonverbal at an age when other children were speaking in fluent sentences, and the added history of the violence he once inflicted on hearing me speak to others, I wondered whether what I\u2019m about to write is even worth sharing; because yes what he now does is upsetting and controlling, but how can I complain in light of where he once was? Still, I know what we go through with him even now is far outside the normal parenting experience, so I think it\u2019s worth writing down, even if only years from now I can look back and be happy with the progress. By Thijs Hooiveld, via Flickr My eight year-old autistic son \u2013 a gentle, loving, happy young man \u2013 tries to control the sentences of those around him. When he is denied the control and change he seeks, he can get very distraught and end up perseverating anxiously, crying or shouting his demand over and over. What sorts of demands? I\u2019ll list the most common recurring ones: (1) He wants people to use exact phrases and versions of words, for example you have to say \u201cMiddle School\u201d not \u201cMighty Middle School,\u201d and he gets remarkably angry at anyone \u2013 even a total stranger who has only just met him \u2013 calling him by his first name without shortening it to his preferred version. (2) He  still struggles with other people using different languages  around him, loudly insisting they are only allowed to speak English (he will have a real go at Dora\u2019s use of Spanish on TV). (3) If he overhears two people in conversation, he may demand to know what they are saying to each other, frequently interrupting the conversation to make his demand. (4) He wants an explanation of every unknown word, this includes unknown words that are not even spoken to him and unknown words that occur on the TV or radio, which would be fine if it didn\u2019t include him asking for the same word to be defined many times a day and include loud frequent interruption of conversations and live TV shows. (5) He gets extremely upset if you can\u2019t repeat a sentence he missed, word for word; he wants to know exactly what you said and can\u2019t let it go if you\u2019ve forgotten the sentence or if you insist he doesn\u2019t need to know what was said. I make a special and concerted effort to remain calm and patient when he gets caught up in these spirals. I try to turn them into learning opportunities, and try to empower him to find and figure out meaning for himself, or remind him yet again that other languages are good and fine, or that he needs to be polite and not interrupt others conversations. Each issue seems to require a different type of response dependent on the circumstances, but they all carry that same sense of anxiety and need for control over his environment, even when that \u201cenvironment\u201d means people. I do struggle with it though, it is hard having someone constantly listening in and policing and making demands of your spoken language. It makes  me  feel anxious and on-edge to be constantly trying to meet his needs in this area (I do struggle with anxiety myself, and it has got a lot worse since dealing with my son\u2019s autism). I try to remind myself of how far he\u2019s come and that he\u2019ll probably outgrow this like his other language issues over the years, but I also wonder whether he\u2019s going to need anxiety medication or some coping strategy I\u2019m unaware to address the way he fixates and reacts to others otherwise-benign conversations. I see this as part-in-parcel with his wider anxiety responses to a whole range of things that we also manage and help him with as best we can. This is not to say it\u2019s not possible to have a semi-normal conversation with my son, it just takes extra mindfulness and consideration to avoid pitfalls that set him off. And I don\u2019t want to create the impression that he is some sort of mini-monster, because truly he is just so sweet and smart and I love him beyond measure. It\u2019s just hard. A lot. Especially when I have him in my care from 6am to 8pm everyday during the over-a-month of school holidays (which, by the way, is part of why my posting is so sporadic of late). So if you have some advice, some insight, some reassurance, or just some sympathetic understanding, please do share it. In the meantime I will just keep reminding myself to be grateful he lets me speak without hurting me anymore, and even more so how wondrous and special it is that he can speak  his own mind  at all. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/90889565@N00/2206508102/in/photolist-4mYVZ9-4sNeED-4vRknu-4xbCBU-4yqVPL-4D5L3o-4EWtGY-4HTtxg-4N5mng-4PFoXp-4Tgt8v-4XKD2o-56dRWh-56fFdw-59Su3B-5c3D7a-5wfe5h-5yvpLT-5ySAZr-5ySB5D-5yWVcb-5FfgsG-5L3bwB-5QM6Bt-5Rxe8J-5WFMNh-5YcHK3-61Zdhq-64ssqG-661qSx-67Ct6E-6bu1hx-6gDxpY-6kpC2g-6kAjMZ-6mC6Px-6mDr1a-6osbVp-6pa2cY-6qFpxD-6rvpsH-6vLhpM-6xg7jz-6zhfd5-6ziERM-6BN7rD-6G8r8F-6NCbVK-6SyRHX-6Umzfn-71t7B7"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/controlling-conversation/", "title": "Controlled Conversation"},
{"date": "March 25, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Plbmak via Flickr \n On the dining room table is a yellow bucket, containing five toys with mirrored surfaces. Along-side this bucket, are four time-devices (two alarm clocks, one wall clock, and a watch). Upstairs in my son\u2019s bedroom he has a slinky, three handkerchiefs, a Thomas toy and a tissue box, all sitting on a pillow (which he never uses for his head). These are his anchors for their respective rooms. No one else is allowed to touch or move his anchors, at risk of a meltdown. I use the word \u201cmeltdown\u201d, not \u201ctantrum\u201d, because once he gets into his meltdown, he becomes completely irrational and almost impossible to bring back to rationality. If I don\u2019t fix the anchor quickly (and sometimes even if I do), then everyone pays the price. Nothing will make him happy (he will say \u201cyes\u201d then \u201cno\u201d then \u201cyes\u201d over and over to anything and everything offered to him), he will end up screaming and shaking, breathless and utterly inconsolable. It can take an hour, if not longer, to get him to some semblance of calmness. His meltdowns used to include violence to people and property; I used to get regularly bitten, and hit. He would turn tables upside down, and throw objects with raged force. My son creates anchors in frequently visited places too. For example, at his great grandmother\u2019s house he collects together her watch, her late husband\u2019s watch, her wall clock and her standing clock, and places them all on the table. Once he\u2019s completed this ritual he might stand and look at them for a while, but there\u2019s also a good chance he\u2019ll then be in a state of mind where he will have some lunch and sing and play elsewhere in the house or garden. As long as people stay away from his anchor, that is. Lining up cars used to be his primary anchor \u2013 both at home and away from home. As long as he was free to line up cars, and then no one touched his line-up, he would feel comfortable enough to potentially interact with people, and toys besides those specific cars. His anchor doesn\u2019t always have to be in his line of sight, but he will regularly check on it (and will notice even the slightest tampering). I got into the habit of always carrying around three cars with us, so he could create an anchor for himself. Without an anchor, high anxiety levels (and what followed from that anxiety) was almost guaranteed. I\u2019d warn other people to please not touch his anchors. At an extended-family event one day, a not-so-nice family member decided it would amuse him to see what would happen if he shifted a line-up of cars my son had constructed (my son had gone to play elsewhere in the room). He moved one car, and my son noticed straight away and the meltdown started. I worked extra hard to avoid it getting out of hand, but his anxiety levels remained high for the rest of that visit. I spent the rest of that time dealing with the consequences of the broken anchor. I didn\u2019t know whether to cry or scream at that family member \u2013 I\u2019d warned them all, and what he had done was like torturing a special needs child in my book. I neither cried nor screamed, but I did lose a lot of respect for that person. I named these things \u201canchors\u201d for what might be obvious reasons by now. They\u2019re his constant \u2013 if you move them, you can essentially set him adrift into a sea of anxiety. Once he\u2019d placed an anchor, it needed to stay there until he was ready to move on (such as to go home). He doesn\u2019t need to constantly mind the anchor, just knowing it\u2019s there is enough. I see it as giving him a feeling of permanence and predictability in a constantly changing and confusing world. He struggles to understand social cues and rules, and to do what is expected of him, but at least his anchor holds steady. Keeping an eye out for his anchors \u2013 which change over time and in different places \u2013 affects my life as his mum of course. I have to be careful when I clean a room, that I replace his anchors carefully. I have to watch out for any changes in anchors too, so I don\u2019t move the wrong things. At the same time I can\u2019t let the entire household be ruled by his anchors; there comes a point when we\u2019ve all had enough of a particular anchor (maybe we need our watches back, or his brother desperately wants to play with that mirrored toy), so I have to carefully negotiate a partial release of an anchored item. At least now that his language is developing, I can perform that negotiation. I can forewarn him of what\u2019s about to happen, and if need be, reassure him that it will be returned to him later. When his communication skills were drastically more limited than they are now, such negotiation was quite simply impossible. If my son\u2019s anxiety levels are already high, it is never time to disrupt an anchor. If he is relaxed, smiling, and in a highly interactive mood, there is a chance I could completely dismantle an anchor and maybe not have to ever let that one be created again. However (isn\u2019t there always a \u201chowever\u201d?) he will simply move on to create yet another anchor with something else, and I might not recognise it for what it is, and again risk unintentionally disrupting it. \u201cBetter the devil you know\u201d. I do hope that someday he won\u2019t require anchors anymore \u2013 he\u2019ll be able to enter new situations, or be at home, and not have to make sure of the permanence of some \u201crandom\u201d object or objects. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I will end up having to shift his anchor to something small, moveable and unobtrusive, that he could carry with him to perform the same function \u2013 if that\u2019s possible. At this point though, knowing he has these anchors, and knowing how to deal with them, is like a sanity survival-mechanism for me too. It helps me to navigate his very-different world. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/8829172@N02/2763895688"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/my-sons-anchors/", "title": "My Son\u2019s Anchors"},

{"date": "March 23, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Jelle Druyts via Flickr \n There are various studies that have suggested a link between autism and pregnancy complications, though they\u2019re not particularly strong ( this meta-analysis  sums it up reasonably well). I had complications with my pregnancy, which I\u2019m going to share in this post, but I don\u2019t want people thinking this means I believe in a causal link; this post is part of the story of my autistic son\u2019s life, which was difficult before it even began. I\u2019ve shared parts of his birth story before, in  this post about his neonatal jaundice , and  this post about the after-birth . I appear to be writing this in chronologically reverse order! So here\u2019s the story of what came before\u2026 I got pregnant in my final year of law school. It was planned that way \u2013 I desperately wanted a child with my husband, but had timed the birth for after the completion of my degree. I sat my final exams at about seven months pregnant. I was working a couple of part-time jobs at law school during my pregnancy, as well as doing full-time study. I was a busy mummy-to-be, but I thought that with enough planning I could make it all work. From the start, there were problems. I\u2019d had a positive pregnancy test but I was regularly bleeding. The doctor warned me that I\u2019d probably had a miscarriage. When it turned out I was still pregnant, and the bleeding continued on a daily basis, I was sent to have a blood test to see what was going on with my hormone levels (to see if the baby was likely to \u201cstick around\u201d). They weren\u2019t going up as expected and I was warned that I might have an  ectopic pregnancy , which is to say, not only was I going to lose the baby, but my own life was in danger. Needless to say, they were wrong. But there was still the problem of the bleeding \u2013 what was causing it? Later a scan would confirm that I had placenta previa \u2013 my placenta was partially over my cervix. In fact, my placenta was also in about three parts, so all round it was being unhelpfully funky. Placenta previa can be life threatening to both baby and mother \u2013 as was true in my case. So through-out my pregnancy I had to be careful about what movement I made, and generally \u201ctake it easy\u201d. Every so often I\u2019d have more extensive bleeding and I\u2019d have to wait to hear the baby\u2019s heart-beat before everyone was reassured again that the baby was still OK (I got to hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat a lot throughout the pregnancy, and I got many more scans than an average pregnancy too). Placenta previa usually corrects itself as the pregnancy progresses \u2013 the placenta shifts further up the uterus wall. But mine was stubborn and refusing to shift as the final months arrived, so my midwife booked me in for a c-section. I\u2019d be warned from early on in the pregnancy that I should expect to have a c-section, and had focused on reading about and mentally preparing for it. I often spoke to my unborn baby and told him to just hang on; we just had to make it to the c-section date without bleeding out, and then we could be together. Close to the date of the surgery, they did another scan, that this time revealed the placenta had shifted enough away from the opening of my cervix that it would be safe for me to attempt a normal birth. (Even though the surgery was cancelled, someone forgot to tell the medical team: On the day I was meant to be having the c-section I got a call from them asking where I was, that the team was ready to proceed and waiting on me!) A couple of weeks after that, my waters broke. What happened after that (leading up to, and the birth itself) is also a bit of a disaster story, and I\u2019ll leave it for a future fourth installment. Suffice to say, nothing went as planned for me \u2013 not the pregnancy, not the birth, not the afterbirth, not the weeks that followed. And obviously, not the years after that either. Even when I planned for the changes to my plans (such as the c-section instead of the natural delivery), those new plans would also go out the window. I\u2019ll always be the type of person who plans out her life \u2013 sometimes to the minute \u2013 but life doesn\u2019t always pay attention to my efforts : Life is what happens to you while you\u2019re busy making other plans. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/45325809@N00/4319619378", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19567888", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001897/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/the-best-laid-plans/", "title": "The Best Laid\u00a0Plans\u2026"},
{"date": "March 25, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n When my son was born, I predictably went over-board with the photo-taking. I couldn\u2019t get enough of my gorgeous child. I particularly wanted to capture all his \u201cfirsts\u201d, but they were few and far between. He was in no hurry to explore or interact with the world, so I settled for just taking photos of him being so darn cute. As time went by though, it became harder and harder to take any photos \u2013 what should I be capturing? The crying, the screaming, the endless lining up of cars? Then I became so busy just trying to handle his meltdowns, that there was no time to pick up a camera, let alone print off and file away photos. We were descending into what I think of as \u201cthe dark years\u201d. There is little photographic record of this time, and it\u2019s not the sort of thing you want to remember either. It was years of being afraid of waking up each morning, because I knew what the day was going to be like: Endlessly (and usually fruitlessly) trying to interact with my son, and just dealing with his anxiety-ridden misery. Years of looking forward to night-time so it would stop, and counting the hours (and sometimes the seconds) until the day would end. It was at it\u2019s worst leading up to, and the couple of years after the diagnosis. While I was learning about autism and how to handle the condition in my son, I had to come up with my own ways of making sense of the madness I was observing: Why did he have his meltdowns, how could I avoid them, what were the signs they were coming, what could I do to fix them. I came up with my own terminology and analogies: \u201c anchors \u201c, \u201cthe filling cup\u201d, \u201c invisible red paint \u201c. (All of which will eventually have links attached to them as I write the future posts in this series.) I would use these ideas to explain to his therapists what I had seen in my son, and to talk to my husband and others about what was going on. Even now that I have a better understanding of how autism is affecting my son, and have access to various pieces of terminology for what I was observing, I still often think in terms of those original ideas I came up with. They help me figure out how to keep him calm, when to push him out of his comfort-zone and when to leave him alone, and what objects in the house I shouldn\u2019t touch and why! These days I\u2019m back to taking photos almost everyday. Life is still a daily challenge because of my son\u2019s autism, but my days are filled with things I want to remember, rather than wish I could forget. I think it\u2019s important though to provide some record of those darkest years. Without photos, the next best option I have is writing about it, and so you can perhaps understand why this blog is really very important to me.

{"date": "March 27, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Frank Wuestefeld via Flickr \n I\u2019ve had two and a half years of chances to \u201cout\u201d my child as autistic. Whether it\u2019s to family, friends, employers, landlords, neighbours, or strangers. In each situation I\u2019ve had to make a decision about whether it\u2019s the right thing to do for me and my son. Some situations are such regular occurences, that I have established personal \u201cbest practice\u201d rules (such as when interacting with strangers and their children in public playgrounds). Even then though I have to take into account variables \u2013 if the parent I\u2019m talking to shows an awareness and (positive as opposed to judgmental) interest in my son\u2019s unusual behaviour, I am far more likely to talk about his autism. There are both positive and negative considerations on whether, and how soon, to say my child is autistic. Before I go through them, I want to be clear that they don\u2019t include a sense of shame about my son\u2019s autism. I do not think that having an autistic child makes me a worse person or a worse mother. I feel no need to have everyone tell me how superior my son is to other children (\u201c mompetiton \u201c), so in turn I feel no shame with the fact that he is developmentally delayed and not able to do what most children his age can. With that out of the way, here are some of the key considerations: Discrimination , directed towards either myself or my son: If I think someone is going to treat us worse because of my son\u2019s autism, I will not share it. Examples are applying for a rental property or a new job. If it\u2019s absolutely essential that they know, of course I\u2019ll share the information despite the potential discrimination. But I am fully aware of the ignorance and confusion that abounds about autism. If I\u2019d told our landlord in our application that our son had autism, there\u2019s a good likelihood they would have been reminded of  stories about autistic children destroying rental properties , without understanding that not every autistic child exhibits those behaviours. Similarly, in applying for jobs, having an autistic son can mean it\u2019s harder for us as parents to do over-time or stand in for other workers when they are sick. But because we only take jobs which match the hours we are able to work with as a family, our son\u2019s autism is largely irrelevant. If we told every employer at the outset that we have a special needs child, they may (wrongfully) presume us to take lots of days off work to deal with our son. Again, that is true of some families with an autistic child, but not ours. (I want to be clear though, I\u2019m not saying those families deserve to be discriminated against, I\u2019m just explaining that such concerns would be irrelevant regardless for our family.) Explanation  is another reason for sharing the fact of my son\u2019s autism. If his behaviour is confusing or upsetting other people (for example,  his happy dance  has frequently been mistaken for an expression of anger), then I will bring up his autism to explain what is going on. If someone has invited me (and perhaps my whole family) to attend events and I keep turning them down, I will explain that my son\u2019s autism affects my availability and what we can do as a family, in order to avoid appearing rude or uninterested in the event. My own friendships . In order for me to make new friends, and even to maintain old friendships, I have found I need to be open about my son having autism, since it is so utterly central and impactful on almost every area of my life. Maybe years from now it won\u2019t be so central to my world, because his autism will be less severe, but for now it most definitely is. The reactions when I tell people my son has autism, are predictably diverse. There are those who find it interesting and want to know more about autism and its impact. There are those who put distance between themselves and their child, from me and mine. There is a rather large contingent of people who don\u2019t know what to say, so just smile politely, and continue doing and saying whatever they were doing and saying as if I hadn\u2019t said a word about it. But there is a special group of people I encounter every so often, which is one of the reasons I tend towards being open about my son\u2019s autism, rather than leaning towards hiding or ignoring it. They are the people who respond by saying they also have a family member with autism, or have taught people with autism, or are passionate about helping people with autism (you can insert the word \u201cspecial needs\u201d instead of \u201cautism\u201d there too). The knowledge of my son\u2019s autism / special needs, provides an instant bond and learning opportunity. I know they then have a certain intimate understanding of my son and myself, that is otherwise hard to convey (though I find after friends and family have read my blog, that they get a good feel for what it\u2019s like \u2013 blogging is great). After I meet these people, I always walk away feeling uplifted and happier than when I started out. Whether you decide to \u201cout\u201d your child or not, and when, depends on the severity of the autism (which may change over time), and the situations you find yourself in. It\u2019s another one of those topics where I suspect experience will change my attitudes over time \u2013 towards sharing the fact of his autism more or less than I currently do. I would be interested in hearing about your own attitudes and experiences, and what other factors you personally take into account when trying to make the decision about telling people that your child has autism. *** I was inspired to write this post after reading  this  over at  Autism Army Mom\u2019s blog .

{"date": "March 31, 2011", "body": "\n Image by smaneal via Flickr \n \u201cInvisible red paint\u201d is an analogy I came up with years ago, to describe some of my son\u2019s more confusing and upsetting behaviour. I didn\u2019t have other terminology to describe it back then; this behaviour was well in place prior to the diagnosis of autism. I suppose today I\u2019d refer to it as anxiety, obsession, sensory issues, and the result of the frustrations and confusions that come from not having language. \u201cInvisible red paint\u201d then is short-hand for a particular way all those problems manifested, that greatly and very negatively affected my whole family. There are always objects in a room that I must be careful about touching or moving, in my son\u2019s presence. This is still true today, but it used to be a lot worse (especially between the ages of two to four years old). Objects I had to be careful around included toys, light-switches, even couches, doors and windows. I became so tuned into figuring out what I was \u201callowed\u201d to touch, and not touch, that I started viewing rooms as full of objects splashed with red warning paint. I couldn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d the paint, but with enough observation and experience with my son, I could figure out what had invisible red paint on it in advance, in order to avoid the meltdown that would occur if I was to touch those things. Some objects always have invisible red paint on them (such as those I\u2019ve discussed in a previous post, called \u201c anchors \u201c). Other objects will have invisible red paint on them weeks or months in a row, such as when my son\u2019s obsessing over certain windows and doors being open or shut. If his anxiety levels are high, almost everything in a room can have invisible red paint on it; those days I felt like my arms had to be tight to my sides as I walked through the room, careful not to knock or rub against anything. Often times I felt like a prisoner in my own home. Unable to sit on the couch, change the TV channel, open a window on a hot day or close a door on a cold one. I would end up sitting stock-still on the floor, hoping no one would visit since they couldn\u2019t see the red paint, and would sit on or touch the wrong thing, and I would end up trying to deal with the consequent meltdown that might go on for hours. It was like living with a mad person, and going mad in the process. I was doing the best I could, to cope with a condition I didn\u2019t understand. When he had meltdowns, he was unable to understand or learn or develop, he was just lost in a sort of whirlwind of destruction that often included self-harm. So I thought that my awareness of this invisible red paint, which enabled me to avoid setting off his meltdowns by touching the wrong things, was enabling his growth and development since it meant more calm time when he was able to learn and interact. But I was also feeding the madness: The more control I gave him over his environment, the more time and energy he spent trying to hold onto that control. Therapists would come into my home to work with him, and to teach me new skills to deal with my son. I tried to explain to them this invisible red paint thing, I asked for their help in tackling the issue. For a long time they didn\u2019t understand, they didn\u2019t listen, which is one of the reasons I wish I\u2019d been dealing with an \u201cautism expert\u201d and not just various therapists who deal with a wide range of conditions. One particular incident with the therapists (or series of incidents) was quite upsetting for me: Whenever the therapists (mostly the speech therapist and occupational therapist) would visit, they\u2019d bring their own teaching toys. These toys did not have invisible red paint on them; my son seemed to only consider things that he owned in some sense, as being candidates for invisible red paint (such as objects within our home). So it was fine for the therapists to touch these \u201cintroduced toys\u201d, which also left with them each time. I tried to tell them that he wouldn\u2019t let me touch his toys, but here they had evidence that he was perfectly fine with people touching toys, and so concluded that the problem must be with me. They said I had to try to be a \u201cfun mum\u201d. Then proceeded to show me how to play with my son, using their introduced toys. I thought \u201cthis is ridiculous, I  know  how to play with my son\u201d, but did what they wanted to see anyway. They praised me for my efforts, thinking they\u2019d fixed that problem, then left with their introduced toys. The moment I tried to play with the toys that were left in the house \u2013  his  toys (the ones with invisible red paint) \u2013 meltdown city. When the therapists came back the next time, I tried to explain that it wasn\u2019t working. They were sceptical and showed me again how to play with my son (grrr). This time I told  them  to try playing with  his  toys \u2013 not the toys they had brought with them. You guessed it, meltdown. Oh whoops, guess it\u2019s not the mother\u2019s fault for not being a \u201cfun mum\u201d aye? They refocused their efforts to trying to find ways to interact with his toys that wouldn\u2019t set him off. They never found the key to washing off the invisible red paint (to gratuitously extend the analogy). The only thing that worked if someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 wanted to play with my son or interact with his environment, was to bring in new toys that would go at the end of each play session, or to take him to an external location so that nothing had red paint splashed on it yet (easier said than done since going to new places also set his anxieties off). If he spent any extended amount of time with particular objects or at particular places, it was as if I could slowly see the red paint building up, as he became more controlling over what could and could not be touched by others. It was partly what he learnt at those external locations, and with those not-owned toys, that would gradually and slowly provide the key to breaking the tight link between objects, invisible red paint and the meltdowns. It was also partly the passage of time that helped fix the problem. Because as his communication skills grew I could explain to him why certain objects had to be moved or touched. Once I could explain to him how timers worked, I could use that tool too to limit the behaviours by providing time limits for his control, then let him know how long it would be before he was allowed to control an object again. Also, as his communication skills developed, there was the possibility of negotiating with him; if he let me take away control of something, then he could have a reward of some sort. The key was always in avoiding the lead up to the meltdown though; trying to discipline or manage the meltdown once it had started was pointless since it\u2019s like all his senses shut down and he can\u2019t hear or see or speak. Just scream and cry and lash out. I no longer live in a house covered in invisible red paint. When his anxiety levels are particularly high though, I do start to see the room in terms of reddening objects. I\u2019m very mindful of never letting him get to the point where he\u2019s made me a prisoner in my own home again; if an object is becoming red, I make it clear to him that he can\u2019t obsessively control it, often by asserting that he can\u2019t have his way with it, then distracting him to something else so he doesn\u2019t become fixated. There are always things he\u2019s allowed to control (I\u2019m always encouraging his independence), but there\u2019s a difference between control and obsession; invisible red paint occurs where the two become a volatile combination. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/12784752@N07/1335938049"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/invisible-red-paint-and-the-not-fun-mum/", "title": "Invisible Red Paint, and the Not-Fun\u00a0Mum"},
{"date": "March 31, 2011", "body": "\n Image by cliff1066\u2122 via Flickr \n There\u2019s a video doing the rounds in the autism blogging community, which is getting a lot of positive feedback. The video is by \u201cRethinking Autism\u201d. You can find the  video here . I thought the video content was ill-thought out, unhelpful, and potentially quite damaging to the well-being of autistic children and their families. Clearly I was in the significant minority though, so I decided to give the organisation the benefit of the doubt, and looked up their  web-page . After that I was no longer unsure about the message the video was trying to give: It wasn\u2019t a mistake that it was demonizing the parents of autistic children, that was its aim. They unequivocally state as much on their web-page: \u201cUp to this point, celebrities and parents of  autistic children have dominated the media with their miracle cures and  unsubstantiated theories on causation. This exploits autistic people,  their family members and the public.\u201d You may notice the inherent contradiction already. The statement that parents are exploiting the families of autistic children, is a non-sequitur. That is the least of the problems, though it does hint at how ill-thought out their project is. I did note that on  another video they did , they start quoting the same paragraph I took the sentence from above, and removed the reference to \u201cparents of autistic children\u201d being part of the problem. Yet it is clear from both their website and subsequent videos that this is still at the heart of their message. Perhaps \u2013 at least for that earlier video \u2013 they realised that demonizing the very people they are trying to get their message to, is pointless and ridiculous. If the aim of this organisation, and their videos, is to stop the violence done to autistic children\u2019s bodies and minds, by unsubstantiated treatments, then they have my full support. Indeed they expressly state they are against using chelation, special diets, and restraints. Surely though, the attack should be made on the use of those methods by the people making money off and promoting it \u2013 the \u201cprofessionals\u201d. Parents get sucked in by the marketing and the false promises, they are being effectively being lied to and stolen from. They are victims too (though lesser victims than their children of course). Why further victimise them? I am going to quote from the main video doing the rounds, and explain the problems with the message it sends. I will use some editing of the text, but I will not add any words, or subtract anything important (for example, when I quote about the mother thinking of chelation, I\u2019m  not going to include the bit about it being cheaper in Mexico). The setting is a parental help-group, with a bunch of mothers and fathers sitting in a circle: \n A Mother: \u201cSo, we\u2019re thinking about chelation\u201d \n Adult autistic woman (who speaks each time but goes \u201cunheard\u201d): \u201cCan\u2019t you die from that?\u201d \n No concerns from me about the dialogue yet, adult autistic woman is correct. \n A Father: \u201cHe threw a fit, started screaming in the barber shop, it was so embarrassing.\u201d \n Adult autistic woman: \u201cWhy did you let the barber touch him without asking?\u201d \n OK, what just happened there? The parents of autistic children are primarily concerned about the  embarrassment , not the  fit ? At this point it\u2019s looking like a parody of how parents react and what parents worry about. I\u2019ve never met a parent who complained about the \u201cembarrassment\u201d, they worry about their child, and yes they get concerned about everyone judging them \u2013 because other people do stare and make ignorant comments. The word \u201cembarrassed\u201d distorts and trivialises the entire experience from the parenting perspective. And her response, what the hell? \u201cWhy did you let the barber touch him without asking?\u201d In my experience (surely I\u2019m not the only parent having these experiences), the parents of autistic children go out of their way to do everything thinkable to make such experiences positive for their children. They use rewards, they use social stories, they may even just cut their child\u2019s hair at home for the first four years of their life \u2013 small pieces of hair at a time, across many days \u2013 to avoid the child getting upset *cough*. I\u2019m reminded of the child I saw at the special needs school I visited who had an entire class session dedicated just to preparing him for his first ever hair-cut, because his parents have never been able to get him a barber. Never. Because they knew how upset it made him.  That  is the typical parent of an autistic child, not someone who forces their child to a hairdresser then complains about the embarrassment. \n A Mother: \u201cI feel like she\u2019s trapped somewhere in there.\u201d \n Adult autistic woman: \u201cBut she\u2019s right there in front of you.\u201d \n Parents want to understand their child. They want to know and understand their thoughts, their feelings, their desires, their dislikes, etc. Whenever I\u2019ve heard a parent say their child seems trapped inside, they\u2019re referring to the frustration of not being able to access those thoughts and feelings,  not  (as this video dialogue suggests) that the child they  really  want to have is nowhere to be seen. \n A Father: \u201cSo sad how we can\u2019t have birthday parties, she\u2019s too afraid\u201d \n Adult autistic woman: \u201cWho are the parties for, you, or her?\u201d \n Oh for god\u2019s sake. The parental concern is about the child\u2019s anxiety reaction to change, crowds, noise etc. The adult autistic woman\u2019s reaction is again to belittle those concerns and cast them as if it\u2019s a selfish response. If this was a genuine help group, the follow-up would be to give the father methods to help the child adjust to such situations, because life is (after all) full of such situations (crowds, noise, change) and he needs to learn how to help his daughter cope with that. Yes, the daughter might turn out to prefer not to have parties, and that\u2019s fine. But if there\u2019s a chance to provide her with the skills to cope with \u2013 and even enjoy \u2013 parties, then there is nothing wrong with trying to achieve that. Plenty of parents stop trying to give their autistic children parties, or change the types of parties, for their children. In fact, many parents isolate themselves and stop throwing any parties \u2013 even for  themselves  \u2013 because their children can\u2019t cope with the situation. \n A Father: \u201cWhat about school, he just doesn\u2019t get it!\u201d \n Adult autistic woman: \u201cAccept that he learns differently.\u201d \n Parents know this, and the vast majority of parents fight tooth and nail for their children in the education system, because they understand this so very well. That agonizing choice of whether to send your child to mainstream school with (never enough) support, or a special needs school, or even to homeschool them. Parents of autistic children don\u2019t just dump them in a class then complain about how the  child  doesn\u2019t get it! They spend their time and energy trying to make sure the  school  gets it. Again, instead of attacking and casting the parent as the ignorant selfish one, look for the real problem here \u2013 the education system. (Just like the attack about the false treatments should be laid at the feet first and foremost of the practitioners, not the parents who are just doing the best they can.) \n A Mother: \u201cHe never tells me that he loves me\u2026\u201d \n Adult austistic woman: \u201cEvery time he touches you he\u2019s saying that he loves you.\u201d \n Well that sounds nice doesn\u2019t it. But considering that many autistic children struggle to even touch people, let along hug or kiss their parents, and considering how often the only \u201ctouch\u201d you get as a parent from a low-functioning autistic child, is a hit or a bite, it\u2019s a bit too simplistic (and wrong) to say every touch is a sign of love. Maybe that\u2019s the problem here \u2013 I am speaking from the perspective of a parent trying to raise a not-high-functioning autistic child. But I do not presume to speak for high functioning autistic people or their parents. I don\u2019t even presume to speak for all parents of low-functioning autistic children, I wouldn\u2019t be so bold, ignorant or arrogant. I present my experiences, my perceptions, and try to inform people about what it\u2019s like living with an autistic family member. The video though does not distinguish between high versus low functioning autistic people, in fact it openly suggests it\u2019s speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves (which classically incorproates those who are \u201clow functioning\u201d). The therapies I have provided to my child, the therapies so many parents try with their children, are not at their heart about denial or change of autism and the child\u2019s essence, but about providing their child with the ability \u2013 the  freedom  \u2013 to choose what they want from their life. Giving them the skills they need to get a job, should they so choose. To talk, should they so choose. And if \u2013 after everything is said and done \u2013 the child becomes an adult who wants to accept, embrace and retain autism as the centre of who they are, that \u201cwithout autism, there would be no me\u201d (a statement made at about the 2 minute mark on their  video here ), then so be it. That is their choice as a free thinking, capable adult. But it is up to us as parents to help them reach that point where they can make that decision. Just because my son loves maths, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to make sure he also learns writing and art and biology. In every part of his life, I am giving him options. I am giving him  freedom . In so doing, I am not depriving or destroying him. Quite the opposite. It is so important to remember that supporting a parent of an autistic child, is to support their child too. These parents are stressed and under-resourced, desperately trying to learn about autism, and to help their child. Like many such parents, I\u2019ve been through hell trying to help my son find joy and pleasure in his life, instead of miserably crying, afraid of anything new or different, and unable to communicate his ideas and thoughts. The therapies we\u2019ve used with him, have worked, and he has become a happy and thriving little boy. The therapies have not stiffled or hurt him. He still faces significant challenges because of his autism, and yes I would wipe out every single one of those challenges if I could. I would wipe out his anxiety, I would advance his speech, I would make him as physically able in both fine and gross motor skills as his peers (and better if I could). I would  not  pay any price to achieve those things though, as I have said in numerous previous posts where I have spoken out against unscientific and disproven therapies (such as  here , and  here ). There is nothing implicit in wanting the most and best for your child, that leads a parent to using dangerous and unproven treatments. What parents need is information; not to be called selfish, and be belittled and demonized for their concerns. It\u2019s fantastic that adult autistic people want to be part of the discussion about what is best for autistic children, but being autistic doesn\u2019t make them experts on what is best for children, and neither does  not  being autistic mean a parent  doesn\u2019t  know what is best for their child. I will always be interested in autistic view-points, but autistic people are always still individuals, with their own politics and preferences and desires. There is no \u201cone\u201d autistic voice, and even if there was such a thing, I doubt it would go around telling parents how evil and pointless it is to try to give your child every option and advantage in this world. It would surely say \u201cthank you for sacrificing so much for me, but please make sure those sacrifices are based on good humane science\u201d.  That  is a message worth hearing. *** If you disagree with what I have written in this post, then I openly and honestly invite you to say so.

{"date": "June 20, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n When you write posts in WordPress, it automatically generates free-use pictures that you can choose from, to accompany your post. If my post happens to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d you can almost guarantee that the picture you now see to the right, will be one of the ones presented. If I can\u2019t find another picture more closely related to the content of my post, I invariably fall back to this. I used to have it as my \u201cAbout\u201d page picture too (prior to Clara doing a personalised picture of my family, which now holds pride of place there instead). I used it yet again the other day, and my husband made some off-hand comment about how often I use it. In the process of explaining to him why I find it so attractive, I realised that it really does carry a lot of meaning for me, and sums up (to my mind) many complexities and issues in viewing autism. So in a rather self-indulgent post, I\u2019ve decided to share with you why this is currently my favourite photo for representing autism. I tried to find information about the original photographer and whether he\u2019d attached or explained any further meaning than the fact that it represents \u201cautistic play\u201d. Best I could find out is that his name is Kevin Fruet, and his own son has autism. No doubt he had his own thoughts about how he took the photo and what it meant to him, and I can hope that he wouldn\u2019t mind me reading my own meanings into it too. So here is what I see in that photo, and what it means to me: The puzzle represents a normal challenge, that normal children can meet. The autistic child who has attempted this puzzle, has seemingly failed. That failure is defined by the expectations of the puzzle and the puzzle-maker. The objectivity of their failure, is \u2013 as such \u2013 contextual, and in a sense, an artifact. If we choose to view and assess the child\u2019s creation in a different way, we don\u2019t have to see and focus on the failure. We can see instead their determination to get all the shapes on the highest (most accommodating) spike. We can see that they succeeded in what they set out to do \u2013 here are all these shapes, standing where they\u2019re not meant to stand, but doing a great job of what they\u2019re not meant to do, all the same. So whether we view the child\u2019s work as failure or success, depends on our frame of reference. At the very least, we must be conscious of, and acknowledge, our frame of reference. A related layer of meaning is the lacks and the excesses of autism. The empty pegs represent the seemingly missing abilities of the autistic child \u2013 such as verbal language and the social interaction. But in the same way that we note the lacks or the short-falls, we mustn\u2019t forget the loaded fifth peg \u2013 the excess talents that frequently accompany autism (eg incredible eye for detail, astounding memory, impressive intensive focus, hyper sensory awareness). Unfortunately that fifth peg isn\u2019t just loaded, it is  over -loaded, in turn the excess talents of many autistic people often overload them, in such a way that we might re-label the excess as just another \u201cproblem\u201d instead of viewing it as potential for something extraordinary. Another interesting thing about this photo that appeals to me so much, is that our eyes are drawn to the evidenced play in the centre; it is the focus and in focus. We see the problem first (the incorrectly completed puzzle), in the same way that we see the negative symptoms (behaviour, social and communication limitations) of autism first. But there is something in the background that is out of focus and should be in the foreground always of our thoughts: The child. The human being. The individual. In this photo the child is obscured by the evidence of their challenges. There are various other aspects of the photo that hold special meaning for me (such as that my son used to play with a similar puzzle at his ABA playgroup, and that he has commented to me before about details he sees in the picture that I had failed to notice), but what I have shared above sums up the more abstract appeal of the picture for me. I\u2019ve become increasingly aware lately of the artistic talents and insights of autistic people. If you know of any such artists who have captured your imagination, or just have a picture like the one above that captures the beauty or complexity of autism for you, I would be grateful if you\u2019d share those with me too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/analysis-of-an-artistic-instance-of-autism/", "title": "Analysis of an artistic instance of\u00a0autism"},
{"date": "June 12, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Food was used as a reward in both ABA (a type of behavioural therapy) and PECS (a system used for speech therapy) for my autistic son. In both situations I felt very uncomfortable with this type of reward, for a variety reasons, including that I didn\u2019t want to associate food with reward (the problems of the obesity epidemic get drummed into you as a parent-to-be); I didn\u2019t want to be giving him his favourite foods as often as the reward systems required (his most motivating food was chocolate drops); and frankly, it felt like I was treating him as a dog. I also worried that we would be setting up a life-long dependence on physical / external rewards for behaviour, which was counter to how the world really operates; often you just have to do things because it\u2019s the right thing to do, or because it has to simply get done. In both situations \u2013 PECS and ABA \u2013 the people implementing the system explained to me why we were using that particular reward, and though it still concerned me at an emotional level, it allayed my concerns enough to give it a go. I still read about other people worrying over this system of reward, to the point that it puts them off trying these therapies at all, which I think is a real shame. So I\u2019ve decided to share what I learnt re why the food reward works so well, and why you need not fear about long-term consequences of such a reward system. The first step for setting up any reward system, is to first confirm that the reward matters to the child. If the child is not motivated by any foods, then using foods would be pointless. Where there are multiple potential rewards \u2013 eg a toy or food \u2013 it is better to choose the food option. This is because the food is taken then used up in a short space of time; there is nothing to \u201ctake away\u201d in order to re-set the reward. So if you used a toy for example, there would need to be a limit on how long the child played with the toy \u2013 more specifically, to be able to use that toy as a reward again you\u2019d have to take it away, and that might (very likely would) cause a melt-down, and there goes your learning session. Also, the distraction of having and playing with the toy (or any other non-consumable) is a significant distraction from the learning session. Usually you\u2019ll have chosen a time in the day when the child is receptive to learning (they\u2019re well rested, alert), so you want to make the most of that window in time, and not have it all taken up in play-time with the reward. The amount of food need not be significant, so your child\u2019s diet isn\u2019t going to be ruined by too many sweets, and it\u2019s not going to make them obese. In fact, it is best for the food to be very small amounts so it can quickly be consumed (return to the next lesson), and leave the child desiring more (a full and fully satisfied child isn\u2019t going to be as responsive to the reward). The food reward is also only an initial stage of learning, to set up a close and strong relationship between desired behaviour or learnt skill, and a positive emotion. Once the idea has been taught \u2013 for example that using a PECS card can get you what the picture shows, or linking the behaviour of sitting down with the request to sit down \u2013 then the reward can either be phased out or replaced. In PECS, the idea is easily phased out once the child learns that picture X means you get item X, because you can move on to item and picture Z. More complicated steps follow \u2013 when the PECS cards move on from a system of request, to a system of communication more generally \u2013 but it needs to start with that initial established link between a picture card and an outcome that the child desires. In ABA, the food reward can be replaced with social praise, which should have always happened simultaneously with the food reward from the start \u2013 in turn reinforcing the importance and relevance of social praise (which is a challenge for many autistic children). More importantly, with ABA, learning that verbal instructions or requests are linked to performed actions (\u201cplease sit\u201d, child sits \u2013 initially with physical help from instructor, eventually by themself \u2013 gets food and praise), is in itself a rewarding experience for the child; their world starts to make more sense and by performing requested actions (eg sitting) they get more of what they want in the world independently of the food reward (eg being read their favourite book since they sat down when asked and where required). So, in summary, the negative reaction many of us parents have to using food as a reward \u2013 concerns over obesity, the type of food, and making it feel like our child is a dog \u2013 need not concern us when we understand the reality of this system of reinforcement: Not only are the food rewards small, they are also phased out as the initial skills of each therapy are learnt. They are also highly effective, because they provide immediate positive reinforcement, and are consumables, allowing the lessons to continue, and making the most of that window of learning. The outcomes from successful (and correct) implementation of such therapies, are so strong and positive, that they are worth that initial and brief emotional discomfort as a parent. Which is not to say that every implementation of these therapies is done well / correctly, nor that every child will respond as well as our son did to these therapies; merely to say that the food reward system in itself, is not a reason to turn away from these therapy options. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Various_chocolate_types.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/food-rewards-in-therapies-for-autistic-children/", "title": "Food rewards in therapies for autistic\u00a0children"},
{"date": "June 13, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve turned my back on the oughtisms of the normal parenting world. My son\u2019s autism got squarely in the way of him doing what all the parents around us were doing: the best kindergartens; the latest baby diets with the best brands; the best extra-curricular classes; the right social events; the latest child fashions, etc. I was just happy to make it through a day without being bitten too often, with a child who was at least eating something (other than my skin), and not in endless meltdowns. It\u2019s not that my standards or expectations were low. It\u2019s just that the ext reme challenges in my son\u2019s life made the things normal parents worry about, seem minor, ridiculous and irrelevant. Enter the world of autism, where my family fits and belongs. This is our normal. This is the community within which we have the best chance of being understood and accepted; where our concerns for our son are predictable and well-known, and the problems we face are met with suggestions and help, rather than shrugs or ignorant judgment. But the world of parenting an autistic child, comes with its own set of oughtisms. It\u2019s not just what treatments and therapies you \u201cought\u201d to do, since those questions can often be decided by science and evidence. I can live with and understand those attitudes and why moral judgment gets attached to the choices to do or not do a particular type of therapy. No; the \u201coughtisms\u201d I have in mind here, are the same sort of oughtisms I referred to at the start of this post, but in the autism parenting world. They begin at the point of diagnosis. My son was diagnosed by a perfectly good (and free \u2013 State system) developmental pediatrician, who works at a children\u2019s hospital, and also lectures at the local university. But apparently that was the wrong thing to do, I ought to have seen pediatrician X who just about everyone else had seen, he\u2019s the popular choice that everyone adores. (He\u2019s also the dodgy doctor I referred to in a previous post, by the way.) Then there\u2019s the choice of private versus public of the exact same therapies (private apparently makes you a better \u2013 though poorer \u2013 mother). You also better choose the right supplier of supplements for your autistic child \u2013 organise bringing them in through the right overseas provider yourself, it\u2019s just not the done thing to go through your doctor, even if it\u2019s the same brand. School choice is important of course, but apparently it\u2019s not about choosing the right school for your child and their needs, it\u2019s about choosing the \u201cbest\u201d (by what frickin criteria, I\u2019m still not sure, but the best is always apparently a private mainstream school, never a special-needs school). Make sure you join the right autism charities \u2013 sign up with the right one and you\u2019re a great parent and advocate, join the wrong one and you\u2019re a traitor and outsider. Nevermind that the two charities have a partnership agreement with each other and promote the same approach to autism. (Keep an eye out for the splinter-groups too: A while ago a local autism charity had a branch break away and start its own location and divergent focus, and I ended up unknowingly promoting one, even though my own views matched the other. I was praised for \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d before I\u2019d realised what I had even done.) Even your most personal feelings, attitudes and experiences with autism, can be subject to the oughtisms of the autism parenting world. You feel a certain way about autism, but it\u2019s not the \u201cright\u201d way; you\u2019re meant to love it, no hate it, no be indifferent to it, no accept it, make that reject it. Your experiences with autism were dreadful? Well that\u2019s your own fault since your attitude sucked, no it\u2019s society\u2019s fault for not being accommodating enough, no it\u2019s Big Pharma\u2019s fault, and if you\u2019re not actively fighting to change yourself / society / Big Pharma then by golly you\u2019re part of the problem. You ought to care more, fight more (whatever it is you\u2019re meant to care and fight about). You ought to blog about what you think and feel in regards to autism, it will help raise awareness apparently. This makes you a good mother. Pat on the back. No wait, blogging means you are taking time away from your child \u2013 you should be on the floor with them right now, stop reading this dribble, I shouldn\u2019t be writing this dribble, the mere act of my each key-push is evidence of my unfitness to be a mother. Remember too to sacrifice everything for your child \u2013 your money, your career, your marriage \u2013 the more you lose the more evident your dedication to your child\u2019s future. Oh but don\u2019t be a martyr, because that just shows you\u2019re actually selfishly using your child to fill an empty hole in yourself; being a martyr is really all about you, not your child. You try to get the balance right, but there is always someone ready to tell you you\u2019re not doing enough for your child, or you\u2019re doing too much for your child, or you\u2019re not doing enough for yourself\u2026 you cannot win. Trying to win \u2013 to match everyone else\u2019s (often conflicting) ideals of what you ought to do \u2013 will just leave you exhausted, self-doubting, confused, and quite probably rather pissed-off without quite being sure who or what you\u2019re pissed off at. They\u2019re all just trying to help you\u2026 right\u2026? Well no. Sometime they\u2019re trying to line their pockets, or their friend\u2019s pockets, by their suggestions. Sometimes they\u2019re trying to make themselves feel better about the versions and providers of treatments they chose; if they can convince other people that they made the absolute best choice then it makes them feel more sure in their rightness. Sometimes they\u2019re trying to just feel superior, and need someone to appear inferior (that\u2019s you, who must follow their advice and insights on pain of being otherwise judged unworthy). Hell, sometimes people just like the sound of their own voices, and you\u2019re just a great big walking depository for their echo. So I\u2019ve had to learn to take a deep breath and realise that there is nothing new or particularly different in this. It\u2019s just what\u2019s happening in the normal parenting world, but its revolving around autism. In the same way that I had to realise a heck of a lot of the advice I got as a new parent was just endless oughtisms, I also had to realise that a lot of the noise I currently get exposed to, is oughtisms about autism of the same degree. I keep my eye on the science and the evidence, and make my decisions based on that. I acknowledge and accept the emotions I have felt and do feel about autism and my experiences with autism, without letting others oughtisms re-label my emotions as \u201cincorrect\u201d or \u201cimmoral.\u201d (They\u2019re just emotions, if they are based on factual error or lead to objective harm, then work on the factual errors or argue against the actual harm; let people feel what they feel without turning it into a guilt-fest, there\u2019s enough of that going around already.) There is a place and value in recommendations about service providers, and in debates about attitudes and emotions, in all these things so long as the moral judgment doesn\u2019t insidiously seep in and lead to others saying you are a worse parent for not following (or better parent for following) their ever-changing autism oughtisms. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/oughtisms-in-the-autism-parenting-world/", "title": "Oughtisms in the Autism Parenting\u00a0World"},
{"date": "May 5, 2013", "body": "In the years since I became hyper-aware of how the intellectually disabled have been treated (or mistreated) in New Zealand, I have not been impressed with what I have found. I know that the wonderful and kind institutions are less likely to make the news, but I also know that what makes the news is only ever the tip of the iceberg. In researching this post it was far too easy to find examples of multiple victims and multiple offending institutions; this is not just a story of a few people affected in a couple of rogue institutions (as is made clear by various quotes I\u2019ll share from those stories too). By MSH* In this post I present a range of news stories from recent years, which illustrate the following concerning trends: \n The intellectually disabled in facilities, are too-often treated like animals or prisoners; \n Their and their families\u2019 complaints are often ignored, or dismissed without adequate investigation, until (and sometimes even after) it is too late; \n Carers are frequently untrained or significantly under-trained; \n Carers and offenders frequently deny or down-play the incidents, even in the face of evidence from multiple sources over multiple incidents; \n The abuses are ultimately \u201cState-funded,\u201d with lack of responsibility or accountability on behalf of the State Ministries in charge of that funding. \n What do we do about this? We start by raising awareness, because these things are going on behind closed doors, to people who are often non-verbal or very verbally challenged. We demand that offending carers, institutions and Ministries are held criminally accountable. We recognise that this ill-treatment and the responses to the ill-treatment, reflect wider societal attitudes that abuse of the disabled is somehow understandable or acceptable, that the disabled are in someway \u201clesser\u201d human beings that deserve or can expect maltreatment, even under professional care. Writing this post, and collecting these stories, is my small effort towards raising awareness about these patterns of abuse and dangerous attitudes. Here are just seven stories from across New Zealand, and my summaries of key points and important quotes. Most of the stories concern people with autism, as that is the disability I have been most likely to read about over the years and is present in the stories I most easily recall. Many of the patients have other co-occuring intellectual disabilities. (Keep in mind the number of other intellectually disabled individuals whose stories I haven\u2019t encountered yet, to give you a feel for why this will just be the tip of the iceberg of abuse in our facilities and by our State-funded carers): \u201cBoy left to eat grass at horror home.\u201d  (May 5th, 2013, Taranaki Daily News.) Victims: multiple victims of many incidents of both abuse and neglect. Facility: Parklands, in Pukekawa. \u201c Ministry audit reports, obtained exclusively by the Sunday Star-Times, say the facility harked back to institutions of the 1950s .\u201d Long history of documented abuses. People who ran the service deny the truth of the complaints. Staff were untrained, and in charge of 19 people. Families had suspicions, but were always reassured by the staff that the complaints and concerns were false. \u201c D e spite the allegations of abuse, some of which were substantiated by ministry staff, the couple are not facing criminal charges. \u201d Critique within the story: \u201c You couldn\u2019t do it to an animal but it\u2019s OK to do it to the intellectually disabled .\u201dIncludes a call for the Ministry to be held responsible too. \u201cMum: Why did my son die?\u201d  (Nov 18th, 2012, NZ Herald). Victim: Otto, 21 year old autistic man died in a house fire under the care of a carer. Facility: A house in Glendene, Auckland (not his home). \u201c On the night of Otto\u2019s death, police told his mother his body had been found in a locked room inside the locked house. She said she was also informed the house caught fire while the caregiver was out buying food .\u201d \u201cCarer of disabled teen denies assault .\u201d (Oct 30th, 2012, Nelson Mail.) Victim: Sixteen year old boy with various intellectual disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism. Facility: Purpose-built Exeter St property, Nelson. The boy lived under the care of highly trained carers. His family raised their concerns, the individual accused of the actions denies the claims, despite multiple witness accounts supporting the occurrence of abuses. Official records of the incidents had \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the files. Claims against them include inappropriate restraint techniques and violence: \u201c That a Nelson woman repeatedly assaulted a severely intellectually disabled teenaged boy, including punching and kicking him, dragging him by his hair, and holding him against a wall by his throat .\u201d \u201cFacility criticised over drowning of autistic boy.\u201d  (Jul 25th, 2012, NZ Herald) Victim: Julian Stacey. Facility: Run by Spectrum Care, Auckland. Eleven year old Julian, who had autism, escaped from a carer facility, and drowned. Staff on duty at the time were inexperienced. There was a history of successful escapes by the child. (See  my extended post on the details and (lack of) consequences .) \u201cAutistic patient locked in room.\u201d  (Apr 28th, 2012, Stuff.co.nz.) Victim: Ashley Peacock. Facility: Tawhirimatea, Porirua. Thirty-three year old man with autism and various other mental health concerns and intellectual disabilities, who thinks he is in prison and can\u2019t understand why. Suffering long-term seclusion, and very poor living conditions: \u201c It is devoid of any furnishings. There was a mattress on the floor, no toilet, no access to fresh air, minimal sunlight. \u201d \u201cHome criticised after autistic resident harmed.\u201d  (Feb 13th, 2012, The Press) Victim: Female, with autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Facility: Mary Moodie Family Trust facility, Christchurch. Dragged across floor by legs and arms, causing her physical harm. Other victims also identified, 14 residents at the facility in total. Under-trained workers. Family was not notified of the key incident. \u201cMy brother deserves better.\u201d  (Jun 21st, 2008, NZ Herald.) Victim: Twenty-four year old Jonathan, an autistic man, in care since he was 14. Facility: House run by Timata Hou organisation, Auckland. \u201c What\u2019s disturbing is how to reconcile that this service is sanctioned by both the Ministry of Health and the Family Court. If this is the standard of autism care in New Zealand, then it appears we haven\u2019t advanced much from the days of locking people in the asylum. \u201d And: \u201d  Dr Hickey is extremely critical of the state of autism care in New Zealand, saying it\u2019s 20 years behind the US and Britain and about 10 years behind Australia. \u201d Jonathan is regularly restrained, both by physical means and by heavy use of medication (leaving him \u201ccatatonic\u201d at times). \u201c Jonathan has fewer rights than someone in prison .\u201d The Ministry of Health funds this substandard care, but refuses to fund the family to supply the care with support themselves, a policy which is ironically intended to protect individuals from poor-quality service. \u201c At present there is only a facade behind which are services that range from inappropriate through to appalling\u2026 \u201d To each of these families and individuals, I want to extend my condolences for what you\u2019ve been through, and my respect for your willingness to fight the system as it stands, and to make your stories heard. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/69108241@N00/491113684/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/8634234/Boy-left-to-eat-grass-at-horror-home", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10848220", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/7881879/Carer-of-disabled-teen-denies-assault", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10822046", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/6821375/Autistic-patient-locked-in-room", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8298937/Home-criticised-after-autistic-resident-harmed", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10517513"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/05/05/state-funded-abuse-of-the-intellectually-disabled-in-new-zealand/", "title": "State-funded abuse of the intellectually disabled in New\u00a0Zealand"},
{"date": "May 7, 2013", "body": "Ever since I became aware of autism politics, I have been bombarded with the slogan that autism is not disability, it is difference; that disability is (primarily) a social construct, and that autism wouldn\u2019t be considered or treated like a disability if we were just thought of it more like a difference instead. That there is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with autism per se, it\u2019s simply a different way of being. The claim that autism is best thought of as difference, has to have this sort of strong meaning behind it to be meaningful at all. If all people meant was that we should call autism difference because autistic people are in some senses different, then the statement is trite and not in any way combating existing paradigms or attitudes (of course autism is a \u201cdifference,\u201d no one would deny such a claim). No, for the statement to have any power or purpose, it has to be juxtaposed with the notion that there is otherwise something essentially negative or intrinsically disabling about autism; that it is a difference  instead of  being seen as *insert current attitude that you want to challenge and change* (ie, disability). As someone who loves an autistic person (someone who is my very own flesh and blood), I am sympathetic to the aim of making autism appear more friendly, familiar, less frightening or alarming. I want people to see my son as just another fascinating and fantastic individual. But I do not like the rhetoric of simply recasting autism as a difference in the way I keep encountering that claim. The same part of me that wants my son to be accepted (the parenting part), also needs people to continue to think of it as a disability and not more-so a difference, and I feel that I need to say why, because I don\u2019t think the reasons are well understood or often thought about by those who want the rhetoric to change. All the reasons I am going to go through come from the experience of parenting an autistic child (or, if you prefer, from parenting  my  autistic child, I do not presume to speak for any other parent). I\u2019m only going to go through three reasons for why I feel uncomfortable and dissatisfied with the \u201cdifference\u201d rhetoric, the reasons that I think go underappreciated the most. There are plenty of other reasons that most people will already be familiar with and hardly need recapping (such as the harsh reality of the worst autism has to offer). Reason number one: Autism is real. As a parent with an autistic child, I could not possibly enumerate the number the times I have had to confront and argue against the notion that autism is not a real condition. The arguments take these common forms: autism is simply an excuse for rudeness; or a made-up condition for overly paranoid and anxious parents; or a parent\u2019s excuse for a badly behaved undisciplined child; or a parent\u2019s way to throw people off the fact that their child\u2019s problems are a pure product of abuse. So here\u2019s the thing then: If you tell the already-doubting public that autism is just \u201cdifference,\u201d you play into existing perceptions that it\u2019s not a real or a serious condition; you reinforce for these people the idea that there is nothing unusual or particular about autism, it\u2019s just the normal and predictable outcome of bad parenting, parental abuse, or a rude person\u2019s decision to act like that (etc). Oh sure, if you had a spare ten minutes of their uninterrupted attention, you might be able to make yourself better understood about how you do think it\u2019s real, it\u2019s just not as \u201c bad \u201d as people think it is. But the fact is the message is predominantly thrown around like a happy-clappy slogan, and to people who already think the worst of what autism \u201creally\u201d is, you\u2019re not helping them to confront their ignorance or prejudices, you are more likely to be reinforcing them. Reason one doesn\u2019t matter to you, because you think the message won\u2019t be misinterpreted or you for some reason don\u2019t think that part of the public is worth targeting with the message of difference, OK. How about reason two then, which is closely related to reason one: The people who do think autism is a real condition, but only when it is severe enough to be obvious to anyone who meets the child for even ten minutes, and believe the rest of the growing number of autistics is mass misdiagnosis serving the desires of parents who want to jump on the trendy autism diagnosis wagon. I wish these people were the joke they sound like, but they\u2019re not. Their numbers are even higher than those who think autism isn\u2019t a real condition at all (and those numbers are frightening enough). These are the people who conspiratorially whisper to me how clearly my own son has autism, but so many of the children they meet with the diagnosis don\u2019t have it. Some of them don\u2019t bother whispering; they shout it in blog form or vomit it all over any half-related comment discussion. Just a few days ago I read a blog post by parents lamenting the fact that so many parents these days seek out an autism diagnosis just because their child is different. That\u2019s right, because their child is  different , as in, talks a bit slower than other kids, is a bit eccentric, or plays with toys in an unusal manner. The particular blog post I\u2019m referring to \u2013 which was not a stand-alone view by any means \u2013 proudly and loudly voiced the view that parents should just be more accepting of the differences among children, instead of rushing to label them with \u201cautism.\u201d Let\u2019s ignore the ignorance here; let\u2019s ignore how hard it is to get an autism diagnosis, let\u2019s ignore the strongly evidenced under-diagnosis going on, and let\u2019s ignore the number of parents who refuse to seek or get a diagnosis confirmed even when those in the know plead with them to do it for the child\u2019s own good. Let\u2019s ignore all that, because my point is this: When you tell these people that hey they\u2019re right, autism really is just difference, they too are reinforced in their hurtful views that parents of (comparatively mild) autistic kids just need to be more accepting of their children and stop labeling them with the latest trendy DSM output. My mistake, you didn\u2019t mean for those people to receive and misunderstand the \u201cautism is difference\u201d message either. Of course you didn\u2019t. So let\u2019s ignore them too, and go to reason number three. Number three is services. As parents of autistic kids, we spend ridiculous sums of money and time pursuing a small pool of government funds and specialists, so our children have the best shot at an independent future. We fight to access what is supposedly ours by right. But accessing this pool of funds requires our children\u2019s challenges to be seen as something negative and serious. If it\u2019s just \u201cdifference,\u201d then why bother pumping limited resources into helping them to \u201cchange;\u201d parents should just accept their child, right? These children don\u2019t need speech therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, they just need acceptance and love. Hey, I was all accepting and loving of my non-toilet-trained, violent, self-harming young son, guess what, it didn\u2019t improve his life. My acceptance and love of him was a constant, but what made the difference was all the therapists we were only able to access because his problems were seen as serious and negative. The very fact that I can sit around and read and debate about attitudes towards autism, is because my son \u201cgot better,\u201d his autistic symptoms got so much better through therapies and interventions that I have the luxury to now wax lyrical about how it\u2019s really just difference\u2026 And there\u2019s the rub. Because you know I  do  believe autism is best thought of as difference. I want the world and my friends and family to understand that my son is just another human being who operates a bit differently in the world than they are used to. But as long as I keep coming against so many people who (1) think autism is a fake condition, (2) that parents who get an autism diagnosis for non-severe kids are just non-accepting of their children, and (3) that autistic children (and adults) need a change in attitude rather than professional help to make their own lives easier (and believe me far too many people in government ministries that control these sorts of resources do  not  understand the condition or its challenges), then I\u2019m not going to go around shouting slogans about how autism is just difference. (Um, except that time I did it on Facebook on Autism Awareness Day, but even I make errors of judgment sometimes, I know, shocker.) Those who have damaging, dangerous and hateful views of autistics, worry me a heck of a lot more, than gently shaping the minds and attitudes of those who already understand the intricacies of the autism debates. In this messy political autism world of ours we can debate terminology and argue about \u201cprivilege\u201d and whether to use the phrase \u201cspecial needs,\u201d and \u201cnormal,\u201d and \u201cinspiration porn,\u201d and whether the kid hitting his head into the concrete ground \u201cis autistic\u201d or \u201chas autism.\u201d The facts are my son has a disability called autism, he is not \u201cjust different,\u201d he is the most amazing person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing (he would shock you with his brilliance and insights, this kid is incredible), but he has a disability, a real good-to-god disability, and if that statement offends or upsets you,  you  should check your  own  attitudes towards the disabled, because in my books disability doesn\u2019t make him any less of a human being. It\u2019s fact, not a judgment; check your  own  prejudices before you tell me that you don\u2019t like  my  words. Or whatever. My point? I don\u2019t like the \u201cautism is just difference\u201d message, and I want to help people understand  why . Keep using it if you like, but understand why I and others might not jump on that band-wagon, and try to think about our reasons for not doing so before you attack us for being closed-minded. If I have failed to help you to understand such reasons, at least I did it in spectacular fashion \ud83d\ude42 The post is finished, you can stop reading now, unless you wish to comment. Here\u2019s the thing dear readers, recently I have had four autism blogging friends tell me or the world that they are afraid to speak their minds because autism politics have become so hateful and personal. The point and value of dialogue and reaching mutual understanding has been sacrificed to a loud obnoxious vitriolic personal bashing of anyone who dares to use the wrong words or to speak what they have experienced (their truths).  I too have been censoring myself, because to speak honestly these days is to offer your sanity and spare hours to strangers who would sooner launch personal attacks than deal with the arguments at hand.  So know this; my blog is not your platform to attack your mythical category of \u201cneurotypical\u201d parents (I am nowhere near \u201cneurotypical\u201d mind you, but that will be a blog post in the near future).

{"date": "May 10, 2013", "body": "My son is autistic, I am not, but neither am I neurotypical. I\u2019m not a fan of the term \u201cneurotypical,\u201d I don\u2019t find it meaningful or helpful.  I\u2019ve analysed and attacked its use before,  so I won\u2019t retread that path. This post is an illustration of sorts, and a very personal one. An illustration of the absurdity of the term neurotypical, but more importantly, an illustration of the simplicity and distortion in this claim: That because I don\u2019t have autism, I can\u2019t understand my autistic son. By karmaOWL Autism, as it\u2019s currently defined, is a cluster of symptoms. Some causes of autism are known, many are not. Diagnosis is symptom based though, and I lack the number and intensity of symptoms to meet the diagnosis. I am  not autistic . But\u2026 Water scratches my eyes. The sensation of water running over my eyeballs is painful and distressing. In the shower I put a lot of effort into avoiding the water falling anywhere near my face, if I get water in my eyes the pain will force me out of the shower in desperate search of something to remove it. I can handle water \u2013 even heavily chlorinated water \u2013 on my eyes, if they are fully immersed before I open them, but water running over them is horrible. I thought everyone felt this way, it never occurred to me until I was an adult that this might be unusual. I thought everyone else was just braver than me and better at hiding the pain. The ads and movies where people stood in showers with water running over their face always made me cringe and feel uncomfortable. So when my autistic son complained of it hurting when water got in his eyes, and panics around water on his face because it might get in his eyes, I understood and I empathized and sympathised. I get it. I\u2019m  not autistic , but\u2026 I have debilitating anxiety at times, at its worst it forms into a panic attack. Growing up I didn\u2019t know it was a panic attack, I didn\u2019t know what to call it. I thought I was just me being more fearful than other people and that I needed to stop being so \u201cprecious.\u201d Nights of nerve-shattering dread and not even knowing what I was afraid of. Terror so forceful that I felt folded in on myself, somehow unconnected and overly-connected to everything around me. As an adult I learnt calming techniques through the experiences, in particular I learnt that seeking intense pressure from someone or something, across my entire body, helped me to calm. The more squashed I was \u2013 the more unable to breathe even \u2013 the calmer and more even my breathing and heartbeat got, until I felt in control again. I learnt other calming techniques too, relaxation methods that also help. So Temple Grandin\u2019s squeeze machine for the purposes of calming an anxious body and mind, makes intimate sense to me, as does my own son\u2019s calming response when we pressurize his joints (shoulders and hips especially). So I get and understand that. I\u2019m  not autistic , but\u2026 There have been times in my life where I was so obsessed with repetitive actions that they disturbed my daily life and would get me in trouble. I felt compelled to do certain actions over and over, even though I knew they served no function other than to feed an endless loop; doing them didn\u2019t calm me, but not doing them did upset me. I had routines that had to performed in certain orders, I even made up rhymes to say to myself to keep the order right. If the routine went wrong I couldn\u2019t focus on anything else until it was corrected. These behaviours were at their worst as an anxious teenager. As an adult I am more aware of these proclivities and that they emerge when I\u2019m under stress, I\u2019m much better at managing them with sensible strategies (like using meticulous lists, and talking things through with my husband), so they no longer negatively impact my life. My son too has repetitive and obsessive behaviours, which I try to help him find ways to manage so they don\u2019t negatively impact his life, ways that reflect the meaning and function of the behaviours in his life which are different from the function of my own. I am  not autistic,  but\u2026 (last one!) I feel like I\u2019m faking this socializing thing. I feel like my childhood was made up of fluked friendships. I was always suitably surprised when I ended up with a best friend, and I always doubted that I deserved it because I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d done to get one in the first place. I even had one best friend who ended up in tears, pleading with me, asking me why I couldn\u2019t just see that we were friends, that I didn\u2019t have to act or feel like I didn\u2019t deserve her. Inevitably all my friendships would fall apart for one reason or another, I found it hard to maintain friendships, they felt un-natural even though I enjoyed having people to talk to and be around. It was like I knew what to do in theory, but the practice never turned out the way I thought it was meant to. These days, as an adult, I actively and very consciously work to build and maintain friendships. It is still hard, but I do enjoy the encounters that come from friendship, and I feel better equipped to do and say the right things. I am driven particularly by the fact that it is in my son\u2019s best interests that I create friendships with other parents with children. I also have a much better understanding now of how important friendships \u2013 and not just acquaintances \u2013 are to the work environment. So I see my son struggling to make and maintain friendships. I see him wondering how to make it work, and wanting it to work, but sometimes just preferring his own company in a way that very few children his age do. He has it much harder than I did, there is no doubt of that at all. But I see traces of myself in his concerns and challenges. In this. In all of these things. He is, after all, my son. Born from my body, there is no closer connection between two humans. So when someone \u2013 some stranger on the internet, and these strangers run numerous highly vocal and popular Facebook sites and blogs \u2013 when these strangers tell me I can\u2019t truly know my son like they can, because they have autism and I don\u2019t\u2026 When they tell me I can\u2019t understand his challenges because I don\u2019t have a diagnosis\u2026 When they tell me I am \u201c neurotypical \u201c\u2026 When they tell me  I am \u201c privileged \u2026 \u201d When they say my voice is less important than theirs and they can  speak for my son  better than I can..? Than the woman who birthed him, raised him, has spent every day of his life watching and learning about and loving him? They are wrong. And I shouldn\u2019t have to say it, because  they  should never assume to know someone else\u2019s neurology or life experiences or life challenges. I have tried, in many posts  (such as this)  to explain when neurology is key to an argument, and when it is not. Because sometimes it matters, and sometimes it  just doesn\u2019t . I am not autistic. But neither am I neurotypical. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/karmaowl/66245374/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/anatomy-of-a-neurotypical-mother/", "title": "Anatomy of a Neurotypical\u00a0Mother"},
{"date": "June 14, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n There is a newly published journal article in  Pediatrics , called \u201c Early Autism Detection: Are We Ready for Routine Screening? \u201c, that is causing a bit of concern and upset, since it\u2019s conclusion is that we are not ready for the roll-out of routine screening. The news articles I\u2019ve seen about the finding, were not particularly informative and even at times inflammatory; so I decided to read the article for myself and see what was really being argued, and why. Essentially the researchers set out to answer seven questions that can be used to judge the effectiveness and worth of introducing routine screening. \u201cRoutine screening\u201d is different from \u201cclinical surveillance\u201d, in that the latter is targeted at people already likely to have the condition (they show signs that concern parents or professionals, or family history, etc), and routine screening is directed at every child \u2013 even with no reason to have previously suspected autism or any other health concerns. The seven questions the researchers answered, came from a 1984 paper called \u201cAssessing the effectiveness of community screening programs.\u201d Which is to say they were applying a previously recognised and respected approach to addressing whether community screening would be advisable. Those seven questions are: \n Question 1 : Has the Effectiveness of the Screening Program (for That Condition) Been Demonstrated in a Randomized Trial? \n Question 2 : Are There Efficacious Treatments for the Primary Disorder and/or Efficacious Preventive Maneuvers? \n Question 3 : Does the Current Burden of Suffering Warrant Screening? \n Question 4 : Is a Good Screening Test Available? \n Question 5 : Will the Screening Program Reach a High Proportion of the Persons for Whom It Was Intended? \n Question 6 : Can the Health Care System Cope With the Screening Program? \n Question 7 : Will Those With Positive Screen Results Comply With Subsequent Advice and Interventions? \n Their conclusion: \u201c On the basis of the available research, we believe that we do not have enough sound evidence to support the implementation of a routine population-based screening program for autism. Ongoing research in this field is certainly needed, including the development of excellent screening instruments and demonstrating with clinical trials that such programs work and do more good than harm .\u201d In order to attack their conclusion that \u2013 at this point in time \u2013 routine screening for autism is not a good option, you\u2019d need to either declare some of the questions above to be irrelevant (depending of course of the particular finding for each question; no point knocking down a factor that didn\u2019t weigh one way or the other in their conclusion), or you\u2019d have to attack their findings in regards to answering each question. From my own reading on the research they collated and discussed in answering those questions, it seems that the conclusion they reached was quite sound and highly justifiable. In fact, in reading the article, I learnt a lot I didn\u2019t previously know. For that learning alone, it was worth reading the original piece. The news articles (and indeed, some of the blog posts I have seen on this news item), didn\u2019t do the study justice, even twisting the story. If you\u2019re feeling particularly emotional about the notion that routine screening for autism is extremely important and should be rolled out asap, set aside the not-extensive amount of time it takes to read the article, and see if it changes your mind. My personal perspective on this is partly coloured by the country I live in, since New Zealand already has regular development check-lists and questionnaires built into a child\u2019s visits to their doctor (or other chosen provider) during the first five years of their life. The checks are not tied to immunisation appointments (though they often coincide because that makes sense), and they don\u2019t have to be done by a doctor at a doctor\u2019s clinic, so they should capture people from all walks of life and of all attitudes. These check lists are not specifically tailored to autism, they pick up on hearing, sight, and other developmental concerns. But it makes sense to have broad ranging questions; filling out a detailed questionnaire for every conceivable issue a child might have, despite no reason to suspect a problem, raises the sorts of harms and concerns directly addressed in the article. My own autistic son was completely let down by these checks, which were picking up on his developmental delays and other issues, but were not being treated as noteworthy or important by the \u201cprofessional\u201d who was performing these checks. In fact, they were dismissed as my over anxiousness related to being a first-time mother, and where they were acknowledged at all, it only lead to critiques of what I must be doing wrong as a mother. But I am objective enough to recognise that those were attitude and ignorance issues on behalf of the professional, and my complaint about the person\u2019s conduct in relation to my son\u2019s case has since being dealt with, so I at least feel that her error has been acknowledged and addressed. Crappy professionals are always a risk; the checks were still doing their job. (My son was eventually diagnosed at three years-old, because I brought our concerns to a doctor, who referred us on to a developmental pediatrician. His autism was severe enough that it should have been identified much earlier than three.) To form an opinion on whether \u201cmore\u201d than what is currently provided, is needed in overseas countries, I\u2019d have to know more intimately how their pre-school and development screenings are conducted. At least from a New Zealand perspective, it seems to me that adequate systems are in place, they just need adequate professionals to respond to them. Regardless of one\u2019s country and that country\u2019s existing practices, it seems to me that the conclusion that it is not a good time to roll out routine screening for autism, stands firm, since the conclusion is based on evidence re tests and therapies that are not limited by geographical zones. If people feel that more must be done than is currently done, to find and help autistic children, then that is not the same argument that there should be routine screening. It seems that a lot of the outrage I\u2019ve seen so far is misdirected, since those outraged people are concerned about how we must \u201cdo more\u201d for the children, but erroneously think \u201cmore\u201d equates with routine screening. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/06/08/peds.2010-1881.full.pdf+html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/not-ready-for-introduction-of-routine-screening-for-autism-clarifying-the-issues/", "title": "Not ready for introduction of routine screening for autism?

{"date": "May 17, 2013", "body": "You may recall  the case that was fought and won  against the New Zealand Government, forcing the Government to accept that it should have been paying family members to care for their disabled children. In response to the case, the Government went through a public consultation to find out how best to meet their duties to this group of people. I made a submission as part of that consultation ( and wasn\u2019t too impressed with the process itself ), and have today received an email with  a link to find the summary results . That, and the  brief news coverage  that payment for family carers was part of the 2013 budget, left me feeling quite positive about how things were moving along: The Government was accepting its responsibilities and acting quickly to meet those responsibilities. By Velvet Android, via Flickr Oh how wrong I was. It didn\u2019t take long for radio, television, and online news media, to pick up the growing outrage at how the Government has chosen to meet these obligations. At first I was a tad bewildered at the response; why was everyone so upset, surely this was a step in the right direction? The more I researched, the more I came to understand that it was more like a wriggle of a toe in the right direction, with a blockade to prevent any further advances. I\u2019m going to help you understand why, because it took me a while to get my head around all of this too. First, and not surprisingly to anyone with previous knowledge of this case, the Government has read-down the Court\u2019s decision to its smallest subset of applicable families and disabled people who can receive the support. (To briefly clarify, the support at issue is when non-family members are paid for care of the disabled, but family members were barred from receiving the payment for providing the same care,  details are in my original post  if you need them). That small predictable subset, is that the relevant disabled individual must be an adult; caring for disabled children who are not adults, are excluded. But it doesn\u2019t stop there, of course\u2026 The number of people who can come in under the scheme is limited to the 1600 who have \u201chigh or very high needs.\u201d This is a tiny proportion of the disabled population in New Zealand. The payments are also blocked for spouses or partner\u2019s of the disabled person. But it doesn\u2019t stop there\u2026 The payments they are entitled to receive when looking after their disabled adult children, is equal to the minimum wage. Which is to say, the family members will be receiving about  half  of what non-family members get paid for the same work. So far we have limited numbers who can apply, limited people who can receive it, and half the pay if they do qualify. (And god only knows how many will ever access the funds depending on the bureaucracy built around receiving payments, I understand there are already serious concerns in this area.) But it\u2019s not finished with you yet, and here is where it gets dodgy. The legislation granting this payment scheme was passed under urgency, without going through the full process of public consultation. It should already be obvious why the public might have liked to be consulted on the specific parameters and propositions at issue. It was dealt with under urgency as part of a set of Budget relevant Bills, but it doesn\u2019t take effect until October 1st, so there should have been ample time to go through the necessary steps. As the  Labour Party\u2019s Annette King states : \u201c Why is it being put through with such haste? It does not come into effect until October 2013 \u2013 can they count how many months away that is? Could it not have gone to a select committee for a while? \u201d However the devil is in the detail, and the detail here is nasty: The legislation also blocks any future actions against the Government for not meeting their obligation under the Bill of Rights Act, in relation to \u201ca provision of the Bill, or by a family care policy.\u201d It expressly leaves the Bill Of Rights Act toothless against the issues in the Bill, by stating that Courts and Commissions cannot take any cases or complaints about any such discrimination, and for those cases already under consideration on the issue, the most the Court or Commission can do is  declare  that the policy in question is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act\u2026 and that\u2019s it. Really, that\u2019s it. (For what it\u2019s worth, as I understand it, that does not apply to the specific case that lead to the government introducing the Bill in the first place.) (Note, this is my understanding of the operation of the Bill from both reading commentaries and from reading the Bill itself, if you think my understanding requires refining or clarifying, please do help me out here.) The Attorney-General has spoken out against it, saying it breaches the Bill of Rights Act. The Labour Party, The Greens and New Zealand First have all publicly spoken out against it too. A powerful quote from  Green Party MP Catherine Delahunty , is worth sharing: \u201c This is vindictive, unfair and what\u2019s more, it is setting up a new level of complexity \u2013 and these people have been though enough. Sometimes, Mr Chair, people\u2019s hopes are broken by life and sometimes by legislation. And this is one of these times .\u201d I want to end with a quote from  my own post  on the consultation process that lead up to this Bill, because what has happened was foreseeable at that point: \u201c I\u2019m not convinced that the Government has appreciated the gravity of what they were doing wrong and how many lives it was ruining, neither am I convinced that their consultation will churn out a better future for these individuals and their families. I very much would like to be wrong.\u201d I wasn\u2019t, and the outcome was so much worse than I thought it would be. **** Relevant news stories / press releases / posts: \n Law Discriminates Against Disabled Adults and Family  (Press Release, New Zealand First Party, May 17th 2013, scoop.co.nz) \n Labour criticizes \u201cshonky\u201d process to pass carers\u2019 bill  (Radio New Zealand News, May 17th 2013) \n Not for profits suspicious of government decision to pay family carers  (wecare.org.nz, May 17th 2013) \n Budget 2013: Family caregivers will get minimum wage  (May 17th 2013, NZ Herald) \n New Zealand Public Health and Disability Amendment Bill (No 2) . \n Making sense of the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision on paying parents as carers  (my post, May 15th 2012) \n The consultation on paying family carers to provide disability support; why I am not impressed  (my post, Oct 12th 2012) \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/consultation-paying-family-carers-provide-disability-support-summary-report", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10884055", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/68777870@N00/118580880/", "http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/budget-2013/135332/labour-criticises-%27shonky%27-process-to-pass-carers%27-bill", "http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/budget-2013/135332/labour-criticises-%27shonky%27-process-to-pass-carers%27-bill", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1305/S00369/law-discriminates-against-disabled-adults-and-family.htm", "http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/budget-2013/135332/labour-criticises-%27shonky%27-process-to-pass-carers%27-bill", "http://www.wecare.org.nz/not-profits-suspicious-government-decision-pay-family-carers", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10884195", "http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2013/0118/latest/whole.html?search=ta_bill_N_bc%40bcur_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/when-is-a-win-a-loss-why-the-nz-govt-is-under-attack-for-its-bill-on-paying-family-carers/", "title": "When is a win, a loss?

{"date": "May 27, 2013", "body": "I was not entirely opposed to the DSM-5 changes to the criteria for an autism diagnosis; I saw many benefits, which  I outlined in a previous post . Now that the DSM-5 is finalized and available (to those who can afford to buy it at any rate), the critiques are building, not subsiding. Most of the critiques are of the general variety we are already familiar with: The pathologising of normal, the expansion of psychiatry (and thereby, drugs) into areas it doesn\u2019t belong and is best left out of. Some have taken the change to  renew all-out attacks on psychiatry itself and the way mental illness is (ab)used in society  already. However, for all that, I kept hoping it would at least deliver the potential benefit for autism. By Jake Bouma, via Flickr At least some of those key benefits, are now demolished. In particular, the benefits around the clarity of who would now receive an autism diagnosis, and what precisely would be required for an autism diagnosis. Dr Allen Frances has described the two key flaws of the criteria in  this clearly written article . I want to add my own concerns and analysis to what he has to say. The wording of the DSM-5 appears to have committed the same impactful error that we saw in a previous edition when PDD-NOS was over-inflated by the replacement of the word \u201cand\u201d with the word \u201cor\u201d in the list of criteria (a detail that I learned through  Grinker\u2019s book \u201cUnstrange Minds.\u201d ). That text error held sway from 1994 until revised in 2000. But what we\u2019re seeing in the 2013 DSM-5 appears to be the complete  absence  of any \u201cors\u201d or \u201cands\u201d in the criterion guidelines for social communication and interactions deficits. In the words of Frances: \u201c The really fatal flaw here is that no instructions are given as to whether one item, two items, or all three items must be present to make the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder .\u201d (See  his article  for the official list of possible items.) This could (and is likely) to have a very real impact on the accuracy of diagnoses across different practices, and similarly then impact on the accuracy of researching those who have received a diagnosis. The second \u201cfatal flaw\u201d is particularly interesting from the view of autism politics and autism pressure groups: Leading up to the DSM-5 there was significant concern about how the new criteria would affect services and supports for those who currently have an autism diagnosis, as well as how it would hurt those who already positively identify as autistic. Despite constant reassurance that numbers would not be drastically affected, and backing up those reassurances with studies that claimed the same, it appears that the DSM-5 drafters felt compelled to clarify the matter further by explicitly stating in the new criteria that those with a \u201cwell established DSM-IV diagnosis\u201d should also receive the new autism diagnosis. This means you potentially have a sub-type of autism, depending on how seriously you take the studies that actually found a  significant  discrepancy in those who once were considered autistic but wouldn\u2019t have been under the new guidelines: If there  really is  a large difference, then doesn\u2019t including them in the new diagnosis group, change the clarity and consistency of what autism is? Isn\u2019t it now then a merge of DSM-IV and DSM-5, rather than the DSM-5 which was meant to be such a huge improvement on the DSM-IV? As I said, a sort of \u201csub-group\u201d of those who may not have otherwise met the DSM-5 criteria? What then, does this do to research on autism that uses a diagnosis of autism under the DSM-5, would it perhaps make sense to always note that the person had the diagnosis only because it was established under DSM-IV, and if you do this, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to always then determine too if they do actually meet the new DSM-5, for any potential research purposes? What\u2019s the point of a new DSM that says the old DSM is still valid? I\u2019m sure some of those concerns would be dealt with by researchers that always first re-establish a diagnosis prior to getting involved in their research (I\u2019m not a researcher, I only read the occasional paper and paper critique, so others would know better), but it seems to add an extra layer of confusion and perhaps a certain level of redundancy to the changes for what autism now means; the sort of uncertainty that was meant to be  fixed  by the DSM-5. I also wonder what exactly is meant by \u201cwell established\u201d in this context? Does that mean someone who has had their diagnosis for two years, ten years, does it include those who had a borderline diagnosis, or is that not considered \u201cwell established\u201d? Frances specifically voices the concern that the wording allows clinicians to simply choose then whether to use the DSM-IV or DSM-5. At first I found that a bit of an extreme interpretation of the words, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed a perfectly defensible action in the mind of a hypothetical clinician: If the DSM-IV criteria counts as autism under the DSM-5 for existing patients (which is the more obvious reading), then what sense would it make to deny that flexibility to new patients? Surely it would be arbitrary to do so? (And again, this may turn on how one even reads \u201cwell established,\u201d could it perhaps apply to a new patient if the condition itself is well established under the DSM-IV criteria despite not previously being diagnosed?) You may know the answers to these extra questions I raise; I am just a parent with an intense interest in the diagnostic criteria history of autism. If you know the answers, please share them; I want to understand. Regardless, it seems to me that the much-needed and much-touted clarity of the DSM-5 over the DSM-IV criteria for autism, has been undercut at the outset.

{"date": "May 14, 2013", "body": "April 2013, an  old post of mine  receives a comment that awaits moderation. The first time I read it my heart pounds, because it is threatening and abusive. It encourages me to kill my child because of his disability, and laments his existence because of the monetary cost to society. The final sentence of \u201cJoe\u2019s\u201d attack is this: \u201c If having another kid was a good idea to you, then you\u2019re just about as dumb as that drooling, loud, obnoxious, tantrum throwing disaster of a child you have. \u201d My son doesn\u2019t fit any of those descriptors, not a single one of them (but even if he did, not a sentiment of the commenter would have been justified). He signs off with the fictitious email :  killyourself@youretard.com . Bu Gib3102, via Flickr I re-read the comment, and my general feeling of upset turns to annoyance and anger. I share the comment in a private group of friends, we all agree it\u2019s best to leave hate speech where it belongs; unpublished and in the bin. A month goes by. May 2013, I find out about a man called Colin Brewer. This man\u00a0 is an elected Councillor, who I am pleased to say does not reside in my country. Here again,  an argument that society would be better off without disabled children, and that they should be killed as babies because of their cost to society.  He compares the cost of caring for these humans as equivalent \u2013 and better spent \u2013 on running 10 public toilets. He says people are transient, that he is thinking of the bigger picture: planning, environmental issues and landscapes. He talks about the many private supporters he has of his view, and I am reminded of my visitor from April. Hate speech and hate speakers don\u2019t stay in the bin. They don\u2019t go away. They vote for people like Mr Brewer. So I want to say something, and I want this to be very clear. Colin and my commenter \u201cJoe,\u201d are interesting in this remarkable regard: They think society would be better off without disabled people who had no choice in their challenges, but they think people like themselves \u2013 who encourage violence and hatred against the disabled \u2013 are the sort of people we should  want  to keep around. That people who  choose  to promote violence and hate, are more valued than their intended victims, who have not made any such choice. What an interesting society they promote, not a place I would want to be, but apparently it\u2019s their ideal. The oddity doesn\u2019t stop there. Colin and Joe think money is more important than caring for humans, yet I find it hard to imagine what money would be better spent on. Toilets, apparently. Because toilets and landscaping are the public sector\u2019s key roles. I was under the mistaken view that matters like health and life were higher up the agenda; someone better take back my Philosophy and my Law degrees, I appear to have been erroneously educated on both ethics and government. But the concern, we hear Colin and Joe say, is that it\u2019s other people\u2019s money you see. But I am then led to wonder, why they wouldn\u2019t advocate changing government spending priorities or taxation or support services on offer; how is it they short-cut to  killing the disabled ? That step is hard to fathom; why is killing people an easier and more sensible solution than confronting and changing public policy? Luckily neither Joe nor Colin will ever be in an accident that affects their bodies or minds, nor will they ever grow old, or have any relatives who also enter the world of disability (what a lovely predetermined world they live in). They are perfect human beings, unflawed, perfectly able-bodied and able-minded (though the able-minded thing is starting to look questionable, wouldn\u2019t you say?) You may be familiar with my disdain for the argument that the value of the disabled\u2019s existence should or could rest of what they can do for the rest of society.  I call this objectifying them , which is just my way of saying people are not a means to an end, they are an end in them-self. They are individuals, with a right to life, that is not up-held or negated by virtue of what they can or can\u2019t do for anyone else. We do not have to justify our existence in reference to others. This ignoring of individualism and individual rights, is behind the Colins and Joes of this world; they live in societies that have flourished on individualism and a system of rights, but they have a modified version of precisely which individuals should be entitled to even the most basic of rights. (How convenient too, that they fit into their category of those who get to have the right to life.) Their arguments to sustain those views are deeply flawed and contradictory. Luckily for them, I and many others  do  value and understand the meaning and importance of choice and individual rights. And I do think that society has to \u201caccommodate\u201d even those who incite violence. I would prefer that they were accommodated in prison \u2013 inciting violence and inciting suicide are crimes after all \u2013 but I would not encourage that we physically attack or kill poor Colin and Joe. No, because I value life. I think that life matters, and I acknowledge that frailty of humans and how close we all are to disability anyway. I acknowledge the fine and shifting lines between who is disabled and who is not. And some part of me even pities these men, that they don\u2019t realize how absurd and ill-informed they are. The world would not be better off without my son, dear Joe and Colin. The fact that he\u2019s turned out to be an amazing human being with a rather bright future if he continues of his trajectory \u2013 in fact, that he looks to be smarter than the average child his age and may yet turn out to have savant skills \u2013 is by-the-by. He could be that fictional drooling violent child Joe describes, and he\u2019d still be worth more to me and society that those who spew forth and encourage such utter rubbish as these grown men do. Just who would society, and I,  and my son , be better off without? \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/chris9002/5781715143/", "http://disabilitynewsservice.com/2013/05/colin-brewer-there-is-a-good-argument-for-killing-some-disabled-babies/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/better-off-without-you/", "title": "Better Off Without\u00a0You"},
{"date": "June 15, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Before we get started, \u201cmummy\u201d is the New Zealand version of \u201cmommy.\u201d I am not \u201cthe dead body of a human being or animal preserved by the ancient Egyptian process or some similar method of embalming\u201d. But I some days feel like \u201ca withered or shrunken living being\u201d ( thank you dictionary.com ., and thank you wordpress for suggesting that a shrunken dead hand would go nicely with my post title.) I refuse to refer to myself as a mommy just to avoid the searches by people who want to find out why an ancient egyptian is feeling sad. Anywho. Mummy is not happy, despite the endless insistances and protestations by my five year-old autistic son. He frequently says to me, \u201cmummy is happy now, mummy smile\u201d if I dare to be anything other than happy. If I cry or get angry or look too serious, he will desperately try to order / convince me that I have made an error. If I tell him I\u2019m happy, that used to be enough to calm him down to avoid him degenerating into a crying anxious mess. But that\u2019s not enough these days; I have to force a smile too. You  try smiling when you\u2019re actually really angry or sad or exhausted or stressed or sick. Yes, it can be done, but when there\u2019s an objectively good reason for me to be something other than happy, it\u2019s more than a little annoying to plaster that fake smile on and keep it on until he\u2019s distracted enough to look away from my face. In fact sometimes, it makes you feel a whole lot worse to force a smile at those times. If I reply \u201cno, mummy is  not  happy\u201d, you can guarantee an escalation of his anxiety and a good chance that he\u2019ll start crying. I try to tell him that I\u2019m allowed to feel other emotions, and that mummy can\u2019t just smile all day everyday; it would hurt my cheeks. I\u2019ve tried to get him to understand this by getting him to smile for ages, but as you can imagine he loves smiling and thinks it\u2019s a great game, and then I get caught up in his smiles and laughter too. And  maybe  that\u2019s the point; me being happy makes him feel happy, the same way him being happy makes me happy. If I\u2019m sad or angry or serious, it makes him sad because I\u2019m not happy? Or is he sad because he\u2019s worried about the outcome of my tears or anger? I\u2019m not a scary woman or a scary mother, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it, but it may be part of the picture; good things happen when mummy is happy, bad things happen when she isn\u2019t..? He has gone from a kid who was seemingly oblivious to my emotions and my facial expressions, to a child who obsesses over my slightest furrowed brow or narrowing eyes or downturned mouth (or the reverses when I show even the slightest signs of happiness). I very clearly remember the time he bit my breast during a feed when he was about 12 months old, and the time he bit down on my finger as I tried to get dirt out of his mouth when he was a bit older than that; both times I screamed in absolute tear-jerking agony because he applied full pressure and wouldn\u2019t stop, both time he just gently smiled at me as if I was amusing. I have lots of memories of my tears, my anger, my happiness, my every emotion, being unacknowledged and seemingly irrelevant to him (particularly up to and including when he was three years-old). Even when he met my eyes, I felt like he was just looking at what I was doing with my face, not understanding what it meant. I\u2019ve written before about how we taught him to recognise and name emotions. I think I\u2019ve also shared the story about when he ordered a woman (one of his therapists) to leave the house when he was four years old and barely able to string two words together, because she\u2019d made me cry. So I can map the shift towards recognition and response to emotion. It\u2019s just that now he seems to have swung too far in the other direction, with a hypersensitivity that elicits an anxiety response from him. I understand from previous research that I\u2019ve done into the topic, that part of what\u2019s going on with his hypersensitivity and anxiety is that \u2013 though he now recognises the emotion \u2013 he struggles to understand what has caused the emotion  in me.  Emotion is confusing because he\u2019s struggling with theory of mind; what is going on in my head that made me angry, was it something he did wrong, is mummy sad because she is hurt? Maybe he thinks by changing my  outward  emotion (sad face to happy face) he can actually change the emotion  itself  (make me happy)? We can just add those questions to the pile I presented three paragraphs back. The fact I can\u2019t answer them yet is arguably evidence that I lack \u201ctheory of mind\u201d in relation to the autistic mind of my child, but I am trying, so very hard, everyday, to penetrate that amazing little mind of his. I know I can do it too; I have frequently made significant discoveries \u2013 initially with the aid of therapists, but I have the skills to figure these things out increasingly by myself now \u2013 about why he does what he does, that have allowed me to bring him out into the world. He interacts more with the world; he is more confident, less fearful, more interested. He is much happier. But even  he  isn\u2019t happy  all  the time. Yet he expects that of me, demands it, requires it. I sincerely wish I could be happy all the time. I would love to comply with his need for my eternal happiness. But sometimes, some days, and for very good reasons, mummy is not happy. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Guanajuato_mummy_01.jpg", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mummy"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/mummy-is-not-happy-reflection-on-the-dictation-of-emotion-by-an-autistic-child/", "title": "Mummy is not Happy: Reflection on the dictation of emotion by an autistic\u00a0child."},
{"date": "May 26, 2013", "body": "I want to propose a different way of thinking about disability \u2013 and autism in particular \u2013 than what I have encountered so far. I want to challenge the idea that it is helpful to think of all autism in one way, or to think of parents who attack and fight their child\u2019s autism and the condition of autism, as hateful or un-accepting of their children. I\u2019m going to explain this in three parts: Paths into autism, paths out of autism, and the \u201cshoulds\u201d within autism cure. By Jenny Downing via Flickr It seems to me that there are three main attitudes to how someone comes into autism, in terms of \u201cfault:\u201d (1) A criminal cause, where someone has acted recklessly or negligently to cause autism; (2) an accident, where it happened by some injury or harm, but there is no meaningful person to blame, and (3) no fault is relevant, autism is just part of a life that some people come to have (at birth or later) or don\u2019t, but no one and no thing is to \u201cblame\u201d in any sense of that term. If someone believes autism (or a particular incident of autism) is caused by genetics, they may find their attitudes falling into any of these three categories. Something like vaccines as a cause, would fall into any of the three categories too, depending on the malice you may see in vaccine producers. The important point for the analysis I\u2019m engaging in here, is the person\u2019s resultant attitude towards fault or blame: Is there someone who has  caused  \u2013 and should be held responsible for \u2013 a disabling change to a person (in this instance, autism)? So if those are the potential paths into autism, the relevant potential paths out, are binary: (1) It can be cured, and (2) it can\u2019t be cured (both of course complicated by what counts as a \u201ccure\u201d for a condition defined by symptoms). Layer that with the \u201cshoulds\u201d: (1) It should be cured, (2) it shouldn\u2019t be cured. The shoulds are often going to be formed in relation to how severely the individual person is affected: Someone intensely disabled by autism is almost always going to be seen as a \u201cshould be cured,\u201d someone who can function adequately most days, is going to attract different attitudes. The \u201cshoulds\u201d and the \u201ccoulds\u201d have to be treated separately of course, and you can see how views of medical reality (for example, it can\u2019t be cured), can impact on attitudes towards the shoulds (\u201cit can\u2019t be cured\u2026 and  therefore  I am inclined to believe we must come to see it as something that shouldn\u2019t be cured, as a measure of acceptance and humanity.\u201d) On this simple mapping, you can see that the the most frustrated and angry people in the autism world, from the parenting perspective in particular, are those who believe autism has a criminal cause, should be cured, and can\u2019t be cured. Those who will be most angry from a self-advocacy point of view against that group of people, will be those who see it as a no-fault cause, that shouldn\u2019t and can\u2019t be cured (or an even angrier group, would be those who believe it can but shouldn\u2019t be \u201ccured\u201d depending on your meaning of cure, for example if you believe any supposed cure is just \u201cpassing\u201d). When people see autism in these different lights, they aren\u2019t really arguing about the same event anymore; they are arguing about \u201cautism,\u201d but because we\u2019re still learning about what actually causes and can help autistic people, there is a huge amount of very-understandable variance in accompanying attitudes towards the condition. If we all agreed on its cause and the state of a cure, most of the arguments would fall into the whether we should or shouldn\u2019t attempt a cure in light of that knowledge, and those attitudes would be informed by what the cure entails amongst other numerous unknowns, as well as the severity of the affected individual, but as least we\u2019d be that much closer to all arguing about the same thing. That\u2019s just the first part of what I want to say though; I want to make a point about the love parents have for their children and why the above attitude differences are always relevant, and yet get ignored in judging those parents. If a parent believes autism was criminally thrust upon their child, and can be cured (and therefore, often as natural concurrence, should be cured), then it makes sense that they do not embrace autism or see their child as \u201cone\u201d with autism: The child is seen as hidden by or stolen by autism, not because they hate the child, but because the autism itself is seen as something criminal and removable. To attack the parent simply for hating autism, and to claim this means they  hate their child , is to completely ignore their entirely different conception of how autism has arisen and what can be done about it. They may be wrong about autism \u2013 for example, it isn\u2019t really caused by a criminal act, it isn\u2019t removable \u2013 but that is a different claim than they hate their child. Their actual child \u2013 the complete child if you will \u2013 was the one taken away, they are just trying to get that child back; they love their child regardless and in all states / conditions, but because they don\u2019t see autism  as  their child, there is no contradiction in loving the child and hating autism. In fact, I am yet to meet a single parent who doesn\u2019t love their autistic child, regardless of their views towards autism itself; as parents we are hard-wired to adore our kids no matter what, and that includes fighting for their best interests. It\u2019s just that what is in their \u201cbest interests,\u201d very often depends on your views of cause and cure. There are other reasons someone might hate autism but not the person with autism, particularly around the intensity of the symptoms impact on daily life and living the life the individual wants, ie in the \u201cshoulds\u201d category of attitudes. If the affected individual is relatively happy, self-identified with their autism, and is not a danger to themself and others, then  even if  autism is seen by them as caused by something bad or curable, it is entirely consistent for them to not seek out any such cure. Again, it\u2019s not just about \u201cautism,\u201d it\u2019s about all these whys and realities supporting those views, that we frequently do not confront or acknowledge in others. What all this explains for me, is that the autism wars I see every single day are perfectly predictable and understandable. Our communities are particularly volatile, and splinter-off and fight amongst ourselves regularly, as you\u2019d expect when we\u2019re calling different things the same word and all trying to dominate how the public and our peers see it too. It makes sense to me that so often we end up saying \u201cbut that\u2019s not even autism,\u201d because we can\u2019t point at a single biological marker or facial feature (or whatever), to at least ground what we\u2019re talking about, let alone know the cause for each individual affected. Does this mean all disagreement would magically disappear if we could be more precise about the phenomenon and if it could be cured? No, but I do believe the disagreements would be easier to confront and understand. Currently even figuring out what someone believes and why is hard enough, and views of an individual can change one year to the next, moving between \u201cextremes\u201d as knowledge and experiences also change. Accordingly, my own views and attitudes towards autism have shifted on all these axes: I came to see my son\u2019s autism as  more likely  to be a result of genetic than post-birth environmental insults (causal); I don\u2019t think autism can be \u201ccured\u201d per se, but I do think interventions can make a significant difference for some children (affecting my views on cure); and my son\u2019s autism symptoms greatly improved (affecting my shoulds, in tandem with my view that autism can\u2019t be \u201ccured\u201d anyway so we need to be more accepting regardless). If I believed my son\u2019s autism was caused by something someone else did to him maliciously, I\u2019d be joining protest-lines to stop it happening to others and to make the perpetrators pay for the cure (or the finding of a cure). I\u2019d be considered an extremist only by those who didn\u2019t believe those facts about autism, if what I believed was fact, I\u2019d be considered a humanitarian seeking justice for criminal wrongs. At some point people are continuing to hold their views despite science and evidence to the contrary, and at that point anger and frustration from other quarters becomes justified, but it is still important to understand where their attitudes  towards autism itself,  are coming from, and focus any attacks accordingly. (Which is to say, I don\u2019t think it is fair or accurate to declare these parents as un-accepting hateful parents, which I see far too often.) I don\u2019t think my analysis is perfect, and I don\u2019t know if it will make sense or help anyone else. But it does help me to understand myself and others better, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing it; maybe it will help someone else too. I intend to return to the analysis in a year or so and see if my views on it \u2013 and on autism \u2013 have changed. If they discover what caused my son\u2019s autism and how to change it, I\u2019ll let you know. For now, my attitudes quite rightly reflect my understanding of not just autism itself, but of the autism my own son lives with, and as a parent, that makes sense. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenny-pics/4443567882/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/paths-into-and-out-of-autism-understanding-the-love-and-hate/", "title": "Paths into and out of autism; understanding the love and\u00a0hate."},

{"date": "June 16, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n My son\u2019s autism is punctuated by extremely high anxiety levels; so high, and so hard to manage, that we specifically asked his developmental pediatrician to re-evaluate him for a separate anxiety disorder in addition to the autism, and to consider putting him on meds. She concluded that the anxiety was purely part of the autism, and was extremely reluctant to put him on meds considering he was only four years-old at the time. She suggested more management methods (which we were already using), and told us to just persist. Over time his anxieties have become more manageable, but they still make almost every part of every day, exhausting and difficult. The best summary I can provide of what it\u2019s like to live with \u2013 and how it so differs from his neurotypical brother \u2013 is that it\u2019s like every little thing matters and has consequences. The clothes he wears must be just-so. That used to be they had to be a certain type of cotton, with no zips, no socks, no hats. He\u2019d refuse to sleep under sheets, even in winter. Now it\u2019s that the buttons must always be done up, preferably add up to three, everything that can be in a bow must be in a bow, socks must be pulled up high and the sock heel must be positioned \u201ccorrectly.\u201d The food he eats must be just right too. The pizza crusts he\u2019ll eat must not have any glazing on them, or any evidence of ingredients showing on it. Jam sandwiches must not have any butter, and preferably number six pieces to a plate. I\u2019m just happy we got him past only eating chips that must always be present to a certain amount in front of him (endless top-ups). Everything has rules and expectations and order. At its worst he was controlling the windows and doors and seating arrangements, and who was allowed to talk. Currently he even controls my facial expressions; again though, I am glad that he even makes eye contact and knows how to read what my facial expressions mean. How does he control these things? Why don\u2019t I just stamp it out as naughty behaviour? First off, it\u2019s not \u201cnaughty\u201d, it\u2019s anxiety; he doesn\u2019t scream and shout and tantrum if he doesn\u2019t get his way, he cries and shakes and shrinks into himself. It\u2019s like watching someone disappear in front of your eyes, to the point where your words don\u2019t penetrate and their senses shut down, leaving a trembling terrified person, who can take hours to calm down. This used to involve self-harm. There are days where one meltdown early in the morning, have meant that he\u2019s wired high for the rest of the day \u2013 where even more things than usual will set him off. If I\u2019m not careful and ever-watchful, whole new obsessions and anxieties will regularly infiltrate his daily life. I have to be constantly mindful of his reactions and particularly aware of any new repeated phrases or behaviours he exhibits, as first signs of an emerging problem. If I\u2019m light-hearted at those moments, and gently move him away from the thing that he\u2019s starting to get anxious about, I can defuse the new bomb before it\u2019s set up. If I\u2019m distracted at the time or don\u2019t treat the situation in the correct way, I may have to pay the price with months (or even over a year) of behavioural consequences. His neurotypical brother doesn\u2019t get hang-ups about things. He has preferences, but he doesn\u2019t obsess. He throws tantrums, but he never has meltdowns. He\u2019ll cry when he\u2019s upset, but it never goes on for hours. Mostly he is happy and relaxed and easily distracted and amused. He is a \u201cnormal\u201d kid. Sometimes I catch myself being on edge around him, watching for emerging anxieties and behaviours that never happen, because he isn\u2019t autistic. I have to remind myself to relax, every tiny thing doesn\u2019t matter. But as soon as my autistic son comes home from school or walks in the room, I have to ramp up my own awareness again, or pay the price for forgetting to do so. It is exhausting. It has made me anxious too (not surprisingly). Sometimes it makes me so mad, or incredibly sad, but almost always frustrated beyond belief. I keep using the management strategies we have in place, and introduce new ones as needed. To a certain degree they have become automatic, but because they require such high levels of awareness and responsiveness, they still require a particularly high level of constant alertness on my behalf. I do sometimes still wonder whether my son would benefit from medication to bring down his high levels of anxiety, just so he can function without so often being on the edge of a meltdown. But until and unless his developmental pediatrician agrees, I accept that this is just how it has to be for now. I\u2019m hopeful that time \u2013 and the language and skills that come with that time \u2013 will bring down the anxieties to a level that medication isn\u2019t a thought that crosses my mind anymore. I don\u2019t want to medicate my son, I\u2019m aware of negative side-effects, and I am impressed with his progress (he\u2019s never been on meds for his autism) over the past two years. Just one day at a time then for now, with a large dollop of hope for the future, and a fair heaping of faith (perhaps the wrong word) that his pediatrician is correct that what we\u2019re already doing is the best thing for him. It\u2019s part of why I read so many books and blogs and articles about autism everyday; searching for reassurance that we\u2019re doing the right thing, and new approaches if we\u2019re not. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Scream.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/the-endless-anxieties-of-everything-matters-and-the-question-of-medication/", "title": "The endless anxieties of \u201ceverything matters,\u201d and the question of\u00a0medication"},

{"date": "June 19, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n What happens to a community of people facing the same challenges, forced to compete for limited resources (particularly government resources)? The effects I\u2019ve seen at a local level \u2013 here in New Zealand \u2013 appear to be replicated overseas, according to what I\u2019ve seen in debates and conflicts in the online communities. There are various government provided supports (in terms of finances and services) that require you to prove your child\u2019s autism is more severe than other children\u2019s autism. Sometimes this is done in direct competition; a specifically limited number of packages of assistance are made available within the country, to the point that if your child qualifies for the support, there is one less assistance package available for another family. Other types of support are available to every child on the spectrum, but the level of support you receive, or how long you receive it for, depends on the severity of your child\u2019s autism. These schemes are set up in this way to respond to the reality that there are not unlimited funds and services available, and that to make those resources available to every child with autism, would dilute the usefulness of them to anyone since they would be spread too thin. So the government has had to come up with some way to respond to the different levels of need present within the autism spectrum; acknowledging that it is a spectrum where one person can be affected very differently from another. In order to achieve this understandable goal \u2013 getting scarce resources to those who need it the most \u2013 they\u2019ve had to create categories and corresponding terminologies of severity. Parents must learn to understand and use those categories in order to understand and access the services on offer for their children. The consequences of all this can be quite significant. I\u2019m going to go through the ones I am aware of. One of the most disturbing things I have heard time and time again about my son, from other parents of autistic children, is how lucky I am that his autism is so severe. This has always been said to me in discussions about the schooling options we have available to us; if his autism was less severe he wouldn\u2019t have qualified for the level of support he has, he\u2019d have been expected to take part in mainstream schooling with little or no help, as is true for many \u201cless severely\u201d affected autistic children. In a world where severity is the difference between lots or hardly any schooling support, it makes sense to say to someone like me, how lucky I am. Yet every single time someone says that to me, I get quietly angry. I\u2019m lucky my child has life-long challenges? How  dare  they! I know why they say it but it still pits me against them emotionally. It also makes me feel like I have to defend my child\u2019s needs and severity to the other parent, or apologise that we get the help they don\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t have to do that or feel that way, yet the system is set up in such a way that my child\u2019s needs were very probably seen as trumping their child\u2019s needs; the fact we got assistance may actually mean their child was less likely to have received the help they also desperately needed. In this situation \u2013 them telling me I\u2019m lucky, me defending and apologizing for the services we receive \u2013 we parents are pitted against each other, and the system stands there like some accepted monolith. The attacks and upset should be directed at the way the system is set up, but changing the system is a slow and overwhelming task; it\u2019s much \u201ceasier\u201d to accept its existence and rules, and turn our frustrations on each other. The way we have these discussions \u2013 even the ability to have these discussions \u2013 shows we have internalized and maybe even accepted the categories of severity or functionality presented to us by the service providers. Just the constant use of their terminology, requires us to also think using the terminology; it inevitably starts to sink into how we understand our own and others\u2019 autistic children. In the process of filling out the endless forms to get these services and assistance from the government in the first place, I was often told to exaggerate my son\u2019s challenges. This advice came not only from parents who had been through it all before, but also from the government employees who aided the application process (the forms are filled out by one arm of the government, then another arm evaluates it, and a third arm provides the service!). Sometimes the advice of exaggeration came in the form of \u201ctricks of the trade\u201d: Provide plenty of examples of the difficulties and don\u2019t hint at his capabilities, use the right emphasis, etc. Other times the advice was to very literally exaggerate close to the point of dishonesty. I don\u2019t work that way; I spent nine years of my life studying law and philosophy (and then teaching the same), so to knowingly lie in such a situation goes against my well-argued, well-understood (and well-entrenched) principles, even if it would supposedly benefit my son. I very strongly hold to the view that if you think the system should be different, then you fight to change the system for everyone; you don\u2019t lie and cheat in such a way that leaves the bad system in place for everyone else and even reinforces its continuance. I didn\u2019t need to exaggerate my son\u2019s condition to get the help he needed, but because it\u2019s such widely known advice, I still have to deal with the fall-out of the advice: People presume that I must have exaggerated or known some special trick to get my son the help he receives. It\u2019s as if the receiving of that assistance for my son is  evidence  of my immoral character. Yet again, I am put in the position of defending myself and the help my son gets, against parents who didn\u2019t get the help (presumably in part because they were too moral to help the application along by lying). This effect of competition for limited resources starts before you even fill out your first form. It starts at the point of diagnosis. Your child\u2019s challenges might be described and categorized in different ways if they are borderline autistic or have co-morbid conditions. The pediatricians and health professionals know that if you get the \u201cright\u201d diagnosis, you are more likely to get the government assistance your family and child desperately need. Some health professionals are so in-tune with these concerns and the level of need of their clients, that they have over time established reputations as the \u201cgo-to\u201d person, to get an autism diagnosis which will allow you to get your child the help you want to get them, even if your child has some other challenges that don\u2019t fully fit the diagnostic criteria, particularly according to other doctors who had declined the diagnosis of autism. (I have written before about such a doctor within the local autism community.) These doctors are sometimes seen as heroes, particularly by the families who get financial assistance because of their diagnoses. They are just \u201cworking the system\u201d to help out families. The problem being that an autistic child who gets their diagnosis from this person will then have their diagnosis doubted when other parents hear about who the diagnosis came from; even if their child is genuinely autistic. Because of the ongoing competition for resources \u2013 diagnosis is not the only point at which resources become available \u2013 these children can become targets of anger because they are diluting the limited pool of assistance. Again, the doctors doing this \u2013 or even tempted to do this \u2013 should be arguing and fighting to change the system. They should not be reinforcing its unfairness and problems, by massaging truths and details so their clients can fit within it; leaving lesser \u201cinformed\u201d families and families of future children, to continue to suffer their way through the unchanged unjust system. I want to make it clear that I am not arguing these are the only reasons we might call others lucky for having more severe children, or argue over whose child is more severe, or use terminologies about severity of functionality, or get annoyed that certain people get help that we don\u2019t. But it seems to me that the systems we operate within whilst competing for limited resources, go a significant way towards creating and furthering such competitive attitudes and unhelpful terminology. One last important effect that I want to mention, that results from such competition for scarce resources, is what it does to our own views of our children and their views of themselves. When we are forced to think about how severely our children are affected, and are \u201crewarded\u201d with a share of the pie when we make our children appear significantly and severely affected, it necessarily impacts on how we in turn view our children. We are asked to talk and write about how bad their problems are, and a lot turns on how successfully we do that. We must focus of their problems, not their skills, in our applications for help. That makes sense, but it can make you start to see your child daily in terms of those severe challenges too. This doesn\u2019t mean there should be a \u201cwhat do you love about your child\u201d section in such forms \u2013 there\u2019s enough paperwork already thank you very much \u2013 but it does mean that its important to try to balance those necessarily negative focal points with celebrations and focusing on the positive in other areas of your parenting life. Not only will our children be affected by how we as parents view them, they may also become directly aware of them being described over and over on endless forms as difficult and troubled children. We can try to protect them from this \u2013 fill out forms away from them and out of ear-reach if the details are being discussed (as they often are) \u2013 but that is not always possible. We also often underestimate what our autistic children can hear and understand, so we don\u2019t always make the necessary effort to make sure they don\u2019t get directly exposed to these views of who they are. Our children face enough problems without realising they are viewed and talked about in terms of their challenges and problems, not their skills and amazing selves. Self-esteem, confidence and a positive self-image, matter. The competition for resources problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, particularly for those of us who must rely on the publicly funded system to meet our children\u2019s special needs. Whether the current system is set up in the best way to respond to those needs and allocate those resources, is a separate issue to the necessity of performing those tasks. At the least, I think it is extraordinarily important to be aware of how that competition impacts on our attitudes about our own and other autistic children, and of autism in general. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/unfriendly-consequences-what-competition-for-limited-resources-does-to-the-autism-community-and-autism-families/", "title": "Unfriendly Consequences: What competition for limited resources does to the autism community and autism\u00a0families"},
{"date": "June 19, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s hard to not have it taken the wrong way by adult autistics, when you openly state as a parent that you fighting the autistic traits of your son. It will no doubt often come across as if you are declaring autistic adulthood as something to be avoided at all costs (as if such a thing was even possible in the first place might I add). But that is not my aim; or even might I venture, the aim of other parents trying to lessen the challenging symptoms of autism in their children. We are just doing everything we can \u2013 as parents, regardless of the autism per se \u2013 to help our children gain the skills they need to one day function as independent happy adults for the sad foreseeable day that we\u2019re no longer around to care for them. We are just fulfilling our role as nurturer, educator, and loving parent. We\u2019re no more attempting to \u201cwipe out their autistic identity\u201d than a parent who makes their child do maths homework is trying to wipe out their love of alternative activities that they would much rather be doing (such as art, or bike riding). (And now I\u2019ve probably gone and offended a bunch more people by over-simplifying with my comparison. Forgive me that for now.) Every parent is tasked with the job of helping their child rise to whatever challenges they face; we would be considered neglectful \u2013 or even abusive \u2013 if we didn\u2019t. There are oh so many caveats I could add about not torturing the child with the efforts to overcome autistic behaviour, not misunderstanding the function and role of stimming, not holding them back from their passionate interests, blah blah blah. Why does no one ever assume that we know all this already; the automatic assumption is that we are evil uninformed parents trying to break our children down. Why must we constantly put in caveats that make our blog posts long and tiresome as we try to unoffend and say the right thing in just the right way. But I am tired of arguing tonight, about nuances and intentions and unintentions. I want to end the night on a smile and a bit of light-hearted fun.

{"date": "February 5, 2013", "body": "My son spent the first two of his school years at a Special School. That was where he needed to be. That was where he learnt the skills, and received the immense support that was necessary to get him to where he is today: In a mainstream school. By Krzysztof Pacholak I have a lot to say about the good and the bad of mainstreaming a high needs child. But this post isn\u2019t about the theories and the perspectives and the myths (you can find those posts in my blog easily enough if you\u2019re interested); this is about my son, and about his own mainstreaming experience. He\u2019s only had two days of it, but even reaching that point involved more work than I could probably ever make people truly understand. The decision itself was frightening, and making it happen was exhausting. When I walked away from dropping him off in his class on Monday, it felt like a graduation to me, for both me and my son. I didn\u2019t think the day would come, and when it did and I was left standing in that school courtyard, I felt like a band should have been playing to mark the occasion, but it was just one more kid being dropped off at school, and the simple and beautiful ordinariness of that event was itself remarkable in such an extraordinary and difficult life. Earlier that morning, the School Principal had found me and put her arm around me and gave me the sort of smile that lets you know you and your child are welcome and wanted. Her warmth and passion was one of the most important factors in our decision to go with this school. She is not alone in her awesomeness there either: The school had arranged for my son to have full-time teacher aide support for his first week, which was so much more than I\u2019d hoped for, and exactly what he needed for a strong start to the year. I had the chance to meet with the room teacher and the teacher aides (three of them would variously be with my son over the week) on Friday, before the school term started. I took their photos to make my son a book, and we all discussed the incredible little boy they were going to meet in a few days. They were all interested, and happy, and calm, and patient, and all the other right adjectives. At the end of his first day, when I returned to pick him up, I happened upon one of his teacher aides. She told me he\u2019d been fantastic all day, and even asserted his independence; wanting to do tasks without her help. She was impressed with him. And then the bell rang and he came running out to me, so excited that he\u2019d forgotten to get his school bag and shoes, so I sent him back in again and he reappeared, just about shaking with joy. He told me he loves his new school, and it\u2019s the best school ever, and he wants to go back the next day. The next morning I had the chance to catch up with his main room teacher, and what she said to me was one of the most lovely things; it was about my son\u2019s main stim. My son has something that I call a \u201chappy dance,\u201d where he flicks his hands and hums and dances from foot to foot when he is very happy and excited. I\u2019d told the teaching team what the behaviour was and what it meant, so it wouldn\u2019t shock or confuse them. When I met up with the teacher that second morning of school, she told me how much she loves his happy dance because it let her know when she was doing something right. It\u2019s so often hard to tell with the other children whether they\u2019re enjoying the task or activity because they won\u2019t tell her or show her how they feel, but there is my son with his happiness written all over his body and face, and she thought that was something wonderful. His happy dance has been the object of derision and confusion and efforts to stamp it out by a couple of therapists, but here was a teacher rejoicing in it as something that made him special in the best meaning of \u201cspecial.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she realises how much that means to me, but it means the world; that she sees his difference and enjoys him the more for it. The school and my son have surpassed my expectations, and all the hard work to get to this point was worth it. Whatever happens next, the right foundations are in place. Mainstreaming has begun, and so far, it\u2019s a beautiful thing. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/pacholak/6007568835/#"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/mainstreamed/", "title": "Mainstreamed"},
{"date": "June 21, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Paul Mayne via Flickr \n I want to preface what I\u2019m about to write, by saying that I have always loved my autistic son. I have always chosen to be closely involved with his daily life and to help him with his daily struggles. But it has been incredibly hard \u2013 and sometimes dangerous \u2013 for me to be his mother. It has often be heart-breakingly sad. A lot of things got a lot better for everyone after I had his brother (who doesn\u2019t have any signs of autism). This post is about how that brother helped me to cherish and accept my first son more, and helped his own development and happiness too. I missed out on a lot of very positive and yearned for experiences, when I had an autistic child. The awareness of what I was missing out on, was highlighted whenever I spent time with families of other preschool children, who talk to and hug and play with their parents; which is part of why it can make you feel even more alone and misunderstood when you spend time with those other families. I couldn\u2019t take my son to the activities and events that other parents did either; if I tried I\u2019d be lucky to even get my son out of the car, then usually I\u2019d have to cope with his meltdown, until the time at which we\u2019d leave the event early (and not get invited back, no one wants  that  family to return). I had so many expectations about what my son would be able to do, how much fun it would be to teach him, and how awesome it would be to hear his thoughts and feelings about the world I\u2019d brought him into. I am not a bad mother for having expectations of my son; they were completely natural to have. Neither am I a bad mum for mourning the loss of those things when receiving his diagnosis of autism. Wondering what job he would have, where he would live, how many children he would have, became very real concerns that he would never have a job, never have children, and probably never live independently either. I thought I was so open-minded about what he\u2019d want to do with his life \u2013 whatever he chose to do would be fine with me, I was sure I\u2019d learn to love all his choices simply because he made them \u2013 compare that to the realisation that your child might never even be  able  to make such choices in the first place. In time I came to better understand autism and my own child, and came to terms with the reality he and I now faced. But there remained that lingering sadness that I didn\u2019t get to experience all those things every other parent around me was busy taking for granted and even complaining about: The endless chatter and questions from a preschooler; the milestones that mean you have to baby-proof your house because they become so adventurous and interested in their world; those hilarious daily antics that leave you laughing while you\u2019re trying to tell them off. There is a comparative joy in dealing with tantrums brought on by a neurotypical child who  wants  to do something he\u2019s not allowed to do; than the endless meltdowns of an autistic child not willing (or sometimes even able) to do something he  has  to do just to get through each day. That makes for a very different parenting experience. I hadn\u2019t truly realised how much that sadness had remained, or how much those things meant to me, until I had our second son, who filled those holes in my parenting life. I now have a child I can snuggle until he squirms free, and turn upside down and throw up in the air without his having a sensory issues and resulting meltdowns. A child who babbles so endlessly that one of his grandmothers felt compelled to say \u201che just doesn\u2019t shut up does he.\u201d No, he doesn\u2019t, and I love him for it. And I\u2019ll not be telling him to shut up anytime soon. I can even take him on car rides and actually get out at the end location, at which point he is excited and eager to investigate the new location, not fearfully shaking. Having these desires in my life filled, means I no longer dwell on not having had them with my first son. The pain and loss of all those wonderful things, isn\u2019t erased, but it is eased and made less significant. I look less to the past and the losses, and focus more on the present and what I have. Having a younger sibling in the house has also allowed me to see the competences and accomplishments of my eldest autistic son, because he teaches and cares for his younger brother. He too seems to have a new awareness since having a younger brother, of what he is good at and can do, because his younger brother is not good at and could not do those same things (such as walking, talking and eating hard foods). So the in-home emphasis very naturally shifts from what the eldest can  not  do, to what the eldest  can  do. Quite amusingly, his younger brother also teaches him. When the youngest plays with a\u00a0 toy the way it was \u201cintended\u201d to be played with, or investigates something previously ignored or discounted by his older brother, or wants to do a new physical skill that used to scare the eldest; my eldest son takes an interest in trying it for himself too. I suppose it\u2019s a rather natural sort of motivating jealousy sometimes too; we praise the youngest for doing X, so the eldest wants to do X too. Or we give the youngest lots of endless cuddles, so the eldest wants some of that action too thanks. It also allows us as parents to point out to the eldest that there are special things \u2013 special independent activities and tasks \u2013 that only big boys get to do. Only big boys can dress themselves, hop out of the bath by themselves, not have to wear nappies, eat certain foods, etc. There was a time, early on, that I loved one son more than the other, and my awareness and knowledge of that shocked and scared me. I loved the first child \u2013 my autistic son \u2013 more. Because I knew him. Because I had been though so much with him. How could a new little baby compete with that? I loved the new baby \u2013 absolutely \u2013 but not \u201cas much\u201d as his brother. Quite naturally, as time went by and I got to know and experience my second son more, I came to love them both equally and beyond measure. I utterly adore my sons, just thinking about how much I love them makes me teary-eyed. They are kind, beautiful, hilarious, happy children. They both drive me nuts sometimes \u2013 in very different ways \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want to be without them for anything. If my second son had turned out to be autistic \u2013 there was always a chance of that of course \u2013 I would have coped. Maybe I would have found the same level of joy and acceptance as I currently have of them. Maybe things would have even turned out better than they did having a second son who was neurotypical. I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ll never know; my story  is  my life, I cannot rewrite it with maybes. But as things stand, I can say that I am very glad we took the chance of having a second child, and very glad that he turned out to be neurotypical; that was what  this  family needed. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/64685187@N00/2539071"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/the-gift-of-a-neurotypical-brother/", "title": "The gift of a neurotypical\u00a0brother"},
{"date": "June 23, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n I have a regular commenter, who openly states that he chooses not to tell his work colleagues about his autism (Aspergers specifically), out of concern for how it might impact on their attitudes towards him and his work. Today I found  this piece  about someone\u2019s similar (and very real) concerns about work colleagues\u2019 attitudes towards their Aspergers too. It\u2019s clear that such concerns are well-grounded; people will be tempted to think of you and the quality of your work differently, merely because you have a diagnosed condition of some description. But it is also clear that judgment is not just for autism or Aspergers or depression; it\u2019s to do with the person doing the judgment making decisions from a usually ignorant stand-point (they don\u2019t know much at all about the condition, the idea of diagnosis is what puts them off), and that the person doing the judging has erroneously confused together the quality of a worker and their work, with the condition. As if the condition pre- and over-determines the outcome of the work relationship. Whilst also forgetting that many people all around them have diagnoses unannounced, or problems as yet undiagnosed. When one hears about a diagnosis, you\u2019d hope the reaction would be polite interest and enhanced understanding and patience. It seems that might be an unrealistic expectation, at this time. I am hopeful (ever hopeful) that as awareness of autism increases, so will understanding; that autism does not predetermine personalities, intelligence, skills or inabilities. It is a condition that brings with it certain (and at times, significant) challenges, but those challenges are not insurmountable; particularly by the time the person at issue has made it to adult-hood and to the point where they are actively seeking and applying for jobs. I see the autistic people in the workforce now, as lighting the way for my son. They are clearing the rubbish and ignorance out of the way, with the evidence of their amazing work-place accomplishments despite (and sometimes because of) their autism. But when I read and hear and see that they are often actively keeping their diagnoses a secret, I worry that the link between autistic people and amazing work, continues to go unrecognised. However I fully understand their decision to hold back that knowledge; not just because it might hurt their earning and ability to support their families, or their career prospects. But because their diagnosis  should be  irrelevant. Surely all that matters is they do their job and they do it well. There should be no pressure to tell everyone that they have a diagnosis, but neither should there be any shame attached to that pronouncement. Hiding one\u2019s autism isn\u2019t always an option. When it\u2019s severe enough to be noticed very quickly, but not so severe that the person is largely unemployable, it\u2019s all the harder to even get your foot in the door. I have been extremely pleased to see a growing number of organisations and initiatives set up to find jobs specifically for such autistic people; promoting their sometimes considerable and rather unique talents, whilst also actively supporting them through the employment process. So where will my own son fit in to all this? At this point in time, I could foresee him sitting between these two broad groups of people. His autism might always be obvious and debilitating, or it might become significantly less so over the next decade; he has had very real progress over the past two years alone. Either way I do foresee him being employable and seeking employment. I wonder then, whether my current actions are hurting his chances. I am trying to raise awareness and understanding of autism, a large part of my motivation in doing so is to make his future brighter. And I\u2019ve put him in special programs, and now in a special school, with the aim of increasing his skills and overcoming his challenges. But along the way have I \u2013 do I \u2013 over-expose his identity, in such a way as to lessen his chances of employment and inclusion as an adult? There are a couple of places (at least) on the internet, where his name is directly linked with autism \u2013 sometimes as a simple consequence of him being my son and me fighting for\u00a0 \u201cmy autistic son\u201d. Then there is the fact of his enrolment at a special needs school; his name and educational past now eternally linked with his disability. I\u2019ve done these things with the best of intentions, and more specifically, in his best interests. But unless future workplaces and work colleagues can be made to understand that this condition he has, and this special help he needed, do not mean that he is unemployable, then there is potential that I have hurt his future already. What a horrible and frightening thought. So all the more, I must fight to make people understand that autism does not mean unemployable. And I passionately ask \u2013 once the knowledge is no longer a danger to your employment, perhaps at retirement if it must be that way \u2013 that autistic people speak out proudly and loudly that they worked and their work was most excellent. A lot can happen in the next decade, before my son reaches adulthood. I will continue to do all I can to make those happenings, positive ones. Not just for my own son, but for every autistic person who just wants the chance to live up to the very best and most they can be. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism_awareness_ribbon-20051114.png", "http://ht.ly/5np4N"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/discrimination-against-autism-in-the-workforce-and-am-i-hurting-my-sons-employment-prospects/", "title": "Discrimination against autism in the workforce, and am I hurting my son\u2019s employment\u00a0prospects?"},
{"date": "June 22, 2011", "body": "\n Image via Wikipedia \n Here in New Zealand, the anti-abortion organisation \u201cRight to Life\u201d has announced that it is going to take the government to the International Criminal Court, for pregnancy screening practices that identify Down syndrome children. They claim that about 90% of those children will be aborted, though the current figure is apparently 75%. The projected higher figure is based on government estimates. This, the organisation claims, amounts to either Genocide (Article 6) or a Crime against Humanity (Article 7), under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to which New Zealand is a signatory. Genocide is defined in the Statute as specified acts (including measures to prevent births) with the intent to destroy whole or part of a national, ethnical, religious or racial group. Crimes against humanity are acts committed as part of a widespread or systemic attack, against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. From my preliminary look at definitions and categories, I don\u2019t see a good case under either Article, but I\u2019ll return to that question later. The changes to the screening test for Down syndrome that have lead to the heightened debate, were introduced specifically to improve the safety of screening; bringing New Zealand up to an international standard. The screening test itself remains optional. It accompanies an explicit and official attitude that knowing a child is going to have Down syndrome allows the parent to make informed decisions prior to birth. Obviously, a potential consequence of that informed choice may be the decision to abort the child; but it has been made very clear by the government that the aim is not to reduce the number of Down syndrome children born in New Zealand. Abortion is legal in New Zealand, but there are restrictions. One of the approved reasons for an abortion, is fetal abnormality. Right to Life are cynical about the professed government aims re the introduction of better screening for Down syndrome. The organisation has cited economic concerns as one of the driving forces behind the government\u2019s actions. There are clearly some very heated intertwined issues here: Emotional, ethical and legal amongst them. One of the many complicating factors is the question of abortion. A woman\u2019s right to control her body is pitted against the unborn child\u2019s right to life. At which point a human being acquires rights \u2013 and what rights they acquire against another \u2013 is necessarily at issue here, and often tied into differing and conflicting religious, scientific and legal opinions. As long as the question of aborting disabled children is intimately tied to the very question of abortion, it will be excessively hard to make headway in the debate. Which is part of why the fact that the Right to Life organisation is spear-heading this campaign, is not in the best interests of the debate: If abortion is  always  wrong then abortion of Down syndrome children is always wrong. We need to tease the question of abortion, apart from the question of identifying unborn disabled children: \u201cIn a country that recognises a woman\u2019s right to abort a child, is it acceptable that she have made available to her the knowledge that the unborn child has certain disabling conditions?\u201d And then we get to the question of which conditions, and why. If the unborn child\u2019s life would be short and horrific, expected to only survive perhaps a few hours after birth, then we would surely (if we accept abortion as a legitimate option) allow for the testing and identification of such a condition. But what about Down syndrome? And what about autism? We do not as yet have a test that will identify autism in an unborn child (and it should be noted that the existing Down syndrome tests are also not 100% reliable; there will still be Down syndrome children being born, even if every woman chose to do the screening, and every woman chose to abort, which is not what is currently happening anyway). Yet despite the absence of such in utero tests for autism, it is an oft-debated issue: Should we try to design such a test, if it is possible? If such a test existed, should it be made available to everyone or no one or a select group of at-risk parents (perhaps those already with an autistic child who intimately understand the reality of their decision)? If this New Zealand Down syndrome \u201ccase\u201d makes it to the International Court (which from what I understand, is legally questionable, though I will make further enquiries), it would potentially be a test case for the rest of us in the special needs community. In the meantime, there\u2019s plenty of food for thought there, and I would \u2013 as ever \u2013 love to hear what you think.

{"date": "February 17, 2013", "body": "I am a New Zealander, born and raised, but I am not of Maori descent. I do not live a life steeped in Maori culture, but I do teach tikanga Maori as part of a law tutorial course, and have done so for about eight years. That teaching experience has at least exposed me to key concepts and the differing perspectives of Maori, through both readings and many group discussions. It is with these limitations and this background that I respectfully write this post. I have done extra research to shore-up my understandings, but I know without having lived as Maori, my understanding of what it is like to live as Maori with autism, is accordingly limited. If you find errors or major oversights in this post, please know that I would like to hear about it and learn from it; this post is an attempt to understand and share, not a settled point of view. The experience of living with autism is necessarily affected by sociological factors; though the condition is defined as and is itself a medical one, the ways it impacts on one\u2019s life can vary to a certain extent with factors of wealth, gender, culture, religion (etc). I understood this in a rudimentary way early on, but it was  Grinker\u2019s book \u201cUnstrange Minds\u201d  that opened my eyes to just how much culture can impact on how autism is responded to and viewed. It made me wonder how autism might impact on the indigenous culture of my own country. Over the years I\u2019ve encountered a few readings on the topic, and have decided to attempt to pull together some of those threads in a post. Maori Art & Crafts Institute, Rotorua. (There are many factors relevant to Maori being a disadvantaged minority, such as being able to access, understand and trust service providers. These are important considerations, but here I am particularly interested in Maori-culture-specific issues; aspects of Maori culture that may impact on how autism is experienced.) Maori culture is a very oral culture, where knowledge and identity is traditionally passed down through the spoken (or sung) word. Tracing your whakapapa (ancestry) back to waka and even the Maori gods, is a central part of knowing who you are and where you fit into the world. Autism impacts on communication, particularly face-to-face spoken communication. This means it impacts on identity in a way that is somewhat unique and stronger than how it impacts on pakeha (non-Maori). For example, it is not customary nor expected that a pakeha learn to orally recite their lineage, and their inability to do so does not impact on their identity, in their own eyes or the eyes of others. Kapa haka (song and dance) is also a vital part of Maori culture. Being able to participate in either song or dance is complicated by autism due to not just the spoken impact of autism, but also the very frequent coordination and movement-control aspects of autism. This is just another way that autistic Maori may find themselves and their families affected in their ability to participate in their own culture. Similarly, expectations around protocols and in/appropriate behaviours (kawa, tika), are a part of Maori culture as it is in any culture. Considering that the dominant \u201clived\u201d culture in New Zealand is pakeha culture (our signs, our laws, our language etc), I could imagine that autistic Maori find themselves having to acquaint themselves with two sets of community and customary rules, that must at times conflict with each other. At the very least, there are extra opportunities for inadvertent and unintentional breaching of protocols, due to uncontrolled behaviours or communication misunderstandings. It is customary to spend time on Marae, including extended overnight stays. The difficulties these changes in routine pose for an autistic individual, along with the ones listed above, affect not just the individual but their entire family. If a family cannot partake in its traditional cultural practices because of an individual who is part of that family, I could imagine that putting extra stress on the family unit itself and the other family members individually. Even the practice of sharing care of children across the wider family group (whanau) is harder when the child is autistic. This is something pakeha families experience too of course, but the extra layer of impact on cultural and group identity, is an important consideration for the lived experience of autism. There is a point I want to make that comes up in this discussion, but I think has much wider implications too: It is often said that the society needs to adapt to autistics, not autistics to society, that people in society need to change their expectations and understandings of others behaviours and words in order to better accommodate autistics and allow them to part of society. However, when the practices, expectations and rules are deeply rooted in tradition, belief and identity, it becomes far more difficult to simply expect everyone else to change and adapt. If your culture is oral, and expects many personal social interactions, and has many protocols surrounding many aspects of life (as is true of Maori culture), demanding those things change implies a lot more than just asking people to \u201cbe more accepting of others.\u201d These traditions and expectations are not simply arbitrary or based on discriminatory ways of treating people (though some \u2013 including those within the culture \u2013 may think it that way), they are part of an indigenous centuries-old culture. I can only think that this poses that many more challenges on Maori autistics; both in helping a child to be part of their own culture, and in trying to get those around them to adapt and accept their child\u2019s differences. How much this impacts on daily life, and how it in turn affects Maori attitudes towards autism as a condition in its own right, I can\u2019t confidently speculate, but as usual I suspect that will significantly vary from person to person (and in part, from region to region, since the ways tikanga concepts are interpreted and applied, can and does vary). I have thought of other ways in which Maori might also be differently affected by autism, in regards to the collective rather than individualistic nature of identity and responsibility in Maoridom; how that might be impacted when one of the individuals is so very different and not always in meaningful control of their words and actions. I openly admit that I do not know enough about how Maori generally view and treat the actions of the disabled, to delve any deeper into that area. (I always wanted to do \u201cpsychiatry and the law\u201d as part of my legal studies, and I hope the issues would have been raised there, but it\u2019s a gap in my knowledge that I haven\u2019t had the chance to fill yet.) I would be very interested in hearing from people who are more in the know. For those who want to read further on these issues, here are some links to information that I found useful in writing this post (unfortunately I cannot speak Maori fluently to enable me to access pieces not written in English): \n New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Gu ideline)\u00a0government publication, with a significant section on Maori and autism). \n Maori Perspectives on Autism Spectrum Disorder  (study) \n Classroom Culture  (definingnz) \n In My Shoes  (link to info on the DVD, sorry I don\u2019t have access to the DVD footage itself (though I have watched it myself), it is useful if you can get hold of it). \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/davorg/2206069210/", "http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/new-zealand-autism-spectrum-disorder-guideline", "http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/special_education/5479", "http://definingnz.com/classroom-culture/", "http://www.inmyshoes.co.nz/info.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/02/17/maori-autism-culture-and-identity/", "title": "Maori, Autism, Culture and\u00a0Identity."},
{"date": "February 14, 2013", "body": "Non-autistic parents of autistic children, are apparently privileged. What does that mean, and why does it matter? And does it really justify silencing and attacking us, as seems to have become a popular pass-time for a few autism bloggers? By TheFutureIsUnwritten \u201cPrivilege\u201d here means that we\u2019re in a position of power, particularly as relative to other autistic adults and autistic parents. We live in a world where being not-autistic is some sort of advantage, a world where our voices as non-autistic parents is apparently already strong. Whether that is true or not, is one question. The second part of the question is what this supposed privilege entails or justifies. The argument I see coming through the most often when privilege is cited, goes like this: Because of our privilege, we non-autistic parents of autistic children, are meant to make way for the voices of autistic parents and autistic adults; pass them the speaking platform when it is offered to us, and give them the ability and position to verify our own views as correct and acceptable. Their views take primacy, and must always be heard over and above our own. Whether that is a reasonable and defendable response to privilege (imagined or otherwise) is also debatable. But first, are we really in a position or power and privilege, relatively or otherwise? Clearly, parents of autistic kids are in a position of weakness and lack of power when it comes to society and particularly to the parenting world. We go largely unheard and ignored in the mainstream world, and we have to fight for basic rights to health and education for our children in a way that other parents rarely understand or encounter. Our lives are typically exhausting, under-resourced, and misunderstood. So when it comes to writing or speaking about  parenting , we are not in a position of privilege at all, we are the ones who need to be facilitated and heard. What about in comparison to autistic adults and autistic parents; are we non-autistic parents not \u201cprivileged\u201d in comparison to them? The superficial answer is yes. However, this is not always the case. Is a Maori, lesbian, physically-disabled, non-autistic mother, privileged when compared to a white, male, heterosexual, autistic father? The obvious answer is no, but there is a potential reply here: That in the context of talking about autism and raising autistic children, the non-autistic individual remains in a position of power and privilege because autism is largely understood and defined already through the non-autistic viewpoint. However there is a major consideration about the nature of disability that I think goes under or unappreciated here. Very often the rhetoric of privilege and power goes hand-in-hand with the notion that disability is a socially defined construct (in preference to the medical model of disability): Both \u201cprivilege\u201d and the social definition of disability, come from sociological roots (and routes) of understanding the world and our interactions in the world. Here\u2019s the problem then: If disability is a social construct, then how you experience something like autism is hugely informed by your position of wealth, your ethnicity, your nationality, your gender, and a lot of factors completely independent of the condition of autism, since they are used to define and construct disability. Therefore, when talking about  experiences and realities  of living with autism, it would always be relevant to consider those other factors at play, so the question of privilege becomes much for complex than simply \u201cdoes or doesn\u2019t have autism,\u201d  even when simply discussing autism . So , if this is true, then those with autism who are not-poor/white/ heterosexual, would have to be ready to give up their own speaking platforms and verify their own view-points in relation to autistic people who do  not  have their privileges ( if  this is what we think privilege requires; giving up speaking platforms and verifying our views and understanding by running them past those who have the deeper and more genuine understanding). At which point you really are stuck, because society is full of comparative privileges that impact on how we experience and understand things; we all carry around various impactful privileges, particularly when it comes to something like autism where the experience and understanding of it is so very much informed by other societal considerations. Let\u2019s make things \u201csimpler,\u201d and accept that autistic people (particularly autistic adults) better understand autism than their non-autistic counterparts, because they themselves have autism. First off, we need to be clear that who does and does not have autism is not always quite that straight forward, many parents of autistic children do themselves have autism or autistic traits, that give them the relevant insights. Some are diagnosed some are not, they do not and should not have to tell everyone their \u201cautistic status\u201d in order to be heard, at the very least one should not assume the parent who is writing is not autistic, as so many people do assume. Let\u2019s simplify it even further then, how about  purely  non-autistic parents, surely they do not have the insights into parenting an autistic child that an autistic parent does. Again, I don\u2019t think this follows well, because autism itself is so various from person to person, in both intensity and even symptoms (though the new DSM-5 should help clear that up a bit); raising a severely autistic child is not the same experience as raising a mild one (I should know, my son has moved from one end of the spectrum to the other, they are extremely different parenting experiences on multiple levels). What about the deeper understanding that comes from having autism inside you, quite apart from the actual parenting experience, surely that matters more and the most? There\u2019s a problem again: There is no consensus on view-points on autism amongst the autistic either. There are a huge variety of perspectives on whether autism is great or a curse, is easy or hard to live with, from the very people who have autism; views that vary  just as much  as those held by non-autistic parents of autistic children. So unless we want to say these people are wrong and inauthentic, we need to allow for that variance, and if you\u2019re going to allow for that variance which often sits alongside the exact variance you see in parental viewpoints too, then why silence or belittle the non-autistic parent viewpoints? Just because they have \u201cprivilege?\u201d Here\u2019s what this actually comes down to, because this is what I see all the time in these discussions: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to speak from a position of privilege if you agree with us.\u201d If you disagree, you are expected to be quiet and make way for the \u201cgenuine\u201d voices. Who are \u201cus\u201d? Whoever currently thinks they are the most enlightened; it is not defined by group membership per se, but by conforming to a particular view-point. This impression has been strongly reinforced due to the number of times I have seen the attack shift once someone finds out the parent they\u2019re having a go at is indeed autistic: The attack doesn\u2019t simply stop because the argument of privilege is gone, the attack continues on new lines once the privilege argument fails. Which is to say, the key is not privilege or power, even though that is the go-to argument when our views are deemed unacceptable. It is used to shut down the discussion, to put the speaker in their place, to silence dissent. The way I see it, when the privilege argument is used in this way, it is just an ad hominem argument: Because of who you are, your argument fails. No need to engage in premises and truths and discussion, just dismiss the view you don\u2019t like by claiming the other person has privilege. This is also a type of discrimination: Dismissing a view and an experience on the grounds of something outside of someone\u2019s control; their neurology. Your understanding and experience of raising an autistic child is irrelevant and wrong because of your brain. That, to me, is no different than attacking an autistic person\u2019s views just because of their autism. We should be engaging with what the person is saying, not simply with who is saying it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are times that being autistic is relevant and essential to an argument, but we have to distinguish when it is relevant and why ( I have written on this topic ), because it is  not  always relevant, and this is particularly going to be true when it comes to writing about a unique experience like parenting. It is hard to grasp the experience and challenges of parenting if you\u2019ve never done it. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have experts on parenting or people with insights on parenting who have never done it. And by the very same token, neither does never having had autism predetermine that you can\u2019t have insights or expertise on autism itself. The structure and premises of an argument matters; one should avoid rather than seek out ad hominems when trying to persuade others. And privilege used in this simplistic way \u2013 as a stand-alone attack \u2013 is a type of ad hominem argument. Here\u2019s the point then: Privilege is not as straightforward as many claim. People have many privileges, and many privileges are relevant even in singular discussion contexts (like parenting an autistic child). Privilege is an observation, a possible consideration, but it is not a winning argument. It is not grounds to silence those you disagree with. It is not even grounds to tell someone they have to give up their speaking rights to others less privileged, since there are not finite ways in this world to communicate and be heard. It is, again, a reason to think about providing more opportunities to those who may be going unheard, but it is not grounds through which to justify silencing those who are already marginalised in society \u2013 parents of autistic children. We already have to battle to be heard in the world, to tell us we must also give up our voices each time and seek permission and verification from autistic adults when we speak, is to squash us from two directions at once. We are squeezed out of the narrative, unless we tow the party line, in which case we\u2019re welcome to the podium. The arguments to hear autistic voices \u2013 on parenting or other topics \u2013 doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t rest on the claim of privilege and power. It\u2019s much simpler and stronger than that. It\u2019s about  respect , it\u2019s about being heard, it\u2019s about hearing diverse viewpoints and experiences. Which is to say, the  very same reasons  that us non-autistic parents of autistic children need to be heard too. Respect. Diversity. Difference. We parents do not speak with one voice. Autistic parents and autistic adults do not speak with one voice. The argument of privilege is a distraction, a too often used ad hominem attack. It is not always relevant, and almost always unhelpful. Identify and acknowledge privilege, sure, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trump card. You want to play the great privilege card battle with me? Fine, go for it, but I carry around more privilege and disadvantages than you could imagine, and neither of us will ever convince the other on those grounds alone. The privilege game has no winner, so stop playing it. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/eduardozarate/5361049944/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/the-privilege-game/", "title": "The Privilege Game"},
{"date": "February 20, 2013", "body": "Over the past two years, my son was driven to and from his school everyday by a taxi service funded by the government. At the end of last year, we were told that the contract for these daily taxi trips was going to another company. The school itself had argued against the change; they were more than satisfied with the service they were already receiving and tried to make the relevant government department in control of the tendering process, understand that change of this type can cause great stress and anxiety for special kids. There was nothing wrong with the existing provider, the change would cause distress for vulnerable children, but still the tender process ran its course, and so the school was left hoping for the best. By Evgeni Zotov And  receiving far from it . Two Octobers ago, I shared with you  the tale of the miscommunicated change in school taxi drivers  that left me panicked, thinking my son was missing or abducted. It was an instance of the immense vulnerability we and our children have in this situation: We trust these drivers to safely carry high needs children from A to B, but it\u2019s more than picking them up and dropping them off. It\u2019s trusting that the driver has strong enough character and patience and problem-solving skills, to cope with very challenging high needs children, when the drivers have no training at all in this area. All they have to know to get the job, is how to drive. (And apparently their pay-packets reflect this expectation, I\u2019ve been told the pay is very poor.) They don\u2019t understand why a severely autistic child, for instance, can\u2019t just be dropped off at their home, they need to be physically handed over to a guardian. They don\u2019t understand how to correctly deal with a non-verbal child that kicks and screams in the back of the taxi. They don\u2019t understand why certain phrases and instructions mean nothing or can even be painful to the wrong set of ears. I went out of my way to set up a personal relationship with the two long-term taxi drivers my son had, so I could try to fill these knowledge gaps, and try to make them care about my son as an individual and not just a package to be delivered (it would have been just one driver over the two years, but the original driver moved overseas). I\u2019d talk to them about his behaviours and what he could and couldn\u2019t understand, and how to help him calm down if he was acting up. I even gave them Christmas and thank you gifts, to cement that relationship. These couldn\u2019t just be taxi drivers, I needed them to feel like they were more than just that, because they  were  more than just that. So putting a taxi service up for tender \u2013 seeking the best price \u2013 strikes me as missing the point. In my eyes, that\u2019s tendering a special relationship. So it\u2019s even worse when I read that the contract recently tendered to a new company, apparently allows that company to then sub-contract out those services to other providers. That makes me think the tendering process wasn\u2019t focused on the history or reliability of the company that would be providing the service, if they were given the power to then subcontract to whoever they might choose; it\u2019s no longer a service provided by that specific company at that point. The  end results  of this subcontracting and of the companies that won the tenders in their own right, are beyond unacceptable. My son no longer takes the taxi everyday to and from school, because  he started at the local school this year  (we literally walk across the road). What my son misses about those daily taxi trips, isn\u2019t the trip itself, it was the man in the front seat. The man who knew about the other kid in the back of that taxi van that teased my son, and how to deal with it. The man who played \u201cDancing Queen\u201d over and over in the taxi, because it made the kids so happy. The man who was sad to know he\u2019d no longer get to see the kids he\u2019d grown to care about. How do you tender for that? Money matters, yes. But so does what you get for that money. And when the school, and the students, and the families, all think the change in service provider is unnecessary and foreseeably damaging, it\u2019s best to listen and weigh that  very  heavily in any tendering process. The consequences of getting it wrong are felt in the daily lives of vulnerable children and their families. Our children are not just cargo, and their drivers were never just drivers. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/zz77/6261888008/", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10866482", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10866482"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/tendering-a-relationship-when-a-taxi-is-more-than-a-ride/", "title": "Tendering a Relationship?

{"date": "February 27, 2013", "body": "A woman had a 20 week pregnancy scan. The scan was read incorrectly, she was told her baby had no abnormalities. Her baby was born with spina bifida. The people who performed the scan admit they had made an error. The mother can\u2019t meet the costs of physiotherapy that are crucial to her child\u2019s well-being. She tries to make a claim under ACC: New Zealand\u2019s accident compensation scheme, which is known to be quite generous in its coverage of costs when an individual meets the criteria. In order to successfully claim for this coverage, the mother must prove that the failure to provide treatment \u2013 in this case, the failure to have the abortion that she would have had if she had correct knowledge from the scan \u2013 has led to a personal injury. By Scott*, via Flickr Let\u2019s be very clear about this: In order for her to successfully claim, she needs to state that she would have aborted her child had she known it was disabled, and that the resulting child\u2019s condition is a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to her as the mother. And that is what she is claiming. She states too that she loves her child, she wants the very best for her child, and it hurts her to make these sorts of claims about her child. Remember too that this is the only way she can see to be able to afford much-needed treatment for her child: By successfully making a claim under ACC. You need to be aware too that ACC makes what is considered by many to be an arbitrary decision between providing cover for disability caused by accident, and not covering disability present at birth. These are the hardships and injustices this mother is up against. I want you to keep all that in mind, because what follows is going to get ugly, and will upset some people. In this post I am going to delve more deeply into the legal issues at play here and why the mother is forced into this line of argument. I will not get highly technical; I want this to be accessible because I want to help people understand this story. I am no expert in this area either, I am relying on a general legal background to help me through the mire. The case originated as an appeal against ACC\u2019s ruling not to cover the mother. Both the District Court and High Court dismissed her appeals, but the mother has won the right to have the Court of Appeal hear her case. The child is now five years old. First, the word \u201ctreatment\u201d is important here, because the mother needs to argue that she was injured by the failure to provide treatment that should have been made available to her, through the error of the scan readers. It appears that in New Zealand and in most of the world, the option to \u201ctreat\u201d spina bifida is not to perform surgery: \u201c\u2026 intra-uterine procedures to treat spina bifida before birth remain experimental and are only practiced in one or two centres in the United States of America. \u201d (Quote from High Court decision.) Rather, if one wishes to \u201ctreat\u201d the condition, the treatment available is abortion. Therefore, her strongest argument would depend on her consistently claiming she would have chosen to have that treatment \u2013 the abortion \u2013 had the option being made available to her. Next we have the question of \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d How has the mother suffered some personal injury here, surely such a claim would have to be made on behalf only of the child (if at all)? First, to look to the mother\u2019s claim. The pregnancy itself has not caused injury to the mother, and yet that is the outcome of the failure of treatment: the continuing pregnancy. How can the mother call the child\u2019s condition after birth, which harms the  child  directly and not the mother directly, a  personal  injury? She can do this by having the lawyer make a claim along these lines: \u201c The continued development of the child\u2019s condition is, in itself, harmful and injurious to the appellant mother. \u201d (Quote from High Court decision.) In the High Court it was decided that the child, being a separate person upon birth, is the one \u2013 if anyone is the one \u2013 with a claim here, where the mother suffered no additional, separate physical injuries. What of the child\u2019s potential claim then; why would the mother persist with a claim in her own right? What does such a claim amount to for the child in its own right, when the only alternative result of the ill-read scan, was abortion, was death? The child would be claiming, essentially, that the wrong done to it, was  life . That it is \u201cwrongful life.\u201d The High Court judge agreed with a decision by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on this general issue, where that court stated: \u201c to entertain the child\u2019s claim would be to contrary to public policy as a violation of the sanctity of human life .\u201d Which is to say, essentially, that a claim made under the child\u2019s name, would be ethically and legally abhorrent. Do you see then, why the mother finds herself making these horrible claims? Can you see past the horror of what she is forced to say in a desperate effort to get her child appropriate care, in the face of a system set up in a way that disadvantages those born with disability compared to those who came to disability after birth? Or are her claims too stomach-churning for you? I will tell you what I personally think and feel, though I am torn on this and unsettled in my own views. What I hear is a mother who loves her child, doing whatever she must to get her child the best shot in life. I see this as a story about ACC, and the wording of ACC (\u201ctreatment,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury\u201d). I see her arguing, hoping, that other people will understand the division between choosing an abortion for a child you will thereby never know, versus endlessly and completely loving the child you now have. I see a public ready to vilify her for her readiness to speak about how she\u2019d have liked to abort the child she now has, and for promoting a view about the abortion of the disabled. And I very much so understand that public, because I have that reaction too; it\u2019s hard not to. Does anything \u2013 ACC, poverty, the well-being of a child \u2013 excuse saying you wish you\u2019d had the option to abort your child? Do we not have to weigh-up the well-being of the child who may receive the ACC payment, against the  mental and emotional  well-being of a child hearing the world being told their mother would have aborted them? But don\u2019t we also have to be honest about the fact that women do have the right of abortion, and have chosen to abort for much less than serious disability? I don\u2019t think we can tackle this whole issue, without staring in the face of the law and policy around abortion and even the issue of eugenics. (I  have written  a bit about this in the past too, in relation to an earlier New Zealand news story, but around Down syndrome and International Crime.) So the issues and consequences run deep. If the upcoming court case is successful, it will have wide-ranging implications, but it looks unlikely to succeed. At the very least, it will be another opportunity for our courts to confront these issues, and what an unjust government support system forces parents to argue in their efforts to get their children the care they need. *** \n ACC Claim Mother: I Would Have Aborted  (NZ Herald, Feb 27, 2013.) \n Mum will struggle to win ACC case \u2013 lawyer  (Yahoo NZ news, Feb 27, 2013.) \n High Court Decision (click on PDF link  that comes up second on this search ) (March 2, 2011.) \n Accidental Baby  (MacDoctor Sciblogs Post from Nov 2009, in response to the District Court case.) \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/jsmoorman/2298671281/", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10868036", "http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/top-stories/16250337/mum-will-struggle-to-win-acc-case-lawyer/", "https://www.google.co.nz/#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=CIV+2010-404-6195&oq=CIV+2010-404-6195&gs_l=hp.12...1509373.1509373.2.1510463.1.1.0.0.0.0.250.250.2-1.1.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.2.4.psy-ab.kq_5-5NCu9o&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.42965579,d.cGE&fp=3973871f647da056&biw=1280&bih=866", "http://sciblogs.co.nz/macdoctor/2009/11/10/accidental-baby/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/wrongful-life/", "title": "Wrongful Life?"},

The doctor has prescribed him antibiotics and a regime of soaking the skin with a warm flannel.

He sees me having to wear glasses everyday and thinks that must be annoying or hard, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so bad because I have got used to it and have adjusted my life to make it work. I don\u2019t see myself as deserving of pity, and I don\u2019t feel some pressing need to go and get contacts or eye surgery so I can look like and be like everyone else, even though it would make everyday life a lot easier. His pity was misplaced, I thought, I wanted him to know that I didn\u2019t need pity but to thank him for his concern anyway; I always encourage his sympathy and empathy and ability to consider others\u2019 experiences and point of view. Alongside all that sweep of emotions and thoughts, there sat a sort of uncomfortable self-righteousness too, that I was utterly surprised to feel in myself: A sense that his pity for my near-sightedness was some sort of claim about how I should be ashamed or feel inferior or wrong, because of how I was different from him; because of how he had something I didn\u2019t that I should want. And then, like some cruel self-inflicted twist, I actually did start to feel sorry for myself, because my eye-sight is less than perfect. And a heightened awareness over the past 24 hours, of everyone else who does and doesn\u2019t have glasses, like it\u2019s the great definer of humanity around me for a while.

I\u2019m reminded of when our previous car was stolen, with the baby seat in the backseat (never saw that car again). And the other time our car was stolen and taken for a joy-ride, leaving us to explain the speeding ticket they got on that joy-ride. So I\u2019m thinking, you know, broken window and missing GPS, is bad but it could have been worse. The day was bad before I\u2019d opened my eyes anyway since I\u2019ve got a cold. But I never just have a cold; my body always turns it into asthma that leaves me semi-attached to my inhaler as I otherwise struggle to breathe. But you know what my body used to do (well you don\u2019t so I\u2019ll tell you), it used to turn every cold into full-blown bronchitis. So yeah, I can handle a little asthma (and the headache, and nausea). I tried to explain to my son that a bad man \u2013 known as a criminal \u2013 had done the damage to the car. He thought about that for a while and told me that he was going to grow up and always be good, in his own words, \u201cI\u2019m just a good person.\u201d His use of the word \u201cjust\u201d there is as in \u201conly\u201d; ie he is not now and will not grow up to be, a bad person. I know he doesn\u2019t talk like other children, and every communication is a struggle, but I love the way he expresses himself and I\u2019m just so happy he is able to talk at all. I was watching videos of him last night. There was one where he was about three years old, and I was trying over and over to get him to say \u201chello\u201d; one simple word. After a while he looks at the camera and says \u201cone, two\u201d, and I tell him well done for saying \u201cone, two\u201d and he smiles. I take my smiles where I can get them.

{"date": "June 23, 2011", "body": "\n Image by mattbeckwith via Flickr \n I just read a post under the irritating title of \u201c Why we\u2019re all on the Autism Spectrum .\u201d I went in expecting something a lot worse than what I found: I thought I was going to encounter someone trying to claim we\u2019re all actually on the autism spectrum to some extent. The post came close to such a claim, but just managed to swerve away from such an extreme view, by rewriting the spectrum to apply to all of humanity \u2013 that all people are on a spectrum just like other spectrums (their example being sexuality). In making the claim in this manner, the poster makes a break from the actual meaning of the autism spectrum, allowing her to then make the otherwise factually incorrect claim that we\u2019re all really on the spectrum. But that subtle shift, and the title of the post, are still going to mislead and confuse a lot of people. (Indeed, it wasn\u2019t clear that the author understood the subtle but important shift she made.) The reason this confusion, and the claim we\u2019re all on the spectrum, matters, is because of the existing immense confusions and misinformation that abounds about autism. There are still many people who claim autism is just made up; that it\u2019s just extreme naughtiness or extreme personalities, and nothing special or noteworthy. Basically that parents need to be stricter and adults need to learn to control themselves, and both groups of people need to stop looking to blame their problems and shortfalls on some mythical disorder. You find the same rhetoric about ODD and ADHD. This thinking shifts autism away from being an identifiable disorder, and places it instead on the completely \u201cnormal\u201d continuum of humanity: \u201cNothing wrong here, just a bunch of misfits disowning their own decisions and not facing up to their problems.\u201d The vast majority of the public does not understand what is meant by the autism spectrum. They usually know of autism, and Aspergers, and that\u2019s it. Many do not realise that Aspergers is considered to be part of the autism spectrum (I certainly didn\u2019t three years ago). They\u2019ve never heard of PDD-NOS or Retts or CDD. Educating the public about the existence and meaning of the autism spectrum is quite a challenge. There are clinical facts involved here: Some conditions are part of the autism spectrum, some are not. Some people are on the autism spectrum, some are not. If we rewrite \u201cautism spectrum\u201d so that it no longer matches or reflects the clinical definitions, we create further confusions and doubts about its very existence. The arguments that the spectrum isn\u2019t accurate enough or needs rewriting, needs to be had openly and clearly; in the way that is currently happening surrounding the DSM-5. There is nothing wrong with that discussion, and indeed in order to even have that discussion, we must first acknowledge and use the  existing  definitions (else what would you be arguing to change). I do appreciate what people are trying to achieve when they rewrite and loosen the edges of the spectrum; they\u2019re trying to let everyone know that autism isn\u2019t so scary, they\u2019re just like everyone else. They\u2019re often trying to get people to think of autism as less like a disability, and more like difference. Perhaps also trying to grow the community and sense of inclusion. Increase acceptance. Even simply trying to raise awareness (though rewriting what one should be \u201caware of\u201d in the process). I don\u2019t want to paint an overly negative picture of the people \u2013 like that well-meaning and clearly quite lovely poster \u2013 who genuinely think they\u2019re doing the right thing for the future of autistic people. I know they\u2019re not evil (though I also know of some people who would consider what was written, to be evil because of its efforts to change attitudes towards autism). I just think it\u2019s incredibly important to not add further confusion to a condition that so many people already misunderstand and even deny. I think there is much more harm than good done, in the suggestion that autism is something we all have to differing extents. We are only all on the autism spectrum, if you completely redefine what is meant by the autism spectrum. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/90058596@N00/4485330575", "http://www.blogher.com/why-were-all-autism-spectrum?page=full"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/why-were-not-all-on-the-autism-spectum/", "title": "Why we\u2019re not all on the autism\u00a0spectum"},
{"date": "March 5, 2013", "body": "My son said something about autism, that shocked and frightened me. After it was said and the incident was dealt with, I tried to decide if it was the sort of thing I could or should share on my blog, knowing full well that it could be twisted and taken the wrong way. Two weeks later, I have decided I\u2019ll share this. I can only ask that you read carefully; there are no demons here, just an innocent seven-year-old boy who thought he found a cure. By Madison Guy After school one day, my son\u2019s teacher gave me a DVD about autism. She said they were going to show all the students the DVD to teach them a little about autism, since the school had a fair few autistic children and they thought this DVD represented a gentle and appropriate way to explain autistic difference. She let me borrow the DVD over a weekend, so that I knew what the children \u2013 including my own son \u2013 were going to watch, and to make sure I felt comfortable with it, considering it was relevant to my own son\u2019s school experience. The DVD was alright. It was pitched at about the right level, and it focused on autism as difference rather than as deficit, whilst also highlighting the particular and various challenges autistic children face everyday. There was a sort of FAQ section at the end, where a scripted student asked the presenter common questions about autism and the bubbly presenter answers the questions. One of the questions was why don\u2019t autistic children just get cured, and the presenter replies that there is no cure, then they go to the next question. My son made me show him the DVD twice. He wanted to know what \u201cASD\u201d was, I explained it was another word for autism, which  is a term he is familiar with already in relation to himself . He is quite settled with the fact he has autism, as far as he understands autism; he sees it as making some things harder, and some things easier, and if anything, is quite proud of this special difference. And I\u2019m settled with him seeing it in that way. He tried to tell me he wasn\u2019t like the children they were showing on DVD in certain parts, and I said that was right, because there are different types of autism and for some people it affects them more than others, and affects people in different ways. He listened, he learnt, he seemed OK with it all. I return the DVD to the teacher on a Monday, with my blessing that it seems fine, and with my thanks that they let me share it with my son first so he was aware of what he was going to see at school with his class mates. Later that week the classes were shown the DVD. Although my son had already seen it twice, there was something he wanted to discuss with me about it. First, you need to understand that my son is interested in death in an abstract and highly inquisitive way. This is something  I\u2019ve written about before;  if you haven\u2019t read that previous post, I would encourage you to do so to appreciate the type of interest my son has in death. It is not a morbid interest, nor a \u201cpersonalised\u201d interest; he doesn\u2019t want to be dead, quite the opposite, he has told us multiple times that he wants to live as long as possible and he is very keen to make the right decisions to that end. He\u2019s decided he will never smoke, he will drive carefully, he will eat and drink the right things, he will stay healthy and take care of his eyes and ears and every other part of himself, inside and out. If anything, his interest in death stems from his love of being alive. Keep that in mind. My son\u2019s question raised by watching the DVD was about cure. He says to me, autism has no cure. I say, that\u2019s right. He says, there is a cure. I didn\u2019t know where it was going. And then he said it. He said death was a cure. I missed a beat, I think my mouth actually dropped open. I studied his face for any sign of fear or panic or realisation of what he\u2019d just said, but he was just my smiley thoughtful boy, sharing something he\u2019d figured out by himself. I gathered myself quickly enough to reply that that\u2019s not a cure, because a cure takes something away but leaves the person alive. He did listen to my answer and think about it, but he almost looked cheated by my reply, like he was proud that he\u2019d figured this cure/death thing out, and I was just twisting things around. I told my husband what our son had just said while my son quietly mulled that over, and my husband piped up with the same response I\u2019d had: Death is not cure. My son thought about it awhile more before going back to playing on the couch. My husband quietly assured me that what my son had just said didn\u2019t hold the deeper horror for him, as it did for us as parents; at its core, that our son was not at all thinking about death as a cure for  his  autism per se, he was just thinking out loud about what he\u2019d heard on the DVD. My son knows he has autism. He now knows autism can\u2019t be cured. He thought that meant the only \u201ccure\u201d would be death. But he either didn\u2019t think to the next step of linking his  own  autism with the cure of death, or \u2013 and I think this is the real key \u2013 he doesn\u2019t see autism as some devastating horrendous condition that he should be trying to remove from himself. And I thought to myself at that moment, that I would never let him see it that way. I could never let him feel that something he can\u2019t get rid of, is something that must be fixed, and that only death can fix. Whatever the rest of the world might feel, whatever I have felt and do feel, I can\u2019t allow him to see autism in such a light. The academic part of me wants him to never ever think of autism as central to his identity or as some enormous part of who he is at his core, for just this sort of reason: I don\u2019t want him to give a label that type of power over him. I don\u2019t want others\u2019 opinions of what autism is or is not, to ever have the power to shape how he sees his unique self. I want him to focus on the decisions he makes in his life, as defining who he really is, not to think that he is predetermined or determined by what someone wrote in a Manual that changes every decade or so. He is more than autism; this is not a denial of autism, or of the nature of autism, it\u2019s just an important fact about my son. Just like I am more than female, more than European, more than anything I was born into, though they are part of a more complex and rich whole. And yet. The mother in me knows my son isn\u2019t going to get those refined distinctions, for many years. And he may  choose  to see autism as some hugely defining part of who he is, and I accept that too; we define ourselves, he is the one living with autism, if he comes to see it as central then that\u2019s his personal truth. So in those intervening years, and in the face of him perhaps choosing one day to see it as defining him, I must work to make sure that  he  sees autism in mostly a positive light. I know I can show him the harsher realities of autism whilst maintaining the overall positivity of it, because that\u2019s where he currently is in his understanding of how autism affects him; it\u2019s a matter of maintaining and supporting that view. Not only would doing so protect him from such horrendous thoughts as death as cure, but it can also more generally help \u2013 I hope \u2013 to protect him from depression and fatalism and giving-in (the same things I wish to protect him from by hoping he will not come to see autism as central to his being). How I personally see and experience his autism, is of secondary importance here. Everything I learn about autism is aimed at his own good. My interest in autism at all, is solely because of him.  He  brings me to autism. How I see autism is hugely affected by how severely and horribly it impacted on his early years,  I can\u2019t (and won\u2019t) forget that horror . No metaphor gives it justice, but living through it I felt like my son and I were trapped in a black hole with slippery edges, and nothing either of us did to get free of it ever got traction. It was pointless agony,  until it wasn\u2019t . I\u2019m not going to deny that, anymore than I\u2019ll deny the pain of childbirth or the joy of breathing in the scents of my baby boys while they fed. These things are my story too, my reality, the life I lived. Sharing my pain and challenges and triumphs around autism have made me feel a lot better and more positive about my son\u2019s autism; I feel stronger and supported and understood when people read what I write and share that they relate. I think some people read the negative things parents say about living with autism and condemn the parents for saying these cruel truths out loud. But if we don\u2019t say them, they\u2019re still true anyway, and many people like me feel enabled and empowered when we can share. It\u2019s not about being cruel or self-centred, it\u2019s about being human and being heard, and all the positives that come from feeling not so alone anymore; positives that can (and do, for me anyway) flow onto the child. So how do I reconcile all this with the need that my son see autism as predominantly a positive thing, when that doesn\u2019t match my experiences so far? How do I protect him from my truth? I think I can only do what all parents must do, I tell him what a boy his age needs to know about the world and about himself. I don\u2019t bury him in adult and parental burdens, he\u2019s not ready, and when he is ready for deeper discussions on the nature of all types of autism, then he\u2019ll be able to handle this. When I became an adult I learnt a lot of things about both my parents that I didn\u2019t previously understand or appreciate, and about the horrors and beauties of life too; being able to deal with truth (and truths) is something an adult can handle better than any seven-year-old. I won\u2019t lie to my son, but I will find the good and safe side to every bad thing he must learn about, and keep that beautiful mind of his open and hopeful. He doesn\u2019t need to know how hard it was to raise him, yet, and maybe ever. And when he does find out, he will already know that other truth: That I have always loved and wanted him. Always. That I loved him and love him and will love him, until my own death. For if death is the cure of autism, then death is the cure of love too. Nothing will take away his autism. Nothing will take away my love. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/madison_guy/1199407719/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/death-cure/", "title": "Death-Cure."},
{"date": "March 31, 2013", "body": "Every one of us has a version of the ideal world, and a corresponding appreciation of the many ways in which it doesn\u2019t measure up to reality. We fight to change the world to better match our ideal version \u2013 we protest, propose law changes, change minds and walk the walk \u2013 but so do the people who have opposing versions of the ideal world. Politics is a version of these competing ideals at war. Politics are at play in the autism world too; we also carry around conflicting ideals and fight tooth and nail to make the world better match those ideals. From FlyingSinger on Flickr Around Autism Awareness Month each year (April), the details of these ideals often get shoved aside so we can try to put on a united front to make a better world for autistic people. But take a look around, does everyone embrace the puzzle piece, the \u201cLight it up Blue campaign,\u201d the message that autism is a growing tragedy or something beautiful and wonderful? No; I see just as much \u2013 if not more \u2013 division during Autism Awareness Month as at any other time of the year in the autism community. (And I\u2019m OK with that diversity, I think it\u2019s healthy and honest.) But here\u2019s the thing then: You can\u2019t embrace some ideal version of what you want the world to be like for autistic people, and then simply raise your child to fit into that ideal, because there are no promises your version of the ideal world is the one that\u2019s going to win out, or that it will win out in the next year or decade or century. For me at least, I\u2019m not going to sacrifice my son\u2019s future to the unknown; I\u2019m going to help him to make his way in the world as it currently exists, whilst continuing the fight to make it my version of \u201csomething better.\u201d The world as it currently exists has social expectations in a variety of situations, and not meeting those expectations has a variety of consequences. Whether you want to find friendship, or love, or get a job, your chances of success \u2013 and your options to choose your own version of success and happiness \u2013 are much higher when you can figure out what is expected of you and are at least able to choose to meet those expectations. This isn\u2019t about \u201cconformity,\u201d it\u2019s about choice and freedom and removing limitations. If someone chooses to behave a certain way and say certain words, that is one thing, but if no one ever gave them the choice because no one  taught  them the rules or the expected behaviours, that is something entirely different. (I\u2019m currently reading a book written by two successful autistic adults, which has made me better realise this truth; I\u2019ll be reviewing the book in a future post, suffice to say for now that it\u2019s strengthened my views about what I am obligated to teach my child in terms of social rules and expectations.) As a parent of an autistic child, you\u2019re supposedly not meant to help your child \u201cconform\u201d or \u201cfit in.\u201d If you talk about such aspirations out loud, you are painting a target on your back. People turn your words and hopes against you, and insist what you\u2019re trying to do is hurt or abuse or change your child in some fundamental sense. Well I call bull on that, because of choice: Because I am granting my child the ability to define himself and  choose  his own behaviours. I am opening doors for him; he gets to  choose  which one to go through. I am not fighting who he is, anymore than forced to do maths and sports and art at school was fighting who I was. Our job as parents, as teachers, is to prepare children \u2013 whatever their neurology \u2013 for the world that actually exists, not just the one we wish existed. Our choices are hard sometimes; such as when to try to change or modify a socially inappropriate stim, that might be isolating the child or targeting them for bullies, but nevertheless serves some meaningful function for the child. But those are still choices we have to make; we weigh-up the options and decide what is in the best interests for that child in  that culture , in  that country , at  that time . We can\u2019t make these decisions in isolation of reality (or rather, we can, but it\u2019s unlikely then to be genuinely in the child\u2019s best future interests). So no, I\u2019m not waiting on the world to change. I look around me and I see what skills and knowledge my son needs to do well in life, and I am giving them to him, in the most loving and compassionate ways that I can. I never stop learning about him, or his autism, or autism more generally, but I also never lose sight of the fact that it is my responsibility to prepare him for reality. I\u2019ll keep fighting to raise awareness, and acceptance, and to make the world an easier place for him to be; there\u2019s no dichotomy there: it\u2019s all just part of helping him towards happiness and success. And if my son\u2019s happiness and competence is anything to go by, I must be doing something right. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/flyingsinger/86898564/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/waiting-on-the-world-to-change/", "title": "Waiting on the world to\u00a0change?"},

{"date": "June 26, 2011", "body": "\n Cover via Amazon \n \u201cUnstrange Minds\u201d is an anthropological approach to the questions of autism: Where did autism come from; who came up with the term and under what historical and cultural influences? How do different countries recognise and treat autism, and why do their approaches differ? As Roy Richard Grinker attempts (and succeeds I would say) to answer these questions, he also weaves in personal stories of autism; from his own family life and from other families across the globe. The first half of the book focuses particularly on the emergence of autism as a condition, and the question of whether there is currently an emerging \u201cepidemic\u201d of autism. (The book is published in 2007, but the answers he provides about the emergence and growth remain as true today). He investigates evidence of autism before it was known as autism, and shows how even today its existence in various countries continues to be often unacknowledged and misunderstood, and the consequences of how different societies approach the diagnosis and existence of autism. At times I found the descriptions of how my son would have been treated in times gone past, so disturbing that I had to look away from the book and take deep breaths. It has the same emotional impact when I read of how mothers have been held responsible for their children\u2019s autism; speaking aloud all those early doubts and concerns a mother has even today when receiving such a diagnosis for their child. Grinker doesn\u2019t just share these things for shock value though (and there is definitely shock value through-out the book); he carefully explains how those theories and resulting treatments came about. The second part of the book moves away from the initial questions of origins and epidemic of autism, and shifts more towards stories of different experiences, using in-depth examples from the United States, India, South Korea, and elsewhere. I didn\u2019t find the second half as engaging or informative as the first half (where Grinker had already introduced examples of how other countries respond to autism), but it is the second half which will perform an important and vital function for the parents reading the book who might be looking for hope and guidance for their own autistic child. This is an important book particularly for people who struggle to comprehend or appreciate the fluidity of diagnostic terms, which is particularly relevant and topical with the DSM-5 diagnostic changes looming. It is also an excellent resource for people trying to understand the changes and growth in autism numbers. I thought I already had a reasonably good grasp of these issues, but this book took my understanding to a new level. A valuable book in many regards. *** Link to the Unstrange Minds website . \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Unstrange-Minds-Remapping-World-Autism/dp/0465027644%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0465027644", "http://www.unstrange.com/index.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/review-of-roy-richard-grinkers-unstrange-minds-remapping-the-world-of-autism/", "title": "Review of Roy Richard Grinker\u2019s \u201cUnstrange Minds: Remapping the World of\u00a0Autism\u201d"},

{"date": "June 29, 2011", "body": "\n Image by DJMcCrady via Flickr \n My son\u2019s language acquisition has been very slow and abnormal (or normal for an autistic child). Though he has remarkably and impressively improved over the past two years (and the last year in particular), his sentences continue to be rehashes of previously heard sentence structures and phrases. In a beautiful and noteworthy advancement, he now regularly uses those pre-learnt structures in attempts to express his  own  ideas; but it doesn\u2019t come easy: You can literally watch him struggling to piece together what he wants to say using turns of phrase that he has already encountered. He looks to the side and his eyebrows bunch together and his words trip over each other repeatedly while he tries to pull it together. I\u2019ve learnt to sit very still and make my body language convey patience and interest while he does this; if I try to help him along or show distraction, he tends to lose his train of thought. Eventually he spews forth a long garbled sentence and looks at me hopefully; I\u2019ll then try to figure out what he\u2019s trying to say and help him tidy it up. That process goes back and forth between us until we reach an understanding. An unfortunate outcome of this effort at communication is the inevitable corruption of his original idea; because as I try to repeat back to him what I thought he was trying to say, I literally see him working my replies into his understanding. His emotions are laid bare on his face; I\u2019ve had to learn to recognise slight nuances so I can often see when he\u2019s trying to work it out and when he\u2019s simply co-opted what I\u2019ve said. So many times I\u2019ve wanted to hear his thoughts pure, untouched and un-reworded by my efforts to understand. A current topic he talks and muses about a lot, is time, and more specifically, death. Its discussion is a natural outcome of his current fascination (obsession) with all things time related, which started with a love of clocks, then a love of days of the week, then months of the year, and of course the length of a life. We\u2019ve had to come up with answers to his questions that he can understand given his current level of language comprehension. If we aim the ideas too high and abstract, he gets confused and will keep pushing us to supply an answer he can understand, so we end up simplifying complicated truths to fit his current schema and language (as indeed you would for any child, but there are differences which I\u2019ll discuss shortly). The alternative to his confusion and insistence for clarity, is he\u2019ll just lose interest altogether in the subject and the enquiry, which I don\u2019t want. The answers I supply my son are not the same as I would supply to another child. I might have to simplify the ideas for any child, but I leave in the uncertainties and unknowns and the child would be OK with a bit of fuzzy edges and maybes. But my son needs absolutes, clear-cut principles that universally apply, with few if any maybes; unfortunately, the world is rarely if ever like that. I do my best though, and so it is that my son needed an age at which everyone is dead; we chose 120. He needed a precise age at which he will be a man (18 works), and wants an age at which he will stop growing (I think we chose 20 for that). When he originally started discussing death, and began to understand it as a sort of forever-sleep, he tried to tell / ask me that after someone dies they (in his words) \u201cstart again.\u201d This morning he was singing the song \u201c My Grandfather\u2019s Clock \u201c, about a man who dies at the same time as his clock stops. He was having trouble separating correlation from causation; we had to explain the clock stopping didn\u2019t cause the man\u2019s death. He thought about this, then said that only men die, not boys; and tried to conclude that this meant if he didn\u2019t become a man he wouldn\u2019t die. I (sadly) corrected him that some boys do die, such as when they get hurt very badly. He thought about that for a while and tried to ask me whether slamming his finger in the sliding door would mean he died. I told him no, it would have to be worse than that. Again, his eyes to the side, his eyebrows bunched, as he processes that and formulates the next response / question. It makes for an interesting reflection on the importance of words to the ideas we form and share. With language, he proposes these ideas to me and requests my feedback for agreement or approval. The way his idea is formulated is already limited by his known words and phrases, immensely more-so because of the challenges autism provides for his communication. Then my replies (my words) shape (and probably distort) his original understanding. Words shape and changes ideas that affect the way we interact with and comprehend our world. Communication makes it easier to both measure and access someone\u2019s intelligence, and for that intelligence to be shared in ways that can change the world (this makes it easy to understand why autistic people\u2019s intelligence is so often dismissed and missed). There is an extra dimension though to communication when it can be spoken: It is raw, there is no delete button, no visual spelling or grammar that can completely confuse or change the message. It is immediate and intimate. The conversations I have with my son would be different ones if they had to be written down or represented in pictures. There would be that extra layer \u2013 the computer or other technology \u2013 forming one more barrier through which his meaning must be sieved before I can access it. So I am glad he talks, and not just communicates with pictures or the written word. I want him to use all forms of communication \u2013 art, writing etc \u2013 but in  addition to  and not  instead of  the spoken word. I look forward to the day that the only limit on the immediate uncensored sharing of his ideas with me, is his existing vocabulary, and not bound by pre-learnt sentence structures clumsily adapted to his needs. I accept too that this might never happen, but I have learnt not to let that acceptance ever get in the way of him. He keeps breaking free of his seeming limitations and surpassing expectations. He has his own ideas, his own mind, and I will never take for granted that he has found a way to speak it. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/56584747@N00/18954868", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3tlIMJ9bK0"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/speaking-his-own-ideas-his-own-mind-language-autism-and-discussions-of-death/", "title": "Speaking his own ideas, his own mind: Language, autism, and discussions of\u00a0death"},
{"date": "August 17, 2012", "body": "You\u2019re no doubt familiar with the saying \u201cif you\u2019ve met one autistic person, then you\u2019ve met one autistic person.\u201d It should be obvious that the same truth stands for a parent of an autistic child. There have been damaging and dangerous stereotypes of autism parents in the past, the prime example being  Bettelheim\u2019s one of the refrigerator mother . Bettleheim was wrong \u2013 both about autism and about autism parents. The same of another stereotype; that all autism parents simply don\u2019t discipline their children, and that\u2019s where autistic behavioural problems come from. It\u2019s another erroneous theory, that similarly misunderstands the very nature of autism. Yet in the effort to fight back against these unhelpfully misinformed views, all too often we just set up yet another stereotype group to which we\u2019re meant to belong, and then get trapped by it. Allow me to explain. A simple example of trying to save ourselves from negative perceptions, whilst creating a further stereotype, is someone who is a hero to some and a villain to others: Jenny McCarthy.  One of her claims about autism parents, forces us into two camps : Those mother warriors who fight to cure autism, and those who revel in the victim role. Of course, she and everyone who agrees with her get to be the heroes. This is an obvious example of creating new stereotypes about us that are meant to help and empower, but only further distort the truth. But there are far more subtle and common stereotypes that I have in mind, which create a trap for us. Those are the ones that proudly announce that the autism parent is a tireless (yet oddly exhausted) under-supported individual, who spends every waking moment sacrificing themselves to their child\u2019s needs and advancing their child\u2019s development. A truth for some, yes. (A truth for me for a good many years, yes.) A truth for all..? No, of course not. Similarly the idea that all autism parents are amazingly strong people who can and do face up to every challenge thrown their way; that they have some extraordinary strength (sometimes expressed in this way: \u201cGod knew you were strong enough for this challenge,\u201d or / and \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done what you do everyday!\u201d) These and other stereotypes of who we are and what we are capable of, are traps. Traps, because if someone who doesn\u2019t fit the mold is found, it makes people question if the stereotype was ever correct, and they find themselves seeking a new all-explaining stereotype based on the new example of autism parent they have encountered: \u201cOh I met a mother of an autistic child, who wasn\u2019t trying at all, she wasn\u2019t using any discipline and was happy to keep her child in nappies, makes you wonder if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with the other autism families too..\u201d More-over, the stereotypes are traps because it can be used as a way to critique us for ever stepping outside of the created role. Just yesterday I was reading a comment from a parent attacking other parents because they were spending \u201ctoo much time\u201d enjoying themselves online; they took this as evidence that the parent either didn\u2019t have a genuinely autistic child, or that they didn\u2019t care about their child. This sort of attack is based on the stereotype that genuine autism parents are those tireless sacrificing creatures, and that if we step out of that role we are either frauds or failures. Another way in which the seemingly good stereotype of the autism parent, creates immense problems, is when we \u2013 as a group \u2013 get attacked for trying too hard to \u201cchange\u201d our children; that we must all be endlessly working at squashing our autistic children\u2019s stims and at trying to make them normal, because that is the stereotypical image of the hard-working autistic parent. (I\u2019ve recently encountered certain people attacking autism parents as an entire group, for just that.) So that the parents are yet again \u2013 just like in Bettelheim\u2019s day \u2013 cast as a group from which autistic children must be liberated. (Only this time the liberation is so the children can be their genuine autistic selves, rather than so the children can be \u201creturned to their normal human state.\u201d) Here\u2019s the truth of the matter: What we have in common is having an autistic child. That\u2019s it. Yes that means some of our experiences are going to be the same, that we\u2019ll be hyper-aware of certain challenges and attitudes within society; but even then it doesn\u2019t tell you what we\u2019re going to think or do about those challenges and attitudes. Some of us are lousy at discipline, some of us are strict authoritarians. Some are cold and distant, some are warm and eternally loving. To push it to its limits, yes some autism parents kill their child, but you know what, the rest of us don\u2019t and would never even contemplate such a thing. All these variations are true of normal parents too. We don\u2019t lose our personalities and ideals \u2013 and morph to some stereotype \u2013 just by virtue of having an autistic child. (I\u2019ve had more than one person assume that I would change my political beliefs when I became a parent, and predicted I would change them again when my child was diagnosed as autistic. Didn\u2019t happen either time.) Claiming that we morph in this way, just creates distorting stereotypes, that no matter how well-intentioned, always ends up making us targets in new ways. The child with autism has, by definition, particular challenges. But the precise nature and intensity of those challenges vary so greatly, that on those grounds alone, it should be obvious there are no immediate truths about how their parents will react and be shaped by the process of parenting. (It also doesn\u2019t necessarily help to point out that autism parents frequently carry a few autistic traits themselves, since again this is not always the case. In the situations where it is the case, it should not be \u2013 but often is \u2013 used to explain away certain reactions or perceptions, even when there\u2019s a substantive argument being presented: Stereotypes are often used to ignore or belittle points of views and to avoid addressing actual arguments.) There are lots of interesting observations we can make about the majority of autism parents (about our education levels or whatever you like); such information can be used to tailor services or to even aid research into autism itself. But when those observations morph into stereotypes expressly used to either praise or attack us as an entire group \u2013 which I see happening far too often \u2013 it marginalises those who don\u2019t \u201cbelong,\u201d it sets up the traps I attempted to explain above, and it of course distorts the reality that if you\u2019ve met one autism parent, you\u2019ve met  one autism parent . \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/metabolico/536081022/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/the-trap-of-the-stereotyped-autism-parent/", "title": "The Trap of the Stereotyped Autism\u00a0Parent"},
{"date": "August 19, 2012", "body": "I don\u2019t like team sports; I tend to freeze whenever it\u2019s my turn to act and I also feel like I\u2019m going to be responsible for the team\u2019s loss. Eventually I just accepted my uselessness in such activities and chose to avoid them altogether. I consciously try to not let my own preferences (and fears) pre-judge what my children can try out and enjoy. But I just couldn\u2019t see what joining a children\u2019s soccer (football) club could offer my autistic son either: He has co-ordination problems, he runs awkwardly (he has orthotics), he struggles with social situations, and verbal instructions can easily confuse and stress him. He\u2019d stand out in a crowd and be an easy target for any group bullying. Sessions were organised by age group, and his abilities and development have never quite matched his age number. Still, I\u2019d been offered a free trial at a children\u2019s soccer group, and I\u2019d be there to watch him the whole time, so I put aside my nagging doubts and decided to take him along. My son wasn\u2019t the only person who learnt a thing or two that day. I\u2019d told the coaches in advance that my son was autistic. This didn\u2019t scare them at all. (There are many other children\u2019s activity groups I\u2019d tried to enrol my son in in the past, who had either overtly or more subtly told me not to bring my son along because of his autism, so their open-ness to having him along, was both surprising and refreshing.) They told me he wouldn\u2019t be pushed to do anything he didn\u2019t want to; that their philosophy was \u201cplay, not push.\u201d (Perhaps a purposeful juxtaposition to a very public national campaign by the Government a while back, called \u201c Push Play .\u201d) It turns out that wasn\u2019t a problem anyway: My son actively and passionately took part in every activity the coaches took the kids through. The group was only about eight kids, which meant the two coaches were able to make sure every kid got a turn, including of course my son. Some of the activities were individual skills working alongside other kids, some were group games, none of it phased my son or sent him to me in tears. There was no bullying or targeting of weak kids, just inclusion and taking turns and encouragement. I was almost in tears with happiness at the end of the first session, and my cheeks were sore from smiling so much. When my son had first seen everyone else in uniforms at the start of the session, he made me assure him that he didn\u2019t have to wear a uniform too. By the end, he was actively asking me if he could wear the uniform next time. That symbolises so much for me; that he felt like he belonged, and wanted to belong. That he wanted to do it all again. There is another important aspect of taking part in the soccer club, that goes beyond the skills he learns and the sense of belonging, which any average kid can get (as valuable as those things are). For my son, he also gets the experience of being around children who have typical functioning, speech and developmental levels, since it is not an activity aimed principally at children with special needs (though it does welcome them). He\u2019s around high needs children every single school day, and though he learns tremendous amounts from his highly skilled and dedicated specialist teaching team, there are certain aspects of social and language interactions that are best learnt from peers (and often more enjoyably learnt from peers). Being part of this group each weekend gives him that opportunity. At the most recent session my son went to, I got to see how the coaches dealt with challenging behaviour, but the behaviour wasn\u2019t from my son, it was from another little boy, who got upset and ran to his mum for comfort. The coaches didn\u2019t make a big deal about it, they didn\u2019t embaress or exclude the boy as would have been so easy to do. They seamlessly re-engaged him in the game they were playing at the time, encouraging and welcoming him back in to the group as if he\u2019d perhaps just gone to get a drink or say hello to mum rather than gone crying to her. Within moments, the boy was happy and joining in again, and enjoyed the rest of the session. I don\u2019t know what sort of training is done with these coaches, but clearly they\u2019re doing something right. (We\u2019ve applied for special needs carer support Trust funding to pay for my son\u2019s sessions at the soccer club (which we paid ourselves already, we\u2019re looking for reimbursement); whether it will get approved or not is anyone\u2019s guess,  the Trust\u2019s forms are notoriously hard to understand and fill out . If his special funding is approved I\u2019ll add it in via an edit later, because I know people are always on the look out for appropriate and good ways to spend the allocated funding. Even if it doesn\u2019t get approved, we\u2019ve got our money\u2019s worth.) I\u2019m not saying a kids\u2019 soccer group is going to work for every autistic or special needs child, that\u2019s clearly false. Just like horse-riding and trampolining and art is perfect for some of our kids, and painfully useless for others. But I am glad I kept an open-enough mind to let my son have a go, and to prove my concerns and anxieties to be misplaced: Sometimes it\u2019s awesome to be wrong. For those who want to perhaps see if it would suit their child, and want to know the name of this group that I am so impressed with, they\u2019re called \u201c Little Kickers .\u201d The group we attended was here in New Zealand of course, but they operate in other countries too. If you\u2019re worried about the fact that the sessions are split by age, or have other concerns, the people we dealt with at least were very accommodating and reassuring, even allowing my son to attend a younger age group if it turned out that\u2019s where he was best suited. As it turned out his own age group was fine, and that seems to be partly a result of their willingness to accommodate a range of abilities rather than fixating on age as being determinate of what a child can and must do. What my son gets from this soccer group is more than increased co-ordination, strength and balance (all of which are already showing in him). The \u201cgoal\u201d is not just to get the soccer ball in a net on one side of the room. That is incidental. And that was what I had to learn too: Look past the obvious end point, enjoy the journey and the surprising lessons along the way. Take your eye off the goal for a bit, and you might be surprised at what you find. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/stawarz/4294185266/", "http://www.sportnz.org.nz/en-nz/communities-and-clubs/Push-Play/", "http://www.littlekickers.co.nz/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/take-your-eye-off-the-goal-what-a-kids-soccer-club-taught-me-and-my-son/", "title": "Take your eye off the goal; what a kids\u2019 soccer club taught me and my\u00a0son."},
{"date": "August 28, 2012", "body": "My six-year-old autistic son learnt to engage in \u201cpretend play\u201d a lot later than most children. Over the last couple of years though, he has figured out that he can pretend something is there that isn\u2019t there ( an imaginary friend ), or that something is other than what it actually is ( a food bowl as a bike helmet ). Although he\u2019s figured out how to play pretend \u2013 and can clearly enjoy himself doing so \u2013 he\u2019s currently very much struggling with how others perceive and interpret his pretend play. A typical example: My son will announce to me that he is a puppy. He\u2019ll make his doggy noises or walk around like a dog. He\u2019ll involve me by directing his play at me. But if I call him a puppy, and maintain the pretend play he himself has initiated, he can get quite upset, almost distraught: \u201cI\u2019m not a puppy, I\u2019m just pretending. Be sensible!\u201d The complaint from him that he\u2019s not really what he\u2019s pretending to be, always starts off with a mostly calm insistence that he\u2019s pretending. If we ever pursue the pretend scenario or try to maintain the state of play, his anxiety levels increase and any fun he\u2019s having quickly dissipates. My husband and I thought it would be obvious that we know he\u2019s pretending; that my son\u2019s not really someone else, or a puppy, or whatever. Yet we\u2019re always met with that statement \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just pretending!\u201d \u2013 delivered in an anxious, frustrated, insistent tone. As if he really isn\u2019t sure that we know he\u2019s pretending, and as if our not knowing that he is pretending would have frightful outcomes. I know that the problems he faces in this area are going to be described by some as issues with \u201cempathy\u201d or more generally as problems with accessing others\u2019 mental states. Personally, I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it; I\u2019m still trying to get my head around why he struggles with it as much as he does. I know it\u2019s related to his autism, that much is clear. I\u2019ll raise the situation with his developmental pediatrician who we are due to see later this week. In the meantime, I\u2019m hopeful someone who reads this post might be able to give me some insight and perhaps suggest a way forward, so us joining in his pretend play is less upsetting and confusing for him. The best I can come up with at this point is to use signal words; verbally and clearly mark out for him that we acknowledge he is engaged in pretend play and we are now joining him in that form of play. I suppose an alternative is to simply not join him in his pretend play since it upsets him in this way, but the problem remains that he seems to need to learn something from these situations; something to do with how others perceive and recognise his pretense, and that it is not threatening but a form of play if we (or others) try to join him. If we as his parents can teach him this, we can hopefully avoid the situation arising in an upsetting way with his peers or other adults who aren\u2019t as aware of his upset and confusion. I hate seeing my son get upset over something that is meant to be fun, and I want him to see that we are interested and engaged and encouraging of his forms of play. How do I get him to understand that when I look at him pretending to be something else, I always still see my perfect son in front of me? Even as I write that sentence I realise that perhaps he is  overly  concerned about and involved in trying to access my mental state \u2013 just in the same way he tends to be  overly aware and involved in my emotions . Writing these things down helps to organise my thoughts, but I still can\u2019t see my way clear to why this is happening or what best to do about it. Have you been through something similar? What would you do? \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/im-just-pretending-the-unintended-threat-of-joining-my-son-in-pretend-play/", "title": "\u201cI\u2019m just pretending!\u201d The unintended threat of joining my son in pretend\u00a0play."},
{"date": "August 23, 2012", "body": "There is a new study out linking a father\u2019s age to risk of autism. The story has been reported in one of the most popular news sources in my country, The New Zealand Herald. They have presented the story under this charming heading: \u201c Are older dads genetically dooming their kids? \u201d In that story, the reporter independently refers to autism as a disease. Not once, not twice, but three times. I can almost forgive this error in classification, because the researchers themselves are quoted (in other news stories) as categorizing autism as a \u201cdisease.\u201d I\u2019ve now read numerous versions of the report from news sources around the world, and thankfully the vast majority of them call autism a disorder or a condition (though at least  one did decide autism was an \u201cillness,\u201d  which seems even more erroneous than calling it a \u201cdisease\u201d.) But \u201c dooming ?\u201d Really? It\u2019s necessary, in a major national newspaper, to use an emotive (and frankly, distorting) word like \u201cdooming,\u201d in reference to autism? Dooming: (1) To condemn to ruination or death. (2) To destine to an unhappy end. The use of words like \u201cdooming\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d as descriptors of autism, just reinforces for me that autism is still the over-simplified monster-under-the-bed for reporters and the public. To my mind, presenting autism is this sensationalist and inaccurate manner, is in the same category as those who present it as always some fluffy feel-good difference that comes inevitably hand-in-hand with a genius IQ and a talent for computers. The fact is that autism is complex and various. It is many things. The reality and experience of it varies greatly from individual to individual, and from family to family. But what it is not, is \u201cdisease\u201d or \u201cdoom.\u201d Thankfully, the New Zealand Herald was the only news source I could find (after extensive searching) which chose to use such an emotive headline. As for the story itself \u2013 the details of how strong the evidence and explanation is of a link between older dads and autism \u2013 I\u2019m going to wait until particular reputable science bloggers dig through the study\u2019s details and explain it; I learnt a while back that mass media is a very poor source of accurate science reporting. They\u2019d sooner run a scary headline and make claims of new definitive proofs, than explain and present scientific findings in the less sensationalist light of reality. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10828880", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/autism-risk-for-children-with-older-fathers-8073807.html", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/cesarmascarenhas/4289603230/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/autism-doom-and-disease/", "title": "Autism; \u201cDoom\u201d and \u201cDisease\u201d..?"},
{"date": "August 22, 2012", "body": "There\u2019s a new post up at \u201c The Tumultuous Truth ,\u201d questioning the accuracy and usefulness of the term \u201cneurotypical.\u201d (\u201c Neurotypical. Who Exactly? \u201c) It\u2019s a short post (just three paragraphs) but it packed a punch for me, since I\u2019ve been using the term \u201cneurotypical\u201d for years, without realising what I was doing. I was originally going to simply comment on her post, but I realised my response was a blog topic in itself. (This post will make sense without having read her post first, but I still encourage you to pop over and have a read of her original piece.) I first heard the term \u201cneurotypical\u201d from a fellow autism parent, at a playgroup for autistic preschoolers. I came to use the term in the same way she did; as a convenient short-hand way to delineate when I was talking about people who have autism, and when I was talking about those who don\u2019t. Later, I found that other bloggers freely used the term too, so by using it myself too I felt like I was \u201ctalking the talk;\u201d like I was using the correct lingo. I\u2019d go so far to say that using the term gave me a sense of \u201cbelonging\u201d to the community; \u201coutsiders\u201d were always unfamiliar with the word. For me, the term was comparative to the use of \u201cnon-Jewish\u201d from when I attended a Jewish primary school: We needed a simple way at the school to talk about who was Jewish and who wasn\u2019t, since it impacted on what classes you took and what religious events you had to attend. It wasn\u2019t a judgement of any sort, merely a useful descriptor of \u201cX\u201d versus \u201cnot X.\u201d So I\u2019d grown up from very young understanding the function of a term that isn\u2019t meant to tell you everything about a person, but is useful in context to quickly convey relevant information. But \u201cneurotypical\u201d is not the opposite of \u201cautistic;\u201d no matter how I and others use the term, it conveys more than some simple negation. The word \u201ctypical\u201d and the reference to the brain via \u201cneuro,\u201d is fundamentally another word for \u201cnormal.\u201d A kinder word, with less baggage one supposes, than saying person Z is \u201cnormal\u201d and person Y is \u201cautistic.\u201d However, the word itself, because it is not a simple negation of \u201cbeing autistic\u201d carries its own baggage, some intentionally added: I\u2019ve heard the word \u201cneurotypical\u201d being used pejoratively; to put-down those whose thinking and experiences are not autistic. To say that these people are less, are boring, are run-of-the-mill, and that their views carry less weight and importance because they can\u2019t escape their limited neurology. Moreover though \u2013 and more widely \u2013 the term is used to  replace  the word \u201cnormal.\u201d (A point made nicely in a comment on the original post, by Jon Brock from  Cracking the Enigma .) And a replacement of the word \u201cnormal\u201d is still going to carry with it the implications that autism is ab-normal (or a-typical, if you will). So, it\u2019s not clear it\u2019s escaping the negative association, anymore than replacing the word \u201cretarded\u201d with other words, is actually going to do much good unless you deal with the underlying misunderstandings and attitude issues. (I\u2019m strongly against  the use of the word \u201cretarded\u201d as an insult , but that is a different point than mere  replacement  of words.) As pointed out in the original post by The Tumultuous Truth, the idea that there is \u201cnormal\u201d and then there is \u201cautism,\u201d also over-simplifies the enormous diversity of the everyone else. It is one thing to say that person X doesn\u2019t have autism, it is completely another to say they are therefore \u201cneurotypical,\u201d or have typical neurology: Those two statements simply are not the same. As the writer also so rightly points out, the idea that you can group all autistic minds in one way and compare that entire group to the minds of those without autism, also over-simplifies and distorts the huge variation among autistic minds too. Which is to say, from either direction or perspective, the term is doing a disservice. To push the point further, there is no simple divide between autistic and not autistic, in a way that would make this type of language division useful. For example, if someone is autistic but undiagnosed, does that mean they\u2019re neurotypical, or autistic? And if the word isn\u2019t then tied to confirmed diagnosis, then what are you actually claiming when you say someone is neurotypical; aren\u2019t you simply making an assumption about something you have no knowledge of? The word \u201cneurotypical\u201d seems to be too tight a divide. It would make more sense to say they are the undiagnosed, or \u201cpossibly autistic\u201d or \u2013 better yet \u2013 just don\u2019t presume at all; the use of the term \u201cneurotypical\u201d is typically used to separate strongly those who have autism and those who don\u2019t, and the reality isn\u2019t that straight-forward. I suppose one could be more precise: There are those with autism, those with other neurological differences, and those who are neurotypical. But then \u201cneurotypical\u201d loses its primary function of saying \u201csomeone without autism.\u201d Furthermore, you are left with the question of \u201cwhat is typical anyway;\u201d what makes someone out as normal neurologically. Again, if the term is only used in reference to autism, then we fall back on the same problem of those who face other neurological challenges \u2013 and different ways of thinking and being \u2013 being lumped in together with everyone else. As Jim (from  Just a Lil Blog ) points out in a comment on the original post, what term would we use instead, even when we see the problem with using \u201cneurotypical?\u201d \u201cNot autistic\u201d is cumbersome, even though it is the most accurate meaning we\u2019re after when we say \u201cneurotypical.\u201d Perhaps though, cumbersome more-accurate language, is the lesser of two evils here. We could get inventive of course. Maybe NT-NOS (neurotypical , not otherwise specified), or ~ASD (not ASD). Useful perhaps for computer speak, not so much for everyday verbal conversations. Surely there\u2019s another way to refer to \u201cthose who don\u2019t have autism\u201d without pretending they\u2019re all thereby \u201cnormal\u201d or the same as each other. With these issues and questions in mind, I\u2019ve decided the term neurotypical is not functioning the way I wanted it to, and the way many use it. It comes with connotations and meaning that goes beyond \u201cthe negation of having autism.\u201d As useful as it has been to have a word widely understood to mean \u201cnot autistic\u201d and to have the helpful abbreviation \u201cNT,\u201d I\u2019m going to make a conscious effort to stop using it (even though I don\u2019t have a replacement term yet). My thanks goes to The Tumultuous Truth for raising this, because I had not given it adequate thought prior, and it is worth thinking about. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.co.nz/", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.co.nz/2012/08/neurotypical-who-exactly.html", "http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com.au/", "http://blogginglily.blogspot.co.nz/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/neurotypical-for-want-of-a-better-word/", "title": "\u201cNeurotypical:\u201d For want of a better\u00a0word."},
{"date": "June 5, 2011", "body": "\n Image by Odalaigh via Flickr \n When I began blogging, I hadn\u2019t yet heard of the neurodiversity movement. My first reactions once I encountered it, were a mixture of outrage and disbelief: How could anyone not see autism as a detrimental disorder that is worth fixing? As the months went by, I came to appreciate some of their attitudes and arguments, and realise they in part reflected my own concerns. (Two particular examples of them matching my own existing sympathies, were (1) that certain popular treatments were overly concerned with making autistic people act like robots just so they could \u201cfit in\u201d; that in the process of trying to achieve this outward normality, the happiness and uniqueness of the child was frequently sacrificed; and (2) concern with the view that autism was such a dreadful state of affairs, that trying  any  potential treatment to make it go away, was worth the risks and side-effects; even when those risks included death, and even when those treatments were as yet unproven (or even disproven).) There are certain attitudes and beliefs in the neurodiversity movement that I still consider ridiculous and unfounded, and other aspects I think quite beautiful and insightful. I recognise the spectrum within the neurodiversity movement too; one persons\u2019 neurodiverse attitude might conflict with another\u2019s. I can accept opinions and attitudes that differ from my own without considering them a threat to myself or my son, however there is a particular oversight that pits parents of autistic children, against autistic adults who are self-advocates; which suggest ignorance of experience and paucity of perspective, on behalf of the autistic self-advocates. This is the experience of bringing up a developmentally delayed child; with the sorts of delays that will frequently be forgotten or unknown once that autistic child has become an adult. Parents who are raising these very delayed children, encounter statements like \u201cwe must not think of curing the child unless the child chooses it as an adult\u201d, and \u201cthis is principally difference rather than disability\u201d, whilst that parent is dealing with a child who is still in nappies years after his peers, a child who can\u2019t speak or communicate (leaving the parent scared for his future in all regards), a child who won\u2019t eat more than one type of food, can\u2019t put on clothes while his peers are playing dress-up with ease, has hourly anxiety attacks or meltdowns. The list goes on. When talking to these parents \u2013 raising children who they are still learning about, in the great unknowns of early autism \u2013 it can seriously and unhelpfully upset them to hear adults who no longer face these problems (not in diapers, have found a way to communicate, can dress themselves, etc), saying they are evil for wanting to fix these limitations that are holding hostage the future of their children. From the perspective of those parents, it is cruel to be teased by these seemingly fully \u201cfunctional\u201d adults, talking about how their kids don\u2019t need serious help (and more than just \u201csocietal acceptance\u201d), when those parents know full well that their child may yet end up unspeaking, untoilet-trained, in an institution. It\u2019s disturbing when you\u2019re fighting tooth and nail to get your child the help they need, and here are autistic adults supposedly telling the public that autism is beautiful and doesn\u2019t need fixing. Try changing a five year-old\u2019s nappy, getting bitten by your child everyday, and worrying who will help them get food and get dressed after you\u2019re dead and gone, and then tell me that is \u201cbeautiful.\u201d This seeming gap between the current experiences of parents raising developmentally delayed children, and fully grown autistic adults talking about a pretty unicorn world where if only everyone accepted autism everything would be fine, is so huge that when you\u2019re on the parent side looking over the chasm, the adults on the other side seem to have lost their grip on reality. This perspective \u2013 of the autism self-advocacy adults being out of touch with reality \u2013 is made significantly worse when people who are fighting other agendas (agendas such as being anti-vaccine and pro cure by chelation or chemical castration), twist the neurodiversity movement into some warped monster; where brain-damage is encouraged and all treatments to help autistic people are shunned, and all help for autistic children and adults is fought. There may be some people within the neurodiversity movement who think such extreme views, but in my experience, they are exceedingly few, and more often than not the presentation of these views turn out to be caricatures and misrepresentations of views held by far less extreme people within the movement. Once you become aware of those other agendas at play \u2013 and that taking down the neurodiversity movement and people within that movement will serve other purposes \u2013 it\u2019s easier to be clear and rational about dealing with the movement, instead of getting all caught up in \u201cdefensive parent fighting for my child\u2019s future\u201d mode. Just tease apart the debates, one issue at a time, and remember that even where those extreme views do exist, that they by no means represent the spectrum of neurodiverse attitudes. There remains though the problem of feeling misunderstood and very much underappreciated as a parent trying to raise these challenging children. What those parents need is information about how they can best help their child to succeed, information about what treatments work and what don\u2019t and why, and support so they can do the very best by their child. They need reality too: They need to know \u2013 and have it acknowledged \u2013 that their child might not gain fundamental self-care skills. But alongside this, they need to be encouraged and welcomed into a movement that is \u2013 at its heart \u2013 trying to create a world that will accept and support their child as an adult. Currently, I still see far too many attacks on parents of autistic children, as easy targets in the neurodiversity battle, even while they\u2019re still coming to terms with what \u201cautism\u201d means. I see parents painted as the enemy for even talking about cure, for crying over how hard it is somedays, for having not yet come to terms with their unexpected new reality.  I\u2019ve said it before , and I\u2019ll say it again: If you want to change how they treat their children and think of their children, you need to accept and welcome them with sympathy and open-ness, otherwise you\u2019ll just drive them into the arms of the more welcoming extremists who will transform their confusion into anger and resentment. I want to make something very clear: I absolutely respect and appreciate autistic adults. I do not underestimate what they have to offer, and do not discount their experiences and perspectives. This post is responding to the people within the neurodiversity movement who attack parents without a caring ear or eye to their very real and daily struggles; struggles that are more than just an \u201cattitude problem\u201d on behalf of the parents. Those parents are already confused, frightened, exhausted, and in some cases desperate. I am utterly sick of people saying \u201cthis is not about the parent, it is about the child,\u201d as if they are insightfully shifting the focus to the correct person. You are  wrong . It  is  about the parent. Because there will always be a parent in that child\u2019s life \u2013 even if you took every autistic child away from the \u201cwrong thinking\u201d parent and gave them to a \u201cright thinking\u201d one.  Always . That parent is the primary teacher, the primary carer, and best chance that child has. The parent is the voice and the advocate of that child, even if the child  didn\u2019t  have autism. No advocacy group will ever replace the voice and advocacy of that parent; they can  add  to it,  inform  it, but  not  over-ride it. To attempt to do so is to create an un-necessary enemy where you should have had an ally. And even to create a dissonance between the child and their parent \u2013 making the parent worry that their own child could become so uncaring and indifferent to such real suffering, when they become an adult (\u201cso that is what an autistic person turns out like, I will not let my son become so cruel and ignorant..\u201d). I might add that such seeming uncaring also feeds the notion that autistic people lack empathy. (Obviously such thoughts are again ignoring the diversity of attitudes and abilities among autistic adults, but when it\u2019s being rammed into you as a parent that \u201cthis is the correct and primary attitude of autistic adults towards autism\u201d, it just feeds such opinions.) So where does that leave the mess? I think there is a way forward, out of these attacks and misunderstandings, most of which I\u2019ve already signaled in the post. I\u2019ll pull those threads together here: (1)  Autism self-advocates / people within the neurodiviersity movement, need to  openly and caringly acknowledge the experiences and challenges  faced by parents dealing with a young and newly diagnosed autistic child. (2)  When dealing with a supposed statement about a movement, or someone within a movement,  check the sources . People with \u201cagendas\u201d will try to ignite emotional responses that make their readers less likely to listen to other statements made by those people. Make sure you\u2019re reacting to something real. (3)  Avoid talking \u201con behalf of the neurodiversity movement\u201d or \u201con behalf of autistic adults.\u201d Recognise that there is  a spectrum of attitudes  as well as a spectrum of autism. I am just as unimpressed with parents who speak \u201con behalf of autism parents\u201d, usually said in relation to being anti-vaccine. (In the same breath I of course recognise that many autism parents do not \u201cfeel\u201d the way I do about what I\u2019ve shared in this post, my post hopefully never came across quite so arrogant as that.) (4)   Calmly offer information and alternative perspectives  when faced with a frantic parent; realise that to a certain extent all new parents are scared and confused, parents of any special-needs child even more so. Do not judge them for being completely normal in their confusion and concerns. Show them the light, don\u2019t shun them into darkness. (5)   Know thy (correct) enemy . When the parents are doing \u201cevil deeds\u201d in a supposed misguided effort to cure their child, remember they are following the \u201cscientists\u201d and practitioners who are taking their money and time. They are often being fed false hope as if it was the  only  hope for a better future for their child. They are often fed a story where they and their children are the unwitting victims in a conspiracy, making them potential heroes in that narrative \u2013 if only they will try this then that then this again. Attack the people getting the money and the fame from spreading the misinformation. When those people  are  parents \u2013 who continuously refuse to listen and act on genuine and verifiable information \u2013 then the attacks become justified. In fact, merely being a suffering parent should not \u2013 cannot \u2013 protect such a parent from consequences for harming their child and promoting harms for other children. I\u2019ve seen parents hide behind the fact they are parents, to launch unrestrained attacks on opponents, and to discount attacks by non-parents (again, merely because their opponents are not parents). Being a parent is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for nasty ad hominems and science denial. I know some people will disagree or take offence at this post, and I\u2019m quite OK with that. My intent is not to \u201cavoid offence\u201d or to cause it either, just to add some thoughts to the endless debate. Please at least let me know specifically which parts bother you, and \u2013 who knows \u2013 you might even change my mind and open my eyes. But try to do it nicely, if possible; you\u2019re far more likely to get through to me if you do it with a smile than with a fist. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/68977046@N00/2197628927"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/a-bridgeable-divide-the-understanding-and-empathy-gap-between-adult-autism-self-advocates-and-parents-of-autistic-children/", "title": "A Bridgeable Divide?

{"date": "June 6, 2011", "body": "\n Image by mr. Wood via Flickr \n \u201cAcceptance of autism\u201d is seen by some as a passive and defeatist stance, by others as a positive first step towards the best future for your child, and by yet others as an un-necessary statement that implies either a negative view of autistic people, or un-necessary because \u201cautism\u201d is a meaningless word. These variations don\u2019t simply imply different attitudes towards autism; they are also evident of different meanings of \u201cacceptance.\u201d To further complicate the matter, crucial explanatory / contextual words are often left out when people talk about their acceptance of autism (acceptance of the existence of autism, the challenges of autism, the permanence of autism, etc). In this post I am going to attempt to tease apart some of these differences, in an effort to provide clarity to debates and arguments that include the question (or accusation) of whether someone has accepted autism or not. The word \u201cacceptance\u201d often imports an inherently negative attitude towards whatever is being accepted. For example, you might accept cancer, but there would be no need to accept that birds sing beautiful songs \u2013 there is no \u201ccoming to terms with\u201d the latter. In this way, \u201cacceptance\u201d is referring to a mental state. In this initial sense of the word, some people will always take offense to the notion that one needs \u201cacceptance\u201d of autism; since it is not some negative thing that one has to come to terms with. However, discovering that someone has autism may initiate a grieving process, which need not be seen as a negative thing either; the grieving can be the adjustment and learning process through which a parent (for example) comes out the other end better informed and armed with the attitudes and skills that will help their child. So, coming out the other end of the grieving process might be called acceptance in this initial sense of \u201ccoming to terms\u201d with autism, but the attitude that is arrived at may itself be particularly  positive . Which is to say \u2013 accepting autism might mean the person has moved from a negative attitude towards a decidedly positive one,  or it may mean they saw autism as negative, and have accepted that negativity at a cognitive level (perhaps moved beyond denial). \u201cAcceptance\u201d of autism can also refer to the existence of the condition. Autism is \u2013 after all \u2013 a contested term which is essentially defined by a grouping of symptoms designated from time to time by professionals in the field (rather than by, say, a simple blood-test or physical malformation). This type of acceptance can also be part of the initial meaning (accepting that person X has autism), since learning what autism is, is part of that process of coming to terms with person X having it. So accepting autism in this \u201cexistence\u201d sense, can mean two distinct things; accepting that autism exists as a condition, and accepting that autism is the condition that person X has. Once someone accepts autism in the \u201ccoming to terms\u201d sense, and the \u201cexistence\u201d sense (in both forms), there comes the question of what they do about it \u2013 here I mean specifically in regards to coping with the symptoms. Again, there is more than one meaning here: They might accept autism\u2019s symptoms by their inaction (\u201cthis is autism, I fully accept it and its manifestations\u201d), or they might accept it by their action (\u201cthis is autism, I fully accept the challenges it presents and are ready to meet all of them with open eyes, dedicated to the task.\u201d) These two types of acceptance in regards to the symptoms, are quite opposite in the resulting activity caused by the attitude. Closely related to the above version of in/activity autism acceptance re symptoms, is acceptance of autism as a permanent  condition. Here, accepting autism gets tied into the question of cause and cure (whereas above it was re the symptoms). If you \u201caccept\u201d autism in this sense, then some will see you as giving up on the fight for a cure: \u201cI accept autism / I accept that it can\u2019t be changed, my son will always have it\u201d. This is often thought to include inactivity re symptoms (the previous type of acceptance) \u2013 but this is not necessarily true. You might accept that autism can\u2019t be  removed  (that the child will always have it), yet be extremely active in efforts to alleviate the severity of the symptoms. The question of permanence \u2013 whether someone can be rid of autism or not \u2013 is separate from the acceptance of autism as inherent to the person. So, you might be attacked for not \u201caccepting\u201d your child \u2013  despite  loving them, fighting for their rights, working on improving their skills, thinking it\u2019s permanent, etc \u2013 because you haven\u2019t accepted that your child is  inseparable  from autism. So if you were to say \u201cI don\u2019t think there will ever be a cure, and I love my child completely, but if there was a cure I would give it to my child\u201d, you may very well be accused of not accepting them (often without further explanation of what it is you\u2019re not accepting). All of these variations might be meant when someone says \u201cI accept autism\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t accept autism\u201d. The context will not always make their meaning clear, and frequently people do not elaborate on what they mean by acceptance either. I have attempted to elucidate the most common meanings (categories) I have come across, and to show how there are also variations within those categories. So, to summarise thus far: \n \u201cI accept autism\u201d coming to terms sense: \u201cI have come to terms with autism\u201d (may be a process from negative to positive, or negative to accepting a negative). \n \u201cI accept autism\u201d existence sense: \u201cAutism exists\u201d (may be in relation to the condition, or/and in relation to someone having the condition). \n \u201cI accept autism\u201d in/activity sense re symptoms: In/actions re symptoms, reveal that they know this is autism, and their attitudes towards it. As in \u201cmy acceptance of autism is seen in how I am dedicated to the task of helping my autistic son\u201d or \u201cmy acceptance of autism is seen in how I fully accept and do not fight its manifestations.\u201d \n \u201cI accept autism\u201d permanence sense: \u201cI accept that autism cannot be removed from the child\u201d. \n \u201cI accept autism\u201d inherent sense: \u201cI accept that autism is inherent to the child\u2019s being / personality, so that to fight or feel badly towards autism, is to fight or feel badly towards the person affected.\u201d \n There is one more key element that I think must be mentioned to clarify debates and underlying emotions that involve the question of acceptance of autism. That is recognising categories that refer to superior knowledge; access to an objective truth that others must also reach before they too have seen the light. And categories that refer to the correct or superior attitude, making those who do not hold the same acceptance (or non-acceptance) as unworthy (morally, or as parents, etc). Categories where superior or objective truth are part of the claim, are 2, 4 and 5. So if someone doesn\u2019t accept autism in those meanings, then they might be told they are ignorant. Categories where superior attitude is part of the claim, are 1, 3 and again 5 (which is perhaps why 5 is so often debated and so emotional \u2013 it comes under both categories as I\u2019ve presented them here). So, to not have (or to have) accepted autism under those meanings, can be seen as grounds for moral judgment. There are obviously other ways in which people leave out the \u201cof\u201d or \u201cthat\u201d when they talk about acceptance of autism (\u201cacceptance that autism\u2026\u201d, \u201cacceptance of autism\u2019s\u2026\u201d), but many of the other examples I can think of, are either expressly stated at the time, or they fit into the broader categories captured in 1 to 5. For example, the claim \u201cyou need to accept that mercury causes autism\u201d might be expressly stated, or comes particularly under category 4. Have I messed up this analysis \u2013 made it overly complicated or unhelpful \u2013 have I overlooked some core categories or meanings? Probably! This is just one night\u2019s musings. Do let me know how you would have changed or refined it. Regardless of its precision or gaps, I hope I have made it clear that the question of \u201caccepting\u201d autism \u2013 and the moral and intellectual judgments that come along with statements of acceptance \u2013 are not one question, but many, and to avoid un-necessary upset and confusion, it is always worth making it clear what is being accepted: \u201cAcceptance of autism\u201d does not say it all. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/22041735@N04/5803521346"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/what-it-means-to-have-acceptance-of-autism/", "title": "What it means to have acceptance of\u00a0autism"},
{"date": "April 2, 2014", "body": "I had the radio on while getting through the morning routine a couple of days back, when a story came on about the increase in autism diagnoses, sitting at about 1 in 68 is the latest figure out of the States. My autistic son overheard the story, his immediate response? \u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but smile at his response because it\u00a0shows me how settled he is with his diagnosis. It doesn\u2019t scare him, and the idea of more people in the world being like him is a delightful thought from his perspective. He\u2019s not blind to the difficulties that come with autism \u2013 he knows it makes it harder for him to understand and interact with people, he knows it makes him highly anxious about changes in routine and that it can make him behave quite differently in a way that people find confusing \u2013 but neither is he blind to what he sees as the advantages it brings. He has an amazing thirst for knowledge of reality, he seeks truth, and has a rather powerful memory for retaining the truths when he finds them. He experiences and understands the world in a different way than most people, but that can be as much of a benefit as a hindrance, dependent on the amount of support that he receives along the way. He makes me see the world differently too,\u00a0from angles and points of focus that simply hadn\u2019t occurred to me in the past. I don\u2019t think I can say he is gifted, but there are days when I consider him a gift. When he said that having more autistic people in the world was a good thing, I did decide to discuss the issue further with him, because I want him to understand it negatively affects some people far in excess of how it now impacts on him, while I also made it clear some people have a much milder impact of autism on their lives than on his own. It is, after all, a spectrum. He appears to understand this point, just as much as he appears to understand that autism has made life harder for him in a number of ways too, yet he\u2019s still glad there are more people in the world like him (let\u2019s put aside debates about the real meaning of the increase in numbers for now, though\u00a0I am personally of the view that any increase in diagnoses tells you little about real increase over time). I\u2019m OK that he sticks to his (overly) positive view of autism, because he doesn\u2019t have to have a negative view of it: he is not a researcher trying to solve a puzzle; he is not a fundraiser trying to scare people into opening their wallets wider; he is not an educator trying to put together a desperate case for more classroom support. He\u2019s just an 8 year-old boy living his mostly-pretty-happy life, all that really matters for him and for me as his mother right now in terms of his attitude, is that he doesn\u2019t see autism as some fixed limitation on what he can achieve in life now and in the future, and that he doesn\u2019t feel bad about who he is. If he wants to love his autism, that\u2019s fine by me. In fact, that\u2019s good. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/image.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/autism-rates-are-up-thats-good/", "title": "Autism rates are up? \u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d"},

{"date": "November 20, 2014", "body": "\u201cWe\u2019ve all on the autism spectrum\u201d is a claim I\u2019ve come across very often over the years. Recently I\u2019ve even had a couple of people use my writing to back up this odd claim, which is all the more bizarre since I do have  a previous post  arguing directly against it. I think it\u2019s about time I updated that old post \u2013 I still stand by everything I said in it, but I want to say it again and clearer, and taking into account how I\u2019ve seen the claim used a lot lately. Free use spectrum image We are not all on the autism spectrum. Anyone who says we are, is unhelpfully and misleadingly misusing the term \u201cspectrum.\u201d \u201cAutism Spectrum\u201d is an actual condition that can be diagnosed by professionals in the field, and that requires significant impact on the individual\u2019s life in order to get that diagnosis. The word \u201cspectrum\u201d in the phrase is not referring to a blurring with normal behaviours, it is not referring to borderline cases, neither is it intended to capture those who exhibit autistic traits but otherwise fall short of the diagnostic criteria. No. The term \u201cspectrum\u201d is capturing the diversity of symptoms and severity \u2013 and in some cases and more so historically, the actual diversity of conditions \u2013 that are considered to amount to autism.  Not  ones that fall short of it. That term \u2013 \u201cspectrum\u201d \u2013 is not a throw-away term, it is part of the name of the condition of autism. Considering existing wide-spread confusion about what autism is, all it does is cause further confusion and downplaying of the reality and importance of the condition, when people claim we all fall on the spectrum. What we may all have (and even this is far from a simple truth) is some autistic traits or tendencies, such that if those traits were taken to extreme levels and accompanied other behaviours, that they may be identified as autism. But I could make a thousand comparisons where we could see that having something that looks like a condition is blatantly not the same or ever comparable to having the relevant condition \u2013 a paper-cut is not on the spectrum of life-threatening wounds; a piece of note paper with two sentences on it is not on the spectrum of great novels; a toasted piece of bread at home is not on the spectrum of gourmet dishes in 5-star restaurants. Just because things look similar, or appears related, doesn\u2019t mean they are meaningfully or functionally the same. So even if we completely remove the word \u201cspectrum\u201d in \u201cautism spectrum\u201d from its actual and intended medical meaning, we\u2019d still be left standing on thin ice trying to explain why it makes any sense to claim we\u2019re all on the autism spectrum. At the very least, if people strongly feel we do all exhibit meaningful autism traits or all fall in some way on a broad autism phenotype, then they should make it\u2019s clear that is what they mean (and back it up while they\u2019re at it). They should avoid using the term \u201cspectrum\u201d to capture this point though\u00a0 \u2013 it is inaccurate, unhelpful, confusing, misleading. It causes irritation to those fighting to help the public better understand what it means to say someone is actually on the autism spectrum, and it down-plays the very real challenges people face who are on the spectrum. I do recognise that there are good intentions behind those who try to say we\u2019re all on the spectrum \u2013 they\u2019re often trying to make the condition be less scary, or help the public relate to those with autism \u2013 but I strongly feel that using the term \u201cspectrum\u201d to make this point, causes more harm than good. *** For further arguments to this effect, and to see some minor ways in which those arguments have changed alongside changes in diagnostic criteria over the past few years, feel free to pop through and compare this to my original post from 2011: \u201c Why we\u2019re not all on the autism spectrum.\u201d \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/11/20/misusing-the-spectrum-in-autism-spectrum/", "title": "Misusing the \u201cspectrum\u201d in \u201cautism spectrum.\u201d"},
{"date": "April 20, 2014", "body": "My eight year-old son has recently begun taking medication aimed at easing some of his autism symptoms. This decision was a hard one, reached only after many years. It is also a controversial and widely misunderstood decision. I\u2019m going to do two posts about\u00a0medicating a child for autism. The first \u2013 this one \u2013 is about the complexity of the decision. The second will be about people\u2019s various (and surprising) reactions to the decision. By subsetsum on Flickr via creative Commons. There are at least five variants at play in making the decision on whether to medicate a child for their autism \u2013 it is not a simple or quick decision, and neither should it be. What I\u2019m going to list is based on my own observations and experiences \u2013 you may be aware of other variants I haven\u2019t considered, please share them with me in the comments. The first is of course the child itself. There is no single \u201cdrug for autism:\u201d If a child has autism, that doesn\u2019t mean they require medication. The drugs that may help autism symptoms depend on the symptoms; are you medicating to address violence, OCD behaviours, anxiety, depression? And does the child have co-morbid conditions that are going to be relevant to what drugs are suitable or unsuitable? How old is the child? Have the symptoms reached a point where their impact on the child is severe enough to require looking into medication, and do the severity of the symptoms you are addressing out-weigh the risks that come with taking medication (the\u00a0side-effects). There is of course also the way the child\u2019s own brain and body reacts to the medication once it has been started; the decision to start taking a drug is never the end point, there is a need for ongoing monitoring of impact, changing dose, removing the child from the medication for short time periods or permanently, etc. There is nothing straight-forward about this, and that\u2019s only the first variant. The second is the family\u2019s own preferences. Even if the child would or would not benefit from medication, a family that is very strongly in favour of or against medication is going to necessarily have an impact on what drugs (if any) are given to the child. A family that is turned down by own physician when asking to have their child put on medication, may deliberately seek out another doctor who is free-er with the prescription pad. Which brings us to the third variant. The doctor. Doctors have their own experiences, knowledge, training, and may or may not keep themselves up to date with the latest research on drugs that can assist autism symptoms. The doctor\u2019s preferences have a strong impact on what options are available to a family. Furthermore, a doctor who highlights side-effects and a lack of research on using medication for autism symptoms on children, is going to differently impact on a family\u2019s decision on whether to medicate their child, than a doctor who paints the drug in the light of hope and relief. Of course a doctor\u2019s personal preferences are\u00a0also impacted on by the society in which they operate, which is the next\u00a0variant. The society and country within which the child lives, has a huge impact on the decision of whether to medicate. Some countries have very specific guidelines on best practice for medicating autistic children, some countries subsidize\u00a0specific drugs of choice, some countries have a free public health system that makes it easier to access, or only have private health insurance schemes that make accessing drugs impossible for some even if the family and doctor wanted it to happen. The attitudes within that country \u2013 society\u2019s views on whether medicating an autistic child is acceptable or abhorrent \u2013 shapes the way a government and health system operate. For example, some think you can just \u201ctalk\u201d the autism away, which brings me around to variant five. Non-medical alternative interventions. The decision on whether to medicate a child to assist them with their autism symptoms, is made alongside a consideration of what alternatives are available, what has already being tried, and what can yet be done. Despite what the majority of the public seems to think, medication is not the \u201ceasy\u201d option. In our case at least, we have already done years of a large variety of intensive interventions that had nothing to do with drugs, and starting our son on medication is happening alongside an extension of those interventions, not alongside a removal of them. The decision to medicate has been made in light of what else is working or not working, and how urgent the need is to remedy the impact of the symptoms on his daily life; sometimes drugs can calm a mind and body enough so that other interventions that were not making much head-way, will have a better chance of future success. In our situation, the decision to medicate is a reluctant and very controlled one. Our son starts on a very small dose, closely monitored by family, teachers and professionals, before the dose is slowly increased if necessary. Any changes in behaviour or physiology is noted and taken into consideration. We have been informed of potential side-effects and what to do if they occur. Our son will only be on the medication for about six months, by which stage we hope the other interventions we are introducing will have helped calm him enough that the medication will no longer be necessary, and we will take him off the drug slowly \u2013 again under professional guidance \u2013 and monitor the impact of its removal too. And yet on a piece of paper and on any statistic chart, all you\u2019d see is the notification that our child has been put on medication for his autism, and that simple statement is what we as a family will get judged on \u2013 the various factors that\u00a0lead up to the decision can\u2019t be captured in a number. The attitudes of others \u2013 and even the surprising emotional response I had to my son going on medication \u2013 will make up my next post. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/04/20/medicating-a-child-for-autism-part-one-the-decision/", "title": "Medicating a Child for Autism.

{"date": "April 23, 2014", "body": "I have a friend who has been put in a situation that is frightening and unacceptable. This friend is an adult with autism, who lives here in New Zealand. She qualifies for support to help her\u00a0live independently. But that crucial support has been taken away with little warning and no replacement, even though her\u00a0actual entitlement to it has not changed.\u00a0Trying to deal with the situation has caused her\u00a0great stress and anxiety, and is already impacting on her\u00a0daily life, and continues to be unresolved. I want to share her\u00a0story with you \u2013 with her\u00a0permission of course \u2013 because I think it is important to understand how our support systems can so badly fail the vulnerable in our community, and because I hope someone who reads this can offer advice and perhaps even a solution. To make it easier to write this post I will call the person \u201cJane\u201d and talk about them as if they are female, but the real name is not Jane and I will not confirm their gender either, in order to protect their identity. Jane has severe anxiety, sensory problems, and depression. Talking can be terrifying \u2013 she\u00a0often\u00a0uses computer-based communications instead \u2013 but when she is comfortable and feeling safe she can talk and enjoys it. She\u00a0needs support twice a day to help with daily tasks such as showering, dressing, dishes, rubbish, and opening and shutting curtains. She also needs support twice a week for domestic chores. This support is what allows her to live an otherwise independent life. Jane regularly tries to learn new skills and try new experiences, with proper support she has been taking part in her local community. She doesn\u2019t have\u00a0the support of people close to her who could help her with these tasks, including family, so she is heavily reliant on consistent and kind carers. She is also one of the most unique, thoughtful, caring women I have had the chance to encounter online, there is no malice in her, just a kind soul that needs a bit of help to get by. Jane was receiving these much-needed supports until a couple of weeks ago, when she was having concerns about one of her carers. As is her right, she requested for a different carer to take their place. The service provider\u2019s response was to remove the carer at issue, but they were unable to replace them, and they then told her they\u2019d have to take out the other carer who had been helping Jane too because they were having difficulty finding people to cover the hours. She was only given about a week\u2019s warning that she was about to lose all her helpers, despite the agency claiming they gave her a full two weeks notice. In the time they\u2019d given her to find new carers, the agencies responsible for helping Jane have failed to find replacement help, so now Jane is in the situation where she had no carer and it\u00a0has already seriously impacted on her well-being, such as in the taking of her much-needed medication. She has\u00a0a friend from out-of-town who has very kindly agreed to come help her out for the next few days, but after that she will be back to no help, and still has no word on when such help will return. You can only imagine the enormous amount of stress this places on someone who already suffers from anxiety and struggles with changes in routine. When Jane first told me about the situation, I desperately wanted to help her. So even though I am not in her city, I made calls to her local support service providers on her behalf to express concern and to ask what progress was being made. I did this with Jane\u2019s full consent, and kept her informed throughout of my progress, or rather disappointing lack of progress and the barriers I encountered that she had struggled with too. When I was finally able to get hold of the person in charge of Jane\u2019s funding and in charge of finding Jane replacement carers, I found myself talking to a rude and antagonistic woman who went straight into complaining\u00a0to me about Jane. Let\u2019s call this short-tempered woman, \u201cKatie.\u201d Katie told me Jane wouldn\u2019t stop contacting her\u00a0about the situation (understandably surely), and that she was already doing everything she could to help Jane. As this was a couple of days before the long Easter break and we would later find out Katie was going to be on holiday at least a week longer than the break period, you\u2019d have hoped Katie would show a sense of urgency and an understanding of how important the situation was. Katie not only failed to find replacement care for Jane, she failed to communicate this properly to Jane too, leaving Jane confused about if and when the situation would get resolved. It was abundantly clear from the way Katie spoke to me about Jane, that Katie does not appreciate or understand the relevance of Jane\u2019s anxiety in their communications. Jane needed reassurance, comforting, and above all else support, she got none of those things from the people responsible for finding her a new carer. By the end of the conversation I had with Katie, it was  me  doing the calming\u00a0of  Katie, \u00a0who was so agitated and annoyed at Jane\u2019s efforts to get the carer situation sorted. I considered Katie to be deeply unprofessional in that conversation, and in later talks with Jane my impressions of Katie as being unhelpfully impatient and rude towards Jane were further confirmed. I do not think someone who gets so annoyed and lashes out when\u00a0being asked to do her job, should be in that line of work. I have encouraged Jane to make complaints about the people and organisations that failed her after the situation is resolved \u2013\u00a0that list includes the fund holder and the person responsible there for Jane\u2019s service provision, the care organisation that pulled her care with inadequate notice, and in all likelihood should probably include the carer who she had to request be removed in the first place. The days went by getting closer to the complete loss of carers, and in that time Jane did everything she could to try to get replacement help. She saw her doctor, she requested an advocate from a mental health community group, and she asked whether I would be willing to contact a mental health crisis team if she got to that point. I only wish I could do more.\u00a0The advocate is hopefully going to be coming to see Jane this week, but whether that will lead to a replacement of services and when remains to be seen. In the meantime, Jane is not provided with\u00a0adequate levels of care, care she is entitled to under our health system. The impact of the loss of that care is hard to fathom. Not only are there the necessary everyday task that she cannot do for herself, and the impact of the interruptions of routine on her physical health, there is also\u00a0the enormous impact this is having already on her mental health. She feels abandoned and has even wondered whether she did something wrong to be treated this way. It breaks my heart that she\u2019s going through this, that she would be made to feel that it\u2019s her fault. I am scared for her well-being. And now I\u2019m reaching out to you. What else can be done to help Jane? What else can I do, what else should she do? Is there some agency I should be contacting that I haven\u2019t already? I\u2019ve tried citizen\u2019s advice bureau, I\u2019ve tried her fund holder, she\u2019s seen her doctor, she\u2019s requested an advocate, we\u2019ve both tried to put pressure on the people responsible for making the care reappear, all of which shouldn\u2019t have had to be done in the first place.\u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be tolerated if we left young children, the elderly, or the sick without care and without information on when care will be available, so why do we have here an example of a person with a disability and significant mental health\u00a0needs who is in this situation? We listen to government rhetoric about how great it is to have people being empowered to live within the community instead of in institutions, and yet\u00a0the short-fall of service provision to make that happen means they are endangering our most\u00a0vulnerable citizens. Jane has the right to live independently, and it is the best option for her long-term due\u00a0to the nature of some of her challenges, all she needs is support and understanding. She knows I have written this post and it is only being shared with her approval. She says she is OK today,\u00a0because\u00a0the aforementioned\u00a0friend from out-of-town is with her\u00a0right now. She will see your comments, so please offer her your love and support and reassurance, she needs it and she deserves it. And if you can help her, or help me to help her, please reach out and let us know. *** Brief update (30th April): The situation remains unresolved and has taken some upsetting turns. Both I and another friend of Jane\u2019s continue to keep in contact with those who are in a position to help, and to advocate for Jane. We\u2019ve had small successes in terms of making those contacts and trying to get people to share the concerns and work towards fixing the situation, but nothing is yet resolved. I just want to again thank all of those who have made suggestions and tried to help, it has been very useful. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/failure-of-support-services-a-friend-in-need/", "title": "Failure of Support Services \u2013 A Friend in\u00a0Need."},
{"date": "April 21, 2014", "body": "The reactions that people have had to my eight year-old son starting on medication, have been mixed and surprising. I want to start though with the reactions I had expected, based on what I hear very regularly on national\u00a0radio talk-back shows and through other social media. Creative commons image If talk-back is anything to go by, the decision to place children on medication for issues like anxiety, hyperactivity, aggression etc, are a symptom not of the child\u2019s state but of the parent\u2019s failure on multiple levels. It is treated like a sign that the parent has failed to parent their child adequately to stop these troublesome behaviours emerging in the first place, and furthermore a failure by the parent to seek appropriate remedies to the problems once they exist. But these views are more often than not, a failure in  those \u00a0complaining people to understand the reality and complexity of conditions like autism, and furthermore a failure to appreciate what I addressed in  my first post  \u2013 that deciding to put a child on medication is not a simple effortless decision made on a whim. There is a sort of nasty busy-bodiness in these attitudes; that these non-professional members of the public are entitled to heap shame and abuse upon parents of children with special needs if those parents dare to follow advice that their child would benefit from medication. It\u2019s cruel, and somewhat bizarre. I also think it stems from a deeply misguided view some have, that\u00a0parents of children who don\u2019t have special needs have done something right \u2013 that when another parent has a child with ADHD, OCD, ASD etc, that it is reinforcement that those  without  these children were\u00a0superior parents. Whatever the driver behind the attacks made on parents who medicate their children \u2013 even if it is genuine concern that children are being un-necessarily medicated as a result of lazy parents who want to sedate their children until they dribble in the corner \u2013 it is clear that there is a fair bit of ignorance backing those views, and that those views are un-necessarily harming these struggling families. These views get heard by parents like me, and some of us will internalise them. Some of us will feel shame and misery that we must have failed our children somehow to have reached the point of medicating them. We may worry that we didn\u2019t try enough interventions, or didn\u2019t try hard enough, and that turning to medication is proof of our failures. However, I want to say this to those parents: Do you judge a diabetic for having to use insulin, or a cancer patient for having to use chemo? Do you judge a schizophrenic or someone who is bipolar for taking medication? Autism is a real condition, and our children are often severely affected by it, why should they not also have medication as an option to help them? If medication exists that can help, and we have already tried so many other options, why would you deny your child this extra potential tool? Because that is what it is \u2013 a tool, not a solution. A tool that is used under professional and individualised guidance. Are there side-effects to worry about? Yes, but there are also worries about side-effects of other non-medical interventions, and it is exceedingly rare that any side-effects of medications for ASD can\u2019t be un-done by coming back off the pills. It\u2019s a careful weighing up of pros and cons, and as parents this is just like all the other cost-benefit equations we have to work through in the best-interests of our children. I was surprised at my own reaction when my son was prescribed medication, I thought I too would feel shame or depression. But I realised I was feeling hope and relief. Not hope and relief because I thought we\u2019d found the answer or this would solve all the problems, rather \u00a0because this was a new and promising tool we hadn\u2019t tried yet that might finally make\u00a0a real and positive difference to those aspects of my son\u2019s life that continued to isolate, restrict and upset him. I trust the judgment of my son\u2019s professional in this field, which is such an important thing. I go into this medication option with eyes open to the potential risks and benefits, and with the support of my family and the professionals. We are in a good position to make this work for my son, and to change tact if it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s worth a try. The one member of my extended family that I have openly chatted to about the medication, took the news\u00a0in without a blink. She listened and nodded and trusted my judgment too. As did the friend I spoke to in person about it as well, I felt no sense of being judged or as if I\u2019d failed my son. That level of support happily surprised me, and made me think more highly of both these women. But there is one other woman whose reaction surprised me in the bad sense, and not because she judged me as a failure for putting my son on medication, but because she judged  herself  as a failure in this regard. His teacher is at a mainstream school, so no doubt doesn\u2019t often deal with this issue. She has tried so hard since the start of the school year to help my son thrive, and she has done a fantastic job. She\u2019s been so willing to learn about him and about autism and to work closely with us as a family. It\u2019s been a steep and at-times stressful learning curve, but I thought she was handling it beautifully. Yet in finding out we\u2019d had to turn to medication for some of my son\u2019s behaviours, she became upset and told me she\u2019d been depressed, and tried to figure out what she must have done wrong for this to happen. She thought she had failed our son and our family somehow for him to have reached the point of requiring medication. When she told me how much it had upset her, I went out of my way to explain we\u2019d been contemplating medication since he was about four years old, that this was not an entirely new topic for us as a family. Yes, some of his behaviours had gotten worse since starting the new classroom and having her as a teacher\u00a0(and yes she hadn\u2019t noticed some of the behaviours that we had since we don\u2019t have a class of 20 kids to watch everyday), but\u00a0change is hard for my son at the best of times and she\u2019d done everything we\u2019d asked (and more) to ease the transitions. I tried to explain that sometimes his autistic behaviours are cyclical, that he goes through bad and good patches and we just do our best to problem-solve and help him through. I did my best to ease her worry and reassure her that she is the fantastic caring teacher she really is\u00a0(and then I gave her an Easter egg to try to cheer her up). So it is not just parents and families that are needlessly hurt by erroneous public views on medication as evidence of failure, it is also caring individuals like teachers who can get caught up in the blame-game. Finally, there is one more person\u2019s perspective I have to cover, because it\u2019s the view that matters the most: My son\u2019s. I think it is absolutely critical that where the child can understand adequately, that we make the attempt to communicate the point and hopes and even maybe the risks of the drug. My son understands that the drug he is on is aimed at helping reduce his more troublesome and upsetting behaviours, we\u2019ve told him which ones we\u2019re hoping to reduce and why. He knows some of the risks \u2013 that it won\u2019t work, or can have some side-effects \u2013 but he\u00a0trusts his professional and us as his parents to monitor him and the dosage, and to take him off if that\u2019s the best thing for him. He knows \u201cdrugs\u201d as a bad word, so he likes us to call them \u201cpills\u201d instead and that is what we do \u2013 the language needs to help him feel comfortable and safe. At one stage he said something about the pills that I think is so insightful and crucial here. My son asked me straight out: \u201cAre you trying to change me?\u201d I smiled and told him \u201cno.\u201d I explained that there is a difference between trying to change behaviours, and trying to change a person. I compared it to many things he can understand, like trying to toilet-train his brother \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to change who his brother is, just some of his behaviours. We even had an extended discussion on how we\u2019re not trying to take away his autism either\u00a0(he sees his great memory and love of truth and knowledge as part of his autism), that we\u2019re just trying to lessen the effect of the not-good parts of autism on his life. We ended up also having a discussion on at what point changing someone\u2019s behaviour might be thought of as trying to change the person themself, where I talked about if I tried to change his interests and his identity and the things he loved by making him act and speak differently about such things, then that would cross a line. My son asks some amazing questions sometimes, his mind astounds me. I wouldn\u2019t want to change him, I\u2019m not trying to change him, I\u2019m making the best decisions I can as his mother for what is in his best interests. Sometimes, the best options in life include medication. There is no shame in that. There is no joy in that. It is just one more tool, to be used thoughtfully and carefully, particularly when it comes to our children. So please, next time someone says something disparaging or cruel about parents who \u201cdrug-up\u201d their kids, speak out and let them know not only the ignorance in such broad claims, but also the needless hurt and damage such views do to innocent families, teachers and even children. Parents are made to feel shame at contemplating medicating their children,\u00a0surely we don\u2019t want parents to be making decisions of what is in the best interests of their child based on that shame. We want the decision to be based on the individual child, on science, on reality. Broader debates about whether too many kids are being medicated, by what and for what, should be had within the same framework: Based on reognising individualism, on understanding science, and with an eye to the complexities of reality. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/04/21/medicating-a-child-for-autism-part-two-peoples-reactions/", "title": "Medicating a Child for Autism.

{"date": "October 26, 2014", "body": "\u201c Saving Normal \u201d is a provocatively titled book by the equally provocative Allen Frances. He has at times been demonized in the autism community, particularly for his views about the over-expansion of the autism diagnosis; whereas many in the autism community fear too few are diagnosed and fear the reduction of the diagnostic category, Frances believes too many are incorrectly diagnosed and that the diagnosis has hit \u201cfad\u201d status. I have read many of his articles and have consistently found him to be a very considered thinker and writer, and someone who is often misunderstood \u2013 his messages get over-simplified by others in a way that makes it an easy (but misguided) target. I think much the same of this book: It is a well-considered and thoughtful book, with a message that would be easy to attack and dismiss if you overlook the complexities that he tries hard to identify and address. With that warning in mind then, the briefest way to explain the key concern of the book is that Frances would like us to \u201csave normal\u201d \u2013 to recognise that diagnostic over-inflation is unhelpful, even dangerous, and only getting worse. He argues that the boundaries of normal are being ever-eroded, with the backing of many interest groups, and particularly due to the influence of \u201cBig Pharma.\u201d Before I go any further, I want to point out one rather glaring factual error that is relevant here and that gets repeated three times in the book: Frances claims \u201cManipulating the market is particularly easy in the United States because we are the  only country in the entire world that allows drug companies the freedom to advertise directly to consumers \u201d (my emphasis). I just happen to live in the only  other  country in the world that allows exactly this \u2013 and we have been doing it since 1981, ie well before the USA stumbled into the mire. It\u2019s a shame Frances has missed this point, because I suspect there are strong lessons to be learned by (a) comparing NZ  and  the USA to other countries who don\u2019t allow the advertising (he focuses on just the USA, limiting his relevant pool of data for his conclusions), and (b) comparing the USA to NZ to see why the two countries have had (somewhat) different outcomes with the same freedoms. This error made me a bit suspicious of what else he may have got wrong in the book, but having now noted it I will put that to the side for the rest of the review. Frances looks at a number of past, present, and predicted future fads, to support his case. Obviously of most interest to me \u2013 and no doubt to my readers \u2013 is his look at autism. As the chair of the DSM-IV task force, and a vocal critic of the DSM-5, his views on what is happening to the autism diagnosis is an important and well-informed one. Here though \u2013 as in other parts of the book \u2013 I was frustrated by the lack of detailed analysis that I had hoped for from someone with his background and experience. Nevertheless he does effectively use autism \u2013 alongside other conditions \u2013 to make a strong case that while many people are over-diagnosed, many do go undiagnosed, and he does explain why that is. Even though his examples are almost always ones drawn from what he is most familiar with \u2013 the situation in the USA \u2013 I was able to see how it related to me here in New Zealand too. I found some of his solutions to fix the problems he sees, particularly frustrating though, because I see some of his \u201cfixes\u201d in place here in New Zealand, and a huge number of families suffer the consequences of the ridiculous bureaucracy and lost funding that then gets poured into those \u201ccorrective\u201d measures. For example, Frances advocates assessing children on actual need for school services and funding instead of basing it on a diagnosis, however we here are in the position of watching endless millions pouring into the salaries and structure of a system that guards our families from accessing much-needed funds unless we continually prove the ongoing nature and severity of a condition; it is never enough to have a diagnosis from a highly-trained professional, our families are forever having to prove themselves, even for children with life-long and severe conditions. Obviously if you put a system like this in place to correct the existing USA issues of so much (too much) power being put in the hands of a quick and one-off diagnosis, you need to make sure you don\u2019t further harm the very people you are trying to help. Even though I took issue with some of Frances\u2019 suggestions for improving or correcting the system, it is obvious that something does need to be done in the face of the current trends of pathologising what is in fact \u201cnormal,\u201d a trend that is perhaps most obvious in the USA but is growing elsewhere too (I recently read\u00a0  \u201cCrazy Like Us\u201d  by Ethan Watters which had a good look too at the westernization of mental illness, that is also worth a read). Furthermore, Frances has the bravery and foresight to at least suggest some fixes, instead of simply identifying the problem. \u201cBrave\u201d is a word that I think does apply more generally to Frances too: he is a very honest man, who puts himself on the line in this book \u2013 exposing his past failures, and putting his own neck out when he could have just as easily kept quietly to himself and not caused a fuss with his colleagues around these issues. It takes a certain openness and integrity to do what he has done in this book; the sort of person you\u2019d want to be present and active in the discipline of psychiatric diagnosis. After the book has made its way through definitions, fads, and fixes, Frances ends with a few rather more intimate stories and suggestions, that changed the tone of the book and \u2013 I think \u2013 further reveals the complexities of the issues themselves and of Frances\u2019 views. He gives advice for how we as individual consumers of mental health services, can aid ourselves to be better informed and more careful about quick diagnoses and quick fixes. He also shares some stories that are both sad and hopeful about what can go so right with a careful diagnosis, and what can go so wrong with careless diagnosis. It would be hard to read those final sections of the book, and not be emotionally affected by them. Through these stories and his eventual book conclusion, Frances makes his case that even though there are serious issues with the current trends of over-diagnosis, there is also very much good that can come from the field of mental health and psychiatry. Essentially, he implores us not to throw the baby out with the bath water. In my own conclusion then of the value of this book, I would say this: No matter your views on Frances himself, on over-diagnosis, on autism and its trends, or psychiatry in general, this book is a valuable resource that makes arguments we should not ignore or be ignorant of. Whether you are convinced by him or not, Frances has some important things to say, and has put his neck on the line to say them. I am glad I made the time to read this book; it challenged me to see things differently, it annoyed me at times, it amused me and made me sad and hopeful, and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 further convinced me that there is something deeply wrong with the way psychiatry and the DSMs are currently progressing. There is a public conversation that must be had about this issue, and this book forms a good launch-pad for that vital conversation. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Saving-Normal-Allen-Frances/9780062229250", "http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Crazy-Like-Us-Ethan-Watters/9781849015776"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/review-of-allen-frances-saving-normal/", "title": "Review of Allen Frances\u2019 \u201cSaving\u00a0Normal.\u201d"},
{"date": "November 8, 2014", "body": "Jerry Seinfeld \u2013 free use image Jerry Seinfeld recently  shared the view that he feels he may be autistic , if autism was taken to a very \u201cdrawn-out scale.\u201d Of course we all know that if you take autism to a very drawn-out scale, it\u2019s not autism anymore \u2013 it\u2019s autistic traits, or the Broader Autism Phenotype, or border-line autism. This fits with the examples he gives of what he thinks makes him autistic, all came from the social communication side of symptoms, which suggests he may better fit what is now called \u201cSocial Communication Disorder\u201d rather than meeting the criteria for an autism diagnosis ( here  are the comparative diagnostic criteria if you\u2019re not familiar with them). Even then though, I\u2019d suggest the impact on this life wouldn\u2019t be to the degree required to meet the threshold for a diagnosis. How would I know though \u2013 all I have to go by is a few sentences from an interview. And yet, those few sentences threw the autism community into an uproar on social media. Twitter is a great way to get snapshots of the variety and intensity of reactions, just type \u201c jerry seinfeld autism\u201d  into the Twitter search to see what I mean. The reactions I have come across so far range from those praising Seinfeld for casting a more positive light on autism \u2013 particularly because he sees his struggles as an \u201calternate mindset\u201d rather than as dysfunctional \u2013 to those who have demonised him for playing down the harsh reality of autism (and using pictures of dead and suffering autistic children to back up their outrage). From those who say his opinions are personal and hold no weight, to those crying out that he has a societal responsibility before he shares his views on autism. And from those who say he is \u201c courageous \u201d for self-diagnosing, to those who blast him for belittling the diagnostic process. In all of this, I see symptoms of something other than Seinfeld\u2019s purported autism \u2013 I see symptoms of what is so messed up about the autism community. The most aggressive responses are coming from those who seem to think they have some ownership of the autism diagnosis \u2013 that it has to look like intense suffering to count, the worse the suffering the more legitimate the autism. Yes, severity is part of considering whether someone meets the criteria because it requires \u201cclinically significant impairment,\u201d but even then autism remains a spectrum, and the severity of autism\u2019s impact on someone\u2019s life can change throughout their life. Furthermore, we can\u2019t forget that what counts as autism can and has changed (many times in our own life-times, and before then too), so good luck pinning down who will be considered autistic 5 or 10 years from now. I don\u2019t own the diagnosis, neither do you, we use it to help people access the services and most appropriate help for them as determined by the current experts in the field (who themselves are forever arguing about what is and is not autism). And yet the autism community seems intent on splitting itself down strict lines of who is in and who is out. I think that\u2019s because letting the wrong people \u201cin\u201d waters down a political message: Where the message is we need more services, more funding, more help, then it may feel like a direct attack on what you\u2019ve been fighting for when someone who is successful in their life suddenly says they belong to your group. Suddenly the public sees autism isn\u2019t so bad after all, the suffering is played-down, the message is lost. At its worst, the parent of an autistic child may worry people will tell them they\u2019re just not trying hard enough with their kids \u2013 if Seinfeld can do it, so can their kid, stop making excuses (etc). Along the same lines, those embracing Seinfeld\u2019s statements are also embracing him because of the political message it encourages: One of seeing autistic people as people of potential, people who are often under-estimated and facing unjust prejudice, people who are too often compared to anti-social and dangerous psychopaths instead of the shining examples of Einstein and Grandin \u2013 and now Seinfeld. They embrace Seinfeld and his message because it fits their agenda \u2013 whether he really is autistic or not is secondary to the political message they are pushing about acceptance and potential. The message is the key. Stay on message.  And you see exactly this too when people stop towing party lines: If someone who is autistic says they don\u2019t mind their autism, it is very common to see them attacked as not really being autistic. If someone who is borderline autistic cries out for more services and shares their woes, it is rare for their autism diagnosis to be questioned. In or out of the group, isn\u2019t about autism in these situations, it\u2019s about the message people want pushed. Tied into all this is the problem with Seinfeld self-diagnosing, and the current wide-spread debates about the growth of mental diagnoses and the concurrent shrinking of the spectrum of normality \u2013 the concern that there is a trend in society right now to  pathologise perfectly normal human experiences . So Seinfeld again becomes a political football in this debate, and in how it affects the autism community. So if Seinfeld diagnoses himself as autistic, he is just one more fool supporting the expansion of everyone being abnormal in some way, and therefore diluting the focus of resources, funding and research on those most in need. Or, Seinfeld is fantastic for de-stigmatising mental conditions by blurring the lines between \u201cnormal\u201d and those conditions \u2013 supporting the message that we\u2019re all a little unusual so stop treating those with conditions as if they are so different or as unwanted people in society. Again, the point is not Seinfeld himself, it\u2019s how neatly he fits in with the political message. I can only imagine how he must feel watching all these debates about him and his autism \u2013 I wonder if any of the things people have suddenly turned him into have any relationship at all to how he views himself or autism. In fact, if you read his quote carefully and without any bias about what message you think he\u2019s trying to push, it\u2019s perfectly possible to read him as saying some of his own challenges feel like difference rather than dysfunction \u2013 not that  autism itself  in his view is or should be seen in that way. (Go on,  read it again  in that light.) I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting to push a message of acceptance, a message of potential, of understanding, of too few services and funding, of unseen suffering, of whatever. But what I do see as wrong is people deciding that  views  on autism can predetermine the legitimacy of your diagnosis. Whether someone likes or hates autism doesn\u2019t change whether they have the condition \u2013 I have met far too many people from across the spectrum with various views and levels of happiness to believe otherwise. Furthermore, whether someone has autism or not, is a fact that can be verified by a diagnosis \u2013 someone diagnosing themself does not mean they  don\u2019t  have autism, and a fair few people who get a diagnosis don\u2019t objectively have the condition either (there is plenty of material proving this fact, from doctors own mouths). So those who decide Seinfeld does or doesn\u2019t have autism based on his views, or based on the fact he is not diagnosed yet, are getting a bit carried away. Yes, he is a celebrity, and yes some people seem to put a ridiculous amount of stock in what celebrities say about something they have no training in, but that\u2019s a problem to be countered with accurate information and with pointing out the lack of meaningful authority in random celebrities. Seinfeld was doing an interview about how he sees and understands himself, the idea of autism helps him understand himself better, and that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s not an attack on our kids. It\u2019s not necessarily a trumpet being blown for one side or the other of any particular autism debate. It\u2019s just one man doing a bit of navel-gazing in public. Now can we all just go back to attacking and misconstruing each other instead? We all have so much more material to work with that way.

{"date": "October 30, 2014", "body": "Each year on my blog\u2019s anniversary, I have a look back on how far I\u2019ve come, and share my most popular and noteworthy blog posts. It\u2019s a good way for me to keep a record of how my blog is advancing (or devolving!), and to share interesting posts people may have missed who are new to my blog. I like to start with a quick look at my stats. I\u2019ve had 354,506 hits on my website so far, up from 235,000 this time last year. My  Facebook page  has 639 fans, up from 442 last year. My  Twitter  followers are at 1340, up from 1051. But the stat that means the most to me is how many people have signed up to my blog \u2013 and that number has gone up from 203 to 1088! Feeling the love \u2764 My most popular post this time last year, continues to be the most popular: \u201c Distinguishing Giftedness from Aspergers; will the DSM-5 help? \u201d My previous most commented on post was \u201c The Privilege Game, \u201d but is now \u201c ABA, regrets, and a question of happiness .\u201d I still find myself thinking a lot about giftedness and its relationship to autism, as well as the controversies surrounding ABA, so I intend to return to both topics in future posts. It\u2019s a little disappointing that none of my posts written in the past year feature as most popular in either regard, but perhaps it\u2019s a good sign too that my posts stand the test of time (look at me finding the upside!) The most popular post then from the past year, is the very recent one on  psychological damage , which you can see two posts down from this one. At this point I typically share the sites of my favourite autism bloggers too, but they have either completely stopped writing in their blogs, or now write very infrequently; whenever I go to update my links list in the sidebar, I find many more that have outright disappeared since I last checked on them (do click through on the sidebar though if you\u2019d like to check some out). I\u2019m not entirely sure why that sad trend is happening, but I do know those who I have had the chance to talk to about their departure, almost always cite the in-fighting they often see at work in the autism community. It is hard enough living in the autism world, it is hard too to find the time and energy to share those experiences and consequent views, harder still to be attacked when you talk openly and honestly about what you feel and go through. I also find it draining when I come under attack, as is bound to happen when you write on something many people are understandably passionate about and yet can experience so very differently. I try to focus on the support I receive from those who read my blog, rather than the fly-by-nights who only pop in to dump abuse, and I\u2019ve been lucky enough that my readers tend to be of the thoughtful and compassionate variety. I never take my readers for granted, I feel honoured that strangers and friends want to read and share what I have to say, so thank you to everyone who is reading this and who reads my blog generally \u2013 you are appreciated and you keep me going. I hope you are still with me on my 5th blogging anniversary a year from today \ud83d\ude42 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/autismandoughtisms", "https://twitter.com/AutismOughtism"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/blogging-anniversary-4-review-of-the-past-year/", "title": "Blogging Anniversary #4 \u2013 Review of the past\u00a0year."},
{"date": "February 1, 2014", "body": "You\u2019d think the topic of disability rights would be familiar to me, since rights were a recurring theme throughout my legal and philosophical training. Yet during those nine years at university, the topic rarely arose. We looked at the rights of women, children, the poor, the terminally ill and of various races. As students and teachers we could all understand these groupings and all knew someone who belonged to such groups. But \u201cthe disabled\u201d was an amorphous grouping \u2013 an \u201cother\u201d \u2013 within the able-bodied and able-minded university classroom. The occasional blind student or wheelchair assisted person made the student body feel all-inclusive and progressive; students would ask to pat the guide dog or smile as they pulled their bags out-of-the-way for the wheelchair. But mental disabilities walked among us unacknowledged, unspoken, or unknown. The academic culture was such that at a recent group tutor training session one my fellow tutors was giving an example of a stupid question a student had asked her, and decided to voice it by sticking her tongue into her lower lip and putting on a typical ridiculing voice used to make fun of the mentally disabled. The other tutors laughed around me, I was disgusted and angry and outraged, and apparently alone in that outrage. Another example: a student in one of my own classes used the existence of the disabled as an example of why rights theory can\u2019t be based on human capacity for rationality because the disabled lack the capacity to reason. Others in the class seemed to find this insightful. The problem with disability rights for many people, is getting their heads around the diversity of disability, which is just as richly varied as the diversity of \u201cability,\u201d and with so much overlap between the two. It\u2019s even trickier when you have conditions like autism where the label tells you little about whether the person is severely intellectually disabled or more mildly disabled across other areas that don\u2019t impact on intelligence per se. Co-morbid conditions further complicate any simple grouping. So much of the disabled rights movement is simply asking people to see the disabled as individuals, with the same rights as everyone else on this planet; looking past the label to the human being. Understanding that lack of speech or looking different (or whatever) does not mean the person is less worthy of basic protection and equal treatment. Equal treatment; there\u2019s the rub. Because equal access, equal education, equal employment rights, look different in a world that is created with the majority in mind. Suddenly \u201cequal\u201d requires extra services, extra supports, special consideration, even more so  in a world that is not only made for the majority , but which actively views the disabled as lesser human beings (eg, situations where \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d may be suggested). For joe-public, this is a contradiction: To insist you are equal and should have equal rights, but to demand special treatment in order to exercise that equality. \u201cMake up your mind; are you equal human beings who can speak for themselves, or are you dependent on others who are more capable and productive than you.\u201d (I\u2019ve seen so many discussions along these lines in local public forums, a classic and common example is when a disabled individual requires special exam conditions like time extensions or people who can write for them, and they\u2019re attacked for expecting \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d) I see this uncomfortable tension playing out in recent Government policy: where the Government is expecting the disabled to stop sponging off the taxpayer and get a job; are  expecting the disabled to enter complex employment contracts with their carers ;\u00a0and don\u2019t accept disability as an \u201cexcuse\u201d anymore, \u00a0in a way that is creating a lot of upset and even terror across the disabled population. (One of the more outrageous examples,  a quote from a Government worker in the case of a tetraplegic woman being evicted from her rental : \u201c\u2018 I note that you have a serious disability. However, many people with disabilities are able to manage very well within their own means. \u201d) This all under the guise of the Government being more accepting of the capabilities and independence of the disabled, yet apparently forgetting that they are dumping them in a world which still treats them like lesser human beings, and forgetting that disability is not one big grouping with a straight-forward cut-off point of who is in and who is out and who can do what. The Government is proud that it has moved away from the institutionalization and segregation of the disabled, yet inadequately funds the alternatives of mainstreaming and home-based care. The money that was holding up the old system, does not appear to have been redirected into the new improved systems, it feels like the inclusion of the disabled in society is being used as a reason to say \u201csee, they don\u2019t need our money anymore, how wonderfully progressive of us!\u201d, when the level of need and support for those individuals has not itself actually decreased. I\u2019m not just attacking the current Government (even though they have a very poor track record over the past few years for the rights and treatment of the disabled), I think the problem lies in the complexity of what is meant by disability rights, and even what is meant by disability. I\u2019m not even arguing for a specific version of disability rights in this post, so much as trying to highlight where a particular key confusion seems to be arising and is being used to turn disability rights against the disabled. I think any meaningful discussion of what disability rights means in practice, has to take place within existing societal constructs: We\u2019re not just talking about the rights of the disabled in a pure context-less sense, we\u2019re talking about the rights of the disabled within a framework of public health and education and the specific country\u2019s legal system. In this context, it is going to be inadequate and discriminatory to provide a publicly funded system that sets the disabled out to fight for themselves but expressly creates and upholds a situation where the majority are extensively catered to already (whereby their own fight is already won). Whether the current system is one based on a good workable understanding of human rights would always be a relevant question, but where it nevertheless exists it remains relevant to ask if it is treating the disabled as equal citizens. The disabled are not trying to have their cake and eat it too \u2013 they are not saying \u201ctreat us like everyone else but differently.\u201d There are those who will twist disability rights into a vehicle to further belittle, demonize, dehumanize, incapacitate, and make fun of the disabled. They are doing more than harming the disabled though, they are perpetuating an impoverished world where significant chunks of the population are denied the right to contribute and to flourish. There was a time that I was ignorant of how disability might fit in with rights rhetoric, I\u2019m not that ignorant anymore, now I\u2019m angry instead. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/90099958@N07/11979157055/in/photolist-jfyj3B-bxz3Vg-bjEcZs-bxzd26-bxzfZe-bxz6Hx-bxz9uM-bjEi4A-bxz39T-bxzcLK-bjEnML-bxz8KX-bxz9FF-bxzgYR-hTqM99-hTrgWZ-9kMC8A-9kMyF1-9kMyEJ-9kMC8d-9kMC83-9kMyEw-9kMyEj-9kMC8G-hm5WLx-fcP9PN-bo5DB5-akpYa1-9kMC8N-gazdk7-iFccvC-b8thdp-bPXyzx-hFukvR-hFv89J-cGZPJm-b8tgFg-b8tg9P-aqUu4r-de4SKE-i2uLbU-fcyQx2-cGZzwy-cGZTPy-cGZJ8A-cGZuGd-cGZMNj-cGZQdE-cGZJyY-cGZHAq-cGZR9G", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/9621058/Disability-no-guarantee-of-state-house"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/02/01/turning-disability-rights-against-the-disabled/", "title": "Turning Disability Rights Against The\u00a0Disabled."},
{"date": "February 5, 2014", "body": "Getting a diagnosis of a serious disability from a specialist, is never the end of the story. It is not the final step to proving your child\u2019s disability to the public and the Government, even though the diagnosis is the end point of numerous investigations, observations and medical tests that often take months to complete. Rather, it just leads up to the first time you will be forced to prove that your child has a disability, to people and organisations that seem to think their own non-medical, non-expert view holds more importance and weight than medical experts who have specialized in the field. Not only is this state of affairs upsetting, time-consuming, and expensive, it shows a remarkable level of suspicion and disrespect towards both medical experts and the parents. By Kevin Spencer, via Flickr First, two local utterly ridiculous and yet not-isolated examples: The example of families who have been forced to prove yet again that their children have life-long debilitating conditions so they can continue to receive Government financial support. This particular story is of a family in Hamilton: \u201c Hamish Taylor, 17, and his 15-year-old brother Austin have duchenne muscular dystrophy. Its symptoms including muscle weakness and wasting.They will have to live with it for the rest of their lives .\u201d You can read the  rest of their story here . Then there is  the story out today  of a mother who has had to put up with threats and abuse because members of the public time and again think her brain-damaged son doesn\u2019t look disabled enough to justify using a disability parking space: \u201c The North Shore woman has a permit to use the parks due to the needs of her 3-year-old son who cannot walk or control his upper body following the removal of a brain tumour when he was 3 months old. \u201d Again, this story is not an isolated one, it happens far too often to the disabled in society, where proving they had a disability that allowed them to use these special parks is seen as \u201cinadequate\u201d in others eyes who have no medical or professional training. Finally, I want to share my own recent frustration at being treated like someone who is trying to cheat the system, despite having evidence from multiple sources that my son has high needs. I had to reapply for the Child Disability Allowance, which gives me the shockingly small amount of about $45 a week in recognition of the extra time and care my son requires because of his disability. Considering I gave up a lecturing and then tutoring job to be a full-time carer to my son, we\u2019re talking a serious income-reduction with a corresponding huge increase in family costs. Put aside my annoyance at being so under-valued though \u2013 and that someone who chooses not to work and with no dependents gets at least a hundred more than I do \u2013 and we\u2019re still left with the situation where I had to recently re-prove that my son\u2019s care still means I should get a single penny. I had his confirmed diagnosis, I had a letter from his specialist saying she still believed he qualified for the Allowance in question, I had the recent agreement of the local family doctor to that effect, and the evidence of other Government organisations like the Ministry of Education and the local NASC who believe my son is high enough needs to require extra daily assistance. But when I submitted the form the doctor had signed off after she\u2019d cited and talked through all of these details with me, saying she believed we qualified for 5 more years support, I received a phone call saying we hadn\u2019t provided any proof and had to do so. Stupid me for thinking the doctor\u2019s opinion mattered. Stupid doctor for thinking their opinion mattered too. Stupid person at the specialist\u2019s office who said getting the renewal would be straight-forwardly signed off by our doctor. Stupid specialist for thinking her opinion that my son still had high needs would be taken seriously. All of us apparently fools, because some non-medical non-expert at a Government office knows better. So I provided all the evidence again, this time directly to the lady who frankly had been very rude and dismissive of me on the phone. She even gave me the wrong email to send the documents to, and no other contact method, so I had to sit on hold for 20 minutes with the generic Government call centre to figure out how to contact her. After all that hoop-jumping, I have been given a single year extension to getting $45 a week, with the express instruction that I must see the specialist again within that time frame to prove again how high needs my son is if I want another extension. Getting an appointment with his specialist takes months because she\u2019s in such high demand, and when we do get one it will be an utter waste of her time and ours because it\u2019s to do nothing other than say \u201csee, he\u2019s still autistic and still has needs.\u201d Even getting into the medical centre where we go for the appointments is going to be hell, parking in the inner city is a nightmare and expensive, we\u2019d have to take time off school, and in all likelihood I\u2019ll have my very-fussy 4 year old in tow while I try to negotiate the huge medical complex. None of this I am looking forward to. Pointless. Expensive. Time-consuming. Stressful, Disrespectful, to me and to my son\u2019s doctor and specialist. I hate how they make me and others feel like we\u2019re trying to get away with something, like we\u2019re immoral, we\u2019re liars, we\u2019re cheaters. Apparently we go around inventing conditions, then finding a doctor corrupt enough to diagnose this false condition, then make up stories about the daily challenges this false condition creates, just to get $45 a week. Or just to get a disabled car-park. Or whatever other tiny accommodations are made for us in society. We are forever having to prove how hard our lives are, forever been told to retell our hardships, and then not being believed anyway. It\u2019s a sick system, a sick world that demands this of us and treats us this way, to throw us crumbs and then tells us to just be grateful we even got that. This is not OK, it\u2019s very far from OK. This never-ending story of having to re-prove serious disability, needs to end. This is an election year, so maybe we can expect to be heard for once. Let\u2019s make them hear us. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/55043824@N00/3525674189/in/photolist-6ny172-6uA2hF-6xDVvh-6DSHmz-6HqDKY-6N7bRp-6WA4wV-7d2foM-7d2fSP-7d2hYz-7d2iXD-7d6bgu-ecbUZm-7QsZbU-e7FCNP-e7MikL-ehjXoa-8UM89F-gyCusF-dacp9D-dus33b-dumhYk-durPXS-dump1T-f85pkz-f8jFgU-7SK4Sh-7SFLmM-7SFNnH-ehkvSp-ehkvjc-8Fkv4c-bvWcbF-9mXmty-7EkUVa-7VUTiX-7QDvPP-e7Mi2u-fJTfr4-9e1mAc-8aS8fG-7SJZW1-7SK2VG-7SFJq8-dBbPCc-bvWiDi-bvWhez-ehkxuk-ehky52-ehrgFy-ehkztP", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/9437301/Winz-forces-Hamilton-family-to-prove-sons-still-disabled", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11196783"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/proving-disability-the-never-ending-story/", "title": "Proving Disability; The Never-ending\u00a0Story."},
{"date": "February 19, 2014", "body": "Here in New Zealand, legislation and the New Zealand School Trustees Association, (\u201cNZSTA\u201d) both encourage school boards of trustees to be representative of their community. Specifically,  they advise that when a school board is seeking to co-opt or appoint new members, it should be mindful of  gender, ethnicity and socio-economic diversity. But I cannot find any mention of the need for a board to represent or reflect the fact that a school will always have a disabled population among its numbers, which is all the more important when this disabled population is typically the most vulnerable grouping within a school. The disabled are known to be a population that experiences high levels of abuse, exclusion, and discrimination, so why are school boards not expressly encouraged to seek out trustee members that can represent their interests and give them a voice at the highest level within the school? By Salem (MA) Public Library, via Flickr I was discussing the issue recently with a lecturer at a course I went along to; I was one of three parent speakers invited to share our stories of what works (and doesn\u2019t work) when it comes to inclusion in schools. The lecturer encouraged me to write to the president of the NZSTA about the issue, which I did a few days ago. I have not received any response, not even an acknowledgement of receipt of my email. Considering that I even identified myself as a trustee member of a school in that email \u2013 and thereby a member of the very organisations they represent \u2013 I would have hoped for at least a \u201chi, good point, let me get back to you.\u201d I\u2019ll wait a while longer before I pursue the matter further, but I am writing this post at this point anyway, because of a recent news story that illustrates why it is so important that the disabled have an understanding voice on the school board. The story is one currently making its way through the courts.  A 14 year old with Aspergers and Dyslexia, has been excluded from their school,  presumably because of an incident with a skateboard, but the facts that are emerging are painting a pretty clear picture that the incident was just an excuse: The skateboard event appears to fall well short of the sort of thing that would justify excluding the child from the school. The school takes the position that it lacked resources for caring for this child, and that I think is the real point behind excluding the child (the family\u2019s lawyer appears to be taking this line too), and is also an appalling state of affairs. I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s appalling because the school lacked the resources, since I sincerely doubt it did in any simplistic or essential sense. In my experience \u2013 from reading these stories for years and talking directly to parents involved in such exclusions \u2013 schools don\u2019t simply \u201clack resources,\u201d rather they don\u2019t prioritise the well-being of the disabled, they don\u2019t allocate adequate money, time and teacher training to the care of these children, and the worst schools for these sorts of actions tend to have a deeply entrenched culture of thinking that the disabled don\u2019t belong in their schools. That culture frequently carries through both principals and in boards of trustees. There was a recent study that bore out this truth in New Zealand; the most inclusive schools correlated with good attitudes from the top-down. It\u2019s an important point, so I want to quote from  my own earlier post  that looked at this eye-opening study: \u201c The 77% of schools that exhibited mostly inclusive practices\u2026 showed a particular and note-worthy trend that was again notably\u00a0absent\u00a0in the schools failing these students: Positive attitudes from those in leadership positions towards the inclusion of children with special needs. In the \u2018few inclusive practices\u2019 category, you\u2019ll find Principals and other core staff who do not believe mainstreaming is appropriate or possible for our children, so it\u2019s hardly surprising to see these attitudes affect other staff and practices across the school. \u201d I\u2019ve seen this in practice personally too. When I first visited my son\u2019s current school \u2013 four years ago \u2013 it was not welcoming at all, either in terms of front-desk staff, or the principal or anyone else I interacted with there. There seemed to be an attitude of focusing on problems and saying they would find it difficult to deal with, and expressly told me money would be tight if they were to try to make it work. At the time, I chose not to send my son to the school. Two years later \u2013 with a new principal, and a new board of trustees in place \u2013 the welcome and attitudes were as different as night from day. The principal made it clear they were going to make it work, and exhibited a joy and acceptance towards their existing autistic children at the school. Is it now a perfect school that gets everything right? No, but when things go wrong they listen and they problem-solve and they work to make it right; you cannot overestimate the value of a good attitude when it comes to working with disabled children. My story, and the 14-year-old Aspergers child\u2019s story, and the stories of my friends; these are not isolated incidents.  This issue is wide-spread in New Zealand , with parents being forced to move home to find a local school that will actually let their child attend, with parents being forced to quit work and home-school because they are left with no other option, and with vulnerable children being denied what other children get without question. Are there children that are just too difficult for New Zealand schools? I\u2019m sure there are, but many of the stories I hear and read about unambiguously go back to attitudes rather than the child themself being the insurmountable problem. The attitudes of other parents who pressure the school to get rid of the \u201cdifferent\u201d child, the attitudes of staff and principals, and at the end of the day, the attitudes of the school\u2019s board of trustees. I would like to think that a board which at least had someone on it with some understanding of disability \u2013 whether from their training or experience or own family or self \u2013 would be that much less likely to turn to exclusion as the solution to a child who faces challenges. I would hope that boards with that sort of voice and perspective on it, would mean we rarely hear of these exclusions based on disability, that we could take some comfort that the relevance of the disability of the child had been truly taken into account when judging the child\u2019s behaviour and when deciding what action to take as a school. So I ask the president of the NZSTA to add the recommendation that boards actively pursue someone with at least some understanding of disability to join the board, to thereby recognise and openly acknowledge that disability is as much a part of our community as gender and ethnic differences. I asked her to put pressure on the Government to change their legislation to reflect this reality too. Depending on her response, I shall also ask particular members of parliament to pursue this change. And now I am asking you;  write to the president of NZSTA , write and talk to your own school boards, write to your member of parliament, ask them to please take steps to actively encourage representation of the disabled at school board level. Even better, next time school board elections come around, please put your name forward, let\u2019s get our voices where they will make a difference, let\u2019s be the change in attitude that has to happen so these news stories of exclusion become few and far between, rather than the expected norm they have now become. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nzsta.org.nz/board-as-governors/what-is-a-school-trustee-/what-is-a-community-trustee-/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035350@N03/4420188417/in/photolist-7JAC28-d55QPC-7ZRNSB-7Pd7bK-9gsbPd-8ZK8wH-8oXxR8-d6rSVQ-83DgMd-9zCrsN-bvk3iG-bBa6Ww-bjxDAJ-boHUbZ-eiAA8x-dCi1dV-e6jvFi-eb7xmz-dCKsYd-c7BSUW-boHT7H-7BztQw-7Z9En2-7MpJos-a3c4rR-dj5bNF-eA6rLq-cfYwLY-9xLHYo-a6ormj-7ECgqk-85oqQ7-b4fzfe", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11205654", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10786481", "http://www.nzsta.org.nz/about-nzsta/organisation/principal-officers/lorraine-kerr---president/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/02/19/disability-representation-on-school-boards-of-trustees/", "title": "Disability Representation on School Boards of\u00a0Trustees."},
{"date": "October 22, 2015", "body": "Everywhere I looked today I saw news sites and social media promoting the new \u201cSee Amazing\u201d initiative by Sesame Street. Eventually I gave in and looked myself, and I have to say, they appear to have got  everything  right. If you haven\u2019t found the resource yet, you can access it here: \u201c See the Amazing .\u201d What\u2019s so special about this \u2013 how is it any different from all those other websites trying to get our clicks and shares and money? So much of that is answered in the simple phrase \u201cSesame Street.\u201d I grew up with Sesame Street, my children grew up with it (and still watch it every day). It has huge popularity and appeal. So for something so wide-spread and so loved to create a free resource aimed at making our lives better, is something very special. And I do mean \u201cour lives\u201d \u2013 they have made sure that their website also offers support, acceptance and understanding of everyone involved in the life of an autistic person, including siblings and parents. So what is involved in this resource? You name it: information and advice on supporting our families; a child-aimed video encouraging us to see and enjoy \u201cthe amazing\u201d in all of us; daily routine charts (tooth brushing, hand washing, trying new food); a storybook about a new autistic Sesame Street character called Julia, etc. All of which can be found through the link above ( here, let me give it again  anyway). The site works equally well on my iPad as it does on my desktop, so chances are whatever you\u2019re looking at it on will cope well too. These resources could be used very well by parents and therapists, within preschools and primary schools, and with friends and family trying to understand and help those with autism. The \u201cSee Amazing\u201d initiative apparently took three years to complete, and included consultation with families, service and support providers, and people who have autism themselves. The tone and usefulness of the end product reflect this wide consultation. Despite expressing the challenges and hardships (such as high bullying rates) of those with autism, \u201cSee Amazing\u201d also manages to convey the important upbeat message of appreciating and accepting others\u2019 differences and seeing both the special talents and simple joys of autistic people. It fits within the wider narrative of, well, of seeing the amazing in all of us \u2013 their chosen title captures what they\u2019re doing very well. They\u2019re encouraging others to share their own stories of seeing the amazing too, which is helping to build the profile and momentum of the movement. Obviously, I think it\u2019s all sorts of wonderful, but I have come across some (undeserved) negativity towards the project, which saddened me. I\u2019m going to mention that negativity only briefly, because I do believe it is misguided and that most people will see where it has gone wrong without too lengthy an explanation. I\u2019ve seen the initiative attacked for using the terminology \u201cwith autism\u201d instead of \u201cautistic.\u201d People making this attack need to understand that no matter what terminology Sesame Street chose, they were going to be under fire from different interest groups \u2013 try not to read so much into the terminology, and appreciate instead the clearly good intent and positive messages; surely that matters so much more. I\u2019ve also seen people attack Sesame Street for focusing so strongly on autism here instead of other disabilities, to which I reply do they even watch the show? I have seen a regular and established cartoon character in a wheelchair, I regularly see the inclusion of children in wheelchairs in their songs and segments, and I have seen Elmo segments include multiple children (and babies) with Down\u2019s syndrome. I know Sesame Street has also included adults with other disabilities, such as deafness and included sign language accordingly. Diversity is not something Sesame Street has failed in. Lastly, I have seen Sesame Street attacked for not expressing their resource from an autistic perspective, which is a bizarre attack because the entire resource is built around understanding and accepting the autistic experience and perspective. I think this is a knee-jerk reaction from people who have not adequately explored the resource and do not realize it was deliberately created with inclusion from autistic people including the self-advocate movement. So really, what\u2019s not to love? I think this is a beautiful, thoughtful, heart-warming and useful resource, that I sincerely hope (and believe) can make a positive difference for our kids. I hope Julia\u2019s character gets expanded further into the everyday Sesame Street universe \u2013 her creation and this initiative is clearly not a simplistic or one-shot endeavor, so I suspect the resource may be expanded, particularly if we show them how much we appreciate it. So please do check it out, please do share the love, and please do let me know what you think too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.sesamestreet.org/", "https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/seea.png", "http://autism.sesamestreet.org/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/sesame-streets-see-amazing-autism-initiative-gets-everything-right/", "title": "Sesame Street\u2019s \u201cSee Amazing\u201d Autism Initiative Gets Everything\u00a0Right"},
{"date": "February 16, 2014", "body": "Blow blow, ear ear, hair. Everyday, many times an hour, my son will blow on his left forearm, his right forearm, wipe the top of his left ear, his right ear, then run his hand across his hair. Again, again. \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked of him so many times, it\u2019s a question his teacher has asked of me too; why does he keep repeating this odd sequence of actions, what function \u2013 if any \u2013 does it serve? Should we be trying to stop it?  Can  we stop it? He did once tell me why he started doing it, and I tried to address the reasons back then. But now the behaviour has seemingly become a non-functional habit and he says he doesn\u2019t know why he does it anymore, and isn\u2019t even aware that he does it when it happens. He\u2019d told me he started touching his ears to make them flat on top, similarly he wants his hair to be flat. I think he blows on his hands to help dry them off after washing his hands, since he\u2019s quite obsessive about his skin being completely dry. But he dries his arms and hands fine with the towel now, and he understands his ears don\u2019t need to be flatter and won\u2019t go flatter by endless touching, and we changed his hair cut to make it even shorter in length than it already was. Still. Blow blow, ear ear, hair. So what am I meant to do, if the behaviour has simply become routine, and doesn\u2019t harm him or anyone else, but makes people stare at him and wonder why he\u2019s doing it? If the behaviour appears to be completely non-functional at this point, but merely ingrained. It\u2019s not as if he even knows he does it now, it doesn\u2019t make him happy or calm, it\u2019s just\u2026 done. Over and over. You already have an answer in mind, most likely. Maybe you\u2019re of the mind-set that it\u2019s harmless, just leave it be, he\u2019s just doing his own thing. Maybe you think it\u2019s setting him apart and harming him in his social relations, and since it serves no obvious ongoing function we should work hard to stamp it out. Maybe you\u2019re undecided, maybe you think it\u2019s nothing even deserving of thought or worry or bother. As a parent of an autistic child, you are expected and required to analyse the child\u2019s behaviours, constantly. Figure out if the unusual behaviours are harmless or harmful, and whether the harm if it exists breaches some magical threshold of \u201cworthy of intervening.\u201d You have to figure out the function of the behaviour, and then decide whether the behaviour that currently occurs is an appropriate way to meet that functional need, or whether you can or should replace it with another behaviour, or address the underlying cause to extinguish the need that the behaviour meets (if possible). You have to find a way to ask your child what need it meets, and observe regardless to figure out when it\u2019s happening and perhaps the why to go along with it. And even when you\u2019ve done all that \u2013 observed, communicated, considered, consulted, experimented with responses and fixes \u2013 you\u2019re still going to make a decision that other people are always going to criticise. Well I decided it\u2019s time he tries to break this blow blow ear ear hair habit, a habit which only started a few months ago but already seems so deeply ingrained in his daily rituals. But for all my careful consideration and communication leading up to this decision, he just won\u2019t stop anyway. He only notices he\u2019s done the behaviour after I tell him he has. So now I\u2019m left wondering whether to escalate my efforts to make him stop, what else to do to make him stop, wondering whether this is a habit that will pass by itself in time or will become part of permanent behavioural repertoire. I just don\u2019t know, and the amount of energy I\u2019ve put into trying to figure this out is almost funny: What a lot of fuss over a blow, a couple of ears and a few imaginary stray hairs. So I open it up to you: If your child was doing this, many times an hour, everyday, what would you do, and why? Or perhaps you can tell me what unusual habits your child has and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 you\u2019ve done about it. In the meantime I\u2019ll return to this endless analysis I\u2019ve been trained to do over the past many years: Observe, analyse, problem-solve, observe, (over-)analyse, problem-solve. Maybe that\u2019s my own pointless habitual behaviour now; maybe  I  should try a little blow blow, ear, ear, hair, for a\u00a0change. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/blow-blow-ear-ear-hair/", "title": "Blow Blow, Ear Ear,\u00a0Hair."},
{"date": "October 12, 2015", "body": "The children are finally back at school now that school holidays have come to an end. I sit down with my newly-acquired spare time to read a parent-written article on how people misunderstand and demand too much of anxious children. I expected to sit there nodding in agreement, expected that I\u2019d surely be aiming for those share buttons to help spread the word\u2026instead I just cringed. And shook my head in dismay. And sat down to write this counter-piece. Public domain image The article that\u2019s annoyed me in its portrayal of children with anxiety and with its view on how we should treat these children, is called \u201c Don\u2019t Ask my Anxious Child to \u2018Suck it Up \u2018\u201d (published on October 9th at \u201cpickledbums\u201d). It\u2019s getting plenty of love and approval, so rather than loudly rain on her parade over there and upset all those parents in heartfelt-agreement with that writer, I\u2019ll do it over here where no one can see me in my quiet little corner of the web. I write my response here as a mother of two autistic children who both suffer from anxiety, one whose suffering is such that he is on daily medication to take the extreme edge off but who still needs help coping with anxiety. (We\u2019ll be trying to get him off the meds at the end of the year by the way, the story of going on and coming off meds for anxiety will need a future post of its own.) I write too as a person who suffers from anxiety and who has other family members with the same; there is no doubt a heap of genetics at play here. The point being, I see and live anxiety everyday. First things first: a diagnosis of anxiety is not a reason to stop pushing your children and exposing them to challenging situations. Rather, knowing your child has the condition is a gateway to understanding and to figuring out what tools will help your child and how to use those tools. Let\u2019s use the writer\u2019s own analogy: She says \u201c You wouldn\u2019t make a child with a broken leg run a race, so don\u2019t force my anxious child to do things they find difficult .\u201d If my child had a broken leg, I wouldn\u2019t rule them out of the race, neither does having anxiety mean my children will be allowed to sit things out and not be challenged anymore in those things they find extremely difficult. Instead, if my child had a broken leg I would figure out whether there is any way in which they can still take part \u2013 maybe on crutches, maybe go a shorter distance; find someway that they can still give it a go with appropriate support. And I would work towards a future where we can heal the leg and help the child eventually live the best-legged-life they possibly can. Similarly, if my anxious child finds something extremely hard, I would work to find ways to allow them to be slowly and thoughtfully exposed to the challenging experience. I would find out what aspect of the experience is hard for them \u2013 is it the running surface, is it the fit of the shoes, is it the speed, is it the length of the race, is it the proximity of the other runners, or pain of the movement, etc. My point is when your child is struggling, you don\u2019t say \u201coh well, damn anxiety, we\u2019re sitting this out,\u201d rather you go into problem-solving mode and refuse to let the anxiety run the child\u2019s life and restrict the child\u2019s future. Take a very real example for both my children: They have fear and intense anxiety around swimming (or frankly, even getting wet at all some days). I don\u2019t pull them out of swimming sports though. I get involved \u2013 I get in the water with them, I slowly expose them to the experience of water on their faces in a controlled way and we use goggles because their eyes are particularly sensitive to water. I recognize their learning pace is slow and anxiety-filled so I break every learning step down as much as possible, with constant reassurance and encouragement. I tell teachers and anyone else who will be with them in the water about the concerns and that if my children are pushed too hard too fast then it will only increase anxiety and distress, so to be mindful and recognize that they aren\u2019t like every other child learning to swim. Recognize and respond to the individual. I also use social stories and videos to reinforce that being in the water can be fun, can be safe, and to build familiarity. It\u2019s a lot of work, but it\u2019s what an anxious child requires. Do I think my children will both be fantastic swimmers one day? That\u2019s highly unlikely, but I won\u2019t stop trying just because of anxiety. They need to learn to swim for their own safety. Similarly, will a child with a broken leg win the race? No, they won\u2019t, but if there is any way at all to encourage their participation and reward them being willing to give it a go, then that is the right thing to do. And never lose sight of that future less-broken-legged child. The entire tone of the article I read, seemed defeatist. Yes I understand the writer\u2019s annoyance and distress that people sometimes blame parenting instead of acknowledging that anxiety for some children is an an actual mental condition and not just a transient state of being that could be fixed by simply \u201csucking it up.\u201d However, the fact is that parenting  can and does  help anxious children; just because parenting is not  the  cause of all childhood incidents of anxiety, does not logically mean you can\u2019t use parenting methods to ameliorate the child\u2019s suffering. In fact, it is in the child\u2019s best interests to not have their anxiety reinforced by a parent who says \u201cyep, too hard for you dear, don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Instead, we need to help our children see things in a way that exposes the fear as something that is in excess of the actual danger involved to them, and equip our children with long-term strategies to help them overcome situations that would otherwise leave them paralyzed with fear. We must listen to our children to understand their type and level of fear, and use that knowledge to then help them to live in this frequently-overwhelming world of ours. That\u2019s our job as parents. My children are not going to be great at everything, I know that. And there will be some experiences that are ultimately far too hard for them. But I will not give up, and I will not tell others to give up on them either. I will teach my children and the adults who work with them, to better understand the challenges ahead and how to work through them to achieve as much as my individual children are capable of achieving. One last point that really bothered me about the article. The author says: \u201c Some kids  might be anxious because parents are too focused on safety rather than long term consequences, but  some kids  are anxious because their brains don\u2019t work quite right.\u201d That made me cringe. Their \u201cbrains don\u2019t work quite right\u201d? Both my children\u2019s brains are astounding, some days I think my brain is pretty damn awesome too, but because we get anxiety our brains now aren\u2019t  working quite right ? Take any given person in the population \u2013 some have irrational fears, some have perverse fantasies, some have addictions to cigarettes or alcohol or gambling, others are perfectionists or have OCD, or have extremely high pain sensitivity. For all these variants of minds and mental states, do we declare that each of those people has a brain that doesn\u2019t work quite right? Or, do we recognize that we all have our personal challenges, some far more extreme than others, but we still have perfectly functional brains that allow us to get on with life 80% of the time and find ways to cope with the more troubling parts of who we are. You can recognize mental illness, you can acknowledge hardship and difference, without having to declare the brain to be broken. Brains are immensely complex and immensely changeable, I worry that if we accept the idea that a child\u2019s brain is not working \u201cright,\u201d then we are doing them and their future-selves a disservice by accepting a limitation on who they are and what they can do. \u201cI have anxiety\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cmy brain doesn\u2019t work quite right.\u201d Now maybe you feel I\u2019ve been too harsh with the author. Maybe she didn\u2019t intend to come across as accepting of her child\u2019s anxiety in such a defeatist manner, maybe she didn\u2019t mean to say that she doesn\u2019t want others to push her child to do challenging things, maybe I\u2019ve misunderstood her choice of words about the brain not working right. Such misunderstandings happen, and if I am mistaken I will accept that error and do so happily. Regardless though, her article gave me the impetus write this post, and to make the points I feel need to be made about children with anxiety; that the diagnosis of anxiety is an open-door to new understanding of the child and to new techniques to help the child, it is not a closed door with a sign on it that announces what your child cannot and should not be asked to do. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/keyboard-114439_640.jpg", "http://picklebums.com/anxious-child/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/anxiety-in-children-and-why-you-shouldnt-let-that-that-broken-leg-stop-you-running-races/", "title": "Anxiety in Children (and why you shouldn\u2019t let that \u201cbroken leg\u201d stop you running\u00a0races)"},
{"date": "April 4, 2015", "body": "My eldest son attends \u201c Riding for the Disabled ;\u201d where once a week he gets to ride a horse for an hour during school time, and I get to say he\u2019s doing therapy. My son with a group riding during a session. (Copyright asserted.) At least, that was my first impression of this oddly privileged outing. We were on the waiting list for a year, so getting a space in the program was itself quite special for us. I was not happy that the only time slots anyone could do a ride was during a school day, but I\u2019d been told it was going to be worthwhile so I decided to give it a go anyway \u2013 maybe the value of the experience would outweigh the lost learning time. After filling out some rather daunting forms, including getting medical clearance from his doctor, we were accepted and ready to travel the fair distance out to the site. The trip there and back once a week plus the ride itself, takes 2.5 hours out of his school day \u2013 this is no small thing, and wouldn\u2019t be possible if I had a job. I reflected on the fact that so many of us parents of children with special needs are unable to hold down regular jobs because we need to be on call for our kids, so maybe it wasn\u2019t an outlandish expectation of the organisation after-all; that parents would have the time in the middle of a week day to ferry their kids to and from the event. However, I soon found out that it was not just parents taking their kids to and from the program; there\u00a0was a\u00a0van load of children from a special unit who also attended with their teacher. My son took to his horse surprisingly quickly, and over the school term he has built a rather special relationship with this one horse he rides each time. He loves making the horse happy and getting to help look after it; it\u2019s almost like having a really big pet that someone else looks after for him. The volunteers who help him ride the horse and take part in the activities during his sessions, have got to know my son quite well too. They always have a smile for him, and love seeing him succeed and try new things as much as I do. The activities my son takes part in serve a number of therapeutic vales and functions. For him particularly, the rides are building his balance, coordination,\u00a0and core strength, but the list of benefits for him and others  is long and significant . It took me a while to appreciate those potential benefits, but it took me hardly anytime at all to see the unexpected benefits for me as his mother attending each session alongside him. There is something really quite unique and very special, to travel a bit out of town\u00a0each week to a\u00a0landscape of gently rolling fields, fresh air, and a quiet that is\u00a0occasionally interrupted by the\u00a0whinnies\u00a0of these huge and yet remarkably gentle beasts. It is my escape \u2013 I ignore my phone, I sit and read a book, I look out over the land, and when I feel the need for a little socialising I approach a fellow parent or teacher for a chat. But none of us impose on each other; we all seem to have an innate respect for the fact that sometimes people in lives like ours just need some space to breathe and to simply \u201cbe.\u201d I\u2019ve also formed a fondness for the horse my son rides. I look out for the horse when we arrive and it always makes me smile to spot him. I feel like the horse is looking after my son during the session. Even though I have never had the privilege of touching the horse, I feel close to him, he\u2019s become special to me as well as to my son. I know there will come a time when my son and his horse must part, but thankfully we\u2019ve recently been told they have at least another term together.\u00a0The waiting list for the therapy is a long one, and once you\u2019ve experienced it and caught a glimpse of its benefits for all involved \u2013 the student, the parent, the volunteers \u2013 you see why it\u2019s in such high demand, and why people are so reluctant to give up their space. I personally got to see the life-long impact the experience can have at a recent session, where I got to meet a well-spoken, polite and friendly young man who is now a volunteer, but was once himself a rider. Seeing his smile, seeing the respect and welcome the other volunteers showed him, said so much about these people and the program itself. So yes, once a week my eldest son attends \u201cRiding for the Disabled,\u201d where he gets to ride a horse for an hour during school time, and I get to say he\u2019s doing therapy, but that description of the experience barely scratches the surface of the value it offers both him and me. Yes, we sat on that waiting list for a year, but it was worth the wait. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rda.org.nz/index.html", "https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/dscn2037.jpg", "http://www.rda.org.nz/benefits.htm"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/riding-for-the-disabled-a-mothers-perspective/", "title": "Riding For The Disabled; A Mother\u2019s\u00a0Perspective."},
{"date": "April 2, 2015", "body": "It\u2019s World Autism Awareness Day (\u201cWAAD\u201d). I\u2019m meant to be writing an insightful, amusing, or challenging blog post for you; I am, after-all, an autism blogger. At the very least, I\u2019m meant to have written you that follow-up post about how awesome the new school turned out to be after that last school discriminated against my children. But in families like mine, life rarely goes as planned, and that means for me that my blogging escapades will swing off in unexpected directions alongside my life. That unexpected swing I\u2019m coping with today \u2013 ever so well-timed for WAAD \u2013 is the confirmed autism diagnosis of my second child. That\u2019s pretty big stuff for us \u2013 we expected it of course, and have done so for a long time, but the confirmed diagnosis from an expert in the field, matters a lot, and still hit me pretty hard. I think it\u2019s fair to say that it hit me as hard as it did though, because it came alongside a diagnosis for ADHD and dyspraxia too. So my son got three diagnoses in one day. I know little about the other two diagnoses, so I now begin an entire new learning curve, as I must and as I should. This \u2013 plus various ongoing school challenges \u2013 mean I haven\u2019t had the time I should for blogging, but it does mean I am put in the position to have a brief but important message for you this WAAD: This day, keep in mind the parents who have only just found out their child is on the spectrum, and who know so very little about what that means. Take the opportunity to share messages of hope, celebrations of diversity, and acceptance; we get 364 days each year to worry and be overwhelmed, misunderstood, rejected and treated like second-class families, how about we try to turn this day into something positive. Let newly diagnosed families know that they are not alone, that yes autism is a lot to cope with but it\u2019s not the end of the Earth, and that the child they loved yesterday is the same child they love today, just with a new word in their life that is there to help them understand their child better. Let\u2019s try to share the positive posts, the hopeful memes, the enlightening messages, instead of the doom-and-gloom that will scare and depress the new families joining our ranks. Let\u2019s encourage the love and acceptance, that we want others to show towards our children as adults; autism is a diagnosis given to a person, they don\u2019t stop being a person \u2013 with feelings, and rights \u2013 just because of the diagnosis. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/and-then-there-were-two/", "title": "And then there were\u00a0two."},
{"date": "August 23, 2016", "body": "If you want some insight on how children with special needs are valued and cared for (or rather, not valued nor cared for) within the New Zealand education system, I suggest you start by looking at two specific groups of people who carry a lot of the responsibility for meeting these children\u2019s needs, particularly within mainstream schools: Teacher aides, and SENCOs. Teacher aides are the people brought in by a school to assist a teacher in the care and teaching of a child with special needs, and a SENCO is a school\u2019s Special Educational Needs Coordinator \u2013 the person within a school who oversees and assists in the implementation of special needs services for these children. Let\u2019s start with teacher aides. This vital, hands-on role, can be taken up by anyone the school chooses; they don\u2019t have to have any special training, or take on any training once they have the role. I\u2019ve interacted with some aides who have no idea what the challenges of autism are, even though they\u2019ve been brought in to deal with an autistic child. Many times, I\u2019ve had to sit down with a teacher aide myself to try to help them to understand my child\u2019s needs and how to meet them, because the school has not explained what is required of them before they start working with my child, and the aide has no relevant training or experience before beginning the role. I\u2019ve also had dealing with teacher aides who are very clearly not suitable for the role. One example is a particularly overweight aide who had regular breathing difficulties, who was charged with keeping up with my extremely active youngest son during play times. She was required to stay with him, keep him safe, and help him with the playground equipment. She couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t keep up with him; he ran off school grounds under her watch \u2013 across a busy road. She had been newly employed for the role, with the school knowing my son was a run-risk. This shouldn\u2019t have happened, it\u2019s like the school didn\u2019t take the role and responsibility of a teacher aide seriously (and I feel sympathy for the teacher aide being put in this position too). Teacher aides are notoriously underpaid, and so it\u2019s not surprising that there is very high turnover in these positions, creating extra work for the school and the classroom teacher each time a new aide is required, and extra stress for the child each time they have to get used to a new adult in the classroom who has high levels of interaction with them. Job security for teacher aides is nearly non-existent, for example my youngest son\u2019s aides only find out each term if they will be required back for work a week or two before the next term begins, which can create significant financial stress for them and their families \u2013 again, it\u2019s not hard to see why there is huge turnover in these roles. I know my sons\u2019 schools have struggled to balance the timetables of the aides they have in, so that only one of my sons receives the aide at the time of the day when they both need help the most; I have been involved in lengthy discussions about how to share out teacher aide timetables so that my most needy son gets the help during that time slot. This is ridiculous. The point of having an aide is to provide help when it is most needed for that child \u2013 schools shouldn\u2019t be delicately trying to balance timetables to make the most of the person they\u2019ve been able to convince to take on the role for that term. The fact that these discussions happen at all shows how broken the system is. There are also never enough funded teacher aide hours with a mainstream school. Schools are used to accepting extra payments from those parents who can afford it, and seeing children leave the roll for those parents who can\u2019t afford it. The Ministry of Education insists parents should never be paying for teacher aides themselves, yet they never supply enough funding for the school to manage it. It\u2019s a farcical situation in a system that claims it provides free public education for all children, where families of children with special needs aren\u2019t provided with the help required to let them attend school alongside their peers. So much for teacher aides then; underpaid, almost always untrained, and lacking job-security, yet expected to fulfill a key daily support role for a child with special needs. On to SENCOs. SENCOs aren\u2019t even compulsory for a school, despite their very important role in helping parents and children to access services and make sure those services get provided. Some schools proudly advertise the fact that they even have a SENCO available. SENCOs are usually teachers or support staff within a school, who take on the extra work of the role alongside their existing school duties. Like teacher aides, SENCOs aren\u2019t required to take on any training, and it\u2019s seen as a rare and positive thing when they choose to do so. Also like teacher aides, SENCOs can have a high turnover rate, but for a different reason. SENCOs high turnover rate can be due to the extra stress and time required by the role. Some teachers step up to the position, having no idea what they\u2019ve gotten themselves into, and step down for the next person to give it a go. Each time that change in personnel happens, it\u2019s extra stress and confusion for the family and the Ministry of Education contacts who deal with the SENCO, as they all reestablish where the child\u2019s supports are and rebuild this important relationship. In the year so far, my children\u2019s school SENCO has changed three times already, and this has very clearly and strongly impacted on my ability to get my son the in-school help he desperately needs, for example we\u2019ve had to put off and reconsider making a major support-funding application due to not having an experienced SENCO on-hand to head the process. The way SENCOs and teacher aides are viewed and treated by the Ministry of Education, sends me a very clear message: My children are not priorities for them. The safety, learning, and happiness of my kids, is not considered important enough to require and supply adequate training and payment for those who work with them on a daily basis. The daily reality of these two important roles within the school, are symptomatic of a broken system that is in serious need to an overhaul It took me a while to realise that the tensions and upsets I had with various teacher aides and SENCOs, was hardly ever their own fault; these people were just doing the best they can within a framework that doesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t respect them. It\u2019s important that we do what we can to understand where the problem comes from when parents and school staff are under so much stress \u2013 instead of staff getting angry and distressed that they can\u2019t cope with our kids, and parents getting distraught and mad that schools are failing our children and not doing enough to help them succeed, we need to understand that the problem stems from the system itself. We need to put pressure on those in charge to make the necessary changes, for the benefit of everyone; for the school staff, for the parents, but most importantly, for the children whose lives are affected by this every single day. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/teacher-aides-and-sencos-in-new-zealand-schools-symptoms-of-a-broken-system/", "title": "Teacher Aides and SENCOs in New Zealand Schools; symptoms of a broken\u00a0system."},
{"date": "July 30, 2016", "body": "I\u2019ve been a very quiet blogger lately, quiet enough that you may have suspected I\u2019d quit blogging. Hell, even I suspected I\u2019d quit blogging. I\u2019d started a new career, been published, moved house, got two new insanely adorable kittens, and was busy raising two rather challenging children. So what has pulled me back? An old issue that seems to just keep getting worse: The invalidation of people\u2019s experiences of autism if they don\u2019t exactly match other people\u2019s preferred terminology and agenda. (The most recent example of the issue that I\u2019ve encountered, is expressed  in this post , but it\u2019s the further discussion of that post on social media that exemplified the issue for me.) It\u2019s as if there is a singular approved version of what you\u2019re allowed to share, and what words you\u2019re allowed to share it in. Any variation from approved language and message, gets attacked loudly and righteously,  not because what the person said wasn\u2019t true or wasn\u2019t genuine , but because it didn\u2019t match those other people\u2019s ideas of what is acceptable when talking about autism. Somehow along the way, these attackers came to believe that  the way  someone shares their own personal experience, is more important and noteworthy than the experience itself. I find this bizarre and disturbing, and frankly, I find it lazy and nasty on behalf of the attackers. It\u2019s bizarre, because we should want people to find understanding and support if they are finding it hard to understand and live with autism or an autistic individual; not shut them down and force them to keep quiet until they learn others\u2019 preferred language and terminology. Is this not particularly bizarre when it comes from the exact same people who talk about how important it is to accept different and new forms of communication from those who struggle to talk at all? Is it genuine when someone says in one breath \u201cwe must accept the efforts of people to communicate in whatever form that takes\u201d and in the next breath \u201cbut those people over there used the wrong words or were off message so we need to shut their voices down\u201d? It\u2019s disturbing, because it\u2019s a type of censorship, not just of the voices, but of the experiences shared by those voices. These attackers seem to desire a sanitized and controlled view of autism, where only the stories that match their narrative deserve a audience, and those that don\u2019t are destined to get buried in attacks about language and hidden agendas they\u2019ve built into someone else\u2019s tale. Lazy, because it\u2019s so easy to attack language and restructure everything you read into being about your preferred topic (abelism, murder of the disabled, etc), rather than engage with the substance of what someone is sharing. It is far more challenging \u2013 and valuable \u2013 to try to really take in what the writer is sharing and to respond to their experiences in a helpful or compassionate way. It is nasty, because the attackers are frustrating the heart-felt efforts of someone to share their life, their emotions, their reality. They are denying the value of the writer\u2019s experience, in favour of attacking terminology and agendas that aren\u2019t even there. It\u2019s OK that not every story about autism is told from the perspective of the autistic individual; parents and carers have voices \u2013 and experiences \u2013 too. The sharing of those experiences and perspectives  does not invalidate  the experiences of the autistic individual. They sit alongside it. They are part of the full story. In fact, it would arguably be disingenuous is they claimed to be telling the story completely from the perspective of their non-verbal child. If the only alternative you give them is to not share their story at all, how is that a reasonable stance to take? It\u2019s OK if someone doesn\u2019t know \u2013 or doesn\u2019t want to use \u2013 other people\u2019s preferred terminology. Terminology is constantly being debated, fought over, redefined and given new and often conflicting subtext, so it\u2019s arrogant and unhelpful to tell someone the words they\u2019ve chosen to share their story means the story shouldn\u2019t be heard. As a final point, it is particularly arrogant to redefine and restructure someone else\u2019s lived experience into your own narrative; to decide that someone\u2019s story is actually about your latest pet issue. To turn someone\u2019s honest story that is told free of any agenda other than to share, into an instance of some insidious plot that you see lurking in every corner. An individual\u2019s experiences and voice, don\u2019t require approval by those who see themselves as the gatekeepers of the autism narrative. If the experience is honest, if the voice is genuine, then it should not be shut down. Sure you can challenge it, question it, suggest another perspective if you like, and \u2013 here\u2019s a thought \u2013 consider offering compassion and support in preference to lectures about language. I feel the need to end with a photo of my kitties. Because they are part of  my  story, and  my  experience, and\u2026 screw it, I don\u2019t need an excuse. KITTENS!

{"date": "April 11, 2015", "body": "It was no easy task finding my children a new school. I researched our options carefully, and chose my local top preference. The visit to that potential new school went worse than I could have imagined \u2013 the principal told me she was a friend of the principal at the school my children were leaving, and that I had to go make it work back there. I told her I\u2019d already made the decision to remove my children from that school and was searching for a new one; but she insisted I stick to their old \u201clocal\u201d school, even though hers was literally just a few more minutes down the road from home. I outright asked her \u201care you saying you\u2019d refuse to enrol my children at your school?\u201d, knowing full well she was legally obligated to enrol my children if I chose the school since it was a public one we were entitled to attend. She told me she wasn\u2019t allowed to say that. She\u2019s right, but she\u2019d made her point: your kids are not welcome here. She knew they had special needs, and her deputy principal had already told me that she couldn\u2019t promise that the school wouldn\u2019t stop my child attending full days like the old school did, even though I knew that stance was illegal too.\u00a0 The utter irony that the principal told me I had to send my child to their \u201clocal\u201d school, but that by her treatment towards us I\u2019ve ended up with my children attending a school that means I have to drive them 40 minutes through rush hour traffic every morning.\u00a0 I both hate and love the new school my children now attend. I chose it because the principal has a strong background in and understanding of children with special needs, but more specifically I even considered it in the first place because it was the school I went to as a child so I knew my children would absolutely be wanted and accepted there. It\u2019s a private school, which we can\u2019t afford, but my parents agreed to pay the fees. We still have to pay all those other private costs which are very far in excess of anything I could have imagined when I initially enrolled them. I chose it as well thinking the playground situation would be perfect for my youngest son who loves trees and nature and freedom, but only later I found out the children are only allowed to use the concrete playground within the park \u2013 they\u2019re not allowed to play with the trees and rolling hills and nature that I had access to there as a child. Add to this the ridiculous daily commute in and out, the 5:30am start to my day just to be ready to leave on time, and the horrible parking situations where I often end up having to pay just to be able to pick up my kids and have time to talk to their teachers, and you\u2019ll get some idea of why I\u2019m hating our new daily routine. Every day is exhausting and stressful, and regular meetings are expensive and difficult to attend. Still, the teachers are fantastic, the supports are impressive, and they have worked very hard on making it possible for my children to attend full school days. There is absolutely no doubt my kids are wanted there, are much happier there, and are learning much more than they ever did at their old school. If I could be sure all those positives could be replicated at a public and closer school, I\u2019d have had my kids there in an instant (despite the horror of a third school transition in just a few months). I still struggle every single day with my decision \u2013 I am secure in my decision to remove them from the first school, and not to send them to the other local school we visited, but I didn\u2019t feel completely comfortable with their new school. And then things got worse. My youngest son was receiving 5 hours a day teacher aide support at his new school, and it was clearly needed. The Ministy of Education has, in its infinite wisdom, now decided to cut that to 2 hours day. This, despite my son having autism, ADHD, and dyspraxia. This, despite my son being a run-risk and not actively engaged in school lessons unless he has dedicated one-on-one support. The services manager at the Ministry told me it would be fine for my son to just sit and play to the side in the classroom. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve given up on son\u2019s ability and right to learn at school. She said that because he\u2019s not hurting other children in the classroom, that he\u2019s not considered to be in their higher funding pool (we\u2019re talking 3 hours versus 2 hours a day here). The 5 hours was only temporary, despite what a huge difference it was making to him and for the classroom teacher. I\u2019ve been told he\u2019s highly unlikely to qualify for the top funding pool called ORS \u00a0(which his older brother gets), and though I\u2019ve requested about three times now that his Ministry support contact person look into starting the application process anyway, there have been no steps taken in that direction.\u00a0 I\u2019m entitled to keep my youngest son at home because he\u2019s not 6 years old and therefore not required to be enrolled at school yet in legal terms. He is clearly smart enough to be at school and learning what everyone else learns though, so if I kept him home I\u2019d be doing a version of homeschooling, which may have to eventually turn into official homeschooling if he reaches 6 years old and is still not entitled to adequate classroom supports through the Ministry. The Ministry contact person\u2019s official view is I shouldn\u2019t pull my son out of school because of the fact he\u2019s already gone through some transitioning. But transitioning concerns cannot and do not outweigh serious concerns about his safety, happiness and basic ability to learn in a classroom, and I told her so. I will not drop my son off at school each day so he can sit in the corner for most of everyday, when he could be home with me happy, safe, and learning. If they continue to refuse to provide him adequate support, I have to and will keep him home. So what does the school itself think about all this? Well, they\u2019re dedicated to giving it their best shot, no matter what level of support he gets. They never once said they\u2019d send him home half way through everyday like the other two public schools were happy to do. They\u2019re going to work on ways to make sure he\u2019s OK and actually learning , even though they\u2019re fully aware of what a handful he\u2019ll be for them. That\u2019s the difference between your kids being wanted at a school, and not being wanted \u2013 even when the Ministry is willing to remove fundamental necessary supports and give up on my son learning in the classroom, the school isn\u2019t. The school staff have made it absolutely clear they are going to fight alongside me to get those supports, so at least I\u2019m not up against both a school and the Ministry this time around \u2013 the school is on my side where it belongs. Different school, same Ministry. That\u2019s where things stand now. It\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s uncertain, it\u2019s all hard work. I can tell you that my older son is now doing well though; he gets good and appropriate supports and my communication with his teacher and the school SENCO is open, good, and productive, which is worlds away from the horror at the first school. Have to take your upsides where you can, I just wish there were more of them to share with you at this time. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/04/11/new-school-same-ministry/", "title": "New School; Same\u00a0Ministry."},
{"date": "February 21, 2014", "body": "Today a reader of my blog asked if I\u2019d read a  recent article written by Rachel Smalley, up on the Newstalk ZB website . The reader was not happy about what she read there, and having read it myself I also feel the article needs a public reply. There is just so much wrong with the way Smalley frames the debate she is looking at, that it is hard to know where to start, so I might as well begin at the beginning. Bu Via Tsuji, via Flickr Smalley\u2019s article starts off with the  recent example of the child with Aspergers and dyslexia , who had been expelled from school because of an incident with a skateboard. She uses this example to launch into the question of whether it is a good idea to mainstream children with special needs. She uses two examples to frame the debate: One where an autistic child was changed enough to be just like their peers at kindergarten and therefore was successfully integrated into mainstreaming, and another example where an autistic child was so demanding and difficult that a teacher quit her job and the children in the class suffered. Her concluding remark is we need to rethink mainstreaming special needs children. From the very start, she takes the view that two worlds \u2013 the one of normal children and the one of children who don\u2019t fit the norm \u2013 are naturally separate and will enter conflict when you bring them together: \u201c Worlds can collide when you merge children with special needs into the mainstream education system .\u201d\u00a0This is a sadly loaded statement, one that presumes these two groups of children don\u2019t fit or belong together at the outset. The fact is people with disabilities and differences are in every community together, in shops and on streets, in families, playgrounds, work-places and in doctors\u2019 offices; everywhere. The idea that they belong together should be the starting point of any discussion, surely, rather than the view-point that the current division is somehow natural and that change to the status quo of divison is what needs justification. The two examples Smalley uses to form the basis of her view that \u201c sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t ,\u201d are written up in such a way that is fundamentally distorting and really quite upsetting. Yet I honestly think Smalley has no awareness of what is so wrong with how she makes her points, so I\u2019ll try to explain what is wrong with her examples. First, the example of a child who learnt to fit in: She describes an autistic preschool child, who was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d because \u201c [h]e didn\u2019t socialise, he sat on a chair, he rocked back and forth, and he slept where he fell .\u201d If that is a description of dysfunctional, then I can tell you that parenting is frequently a dysfunctional experience. I know what she\u2019s trying to describe and how much it can matter though, so I\u2019ll give her that much, but the way she expressed herself that really upset me was this: \u201c He is now a fabulous, functioning little boy who\u2019s social and interactive. You would never know he\u2019s autistic. \u201d Ouch. He\u2019s fabulous now but he wasn\u2019t before, and all because you can\u2019t tell he\u2019s autistic anymore? It\u2019s clear that Smalley has a very limited understanding of the complexity and varieties of autism, and she appears to have a very negative view towards autistics. Let\u2019s move on to the second example though, because her opinions don\u2019t get better as we go along. The second example is a high needs autistic child that had \u201cdreadful behavior,\u201d she says it was a \u201cnightmare.\u201d A nightmare  for whom  you may ask. It\u2019s abundantly clear she hasn\u2019t considered who is really in hell here, and why. The child would scream and yell and be violent she says, and goes on to give examples where it\u2019s obvious the child wasn\u2019t receiving adequate classroom support and supervision, though she doesn\u2019t seem to pick up on that vital point. The child clearly wasn\u2019t being adequately prepared for changes in routine, wasn\u2019t being supported with coping strategies when things went wrong, was clearly under huge amounts of stress and deeply distraught, but Smalley\u2019s conclusion is \u201c you had 22 mainstream children whose education for a year was disrupted and adapted to appease the needs of one special needs child .\u201d Instead of arguing for better classroom supports, better understanding and training for teachers, a more adaptive and sensitive classroom situation, a more tailored response to a deeply distraught child, her conclusion is we need to rethink mainstreaming. I find that astounding. She takes a situation where a child is being seriously let down by the mainstream classroom, and instead of insisting for change to the classroom to be a better environment, she thinks it shows that mainstreaming can\u2019t work for these children. It\u2019s almost bizarre, but it is predictable considering the tone of the rest of the article. In all of that though, there is another major point that I think she is overlooking: The autistic child is not choosing to act poorly, when autistic children act out that strongly they are typically in deep distress outside of their control. Here is the crux of the matter then, for me: What she \u2013 and many members of the public \u2013 don\u2019t like, is bad behaviour that disrupts others learning. I get that. But you know what: bad behaviour that disrupts learning is not exclusively in the realm of those with special needs. Plenty of \u201cnormal\u201d kids do it too, but we don\u2019t say \u201csee that kid with the brown hair / brown skin / etc, well they have bad behaviour and so I think we need to question whether everyone with brown hair / brown skin (etc) belongs in the classroom.\u201d What we do instead (what we should always be doing) is treat people like individuals: we look at why they are doing the bad behaviour \u2013 is it reacting to someone or something that we can change, that we can improve, that we can remove \u2013 before we decide the only answer is exclusion. This investigation into what can be done to improve the behavioural problem, is more complicated when it involves those with special needs, because you need a general understanding of the child\u2019s condition to make a meaningful enquiry into the cause and appropriate response to the behaviour. But just because it requires more thought and even possibly more work to find a solution, does not mean it is not worth doing or is impossible to do. It\u2019s exactly that sort of attitude \u2013 that lack of consideration of the relevance of the condition and lack of flexible problem-solving \u2013 which has led to the recent court case of the excluded child with Aspergers and dyslexia. And yet Smalley uses that court case as an instance in favour of her argument that sometimes mainstreaming just doesn\u2019t work. The details of the case that have come out so far simply do not support her using this as an example of bad behaviour that argues towards questioning the mainstreaming of special needs children. In fact, to me, it adds insult to use this poor teenager\u2019s situation to argue for the exclusion of others. As a final point to all this, I don\u2019t think Smalley \u2013 or the public more generally \u2013 have an accurate understanding of how schooling is done in New Zealand for children with special needs. She says: \u201c Is the merging of special needs children into mainstream education giving every child the best possible education? Sure, it saves money, but every child has a right to learn in a safe and nurturing environment that\u2019s tailored to their needs. \u201d I\u2019m not sure what she thinks is going on \u2013 special needs children are not all being shifted into mainstream schools, not by a long shot. There are still special schools and no aim by the government to remove or shut them down right now. There are still a huge number of options for children, tailored to their needs, from special schools to satellite units, to residential schools and wrap-around support, teacher aides within mainstream classrooms, and so many other ways that education is made to be flexible to diversity. Are there some who want to shut down special schools? Sure, but it\u2019s not happening right now. Are there children for whom no suitable education option currently exists? Of course there are, that\u2019s why many of us fight to make education more inclusive and responsive to the true variety of humanity. And part of that journey \u2013 that improvement of education all round \u2013 is making sure that mainstream schools are improving their practices so that special needs students can take their place in the community alongside their peers. I am of the unambiguous and firm opinion that a school which is adapting its practices and attitudes to be more accommodating to special needs children, is a school that is better for  all  students that attend. There is no firm dividing line between who has special needs and who doesn\u2019t, an education system which accepts and welcomes diversity is also going to be better for the gifted students, ethnically diverse students, and anyone else who doesn\u2019t fit some mould of the \u201cusual.\u201d It will also cope better when discipline and behavioural problems arise, which are hardly the sole realm of the disabled. We haven\u2019t completed that journey towards a great education system yet. When we do \u2013 when our schools are adaptive and responsive and welcoming and well-run \u2013 we will also have schools that successfully integrate the majority of special needs children within the classroom. But we\u2019re not going to get there by deciding in advance that these children don\u2019t belong in mainstream classrooms. And we\u2019re definitely not going to get there by thinking the problems all lie within special needs children and not with lack of support and understanding within the classroom and school. And we sure as heck are not going to get there by scare-mongering with the notion that all special needs children are currently being pushed into mainstream classrooms, because that simply is not happening right now anyway (even though it arguably should be). Any debate about what we should be doing around mainstreaming and special needs children, must be had with an accurate eye to what is actually going on within the education sector, I don\u2019t think an informed debate can happen otherwise. I don\u2019t think Smalley means harm, even though her article does harm. I don\u2019t think she set out to misconstrue reality, I just think she did inadequate research into autism, special needs, and the state of the current education system. I would like to think that when we engage in the debate that she calls for \u2013 about mainstreaming and special needs children \u2013 that people like her will hear our arguments and realise that moving towards inclusion really is in the best interests of all students; that our children are not a threat, they are an opportunity for everyone\u2019s betterment. That there is nothing inherently impossible about integrating our classrooms to better reflect societal reality; the disabled, the different, the differently-abled, are all around us anyway, they are part of our world and deserve to be. We can recognise that some students may never fit well into a mainstream classroom, but we need to know and make sure that the reason they don\u2019t fit in is not simply because we gave up on the disabled. We need to be sure that when a child is excluded from a school, it really is because it was the best and only decision left, rather than the current situation where our kids are so often not even allowed in the front door. We need to reply to pieces like that written by Smalley, and we can only hope we are listened to with the same open-mindedness, patience and willingness to learn, that we hope to get from mainstream schools someday too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/shows/earlyedition/highlights/rachel-smalley-20feb2014", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/53881030@N00/5335847935/in/photolist-98vBGc-b4yB12-fK5SZA-9GSehf-9C32M9-fJNkq8-7JF5xM-anso53-anszZh-anpyiK-ansnHq-anpLJV-anpL2i-ansnWW-ansAcq-9qsyaQ-dUybRv-8e3P6n-9qezKu-dKfH9L-dyPmQY-d5Knfq-9LTB6u-7Xb3LX-c7pqWJ-dQobYH-anjL25-9LQPbT-dQxEKA-gkFmxp-drDAKP-dc33kb-aatpLJ-8e76eb-9eXLpx-aoVKbt-9PzgLJ-aSXRKF-9f1Vb1-dQqSSP-8QnCch-9uh7xS-b4yzxB-aV6Dra-9emZJt-bLmsRX-dtZFhS-7DFjQt", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11205654"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/what-rachel-smalley-and-the-public-doesnt-understand-about-mainstreaming-special-needs-children/", "title": "What Rachel Smalley, and the public, doesn\u2019t understand about mainstreaming special needs\u00a0children."},
{"date": "July 6, 2015", "body": "Who is responsible for funding teacher aides? Free-use image The Ministry of Education here in New Zealand, claims they provide adequate funding and support for children with special needs, and\u00a0so  parents  shouldn\u2019t be paying for teacher aide hours. The schools say they don\u2019t receive enough targeted funding and have to\u00a0take the money from other funding pools, and end up accepting money from parents to pay teacher aides. The parents can endlessly fill out forms, attend meetings, take phone calls, and deal with\u00a0emails with both Ministry and school staff, that go nowhere \u2013\u00a0leaving them in the position of either fronting the money for aides\u00a0themselves, or having their child excluded from school because the school can\u2019t or won\u2019t let the child attend without one-on-one support. The answer to who is meant to be funding the aides, is a simple one, both by policy and by law: The Ministry of Education. They provide schools with funding, and it is the Ministry\u2019s responsibility to meet its national and international obligations to allow children with special needs to be included within the schooling system. The funding they provide to schools and families is not enough \u2013\u00a0that\u2019s not debatable. I have been in the situation myself since the start of the year, that the Ministry out-right refuses to grant\u00a0adequate funded-hours to allow my son to be safe and able to learn at school. I have filled out their forms, jumped through their hoops; there are no Ministry-sanctioned options left to me \u2013 they are refusing the required funding. The school, my son, and my family, are suffering because of their refusal. I am far from alone in this situation; not only do I personally know\u00a0other people in this situation, but the New Zealand Herald is currently doing articles ( here , and  here )\u00a0on this wide-spread reality. The Ministry says parents shouldn\u2019t be doing this \u2013 paying for teacher aides themselves \u2013 but it\u2019s happening nonetheless. They  know  it is happening. Schools  know  it is happening. It is laughable that the Ministry has told the New Zealand Herald that parents should talk to\u00a0the Ministry\u00a0about sorting these situations out rather than paying for aides, when the Ministry itself is the  reason  parents and schools are in this situation. No parent wants to be put in this financial position \u2013 paying huge amounts just so their child can simply access the education system that is meant to be freely available to all New Zealand children \u2013\u00a0and no parent should be put in this situation. But here we are, and everyone is paying the price. Even parents of children without special needs \u2013 you are paying the price too in so many ways; if our children with special-needs are given adequate in-class support, it would make life easier for the teachers of your children, and for your children as class-mates. Everyone wins if this is done the way it should be. You too should be out-raged that the Ministry is claiming there is enough funding and support, because it is only the wealthiest families who can meet the\u00a0true short-fall \u2013\u00a0so unless the children in your child\u2019s class are all very well-off and are paying for a service they shouldn\u2019t have to be, your kids may be directly affected too. And before I have to\u00a0deal with the classic reply \u2013 \u00a0if   your child needs that much support, they should be in a special school \u2013 \u00a0let\u2019s be very clear: It is  hard  to get into a special school. I have tried all year for my youngest child to qualify, but he has been denied the Ministry funding required to allow his attendance (\u201cORS\u201d funding). The Ministry does not agree that is where he belongs \u2013 they have declined our ORS application. We are stuck in mainstream, with utterly inadequate support. The support we get is inadequate in everyone\u2019s opinion who deals with my son on a daily basis \u2013 including his first school who  illegally  sent him home whenever he didn\u2019t have a dedicated teacher aide. And you know what the Ministry did about that illegality? Nothing. They had an employee in the meeting where the principal said my son would not be allowed at school without an aide, and she just nodded along with the school staff in the room. I complained to her superior about her lack of support, she took my call and noted my concerns, saying she\u2019d call me back. She never did. They cover each other\u2019s backsides, the Ministry looks out for the Ministry, not for the people it is meant to be serving. I must add this important point here too: Our children have the capacity to be part of the mainstream schooling system, when they have adequate supports. More than that, they have the  right  to be part of it. I feel like shouting sometimes, shaking some sense into by-standers\u00a0\u2013 how can the government and the wider society not see the wasted potential here? How can they not understand that adequately supporting our children during their school years will pay off hugely when they reach adult-hood? That looking after our kids also allows us parents as potential workers, to return to being productive in the work-force? Why, when we share our stories, are we met with \u201cgo take your child to a special school\u201d or \u201cyour kid is ruining my kid\u2019s chance to learn in class,\u201d instead of other parents standing shoulder-to-shoulder with us, fighting alongside us as fellow citizens whose rights are being trampled while the Ministry keeps pretending this isn\u2019t happening and insisting they provide adequate funding when everything shows otherwise? I suppose they think it\u2019s easier to have our children out of schools \u2013\u00a0and at an extremely short-sighted and superficial level, it  is  easier for schools and the Ministry to have us out of sight and out of mind. But the reality of that attitude \u2013 the real impact of it on society in general, and on the children raised in these artificially sanitised environments \u2013\u00a0is deep and nasty. And it doesn\u2019t take much to see the parallels with other \u201cunwanted\u201d people of history \u2013 people of a certain colour, or religion, or gender. They didn\u2019t take it quietly, and neither should we. I want to end by making it clear that I\u2019m not of the belief that teacher aides are the be-all-end-all of in-class supports \u2013 inadequately funding them is not the only problem our special education system faces, and neither would adequate funding of teacher aides solve all our problems. However, they are a vital piece of the support system, even more so when we continue to create classroom teachers with woefully inadequate knowledge and training on how to help children with special needs flourish in the classroom. For me \u2013 and for many others \u2013 the inadequate funding of teacher aides and the attitude of the Ministry of Education towards this problem, is highly symptomatic of the wider and deeper issues at play in our special education system: Lack of funds; lack of support; inadequate training of teachers; passing the buck; turning a blind-eye to the reality families and children face. Lots of things need to change, adequate funding of teacher aides is a good starting point. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/early_childhood_education.jpg", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11476238", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11476488"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/07/06/funding-teacher-aides/", "title": "Funding Teacher Aides"},
{"date": "May 20, 2015", "body": "There are a lot of counterintuitive claims that you\u2019ll encounter in the autism community. Claims that will throw you and think the people making the claims are in denial, running some sort of hidden agenda, lacking perspective, or all of the above. For example, the claim that autism is simply \u201cdifference\u201d rather than disability (or that it is actually a gift), or that the causes of disability are societal rather than medical, or that every autistic child can and should be mainstreamed. The one I\u2019m going to deal with today, also falls in this counterintuitive category: The claim that is is harder to raise a child who is mildly affected by autism compared to a child severely affected by autism. As a mother who has two children on the spectrum \u2013 one who was once severely impacted by autism and in a special school, and one who was so mildly impacted that I used to be very sure he wasn\u2019t autistic \u2013 I\u2019ve had some relevant experience here, that I want to share. What I want to say though goes beyond a simply personal view; I want to share how this question ties into the broader concept of happiness. Raising both my sons has been hard, but for rather different reasons. Why might someone claim it is harder to raise the mildly autistic child? I\u2019ve seen people point out before the obvious starting point here: It is easier to access supports and understanding from school and governments (and even strangers), when your child\u2019s issues are more severe. But the impact of that simple truth is much larger than I ever appreciated; for example, I spend weeks working on applications and forms that are highly unlikely to result in any assistance, and lack of supports from agencies and professionals mean I have to do all their roles myself so I can\u2019t get a job and I\u2019m forever exhausted. This is arguably too simplistic though \u2013 the work-load is huge even when you do have heaps of therapists and agencies on board for a more severely affected child, and the paperwork is endless even once you\u2019re in the system (though much less maddening since you get told \u201cyes\u201d more often than \u201cno\u201d). Another explanation you\u2019ll often come across is about the mental anguish experienced by those more mildly affected by autism; the hardship all-round in raising a child who is depressed because they are so keenly aware of their differences from their peers, in a way that a more severely affected child may be oblivious to. However, this again is somewhat too simplistic; I have seen the mental anguish and suffering of those who are more severely autistic too \u2013 frustration from inability to clearly communicate even basic needs with those around you, and to seek comfort for themselves when overwhelmed (for example). These may seem to be of a different quality of mental anguish than suicidal tendencies born of heightened awareness of your own social differences, but it\u2019s still misery and despair in the face of helplessness. I would not venture to claim one of those forms of despair is more essential or painful than the other (and don\u2019t get me started on the death rates \u2013 dying by your own hand or dying by another\u2019s, the first more likely to happen if you\u2019re more mildly affected and the second if you are severely affected \u2013 are both horrendous deaths; both tragic and avoidable, so let\u2019s not play the \u201cwhich death is worse\u201d game, at least not today.) For all that though, I feel that the real key to whether it is harder to raise a severely or mildly affected autistic child, lies in other factors that are so different person to person, as to make the entire line of enquiry rather pointless. Those other factors are to do \u2013 simplistically at least \u2013 with the happiness and personality of the carer themself. The first factor here, is what the carer went in with to the parenting role: How resilient is their personality, do they suffer from their own mental health issues; how well supported are they \u2013 do they have many friends, do family live near by; does their culture and religion accept or discriminate against the disabled; are they wealthy, etc. If considerations like this are in your favour, then no matter how severely your child may be impacted by autism, you may be thriving where someone with a very mildly affected child is crashing and burning. With so many diverse and important personal factors at play, you need a \u201ccontrol\u201d \u2013 for example, someone like me (and many of you of course) who is one person with all the same personal factors at play, but with children at different ends of the spectrum. Ask us which we find easier \u2013 you\u2019ll get a much more useful response that asking person X from a different culture, background, mental health, etc, whether they found it hard to raise their differently-impacted autistic child than person Y on the other side of the world with their different\u2026 everythings. However, I think there is one more crucial piece of the puzzle here, for which type of child is more difficult to raise. This final piece ties in to a certain extent with the personal factors I discussed above, but it also a consideration in its own right that I think sheds light on this entire question. It is the issue of happiness, and what makes us happy. A recent study I was reading about on the question of happiness, empathised the importance of expectations, in two key ways: (1) having hope and expecting good things makes us happier, and (2) having our expectations crushed make us less happy. You immediately see the conundrum \u2013 if you have high hopes you may be a happier person, but the higher the hopes the further you fall when they can\u2019t be met. So being upbeat but also realistic seems quite important here. When it comes then to raising an autistic child, you can see why all this would be really very vital to the experience of raising that child; this is where I think it may be helpful for me to draw on my own experience to make the point I am driving at here. When my first child was diagnosed with autism \u2013 the more severely affected child at the time \u2013 I was utterly devastated. I went into a very black hole, I was deeply depressed. My expectations for my son to have a good life \u2013 the life I had dreamed of for him \u2013 seemed to have been ripped away. I felt incredibly hopeless \u2013 busted expectations, no hope, equals utter misery, and an extremely difficult time raising my son on top of all the objective challenges. I adjusted; I came to understand autism, I found hope, and in turn I coped better with my huge workload of dealing with my son. He was incredibly hard work, but I was doing OK. On to my second son \u2013 the mildly affected one. Here, again, I faced a huge depression around coming to terms with the challenges he was facing every single day at school, where his autism and other conditions had become so clear. But the reasons for the depression were not fundamentally the same as before. The problem was again tied to hope and expectation, but not just hope and expectation for my child this time. I had found hope for myself as his first day of school had drawn near. I thought I would finally \u2013 after nine years of full-time care for his brother and then him \u2013 have the chance to be me again. To get a job, to reconnect with friends, to maybe even have a clean and tidy house because I\u2019d be free enough to have the time for that too. Such simple things, I really thought they could all be mine. Hopes that were soundly ripped away as I realised the school(s) couldn\u2019t cope with him, and that I was unable to access adequate supports to let him have a proper full-time school life. No job for me, no friends, no freedom, not even enough time to keep the house clean. Expectations crushed, hope gone, utter misery again. It takes time to adjust your expectations, to change your hopes to be more realistic. It takes time to find out how to be happy again. Some autism narratives call this time a period of \u201cgrieving\u201d for what you\u2019ve lost. I used to think of it in that way too, but now I think it is more accurate (and less confrontational) to call it a period of adjustment. Adjust your hopes, adjust your expectations \u2013 once those are back in order and you\u2019ve got your head around your child\u2019s and your own life again, you\u2019ll find some happiness again, and even the toughest challenges will be that much easier to face and work through. The point is this: How hard it is to raise an autistic child isn\u2019t ever as simple as counting off the challenges and their objective impact on you and the child you love (and it\u2019s not simple to compare and rate such challenges regardless). It\u2019s to do with the parent and the world they personally live in too \u2013 their personality, their history, their supports, their wealth, their culture, their expectations, their hope. Their happiness. Our children are individuals and are incredibly hard to compare, just as we parents are also individuals and are incredibly hard to compare. So is it more difficult to raise a severely or more mildly affected child with autism? Yes, yes it is. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/05/20/is-it-harder-to-raise-a-severely-or-mildly-autistic-child-yes/", "title": "Is it harder to raise a severely or mildly autistic child?\u00a0\u2026Yes."},
{"date": "February 20, 2015", "body": "There is  a story and radio interview out today  about a local\u00a0school \u2013 that goes unnamed \u2013 where disabled students are treated awfully and actively discouraged from enrolling. The school is a public school, and for some people in the region, the only public school for which they are zoned to attend. The fact that the school goes unnamed, was one I initially sympathised with \u2013 there are often many sides to a story, and one poor experience can over-shadow a wealth of far more successful ones. However, the more I reflected on the matter, and the more of the story that I came to understand, I realised how deeply misplaced that sympathy was. Free use image There is a clear and uncontested problem in this country with holding schools accountable for the ways \u2013 both subtle and outrageously unsubtle \u2013 that they exclude and discourage disabled students. Part of the problem with holding these schools accountable is apparently proving that the school has acted in this way \u2013 ie have discriminated against the disabled. However, as you\u2019ll find in the piece I\u2019ve linked to at the outset of this post, that is a problem with the system itself \u2013 the system of education reviews here appears to fall short of the robustness, insight, or power necessary to provide that proof. Without that official\u00a0accountability, it becomes particularly important that the rest of the public \u2013 those who are trying to choose a school for their children, and those who can in other ways hold the school publically accountable for its horrendous and backwards treatment of our kids \u2013 get to know the name of the school involved in such behaviour. It is no small decision when we choose a school for our children. We invest time and money in transitions, uniforms, relationship building, we may even choose to move house into or away from an area because\u00a0we\u2019re seeking what we think is a good school. In making that decision, we should also have the right to know whether the school we are choosing even wants us there,\u00a0or whether it will dedicate itself to our kids (and us) feeling unwanted until we reach the point of leaving, making room for the next victim on their roll. Anonymity in the current educational\u00a0climate, only helps the school to remain the way it is, and helps line up families unknowing of what sort of school environment they are exposing their child to. This goes for families of non-disabled children too \u2013 they too should be rejecting and fighting against the sort of school where discrimination is par for the course, where some children are deemed \u201ctoo hard\u201d to bother with, where school personnel and boards think they are above the law and feel they don\u2019t have to respect basic rights to education. I think too that the mere fact there are multiple good or successful stories coming out of a school, cannot and should not be treated as a reason to ignore or downplay the utter failures that occur. It is easy to look after many families in\u00a0schools\u00a0\u2013 the ones where families are intact, where children are particularly intelligent and meet milestones with little effort, where financial wealth means children are well-fed, clothed, and can attend class trips, etc \u2013 it is a lot more challenging and a better mark of the school, as to how well it deals with the children and families who don\u2019t meet these markers. To put it another way, if 99% of your students are not very disabled, and 1% are, is it really a valid defence to the complaints made by the 1% to say \u201cbut the school has lots of success stories from the 99%\u201d? Each serious complaint of misconduct by a school, deserves to be heard and dealt with \u2013 publically if need be \u2013 especially\u00a0considering the lack of accountability. Furthermore, our public schools, and an ever increasing number of our private schools, take tax payer money to provide education to the New Zealand public. Where they have failed to\u00a0provide that service because of discrimination or abuse of our disabled children, we have a right to know about it. That\u2019s our money they are choosing to misspend (or not spend at all) on our children, forcing us to put our children through multiple school or home address changes that we should never have had to go through. We should know about which schools are behaving in this way. We should demand answers. We should demand accountability. If the existing system won\u2019t give us that accountability \u2013 if they\u2019ll just keep taking our money, our time, our children\u2019s happiness because no one is making them face their disgraceful behaviour as an educational institution \u2013 then we stand up and speak out ourselves. The time for the silent painful shuffling of our kids from one discriminating school to the next, needs to be over. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/266590/disability-groups-want-tough-line-on-schools", "https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/taped-mouth.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/02/20/naming-and-shaming-schools-that-mistreat-the-disabled/", "title": "Naming and Shaming Schools that Mistreat the\u00a0Disabled"},
{"date": "December 22, 2014", "body": "On the 25th of February 2014 I sent an email to the President of the New Zealand School Trustees Association (NZSTA). This is the organisation here in New Zealand that advises and trains trustees, who in turn govern each of our schools. I am one such school trustee \u2013 for my sons\u2019 school \u2013 and our school (rather naturally) belongs to the NZSTA. I wrote to the NZSTA President with a recommendation about changes to a particular Section of the Education Act that lists the criteria all boards must take into account when selecting new trustees. That Section \u2013  S 99  \u2013 gives a list of considerations that include ethnic, social economic background, and gender balance, when deciding who to add to a school board. My simple suggestion to the President was that it would be a great addition to the list if school boards were also directed to consider adding trustees who have experiences or perspectives of those within the disability community, since such people are present in each school and are often the most vulnerable members of our school communities. I requested that she suggest boards take this into consideration when selecting trustees, and asked if she could petition the government to make the necessary changes to the legislation. A week went by with no reply, not even an acknowledgement of my email. So I wrote again, this time to another person who seemed relevant within the organisation (the General Manager of NZSTA), and forwarded them my original email, requesting if they could please follow up on why I\u2019d received no reply. I asked whether there is someone else in NZSTA I should be trying to contact about the issue. This man assured me the President was the correct person to talk to, and told me he\u2019d copied her in on our communication and that I\u2019d no doubt hear from her. That was in February. It is December. The President has never acknowledged my email, my suggestion, or replied to me in any other manner. However the man who assured me that the President would reply, did add in his own comment on the issue in his first (and only) message to me: He wanted to inform me that it was \u201c extremely unlikely that there would be any appetite for specifying legislatively how co-option slots must be used .\u201d This not only meant he hadn\u2019t understood my email (which at no point talked about forcing or requiring a board to take on people from the disability community), it also showed a lack of understanding that the legislation  already  mandates boards to consider ethnicity, gender, etc when co-opting new board members \u2013 all I was suggesting was adding one more consideration to an existing legislated list; there was nothing outrageous in what I was proposing, but it was nevertheless an important proposal I was making. I tried to explain this to him in a reply, but he never emailed me back to show he understood \u2013 that was the end of our communications too. Leaving me with a building sense of utter frustration. I was so frustrated at the lack of communication or action from NZSTA, that I recently decided to go directly to the people who make the law, instead of those who lobby and advise the lawmakers in this area. I wrote to the Minister for Disability Issues and the Minister for Education on the 19th of November. Again, I explained my simple (but important) suggestion about making boards take into account disability perspectives when choosing new board members. They immediately acknowledged my email, and assured me the Ministry of Education \u2013 who are responsible for this area of legislation \u2013 would get back to me with a fuller considered reply in time. On the 18th of December I received a very polite and respectful reply from the Ministry of Education. They thanked me for my suggestion. They assured me they would take my suggestion into consideration next time they were considering relevant legislation. Furthermore, they advised that they have (completely of their own account \u2013 I did not request or suggest this bit) raised my suggestion with the NZSTA, advising them to consider the issue when developing guidance to school boards around cooption and inclusive practices. The Ministry\u2019s reply to me made it very clear they had read and understood my request, and reasserted their commitment to those with special education needs \u2013 this was not some stock letter, it was an actual reply. If a government ministry can respond to me \u2013 in such a polite, respectful, and helpful manner no less \u2013 within a month of me making a suggestion about what would improve school boards, I don\u2019t see why an organisation which exists solely to advise and guide school boards has taken almost an entire year to get back to me. The NZSTA made me feel ignored and frustrated, the government made me feel acknowledged and listened to. Where this goes from here, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not in my hands other than to raise the issue again when the time is right. I feel that I have done the right thing by persisting, and for raising the issue in the first place. I know many of you have asked me to update the matter over the months since I wrote an  initial post on the issue  back in February, and now that I have an actual update I decided it was time to write a new post; thank you for your support and interest in the issue, I will update again if things progress further. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM180550.html"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/12/22/disability-representation-on-school-boards-update-progress-and-frustrations/", "title": "Disability Representation on School Boards \u2013 Update, Progress, and\u00a0Frustrations."},
{"date": "December 23, 2014", "body": "When I started this blog, I was my son\u2019s storyteller. His communication skills were so limited, and the future of those skills still so unclear; there was a good chance I would always be his storyteller, as the person in his daily life who knew him best. Sharing his life stories, was always a matter of sharing my stories too, because I was such a central part of his access to and experience of his world. I was his \u201cinterpreter\u201d in so many ways \u2013 both helping him to understand others, and helping others to understand him.  The years passed, and if you\u2019ve been with my blog since the beginning you went on that journey with me as he found his voice. His words became sentences more often, his sentences slowly became more meaningful. He started using increasingly challenging concepts. His echolalia made way for his own unique ways of expressing himself, and it was a beautiful transformation towards his growing individualism. In time, and when he was truly ready, I gifted him the words he needed to talk about his own autism, as an essential part of who he is. His understanding of what it has meant for him to have autism \u2013 both now and in the past \u2013 grows each year. Just like watching him learn to find his own voice, watching him come to understand his own autism has been quite a wonderful journey to behold \u2013 my son is expressing and shaping himself now. So naturally I would get to the point of explaining to him that I blogged, and that on this blog I tell stories of him and his autism, and of autism and advocacy around autism. He\u2019s OK with it, he finds it kinda neat really. I haven\u2019t given him free access to read everything I\u2019ve ever written, here for a variety of reasons, including that I don\u2019t want him to feel sad for how hard its been (he\u2019s a kind gentle boy and he would feel bad about it), and because my own views of autism have evolved so much over the years that I no longer believe everything I have ever said on my blog about the condition (well, at least not in the fine detail, and my boy is one for the details). There will come a time when he can and will read all I\u2019ve written, it is his story too, he has a right to see how it is told. So I find, year by year, step by step, I hand over the role of storyteller to my son: He has the mind, and the words, and the skill to tell his own story now. He has a life ever-growing independent of mine \u2013 I still help others understand his mind and perspective when he confuses or shocks them (or they him), but he is not as reliant on me. Next year I will even be looking for work again, I can actually contemplate having my autistic son going into before or after school care, these are huge steps for him and me both. As he grows in independence from me, I am free to find myself again too \u2013 who am I, what do I do for a living, it\u2019s no longer completely defined by being the carer for an autistic son (or two). In turn my blog evolves: I write less often as my life expands beyond autism, I write more carefully knowing he has a right and ability to tell his own stories now. My blog is in a state of flux, limbo, transformation, whatever it is, it\u2019s not what it was. Our whole family is in a state of transformation, it\u2019s natural my blog reflects this. I am cautiously optimistic about the future \u2013 both mine and my son\u2019s, we\u2019ve both come a long way. And on that journey you have read along side, sharing the pain and triumphs, the successes and failures, you\u2019ve supported me or attacked me, but either way cared enough to feel it was worth sharing your opinions with me on my blog. Where the story goes now, who tells it to whom, how and why, I guess we\u2019ll see. If you stick around, you may be here the day that my son becomes the writer \u2013 becomes the storyteller of \u201cAutism and Oughtisms\u201d \u2013 and I think that would be the greatest and best transformation for this blog of all. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/12/23/the-storyteller/", "title": "The Storyteller"},
{"date": "February 15, 2015", "body": "It was with a sad sense of  deja vu  that I read  a story today on Stuff.co.nz , about the treatment of an autistic child at a high decile private school here in New Zealand. The story is one of miscommunication, lack of information, confusion about funding, all\u00a0culminating in a poor outcome for the child. The child ultimately had a\u00a0\u201csignificant deterioration of his mental state,\u201d\u00a0a massive regression in his behaviour, and lost interest in activities that he once greatly enjoyed.\u00a0Once he had been removed from the school and placed in another one (a public, low decile one as I understand it), he returned to his\u00a0\u201cold self\u201d and is apparently now doing well. The parents had initially chosen the private school thinking it would be in their son\u2019s best interests, particularly because of the small class sizes relative to the average public school. The school is run by a private trust, rather than by the Government. The\u00a0end\u00a0jab\u00a0of the story told on Stuff.co.nz was a (not very subtle)\u00a0attack on the Government\u2019s private partnership school policy. It was (apparently) in part because of that push and agenda (but also because of perceived poor journalism),\u00a0that Cameron Slater at  Whale Oil dedicated a post  to the rebuttal of the story, with an open letter from the man in charge of the trust that runs the school. Despite the fact that the open letter was written from the school\u2019s perspective and in the school\u2019s defence, my personal response to it was that there is something wrong with the way the school is being run \u2013\u00a0specifically for families of children with special needs. In the spokesman\u2019s\u00a0own words, they do admit that they withhold reports from teachers, on the child\u2019s abilities and behaviours, for an entire term when a child starts the school \u2013 just as the family said in a video on the Stuff.co.nz page; professional reports and opinions on what was in the best interests of the child and of what a teacher should know about the child, were actually held back from the teacher. This information is withheld on the reasoning that it would affect the teacher\u2019s expectations for the child. As\u00a0ideal as this may sound for your \u201caverage\u201d child, it is far from any sort of ideal for an autistic child, where seemingly small and innocuous matters can completely throw the child\u2019s ability to function and\u00a0thrive in a classroom, unless a teacher is aware of them. Think of sensory issues, as a very common and classic example here. Add to this that the school spokesman also said\u00a0the school\u00a0often finds itself in\u00a0 disagreement with parents because the school prefers to 100% back any child\u2019s ability to \u201cgrow and\u00a0improve\u201d anew at a new school. The wording of this viewpoint\u00a0tells me that there is something going wrong here with communication between the school, the parents, and the professionals whose opinions are incredibly important when it comes to the education of children with special needs: The idea that the school sees itself in conflict with parents because the school is the one backing the child (implying surely that the family is the group somehow holding\u00a0the child\u00a0back), is an inherently antagonistic one. That is the view I walk away with having read the Stuff.co.nz piece, but also the Whale Oil rebuttal \u2013 it is a consistent impression when the story is told from either side. The school spokesman did say their practices were backed by research about expectations of children and teachers attitudes and the child\u2019s outcome when those expectations were blocked. However, I would point out that there is a difference between the outcomes of research, and the  effective implementation of systems\u00a0 set up to achieve those outcomes in real-world and\u00a0diverse situations. In particular, for that research to be meaningful for autistic children, you would need to compare a school where teachers are actively informed about an autistic\u00a0child\u2019s background, needs, abilities, anxieties etc, to a school where that key information was with-held (such as appears to be the situation here). Even if \u2013 oddly \u2013 the withheld version had better results for autistic children, one would have to reassess methods where actual real-world outcomes for a specific student at a specific school evidenced that something was not working well, as appears to be the case here. Even if we put these specific concerns aside, there\u00a0is the remaining underlying issue that there is\u00a0a clear\u00a0breakdown in\u00a0communication here between parents and the school, and that a child has suffered because of it. No matter whether the school or the parents are completely correct in their claims in these stories,\u00a0something vital has still gone terribly wrong, and there need to be serious and honest efforts to figure out what happened, why, and how it can be avoided in the future. Doing so benefits the school, the family, and potentially all other children at that school too. Yet, sadly, these very real concerns and morals in this story,\u00a0seem to have got lost in a debate about how the current Government should spend its education dollars when it comes to schools being run by private trusts or other private organisations. That debate and issue is an interesting and\u00a0important one, but I don\u2019t see how one example of a school that appears to have failed a child of high needs, says anything one way or the other on the issue. Funds can be just as easily misused or seemingly go missing (or not be understood as to how they are being used) at a private school just as much as a public one. I hear these stories every year, several times a year, from people in person and online \u2013 and yes there is a very clear trend that private and high decile schools appear to do a relatively poorer job of accommodating and problem-solving when it comes to children with special needs. Just as often, I hear wonderful success stories of how low decile and public schools appear to excel at making such modifications. I personally put this down to three key factors: (1) the inability of public schools to turn away a child \u2013 they are forced to find a way to make it work, (2) the fact that they\u00a0are used to having to deal with the vast diversity of humankind at extremes that may be less likely to be encountered in a private or well-off school, and so are often more accepting of difference in all its forms, and (3) private and well-off schools classically put academic ability at the forefront of their aims\u00a0 \u2013 that\u2019s fine, they are a school after all, but other priorities and interests also\u00a0require recognition at schools and most especially for children with special needs, such as basic social skills and other developmental milestones that are missing or\u00a0so delayed that a school must take them into account on a daily basis if that child is ever to have a chance at academic success. If this all makes it sound like I am anti private schools or anti private partnerships, then you have missed my point. In fact, I believe we should have a vast diversity of schools just in the same way that society has a vast diversity of students for those schools. I am pro-choice \u2013 whether it be public, private, home-schooling, special schools, exclusive schools, etc. I believe all schools should base themselves on the best knowledge and research in the education field, but I do not think the implementation would (or even necessarily should) always be the same in each school, neither do I believe every school should run the exact same curriculum or with the exact same focus \u2013 I recognise (and am in favour of) the huge diversity in interests in children, and in the ways they learn, and I am quite happy to see schools variously cater to such diversity with teachers most passionate about teaching within the sorts of schools that suit them best too. And this gets me to my point then: Within such diversity, a school should always be communicating well and openly with parents, should always be responding when a child is in crisis, should always be able to account for the support and funding that was tagged to a specific child. Private or public or anywhere in between, accountability and communication are always important at any school, and that is where I see the failure here. I want to end by saying I have no inside knowledge or private communications with the affected parties of this school. I have purely based what I have written on what is said in the piece at Whale Oil, Stuff.co.nz, the videos on Stuff.co.nz, and on my personal experience and conversations with other families and interactions with\u00a0a variety of\u00a0schools. Feel free to correct me, or disagree with me \u2013 that is the nature of the interactive\u00a0endeavour that is blogging. It allows us to share a different perspective; as always I\u2019d love to hear yours too. *** Update: The Principal of the school and spokesman for the trust that runs the school had reached out to me and invited me to come visit the school for myself. I had accepted his invitation and had arranged for the visit to go ahead, but had to cancel at the last minute due to an unavoidable clash with another urgent appointment. At this stage I haven\u2019t arranged a replacement visit because of other long-standing family commitments. If I get the chance to follow through with a visit anytime soon, I will do an update accordingly. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/66204362/private-school-failed-our-autistic-son", "http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2015/02/open-response-sst-hit-job-alwyn-poole/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/private-versus-public-schools-for-special-needs-the-mt-hobson-middle-school-controversy-and-case-study/", "title": "Private Versus Public Schools, for Special Needs: The example of the Mt Hobson Middle School\u00a0controversy"},

None of that made a damn bit of difference at the end of the day though. If a school \u2013 and more specifically, a principal \u2013 doesn\u2019t want your kids at that school, you will find yourself in endless fights, and eventually facing that final decision: keep fighting \u2013 with all the hardships and exhaustion that brings \u2013 or leave to find another school \u2013 with all the exhaustion and hardship that brings too. Either way, you lose, your children suffer, and you might come out of the experience a shadow of who you were when it all began. It all began when my sons\u2019 school got a new principal at the end of last year. Never doubt the power and influence that a single person can have on an entire school culture; understanding this point was what would help me eventually choose a better replacement school for my boys, but we\u2019ll get to that part of the tale in another post. The school\u2019s new principal decided she\u2019d take-over the over-sight for special needs provision in the school. This didn\u2019t worry me at all to begin with; she spoke the language of meaningful inclusion, I thought this could be what the school needed to become excellent and iconic in its treatment of their special students \u2013\u00a0integrating them as true equals within the school in every way. But instead of becoming a gate-way to better communication and better use of special education resources within the school, she became a barrier; it was like someone had slammed the door in my face and no matter what I did, no matter how hard I struggled to re-open the gate, it was locked tight. I went from feeling wanted and appreciated within the school for the insights I could provide\u00a0for helping families like mine and our special kids, to feeling like I was distinctly unwanted, a nuisance, a pestering precense they wanted to make go away. At first I thought maybe that was just me; maybe they didn\u2019t really feel that way towards me at all, maybe I was misreading the situation. But matters went from bad to worse in a very short amount of time. I watched my older son\u2019s supports lessen, and information on those supports and why they were lessening was kept from me \u2013 like some sort of secret I no longer had any right to access. When I\u2019d ask for a meeting to discuss his supports, I\u2019d get no reply. When I followed up another week later politely seeking a response to my original email, I was rudely and aggressively told off for doing so; even though I was asking about my older son\u2019s supports, I was told that my  younger  son had heaps of resources spent on him and that the staff was spending a lot of time having to deal with me. Me. Me who couldn\u2019t get any answers or help; me who was asking about the older son but was being attacked about my younger one as if that was a relevant response. Me, who spent hours every week for the past two years contributing my own free time (what little of it there ever is) to helping run the school as a board member. I was now categorised as a nuisance. At one stage I\u2019d\u00a0brought up\u00a0the idea of whether my older son might be suited to a different classroom because communication and supports were not going well in his current classroom, and that possibility was abruptly shot down too \u2013 I was told he was in the right room for him. My views as his mother, seemed worth nothing. I felt like I was being treated as an outsider daring to make enquiries about someone I had no relationship with, rather than as a mother seeking information about her own son. Still, things got so much worse. Finally a meeting was set up to discuss what was going on with my  youngest  son, who was a new entrant at the school. He was only being allowed to stay at school for 2.5 hours each day. He was not enjoying school, he constantly tried to escape a classroom he expressly found boring. He\u2019d get distressed when it was time to go to school, and when he\u2019d get home after his half-days at school he would cling to me like never before. He\u2019d become quite anxious, unhappy, and insecure. School \u2013 or rather,  this  school \u2013 was making him upset, and teaching him nothing (except to hate school). In fact, he hated it so much he once ran all the way home during school time, at a time when he was explicitly meant to be watched by a teacher aide. He crossed a busy road (pure luck he wasn\u2019t hit by a truck) to get home to me. The school\u2019s response? To perhaps make the classroom more enjoyable or engaging for him, or to close the doors of the classroom so he\u2019d stop running out of class, or to discuss options with me and seek my insight or help? Nope. Their response \u2013 specifically the principal\u2019s response \u2013 was to openly say in front of others at this meeting that my son was not going to be allowed to stay\u00a0at school unless he had an aide with him at all times, and that the very maximum aide hours they would be able to get was three hours a day. The intial plan to extend his hours at school after the first three weeks, was completely abandoned, without asking my views on how to make\u00a0such an extension\u00a0work. I was truly devastated; I had longed for the day that my youngest son would attend school full time \u2013 as he is legally entitled (and even required) to do. I wanted to be able to go get a job for myself so our family could get an adequate income instead of all four of us relying on the one income as we have now for years. More importantly though, I wanted my youngest son to have the chance to grow in his independence, to have a school teach him what he needs to know, to have him learn. I wanted so many simple things other families are allowed to take for granted, and it was all taken away from me at that meeting. I was told too that my youngest\u00a0son had to learn to be \u201cpart of the pack,\u201d that he had to learn that \u201cteacher was boss.\u201d My request for an individualised approach for him was shot down without discussion since they said it would make him think he was allowed to do things differently than other kids and he had to learn to be one of them. I wish I was exaggerating, I wish this wasn\u2019t as bad as it really was, but I have all of this recorded in verbatim meeting minutes and in emails \u2013 all there in black and white. In fact, it was so offensive in its black and white written version, that a Ministry of Education person carefully re-wrote the meeting report to remove the hurtful (and even illegal) remarks and requirements. I have both versions of the meeting records, and the difference between the real and the sanitised versions is stark. I was also told at this meeting, again in front of the others attending, that other parents didn\u2019t want their kids in my youngest son\u2019s class. My son, my gentle, fun-loving, never hurt-a-fly son \u2013 a bright young boy with suspected mild autism, and so a bit different and a little challenging, but hardly a problem-child. Why the principal felt it was necessary to share this news about other parents not liking him, in front of me and the others present, remains a cruel mystery to me to this day. It had absolutely nothing to do with the purpose of the meeting, we were all there to discuss how best to help my son, not to talk about what other parents \u2013 with no relationship or connection to his well-being \u2013 thought about him. I was so angry by this point \u2013 so outraged at their attitude towards my kids and me \u2013 that I was in tears. The people at the meeting mistook my tears for sadness, they tried to comfort me \u2013 they claimed to be worried about my stress levels, but all my stress at this time was not caused by my lovely kids, it was all caused by having to deal with these short-sighted, barrier-creating, anti-diversity, adults, whose job was meant to be looking after and teaching my children. In that final week of my children being at this school, I was spending every day in tears. I had frequent occasions when my heart would suddenly speed up and seem to skip a few beats, to the effect that at times I almost fainted. I was experiencing panic attacks each day, and during the night too. I lost hours of sleep every night. My IBS gut symptoms had almost disappeared in the months prior after two years of interventions, but all of that progress was lost as my symptoms came rushing back with a vengeance during this time of extreme stress. I felt powerless, frustrated, distressed. I was the unwanted mother, with the unwanted children that a school was trying to push out, and they were going to win, because what option did I really have anymore? I was desperately worried about my children\u2019s\u00a0well-being at a school where last year my eldest had an incident when he was not supervised when he was meant to be and ended up getting seven stitches to his head, and this year the younger son\u00a0had run\u00a0across a road during the school day when he was supposedly supervised too. I felt the school was not looking after my kids adequately, wasn\u2019t teaching either of them well, and was blaming my children for the  school\u2019s  failures to care for and teach them both. I\u2019d tried to help the school to understand how to best care for my children, but in not listening to me or valuing my experience and insights, they\u2019d created situations where things were increasingly going wrong and they continued to not look at their own systems and how they could and should have been improved to everyone\u2019s benefit. Things were spiralling away from my ability to fix them, and each day my children continued to attend that school felt like a lost day of learning, and a potential danger to them. I had a choice. Fight, or flight. Fight the system, fight the people, fight to keep my children somewhere they weren\u2019t even wanted even though they had every right to be there. Or find them a new school, take a chance that there might be somewhere they will actually be wanted, be taught, be safe. What happened next \u2013 the search for a new school, and how we would make that eventual and incredibly important decision \u2013 is the subject of another post. What I learnt this year, through those horrible weeks, was this: No one is immune to facing this sort of discrimination against their kids \u2013 no matter your education, or how much time you volunteer to help out, how much you learn or share or care or sacrifice, no matter who you are or what your standing in a school or a community, you can end up in this situation. A situation that is tolerated far too often, as if it\u2019s just the way things are and will always be. It shouldn\u2019t be and doesn\u2019t have to be this way, the hardship created by this should matter to everyone who cares about children, education, and having a society worth living in. The way things are now is in no one\u2019s best interests, this needs to change. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/discrimination-clipart-discrimination.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2015/03/18/from-fight-to-flight-how-i-lost-a-school-discrimination-battle-and-almost-lost-myself/", "title": "From Fight to Flight; How I lost a school discrimination battle, and almost lost\u00a0myself"},
{"date": "August 14, 2014", "body": "It\u2019s an election year here in New Zealand. Last time this event came around I created  a post for each political party , looking at their attitudes, priorities and promises when it came to disability (and especially autism) in New Zealand. I simply don\u2019t have the required time to dedicate a post to every party this time around, but I can provide links and other key information that may help make your own decision easier this year, if disability issues are a top priority for you in where your vote goes. Honestly, in my experience, people rarely vote on single issues \u2013 the party you vote for reflects a  much wider view of what is best for creating a good society and thereby (naturally one assumes), what is also best for those with disabilities. So if this post will be helpful at all, it may be helpful to those torn between parties with otherwise similar views of what makes a good society, or it may help you figure out which parties you\u2019d like to lobby to change their views. Either way, I hope you find this post a useful resource. First, a list of links to each party\u2019s disability policy, with further explanation where needed. I\u2019ll present these in alphabetical order. I will not be going over every single political party because there are such a huge number of them, just the ones that regularly make it into the polls (here\u2019s a link to the\u00a0 New Zealand Herald\u2019s poll stories , as a source for those interested in keeping up with the latest polls). \n Act  do appear to not have a specific \u201cdisability policy,\u201d but you can gleam their attitudes, priorities etc from their policies in the related areas of health, education, welfare (etc). \n Conservative Party \u00a0also does not appear to have a specific disability policy, see the guidance above about Act for where to look for more relevant details in their other policies. \n Green Party Disability Policy . You can also find a link on the right side of that page to the full disability policy in a PDF. \n Labour Party Disability Policy . \n Internet Mana Party Disability Policy . \n Maori Party , do not appear to have announced a disability policy, and I found it hard to find other relevant policies on their website too. Let me know if you have better luck than I did. \n National Party , do not appear to have announced a disability policy yet, but considering they are the current government it is easy to find huge amounts of information on what they are doing around disability issues on all sorts of websites ( NZ Herald ,  Scoop , and\u00a0 Stuff  are useful starting points). Like Act and all other parties, you can also gleam further detail on their disability views by having a look at other policy areas such as education, housing and welfare. \n New Zealand First  do not appear to have a specific disability policy, but other policies (health, education etc) will help you figure out what they want too. \n United Future \u2018s site specifically declares that they are still in the process of releasing policy, and provide a way in which you can contact them to share your suggestions about policy. \n I was also interested in finding out which parties have people with disabilities standing for parliament. So far I have only identified two: \n The Greens have  Mojo Mathers , who is deaf, and who is currently in parliament as well as standing again this year. \n Labour has  Simon Buckingham , who claims to be New Zealand\u2019s first \u201cautistic spectrum lawyer.\u201d Simon is not currently in parliament, and I do not know where he comes on their party list, but I will add that detail when I find out. \n I only know of one disability advocacy agency that has tried to find answers to their specific concerns from the parties and shared those answers online. It was a good effort to get responses to a range of issues. You can find the responses  here at IHC \u2018s webpage. If policies, key personalities, or other relevant information becomes available between now and the election, all you have to do is message me in the comments section below, or via\u00a0 Facebook  or\u00a0 Twitter  and I will add to or change the information in this post accordingly. If there is a specific issue or party policy you\u2019d like me to look into further, in regards to disability and especially to autism, please do feel free to let me know that too. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.clipartpanda.com/categories/question-mark-clip-art", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/political-polls/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1502763", "http://www.act.org.nz/policies", "http://www.conservativeparty.org.nz/index.php?page=Principles", "https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/disability-issues", "http://campaign.labour.org.nz/disability_issues", "http://mana.net.nz/policy/policy-disability-issues/", "http://maoriparty.org/our-policies/", "https://www.national.org.nz/news/portfolios/detail/disability-issues", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/", "http://nzfirst.org.nz/policies", "http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/policy", "https://www.greens.org.nz/candidates/mojo-mathers-mp", "http://campaign.labour.org.nz/simon_buckingham", "http://www.ihc.org.nz/campaigns/general-election-2014/", "https://www.facebook.com/autismandoughtisms/", "https://twitter.com/AutismOughtism"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/08/14/information-on-nz-political-parties-disability-in-the-2014-general-election/", "title": "Information on NZ Political Parties & Disability, in the 2014 General\u00a0Election."},
{"date": "August 1, 2014", "body": "Today I was contacted by a woman here in New Zealand, who wanted to share\u00a0her research project with me \u2013 specifically she wanted to hear my thoughts on what she had written. The project written by Catherine Rivera-Puddle, is entitled \u201c Loudly Silent: Experiences of women who have a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Social Groups .\u201d It was completed in 2012, and can now be publicly accessed via this link:  www. autismnz .org. nz /\u2026/36156/ Loudly _ Silent _-_Research_Project.pdf Having read it, I think there is much of value in there, lessons that we can take away from her research, and insights to what it means to be a mother, most particularly to be a modern mother of a child with autism. There is much I could write spinning off from the subject matter, but there is one particular lesson I want to share with you for now: The importance of our own autism parent narratives. ( Just a note that this discussion evolves from Catherine\u2019s work, and is not a simple restatement of her views \u2013\u00a0I give her credit for the material that lead to this post, and take personal responsibility for the additional views I express in this post .) Catherine\u2019s work forced me to\u00a0reassess something that I have written on many times, without realising the deeper issue at play: The stories we tell ourselves and others to make sense of our lives as parents of autistic children. Some of us do see ourselves as Super-Mums, some see ourselves as heroes or martyrs or survivors, some as victims (be it of vaccines or society or autism itself), some as destined into our roles. We create a narrative in which we fit \u2013 perhaps one that is already constructed for us in part by society or by the autism community, or perhaps one we have shaped for ourselves \u2013 as we make sense of what and who we now are once autism has completely turned our lives upside-down. Whatever that story may be, it serves some important function. The stories that ready-made society already presents to us \u2013 where for example a mother\u2019s worth and success can be judged by her child\u2019s behaviour\u00a0\u2013 don\u2019t make sense for most autism mums, and indeed isolates, marginalises, stigmatises us. I feel that we are forced to directly confront and almost rebel against those standard narratives. We have to come up with an alternative which not only better reflects our lived realities, but also doesn\u2019t automatically label us as outcasts that should be avoided and shunned. But the stories we come up with to make sense of our world, can put us in direct conflict with other members of our own autism community \u2013\u00a0with others who have chosen their own story which can\u2019t seem to coexist with ours. Sometimes that conflict arises because the version of autism required to uphold it is scientifically or empirically inaccurate, but more often I see parents under attack for not conforming to someone else\u2019s version of the \u201cone right way\u201d to approach parenting an autistic child. We have to say the right words, think the right things, support the right charity, attend the right conferences. If we fail to meet this standard, we can and do find ourselves under attack. Maybe we\u2019re not sacrificing enough, or we\u2019re sacrificing too much, and either way we have fallen short of the ideal autism parent. Just when you think you\u2019re going to be safe as you shift away from the judgements and impossible standards of mainstream society, you find yourself damagingly\u00a0in conflict with the judgments and impossible standards of the autism community. I think that there is inherent value in our (often conflicting) narratives though \u2013 that even when they can\u2019t piece together tidily or we can\u2019t understand or accept someone\u2019s version of what it means to be an autism parent, that we still need to appreciate the importance of people forming these narratives.\u00a0For the mental well-being of a parent \u2013 and therefore necessarily for the well-being of the child \u2013 we should appreciate that the narrative any one person has formed to make sense of their new reality as an autism parent, is one that is helping them to get a foot-hold in their lives and to therefore get on with\u00a0what needs to be done.\u00a0We need to allow them the mental peace to move beyond mainstream society\u2019s view of what is acceptable and what constitutes a parent as a failure, and replace it instead with a version that allows them space to breathe and to\u00a0simply exist; to not be living their lives in endless depressing unhelpful reference to a standard that is alien to the autism experience. Is there a place for a war of narratives \u2013 where parts of our community fight to make theirs the dominant voice, the dominant version of reality? I think that\u2019s\u00a0quite natural and maybe even necessary \u2013 I do think it is healthy to confront our views and question our assumptions, I think\u00a0the ever-shifting understanding autism as a condition in itself necessitates these debates. However I think \u2013 considering the huge diversity of autism experiences \u2013 that we need to accept a corresponding diversity of narratives. The story I would have told you about how I made sense of and lived alongside autism when my child was severely affected, is incredibly different from the version you\u2019ll get from me now with my now milder affected child. Did my story \u201cevolve,\u201d or grow-up with my deeper knowledge\u00a0and understanding over the years? Maybe, or maybe it just shifted alongside my reality and the original narrative I\u2019d formed no longer accurately\u00a0reflected my life. And really what\u2019s so wrong with that \u2013 if the narrative I was living with assisted me to make sense of my world and to get through each day, if it served a function that helped hold me mentally together in the face of public rejection and judgment \u2013 then surely it\u2019s performing some good on some level that also benefitted the child. And on that point, I do think that\u00a0many make an unjustified leap in reasoning where autism narratives conflict; I think\u00a0many judge a parent\u2019s love for their child based on the narrative that parent has adopted. I also think that is extraordinarily cruel. You can find instances throughout the comments on my blog (and many more that I never publish because their cruelty is just so profound) where a parent is accused of not loving their child because their version of what it means to be a parent of an autistic child doesn\u2019t match someone else\u2019s. It always shocks me when people make this leap, no matter how many times it happens. I think of it now as almost an intense\u00a0defence mechanism \u2013 when someone feels their version of reality and of understanding autism in lived experience is under attack, and they have fought so hard to build up their version in the first place to replace mainstream society\u2019s version, then it makes sense to lash out to protect it from non-conforming alternatives; if your way of learning to live with and love autism is not the same as someone else\u2019s you have the choice to accept that diversity or to fight it, and I think the instinct to fight it in this (and other hurtful)\u00a0ways is indicative of a vulnerability \u2013 a vulnerability of an unstable perspective that has trouble standing firm in the face of alternatives. Or not\u2026 that\u2019s just one way I view those ridiculous \u201cyou don\u2019t love your child then\u201d attacks. I find it easier to view people who makes these attacks as being defensive and reactionary, rather than somehow actually believing that you can judge a parent\u2019s love for their child based on how they are working to come to terms with autism. Personally, I acknowledge my evolving narrative, and I acknowledge and respect the diversity of autism-parenting narratives. No I do not think they are all equally \u201cvalid\u201d (eg scientifically, empirically) or as healthy as they could otherwise be for the child and parent, but they nevertheless play an important role in that person\u2019s ability to make sense of, accept and get on with their daily lives, and reflects the enormous diversity of autism and how it is experienced person to person. Mainstream society\u2019s version of a good parent can\u2019t make sense of my autism parenting experience, and neither do many of the other autism-specific versions I have encountered over the years, and that\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t have to hold the exact same perspective as I do about autism, for your own experiences and views to also be relevant, important, and valid in your world. It\u2019s OK to think differently than I do\u2026 but perhaps my acceptance of that type of diversity is just  itself  an expression of  my own  narrative. Lots to think about anyway, and I will continue to think it through \u2013\u00a0as usual I\u2019d love to hear your own perspectives.

{"date": "August 25, 2014", "body": "Whether I currently have one or two sons with autism, is waiting to be confirmed. I have an eight-year-old son whose autism was diagnosed at age three, and a second son who is strongly suspected to have autism but remains undiagnosed at age four. You may think that as a mother of an autistic child I\u2019d have quickly and easily spotted the second child\u2019s autistic traits \u2013 I thought that would have been the case too. But I\u2019ve found that already having one child with autism actually created a whole set of challenges and distortions that made it a lot harder for me to recognise the autistic traits  as  possible autistic traits, in the second child. It took an autism specialist and a group of kindergarten teachers, to pick up on things I\u2019d seen but had \u201cmis-categorised.\u201d I\u2019ve been reflecting a lot lately on why this is the case \u2013 how is it a mother like myself who is so emotionally and intellectually immersed in the world of autism, misses the signs in her very own son? I\u2019ve reached some understanding of how this came about, for me at least, and quite possibly the same factors are at play in other families like ours. Free use image. It starts with the fact that my eldest son is my primary reference point for autism. The symptoms my eldest son has \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, their severity \u2013 blinded me to understanding what was going on with his younger brother: although the younger brother showed some unusual or concerning behaviours, to my mind they fell well short of actual markers for autism. I couldn\u2019t help but compare the two children. This is tied up in a second issue: I have only ever raised an autistic child. I don\u2019t have personal experience with raising a child who went through \u201cnormal development,\u201d I have intimate experience with the development of a severely autistic child though and comparatively my younger son\u2019s development seemed to be going very well. As time went by I did start to notice significant differences between him and his unrelated peers, but there were two other factors at play that lead me to largely dismiss my observations as relevant to autism: (1) I thought my younger son was simply copying some of the more concerning and unusual behaviours from his autistic older brother, such as the humming endlessly while he ran in circles. Indeed, when I brought up this concern when he was about two with a speech therapist who was assessing him at even that early stage, she also felt it must be a copying behaviour that would go after he\u2019d spent a lot more time at kindergarten amongst more \u201cnormal\u201d peers. Similarly my younger son\u2019s seemingly delayed social skills; something that could be explained away by the daily presence of an autistic older brother whose own development and social skills were themselves so very different from the norm. We all know how influential an older child can be on their younger siblings, which made it easy \u2013 alongside the next factor I\u2019m about to address \u2013 to explain away the younger sibling\u2019s oddities. (2) I was fully aware that I \u201csee\u201d autism everywhere. Just like anything you become hyper aware of, suddenly it is everywhere you look because your brain is focused on it and searching it out. If someone tells me about their concerns with their child\u2019s development or behaviours, my brain starts by considering whether autism might be a relevant cause (it rarely is, but the point is my brain heads there first). Or if someone is discussing disability advocacy, my first reference point for what services are needed or lacking is to run the issues through an autism-experience filter, and this is completely natural and understandable considering my most intense interaction with disability experiences is through living with my own son. But because I am fully aware of this tendency of mine, I am also weary of jumping to \u201cautism\u201d as the answer or explanation for everything. So when I saw autism-like behaviours in my younger son, I chastised myself for thinking it might be autism. Instead I \u2013 and others who knew my son well \u2013 declared that he was just strong-willed, stubborn, independent\u2026 nothing pathological, just a particular personality type. But as more professionals and teachers became part of my younger son\u2019s life \u2013 and the same concerns got voiced across the board, and the concerning behaviours and traits weren\u2019t lessening and became more intrusive, and the professionals in his life step-by-step ruled out parenting or other factors as causing the problems \u2013 I couldn\u2019t dismiss autism as an explanation anymore. Autism does tend to run in families, we always knew this was a possibility. I just thought \u2013 for all the reasons outlines above \u2013 that autism wasn\u2019t the explanation for my youngest son\u2019s challenges. So here we are, facing the start of that new autism journey. We\u2019ll be just fine \u2013 we know the system well, we know the interventions that will be employed and have the experience and dedication already to make the most of them. We already love and live with one autistic son. This is not new territory, even if it will take a bit of getting used to. So even though my older son\u2019s autism created various challenges to identifying the same base issues at play in his brother, I can confidently say that those experiences with his older brother will ultimately benefit my youngest. I\u2019ve been through raising a very difficult autistic child, in comparison his quirky younger brother is a piece of cake. We already  know  we can handle this. Though we\u2019ve had an autism specialist say she does see mild autism in him, and she\u2019s told us she\u2019d be happy to go through the full diagnostic process if we find we need a confirmed diagnosis to access services, for now we\u2019re doing OK without that final step of confirmation. \u201cSuspected autism\u201d gets us the services he needs right now, and that\u2019s what matters. One day we\u2019ll know for sure either way, but there are certain things a diagnosis could never change; I\u2019ll just keep on loving my two boys just the same \u2013 they\u2019re quirky and clever and independent and stubborn, and best of all, they\u2019re both mine. I wouldn\u2019t change that for the world. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://autismandoughtisms.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/magnifying_glass-3.jpg"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/the-challenges-of-spotting-autism-in-siblings/", "title": "The Challenges of Spotting Autism in\u00a0Siblings"},
{"date": "May 11, 2014", "body": "A reader recently asked me how I keep going in the face of the\u00a0exhaustion and frustration of dealing with people who stand in the way of your child receiving adequate support and services. Her question had other facets to it too \u2013 ones that I will deal with in other posts \u2013 but for now I want to share my own views and tactics when dealing with an ignorant and indifferent bureaucracy. By Forest Runner, via Flickr Whether the people, organisations, or settings you are trying to deal with are teachers, IEPs, government service or funding providers or other people with the power to make it hard to get support, I\u00a0find the following approach has served me quite well. I hope it may help others, or perhaps you could share what works for you. First, knowledge. You need to empower yourself with both what you know and with the confidence that comes along with that knowledge. You need to know how the administration works: become familiar with the positions within the organisation, and the legislation that upholds it. You may find you quickly come to have a better understanding of how an organisation runs that the people who work as cogs within that machine \u2013 don\u2019t assume that the front-line person you are dealing with is\u00a0correct when they tell you something just can\u2019t be done or a matter can\u2019t be taken any further or appealed. So too, you need to know the hierarchy you are dealing with: Are you facing the ultimate decision-maker or can you appeal their decision, could you even request to have the difficult person swapped out by asking for someone else to be responsible for your child\u2019s case. Know your rights and what you and your child are entitled to. A good way to learn this when it\u2019s not spelled out for you in documents you can access, is getting involved with other local parents who can tell you what their child receives \u2013 you may be surprised what one family can access simply because they have someone different working on their child\u2019s case. The importance of networking in this way will come up again later in this post. Feel free to give ignorant people information about the condition they don\u2019t understand when that lack of understanding is affecting you getting the right care for your child. Give them pamphlets, books, send them links to articles, posts, whatever you think they need to know that they\u2019re currently lacking. Send them invitations to local speakers and training sessions if you think that will help. The worst they can do is ignore the information, but even then they would have\u00a0received the message\u00a0that they are dealing with a passionate well-informed individual. At the best they may even read or go where you send them, and some of that ignorance might sloth off. When it comes to actual meetings, I suggest preparing well in advance. Make notes of the key points you want to cover and of what you are after, be prepared to perhaps hand over the notes if they ask for them to record the information (in my experience they often do want the notes, so I\u2019ve learnt to type them out instead of taking in hand-scrawled information). Appear confident and like you\u2019re holding it together well (even when you\u2019re neither) \u2013 give them the impression of someone who has the time and energy to fight for their child to the bitter end. Be calm, assertive, polite, but unmovable when it comes to the important stuff \u2013 don\u2019t let them think that just because a meeting has ended that everything is sorted until the next meeting. Expect them to take action, and make sure any actions that need to be done are actually assigned so at the next meeting people can\u2019t say \u201coh I thought X was taking care of that.\u201d Take notes during the meeting of anything said that is crucial \u2013 don\u2019t trust the \u201cofficial record\u201d to be accurate (in my experience, it frequently isn\u2019t and you wonder if the person who recorded the meeting was even in the same room). And after these meetings, these phone calls, these interactions? When no one is watching, let yourself fall apart for the rest of the day in you need to (I often do).\u00a0You\u2019ll probably feel drained and not feel like doing much the rest of that day if it\u2019s been a typical meeting where you\u2019re fighting for your child, so give yourself permission to do nothing. Cry, shout, rock in the corner, see a movie, dance, talk to a friend \u2013 whatever it takes to just let those emotions go, because you\u2019ve done your best and it\u2019s OK to be human again now. It\u2019s OK that you\u2019re not superwoman (or superman), and that you\u2019re not as confident and knowledgeable as you tried to appear to be. You\u2019ll be OK, just give yourself permission to breathe. And if it\u2019s all gone to hell? If you tried everything, you\u2019ve exhausted your appeals, or the legislation itself stands in the way of what your child needs? Then you lobby, you write, you protest, you work the system from the outside when working from the inside has failed you. You rock that damn boat til you get noticed. Remember that laws and funding decisions are only made by human beings just like you,  they  are not immovable,  you are . Be a nuisance, make them want to make you go away by giving you and your child what you need. Be the squeaky wheel until they show up with the oil. And on that road to change \u2013 a road that may not end with the change you need and want \u2013 network like crazy. Meet other people who have the same values and beliefs and needs as you do, you\u2019ll be stronger for the support and in larger numbers. And learn, learn what\u2019s wrong with the system and how it could be made better, look overseas for how other countries do it better, remind yourself that just because this is the way things are here and now doesn\u2019t mean it has to stay that way. And by the end of your campaigning, if you get nowhere, you will still have made new friends and gained new valuable knowledge along the way \u2013 it is never for nothing. You can take up the fight again another day if your energy disappears, it\u2019s OK to not succeed in everything you do, especially when that everything includes trying to change people and to change the world. Don\u2019t let yourself feel like a failure, don\u2019t beat yourself up for not having enough energy or money or time to push it all the way yet. You know you did the best you could, and by not draining yourself to the point of a break-down, you will live to fight another day. Do not push yourself to burn-out, burn-out is very hard to come back from and can take years (if not decades) to recover from. Remind yourself that you need to stay mentally and physically and emotionally healthy for the sake of your child, because this is all for them, so it\u2019s in that child\u2019s best interests that you survive intact. You are a survivor, you are a fighter, you are a parent who loves their child. And on the days you just can\u2019t fight anymore, remind yourself you are only human too, and being human is OK. Breathe in, breathe out. Survive, and know this: you are not alone. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimbaker/70751294/"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/05/11/surviving-the-ignorance-and-indifference-of-the-bureaucracy/", "title": "Surviving the Ignorance and Indifference of the\u00a0Bureaucracy."},
{"date": "May 11, 2014", "body": "There has been a lot of media hype recently about \u201cThe Sewell Foundation,\u201d and the family behind this charity. They got their story on the  TV show Seven Sharp \u00a0this week, and have had yet\u00a0 another article  published about them on Stuff.co.nz. The media (and large segments of the public) are lapping up their story and promoting their charity, but a lot of the language the Sewells used to talk about autism rang warning bells, and the more I researched them the less I liked what I found. Some autistic adults and other parents are getting quite upset about the Sewells\u00a0too, and I think people need to know why. (After writing this post I discovered an excellent examination of what\u2019s wrong with the Sewells\u2019 views over at \u201c Public Address \u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Russell Brown provides further arguments and evidence for why we should be concerned about the Sewells and I strongly suggest reading his article.) The Sewells liberally use words like \u201ccure,\u201d \u201chealing,\u201d and \u201cmiracle\u201d when it comes to their autistic daughter\u2019s experience moving from being severely autistic to mildly autistic. They\u00a0also refer to interventions that are \u201c parent-proven \u201d (rather than those which are supported by the scientific literature, one presumes). They talk about defying what they had been told was their daughter\u2019s future, and use the positive outcome as proof that what they did works. They also talk about their preferred interventions as if those interventions haven\u2019t been treated like serious options by the government here. So what are these amazing interventions that our government is supposedly ignoring? ABA and dietary interventions. Oh.\u00a0Not quite the miracle solutions you were expecting, right? Because this stuff is nothing new, it\u2019s well-known, it\u2019s been tested. These are just two options in the wide variety of interventions we know that can work for some families. Many interventions that have good evidence backing and good outcomes are already funded here \u2013 including speech therapy, occupational therapy, educational psychologists, physiotherapy. If a family wants to also try dietary options and ABA, they have some discretionary government funding they could put towards it (such as through using\u00a0\u201ccarer support\u201d). If the point is ABA is too expensive for most families and the government should be supporting its implementation better, then that\u2019s fine, there is a good argument for that (though it\u2019s extraordinarily expensive if you want the 40 hours a week option as many do, about $60,000 a year) \u2013 the government here  even recommends  ABA . However, that is not the sole\u00a0message of the Sewells (and even if it was, you should at least be aware that ABA is a highly controversial therapy in some quarters, some even view it as a type of abuse, here are  just   two  of many attacks you will easily find on it). Let\u2019s take a moment to return the Sewells\u2019 story: They were told their daughter was destined for an institution and wouldn\u2019t learn to talk, they were given no hope. The fact that she\u2019s doing well now is treated like evidence the current medical establishment and knowledge is wrong and that we need to look to the alternative therapies they discovered. I take a very different view of what their family went through: Their doctor should have  never  given them such a certain (and negative) prognosis. We know that it is hard to predict where an autistic child will be years from now. We know there are a  range of developmental trajectories . We know that some therapies work very well for some autistic children but don\u2019t make a difference to others, we know some autistic children have gut disturbances whereas others don\u2019t, we know that  autism has multiple different causes . We know some severely autistic children become well functioning children without the need for dietary interventions and ABA too. Let me put this in a simple form for you: ABA and dietary interventions are  neither necessary nor sufficient  to recover a child from autism. Can they help? Yes, for many they can. Are they a miracle, that the dominant medical establishment is ignoring? No, not even close. Scientists have studied and continue to constantly study autism interventions and to openly share their findings, no one is hiding this from autism families. There is no conspiracy going on to keep autistic children severely autistic. If we stop the story here, there\u2019s nothing overly upsetting with the Sewells. Yes they seem to be acting like they found \u201cthe cure,\u201d yes they use language that many in the autism community finds distorting and dangerous, yes they seem to be ignoring the fact that autistic individuals are a very diverse bunch who don\u2019t all respond to the same therapies in the same ways, yes they are promoting what is considered by some to be an abusive therapy option. But the story doesn\u2019t stop there, because the Sewells are promoting some other very dangerous organisations and views. That becomes clear very quickly by even the most cursory of glances at their suggested\u00a0 \u201clinks\u201d list \u00a0(which has been carefully compiled \u2013 it only has 14 links on it, out of the thousands they could have chosen). It includes \u201cGeneration Rescue\u201d \u2013 the widely criticised\u00a0Jenny McCarthy charity that  promotes the view that autism is caused by vaccines \u00a0(the fact the Sewells align with Jenny McCarthy can be seen from way back in  2008 when they got a Stuff.co.nz piece  written about how she inspired them) \u2013 and \u201cAutism One,\u201d who  run conferences  where people like Wakefield (that\u2019s right, the guy who lost his medical license and committed fraud), Jenny McCarthy (also in the vaccine-causes-autism camp), and homeopaths (need I say more) are invited to talk to vulnerable autism parents \u2013  the\u00a0Autism One\u00a0website  similarly promotes such\u00a0views.\u00a0The Sewells also  promote \u201cDefeat Autism Now\u201d (\u201cDAN\u201d) , again, one of the most notorious agencies for dis-proven autism interventions, who have even  been sued for prescribing dangerous and un-necessary interventions  for autism such as chelation. This list of people and views the Sewells promote, sits alongside\u00a0the language they use \u2013 talk of cure, miracles, and the general view that having autism is a \u201ctragedy,\u201d something to be \u201cfought\u201d and \u201cbattled.\u201d It has not been surprising to see autistic adults and other autism parents on the  Seven Sharp Facebook page , fighting back against the language and the way the Sewells view autism; talking about autism in such a loaded and negative way as the Sewells do, furthers the stigma against autistic individuals. Indeed, the Sewells appear to think autism  is itself  a stigma, a stigma that is removed not through fighting myths and stereotypes but through \u201chealing:\u201d\u00a0\u201c when you heal a medical condition the stigma of autism goes away .\u201d Personally, I would rather people didn\u2019t go about promoting and funding a group that itself promotes and supports dangerous and disproven autism interventions. If you want our government to fund more ABA, well OK, I get that \u2013 ABA done well can definitely help some children. If you want to rejoice in the story of a family who found their own way to help their own daughter reduce her most debilitating autism symptoms, well OK, I get that too, let\u2019s all be happy for them. But\u00a0I wish the media and the public were being a bit more careful about what they\u2019re pushing here. I would rather not see the Sewells and their organisation being presented as fighting for the rights of autism families, when what they evidently believe about the nature and cause of autism is what\u00a0so many of us have been fighting  against  for years. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tvnz.co.nz/seven-sharp/parents-call-funding-autism-treatment-video-5966894", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/10027611/Singer-devotes-himself-to-fighting-autism", "http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/autism-and-celebrity/", "http://sewellfoundation.com/", "http://thecaffeinatedautistic.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/the-good-bad-and-the-ugly-my-assessment-of-our-experience-with-applied-behavior-analysis-aba/", "http://autismmythbusters.com/parents/therapy/the-truth-about-aba/", "https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/news/2012/long-term-studies-chart-autisms-different-trajectories", "http://www.ted.com/talks/wendy_chung_autism_what_we_know_and_what_we_don_t_know_yet", "http://sewellfoundation.com/?page_id=38", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Rescue", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/382688/Star-inspires-autism-battle", "http://skepchick.org/2012/06/infiltrating-the-autismone-conference/", "http://www.autismone.org/", "http://sewellfoundation.com/?p=109", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/05/suing-dan-practitioners-for-malpractice/", "https://www.facebook.com/sevensharp?fref=ts", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/10027611/Singer-devotes-himself-to-fighting-autism"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/05/11/support-the-sewell-foundation-no-thanks/", "title": "Support \u201cThe Sewell Foundation\u201d?

{"date": "May 3, 2014", "body": "I\u2019ve seen a recent resurgence of my fellow autism parents being accused of justifying murder. They are accused of justifying murder\u00a0because they bring up the issue of inadequate family support when\u00a0faced with stories of parents murdering autistic children. The claim\u00a0against them\u00a0goes like this: \u201cBy bringing up the issue of support, you are justifying the murder of these autistic children, there is no excuse for murder and now is not the time to talk about support.\u201d I can give you one of a very large number of examples of exactly this attack, this example is taken from  an admin on the Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism public\u00a0Facebook page , which is a very popular forum: \u201c But the time to talk about services is not now. It is any time BUT now. And if you can\u2019t understand why connecting the two is justifying murder, then perhaps you should walk away and mull it over .\u201d Even though this reply was not directed at me (I didn\u2019t comment on that or any other recent discussions there), I did \u201cwalk away and mull it over\u201d and reached the following conclusion: Those claiming that bringing up the issue of inadequate support for autism is justifying murder, are (1) completely and utterly incorrect about the meaning of the word \u201cjustify,\u201d and (2) are being hypocritical in the extreme as they use these murder incidents to push their own agenda. First, the word \u201cjustify.\u201d Providing an explanation for an action, is not the same as justifying the action. To justify something is to say you think it is  right, proper, defendable, guiltless . I have never \u2013 not even once in all the forums and blogs I\u2019ve read of this topic \u2013 heard a single parent of an autistic child say that murdering an autistic child is any of those things. In fact, they often explicitly say that no matter what motivated the murder \u2013 whether it was a mental health issue or whatever else \u2013 that the murder is always unacceptable. Words matter \u2013 there is a huge and important difference between justifying something and explaining something. To explain something is to make it clearer, it doesn\u2019t contain a judgment of the  worth  of the explanation \u2013 unlike the word \u201cjustify.\u201d Anyone who treats an explanation as always being the same thing as a justification, is not only wrong, they are deliberately inflaming and upsetting the person who is trying to communicate with them. I have trouble reading the situation in any other way. If you need an example that isn\u2019t so upsetting, think of all the times you\u2019ve heard people talk about the relevance of poverty, lack of education, and gangs when it comes to burglaries. Do we honestly think that bringing up these issues \u201cjustifies\u201d the burglary? No, they go towards  explaining  the crime. Bringing those issues up does not mean we don\u2019t care about the victim of the crime. In fact they may be brought up with the intent of finding ways to avoid further future victims. In much the same way that bringing up factors like inadequate support services of autism families does not mean you don\u2019t care about the child who has been murdered, but that people are trying to find a way to help avoid these stressors building up in other families. It would be a different case if the stress of inadequate services was considered entirely  irrelevant  to these horrific murders, but then that claim should be made very expressly as a response: \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t think you should bring up inadequate services for autism families, is because I consider that to be irrelevant to the murder.\u201d That is not the same as what I\u2019ve been seeing around, which is \u201cdon\u2019t bring that up now, you\u2019re justifying the murder.\u201d It\u2019s important to understand too that it is perfectly possible and logical to show concern for both parties involved in a crime. We live in a society where we provide counselling and rehabilitation to criminals, as well as counselling and support to the victims. Do we think that people who do social work within prisons are evil, callous or don\u2019t care about the victims, just because they try to understand and help the criminal? Surely not. Do we all accept that the safety and well-being\u00a0of the victim takes precedence though? Surely yes, and we can see that understanding and rehabilitating the criminal is a way to further protect victims too. I don\u2019t think it is rational or fair to condemn people for trying to help and understand a person who committed a criminal act, except where doing so would be putting that person in higher priority within society than the victim. Again though, I have not seen any parents who think a murdering parent is more important than the child, I have seen plenty of people accuse them of this though simply because they tried to understand how anyone could do something so heinous as kill their own child. I would point out again too, that those who try to understand what factors lead to a murder, are trying to find ways to avoid it happening again. What about the point that this is not the time to bring up issues of inadequate support services; that bringing up that issue now is insensitive and that people shouldn\u2019t use a horrific murder to push their agendas? Despite seeing parents told not to bring up the service issue at this time, I have seen the exact same people using these murders to push their own agendas: They use these murders to highlight the attitudes the public has towards the disabled, where they are seen as treated as expendable, lesser human being, who are a burden, who would be better off dead. It strikes me as awfully two-faced to say \u201chow dare you use this crisis to push your support-services agenda\u2026 when I\u2019m busy using it to push my disability-attitudes agenda.\u201d (In fact, the more cynical part of me wonders if this point\u00a0isn\u2019t behind the attacks on parents pushing the services-agenda; other people get annoyed when the spot-light gets taken off their own pet project.) To make it very clear that pushing one agenda in\u00a0this is no different than the other, consider the following two claims: \u201cBy talking about inadequate services for the person who murdered, you are justifying them murdering the disabled child.\u201d How is that (essentially) any different from: \u201cBy talking about a murderer\u2019s negative attitudes towards the disabled, you are justifying their murder of the disabled child.\u201d Both statements are confusing explanation with justification, and the intentions of those talking about inadequate services is the same as the intention of those talking about attitudes towards the disabled: Both are trying to understand and find ways to prevent the murders happening again. You may see one key difference though: You may think those talking about the attitudes towards the disabled are focusing on the victim, whereas those talking about inadequate services are focusing on the murderer, and thereby you may think those talking about services are putting the murderer\u2019s interests and perspective above the victim\u2019s. But this is not convincing at all. Poor attitudes towards the disabled and poor service provision negatively affects the entire family \u2013 including both the child and the mother. If you are part of a family in a society where people look down on the disabled as worthless, you will know that the mother also gets attacked and judged and considered faulty and worthless for the child she created, she will typically try to shield her child from these views and fight them tooth-and-nail \u2013 both her and the child are impacted. Of course when services are inadequate, not only is a mother left unsupported, so is her child. When people talk about inadequate services, this is relevant to both victim and perpetrator, it\u2019s not solely about the person who did the murdering, and I consider it deliberately distorting to say it is otherwise. The mother-child unit is a close one; to care for one is to benefit the other, it goes both ways. In summary: (1)\u00a0It is incorrect and hurtful to claim that people are trying to justify the murder of autistics by bringing up the relevance of inadequate support-services; (2) it is perfectly logical and possible to try to understand and care about both a criminal and a victim; and (3) it is highly hypocritical to claim that others aren\u2019t allowed to use an event like someone\u2019s murder to push an agenda of inadequate services, whilst you push your own agenda (e.g. about attitudes towards the disabled). My own views \u2013 if you care to hear them \u2013 are that it is very hard to figure out what motivates a\u00a0murder without the intense investigation typical of a court-case, and I think it over-simplifies them in a way that does a disservice to both the victim and the perpetrator if we try to turn such events into a public service announcement \u2013 whether that announcement is about attitudes towards the disabled or about inadequate services. I have  written before on complexities  involved in figuring out motivations, looking at what historically motivates the killing of children. I have also written before on the frustration of  all autism parents being treated like potential murderers . In neither of those posts did I hop on anyone\u2019s band wagon, or try to turn a real disaster into a platform for some other cause. And I hope that anyone reading this post would not see me doing that either. All I am doing is responding to the very poor, distorting, and hypocritical arguments I see on almost a daily basis now, attacking parents of autistic children who are desperately trying to understand how another parent could ever have taken a child\u2019s life. Attacking each other like that lumps accusations and hurt on people who deserve neither, and just perpetuates the current climate in the autism community of parents against self-advocates \u2013 a division which is un-necessary, unhealthy, and counter-productive to the ultimate aims of both groups. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/thinkingpersonsguidetoautism?fref=ts", "%20But the time to talk about services is not now.

{"date": "September 30, 2014", "body": "Before I was a mother of an autistic child, I had certain presumptions about the services a family like mine would be entitled to. I thought mothers who had to quit their jobs to look after their high needs children full-time would get a benefit that would cover basic expenses, similar to what you might get from an unemployment benefit. I was wrong. I thought schooling support would be automatic and cover the child\u2019s basic needs. I was wrong. I was wrong about a lot of things, and yet somehow it still manages to surprise me when I encounter major short-falls in a system that is supposedly in existence to help the neediest members of society. This post though is not about that short-fall in itself, it is about the damage that gets done to those who have to access and navigate the system, in order to squeeze out inadequate support and services. It is about how different I have become over the past eight years, and how I feel a fair chunk of that personal change is thanks to the way the system is (poorly) run. \u201cBroken\u201d (Free use image) I am not OK. I am stressed, often depressed. I am sleep-deprived. I have high anxiety. I am fragile. I feel broken. As hard as it has been being a mother of the children I have, that job has been made so very much harder by the government\u2019s systems. From the first day you reach out for help with your child, it\u2019s like a highly judgmental never-sleeping set of eyes enter your life. They first assess whether the child\u2019s problems are all your fault as a faulty parent, and when they decide the problems are real and exist independently, you have to maintain perfect parenting as therapists and social workers and educationalists and bureaucrats breeze in and out of your life; taking notes, comparing you to \u201cthe average,\u201d measuring your actions and words and emotions. I learned that if I showed them my anger and frustration about the lack of services, I would be stone-walled and put to the back of the queue until I could behave myself; if I showed them sadness and despair then the services for my son would be placed further down in priority and attention would shift away from him to me no matter how much I insisted my sadness was because I needed his services in place, again putting his services on hold; if I showed relaxed calm or happiness I would receive comments along the lines that my family seems to be doing fine and maybe we don\u2019t require the level of services we\u2019ve been receiving anymore; if I showed a stone-face of little emotion then there must be something wrong with my emotional connection with my child and again the focus would shift unhelpfully and incorrectly to me. Over the years I have been forced to tightly control my emotional, facial, and body-language interactions with the government employees to keep them focused on what matters and why they are in my life \u2013 to get my son what he needs. I have learned to smile a little and appear confident, but not cocky or too sure of myself, I control every aspect of who I am when I have to deal with these people, and it is mentally exhausting. That exhaustion can become overwhelming. If I have a visit due from the local Needs Assessment Services Coordinator, or an IEP, or any other government-funded visit or assessment or phone call, I find myself completely wiped out for the rest of that day. So much rides on saying the right things, in the right way, and making myself appear right to them. If I screw it up then my precious sons face the consequences of my failure, and I can\u2019t be OK with that. I have to get it right \u2013 make it look right \u2013 even if it ruins me. I have become so used to the exact precision required in filling out forms and applications to first get and then to retain government services and support, that it has enhanced my already unhealthy inclination towards being overly detailed-obsessed and a perfectionist. The time and cost involved in getting it wrong, can be of such significance that it makes sense to obsess. That plus the feeling of always having the government watching and judging, plus the need to tightly control my emotions and appearance when interacting with these people, and none of this is healthy for me. I have been shaped into what they want me to appear to be: In control and calm. I feel like I have to be the background noise of my son\u2019s life just to keep their focus on him and not me, I have to play my role as defined by them to make sure they play their role. Through it all, after years of this, I am feeling utterly shattered, but I am extremely good at putting on my mask and getting through my day. My son is doing so much better now in his life, he is doing fantastically and I have so much hope for his future. But me? I don\u2019t have so much hope for me or my future, and I\u2019m not even sure who I am anymore. I know I shouldn\u2019t talk openly about how broken I am in the autism community either, because every time one of my many autism mum friends speaks out they get loudly attacked by other members of the autism community who consider their honesty and emotions to be irrelevant or inappropriate when all the focus should be on the child. It just reinforces for me that my own experiences and emotions aren\u2019t important. Say the right things, look the right way, smile at the right times. The child always comes first, the mother is a back-drop. So yeah, I\u2019m damaged. My son\u2019s autism wore me down, then the government came to help and hurt me worse in the process. I want to say \u201cit was worth all the heartache and headaches to get my son where he is today,\u201d but I just don\u2019t think it had to be done that way. There must be a better way to run the system, that doesn\u2019t crush the people it\u2019s meant to help. This shouldn\u2019t be OK. This isn\u2019t OK.

{"date": "June 17, 2014", "body": "One of the most enduring experiences for me as the mother of an autistic child, is a deep and growing sense of isolation. No, not just a sense, a  reality  of isolation. There was a time when the reality was devastatingly obvious to anyone who knew me, because I couldn\u2019t talk on the phone or in person or have anyone around the home if my son was\u00a0around, and my son was almost always around because he was so hard for others to look after. My son would violently attack me or others if I tried to communicate \u2013 or at times, even be in the same room \u2013 as others. Now, with his autism affecting him less severely, the isolation is just as real, but subtle and so much harder for others to understand, and that inability to make others understand becomes itself further isolating. I reached a point recently where I gave in, I gave up.\u00a0Interacting with what few adults were in my life was itself depressing; they talked about places they went and things they did and freedoms they had that were constant reminders of what my life isn\u2019t and maybe never will be now. I realised that whenever it was my turn to become an active participant in a conversation, that everything that came out of my mouth just made people give me piteous or worried stares, so I started trying to avoid having to share my life with others at all, and heavily censored what I did share so it didn\u2019t sound so bad. And then I withdrew even further, trying to back out of any interactions and pulled away from social media. There came the day I disconnected the internet, turned off my cellphone, pulled the phone jack out of the wall; I figured I might as well truly embrace the isolation instead of fighting it. It was inevitable after all, why spend so much energy trying to overcome it. I accepted that the focus of my life was what it had been anyway for the last many years: my son\u2019s (or sons\u2019) autism. I would interact with what few adults I had to help my sons, but beyond that I would be alone, because it was all too hard. This sense of isolation had become so much worse when my son shifted from a special school to a mainstream school two years ago, because I was no longer regularly interacting with people who actually understood my life. The autistic and other special children, their families, the access to teachers and therapists on a daily basis who got my son and my life and made me feel normal \u2013 all gone.\u00a0My son used to get invited to many parties a year back when all the kids in his class were like him and the parents saw us as wanted and normal. Now he gets invited to one friend\u2019s party a year by the one friend he has that he only became friends with because they were buddied up by the teacher last year. The friend is lovely and his family is awesome \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 but that\u2019s all my son has now. We don\u2019t belong to the wider community. The birthday party I threw for my son last year, only one child\u00a0who\u00a0had been invited turned up \u2013 the one friend. It breaks my heart for my son, and it deepens my personal sense of isolation. Then something happened on Monday that finally pulled me out of my growing funk. I attended the opening of a new satellite unit at a local school \u2013 a satellite unit is a class of high needs special children (with associated high teacher ratios, resources and skilled therapists) placed within a mainstream school. And at this event\u00a0I saw the principal of my son\u2019s old special school, and I hugged her and we discussed advocacy issues. And I saw my son\u2019s old special class teacher, and we hugged and celebrated how well my son is doing. And I saw my son\u2019s old preschool support worker, and we hugged and rejoiced in her recent success in getting more work as an aide within the school. And I saw a few of the children from my son\u2019s old special class, and just seeing them and their stims and their unique ways, just lit me up from the inside. I caught myself smiling and realised it was a genuine smile, not a forced one. I had human contact, with people who truly understood me and my son, and it was bliss. Brief, but beautiful bliss. So now here I am blogging again after a hiatus, because I feel like sharing and reconnecting again \u2013 I\u2019ve had that little lift I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself and just get on with life again. The cellphone is back on, internet is all go, and back on social media all my lovely online friends were still there for me. I know there will come a time again that the isolation builds and overwhelms me, and the foreign-ness of my life from those around me starts to hurt, but\u00a0I\u2019ll know next time to reach out and try to make physical contact with the disability community, a community that celebrates the little things, and fights to make this a better world for people like me and my son, and who \u201cget me.\u201d Because I need to be gotten \u2013 I think we all do. I\u2019d like to think that in a more inclusive society, perhaps I wouldn\u2019t feel so isolated, and there would be more people in everyday life who saw and understood and cared about these different lives we lead. But maybe it would make no difference too \u2013 maybe isolation is a part of the parenting experience when your child has autism, and us parents just need better counselling and support to navigate it. Maybe it\u2019s a necessary part of making it through that we become part of the local disability or autism community, and that\u2019s not such a bad thing anyway. Lots of maybes. I think ultimately we have to find what works for us as individuals;\u00a0for me that seems to include a cascade of\u00a0heart-felt,\u00a0much-needed and well-timed\u00a0hugs. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/06/17/isolation/", "title": "Isolation"},
{"date": "July 15, 2014", "body": "Should all\u00a0special schools \u2013\u00a0schools that specifically and exclusively cater to children with special needs \u2013 be shut down? My personal experiences, and a look at the reality of what the two types of schooling have to offer, once made me feel very strongly that these schools are an important, essential and indeed wonderful part of our schooling system. Those\u00a0experiences and those realities have not changed for me \u2013 I am still extremely grateful and very pleased with what my son received through the special school he attended for two years, and I still observe much better training, skills, ratios and services available through special schools than through mainstream schools. However there are other relevant and important factors to consider that I once overlooked, and because of those other considerations I now find myself genuinely torn in my views. Yes, the  current reality  is that mainstream teachers are not adequately trained or properly  resourced to cope well with many of our special children \u2013 there are clearly some fantastic mainstream teachers who go this extra mile, but from what I hear they are the minority and they can face burn-out while they struggle to meet the challenges. But acknowledging this reality doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s how things should be or should stay. If teachers aren\u2019t adequately trained or resourced, then isn\u2019t that a reason to make them so, rather than a reason to hold on to the status quo? Indeed it can be \u2013 and often is \u2013 argued that the continued existence of special schools allows mainstream schools and\u00a0teachers to justify remaining woefully unprepared for the full diversity of children. Surely when you spot a serious deficit\u00a0in the way things are being run, the immediate response should be to fix it, rather than to leave it as it is as if it\u2019s inherently perfect? An education system must evolve as new challenges and new research come along \u2013 education should be, by its very nature, responsive and ever-improving. I\u2019ll get to the relevant research soon, first I just want to also address another point about the reality of the current education system. The reality that gets thrown in parents faces whenever they assert their right (both legally and morally) to have their disabled children attend their local school. That reality is the current dominant attitude within our society that children with special needs don\u2019t belong in mainstream schools \u2013 that they belong in special schools (just read some of the horribly righteous responses\u00a0at the bottom of  this recent opinion piece ). Putting aside for the moment that not all disabled children qualify for entry into special schools (so that the \u201coption\u201d is not really an option at all), the very existence of special schools appears to support these exclusionary views: \u201cYour kid \u00a0can  go to school, just not a mainstream one, go put them where they belong.\u201d Even though\u00a0the child, the parents, and educational professionals may all be of the view that the mainstream classroom is the best option for the disabled child, the fact that they have a choice to attend a special school is frequently used as part of the argument for why they shouldn\u2019t be mainstreamed. On what basis might parents and professionals think mainstreaming is the better option \u2013 is it a view actually supported by research or is it just an ideological view about inclusiveness without reference to reality? I read through whatever studies and meta-studies and reviews and governmental papers I could source on the issue, and the answer here is pretty clear: Mainstreaming is either better or as good as special schools, even when those special schools offer specialized\u00a0services and have better teacher ratios. I found that a bit counter-intuitive, so I read deeper, and found that there are of course a few studies that found negative outcomes, in particular when it came to the most severely disabled children, issues around bullying, and preparing children for the real world. To elaborate a little: Parents of more severely disabled children in particular, have been found to prefer separate schools, bullying and isolation may be more likely to occur in some mainstream schools, and special schools tend to focus more on life skills (rather than purely academic skills) which can be of more benefit to disabled teens as they enter adult-hood. But those findings were not representative of the majority of studies which found social, academic and many other important benefits of mainstreaming. The weight of evidence clearly does come down in favour of mainstreaming between the two options. Where studies found no significant difference in experience or outcomes between the two options, it is fair to say this argues in favour of integration, considering principled\u00a0arguments against needless segregation of peoples and in light of the benefits that can flow to non-disabled children who are in integrated classrooms. Studies have found that those other non-disabled students\u2019 learning is not negatively impacted by the presence of the disabled children, and indeed that there can be positive outcomes for all learners in an inclusive classroom. Win-win\u2026 right? But wait a minute,\u00a0isn\u2019t it a bit simplistic to talk of special schools versus mainstream schools \u2013 aren\u2019t the quality of teachers and the programs being used with the children more important? This is a point that is picked up in research too, and yes those things matter, of course they do. But quality of teachers and programs is not automatically better just because it\u2019s a special school \u2013 I think that is a point worth emphasizing here. Just because you have more teachers in a room \u2013 for example \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean your child is getting a higher quality education. My own experience with my own child was that the special school did have better training, better resourcing, more and better\u00a0services. When my son was at his most severe, these were exactly what he needed, and he benefited hugely. However as he became less severely impacted by his autism, the special school wasn\u2019t able to meet some of his new needs and was starting to have a somewhat detrimental\u00a0impact\u00a0on his behaviours in some ways because of poor modelling (and lack of modelling). By the way, at this point I would like to address the\u00a0argument I hear far too often: that special schools don\u2019t encourage their students to be mainstreamed because they are trying to hold on to funding and numbers. I call hogwash on that. These schools are well-funded and they know it (and are grateful for it), a few\u00a0students here or there are\u00a0not going to ruin them. Furthermore \u2013 again, as I understand it \u2013 they have no shortage of families who would like to be able to send their kids to the special school but who unfortunately don\u2019t qualify to attend. I know my son\u2019s old special school would sometimes extend its existing funding to take on those children where they felt the child would benefit from what they have to offer. Indeed,  it was my son\u2019s special school teacher who told me that she believed he was ready for mainstreaming , having discussed the matter first with the principal who believed it was now in my son\u2019s best interests too. Is that the behaviour of an institution that is more interested in its continued existence than what is in the best interests of each child? Hardly \u2013 it\u2019s the exact opposite. This, and pretty much every single other experience with my son\u2019s special school, had utterly convinced me of the huge benefit of the continued existence of such\u00a0schools. They are places full of people who actively want to work with our high needs kids, people who genuinely care about our children as individuals, closely tracking their development and trying to cater to their entire well-being \u2013 physical, mental, academic. Every person I interacted with at that school \u2013 from the principal to the head teacher to the aides to the therapists \u2013 were passionate people who I trusted with my son, and that trust was well-placed. But that was my single experience, at a single school; however wonderful it was, I recognise that there are others who did not like the school, and there are \u2013 without doubt \u2013 other special schools which will not be serving their students as well as that school served my own son. I am so grateful I had the option to send my son to the exact place he needed to be, and I have never regretted that schooling decision,  as a general rule I believe having such choices is itself in the best interest of our kids and our families . But that brings me back to where I started: Mainstream schools are evidently \u2013 on the whole \u2013 better for our kids, and the public uses the existence of special schools to argue against our inclusion. So, you see, I am a bit torn. And  it turns out the New Zealand education sector is all a bit confused here too \u2013 at once pushing for full inclusion, but not pushing for the closure of special schools , where some see the continued of special schools as the opposite of inclusion. Some argue the very existence of special schools is itself a form of unjustified discrimination, and\u00a0point out that these schools come from a history of institutionalism and segregation (for example, see pages 2 and 3 of  this leaflet \u00a0(pdf) distributed by\u00a0the local charity  IEAG ). But the modern special school here uses out-reach services, and shares their expertise in mainstream schools, and creates satellite units in mainstream schools \u2013 I find it so hard to reconcile the attacks on the existence of special schools with the actual practices and people involved in modern special schools. I want to hear\u00a0what  you  think \u2013 indeed, what you  want . Do you think special schools should always exist, will always exist? Should they be shut down, reduced, increased in number? Let me know in the poll, and in the comments, and\u00a0feel free to try to persuade me to your own views \u2013 this is an interesting topic that I\u00a0am very open to and would love to hear more about. *** A few helpful links about the research in this area: \n Very good overview of the research, in Chapter 11 of \u201c Education that fits: Review of international trends in the education of students with special educational needs .\u201d (June 2010). \n \u201c Call to scrap special schools. \u201d National\u00a0news piece from 2009, also referring to overall research findings\u00a0(stuff.co.nz). \n \u201c Mainstreaming (education) \u201d entry from Wikipedia, also citing\u00a0research, and looking at the pros and cons of mainstreaming. \n Take Our Poll \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff-nation/10265079/Education-ministry-still-got-work-to-do", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff-nation/assignments/nz-election-school-of-politics/10253672/Imagine-your-child-going-through-this", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8578.12053/abstract", "http://www.ieag.org.nz/documents/IEAG_CSIE_FAQs.pdf", "http://www.ieag.org.nz/home", "http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/special_education/education-that-fits/chapter-eleven-inclusive-education", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2470269/Call-to-scrap-special-schools", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstreaming_(education)", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/8186063"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/should-special-schools-be-shut-down-includes-poll/", "title": "Should Special Schools Be Shut Down?

{"date": "March 21, 2014", "body": "Today I am honoured to share a guest post by a friend and fellow mother of a child with a disability. Antonia is mother to three children, including Max who has Down syndrome. Antonia\u2019s experience of rejection in non-inclusive school environments \u2013 rejection of both her child and herself over something her child cannot help \u2013 is an experience very common among families of children with disabilities. When she shared this piece of personal writing with me, it touched me deeply and I wanted to share it to help others understand, and to encourage them to give our children a chance at real inclusion.\u00a0 Thankfully\u00a0her children are now in a more\u00a0inclusive\u00a0school-environment\u00a0than at the time of writing, but the message remains one that needs to be heard and is widely felt.\u00a0 She has kindly given me permission to share it on my blog . Every week his sister gets an invitation to a play date\u2026 every second week his sister gets an invitation to a party. The cruel irony is that Max enjoys company and parties and knows exactly what they are, I can see his shoulders slump every time Lottie skips in with another invitation. Antonia and Max He gets his Mum to organise the odd play date, which is\u00a0never returned. The odd party but again, the gesture is never returned. He just wants friendship like everyone else, but nobody sees any benefit in the relationship for them so they don\u2019t pursue (or at least the parents don\u2019t pursue it\u2026). Max has a lifetime of this ahead of him \u2013 so it often makes me wonder why people are so\u00a0stingey\u00a0with their\u00a0kindness, a couple of hours out of their life, an afternoon of giving. No one is asking for a lifetime of giving, just the odd act of generosity. The odd \u201chow are you Max,\u201d the odd conversation, too. All of the above applies to me as well\u2026as the mother of the child with a disability. I see all the mothers effortlessly nurturing friendships, I see the eagerness in their eyes when they greet each other. I once felt that eagerness from people and I once had a swarm of friends with whom to laugh and commiserate. I loved giving people my good aspects\u2026 humour and empathy. Today I feel fragile and\u00a0untrusting. People turn their gaze from me, they clearly do not want to pursue a friendship. Nobody is interested in my story.\u00a0At times someone lets it slip that \u201ca lot of people are complaining about Max\u201d and it is like a stab in the heart. It makes me weak with sadness that people are so ruthless and\u00a0unpitying\u00a0and\u00a0ungiving. Their children have the basic ingredients to survive, my child does not. And every negative thing he does is used against him to justify the same underlying philosophy \u2013 he does not belong here with us. I can see Max and myself retreating into ourselves\u2026 and it is so against our nature. Neither of us can be the best we can be, and every day the incentives to try\u00a0slip away. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/guest-post-on-the-deeper-meaning-of-exclusion/", "title": "Guest Post on the Deeper Meaning of\u00a0Exclusion"},

In particular, she wanted to know about the processes and her options. This is a big topic, and a relatively new one to me. I\u2019m going to do my best to tackle it, but please if you want to know your rights when you find yourself in trouble you  must  talk to a lawyer or the Ministry of Education to clarify your options. What follows is my attempt to make sense of the system, and treat it therefore as a mere introduction to the system and as my effort to put it into layman terms. I will provide a range of useful links at the end of the post, please do use them if you want to refine or further your understanding. By andy logan, via Flickr The particular interest I have in writing this is concern for children with special needs, so that was my focus as I trawled through all the information, and at times in this post I will comment on where the fact that a child has special needs may be particularly relevant to proceedings. I will begin by explaining the difference between four different categories of disciplinary responses to a student\u2019s actions: Stand-down, suspension, exclusion, and expulsion. Stand-downs are when a student is removed from the school for a period of days that may not exceed five days a term or ten days a year. A suspension is when the child is removed from school awaiting the outcome of a suspension meeting. That meeting can have a range of outcomes, but must be held within seven days of the suspension. Exclusion is removing the child from the school who is under the age of 16, the child must be enrolled in another school. Expulsion is for a child 16 or over, who may enrol elsewhere if they choose to continue their school education. In deciding how to respond to a serious situation, the school must act fairly and flexibly. This means it must particularly take into account individual circumstances, including that individual\u2019s abilities. Before deciding on a course of action, there has to be an investigation into the incident. If the evidence that arises from that investigation is inadequate or incorrect or in some other way flawed, there comes in here the potential to challenge the decision. It is the principal\u2019s decision whether to stand-down or suspend a student. The behaviour has to fall into one of three categories for either a stand-down or suspension: Gross misconduct, continual disobedience, or behaviour risking serious harm. To qualify as gross-misconduct it must be decided if these two parts have been shown: (1) Was the misconduct significantly blameworthy and remarkable, and (2) serious enough to justify removing them from the school, taking into account that it could damage their education. I think it is very important to note at this stage that gross misconduct must never be  predetermined  by school policies or by breaking a school rule; you can\u2019t automatically label a particular action or behaviour as gross misconduct. The principal must also ask themself if the behaviour at issue sets a dangerous or harmful example to other students at the school. \u201cContinual disobedience\u201d has to be a pattern of entrenched misbehaviour. (I\u2019d add at this point that the term \u201cmisbehaviour\u201d and \u201cdisobedience\u201d appears to imply a certain level of intention and understanding that may not always be obviously in evidence for special needs children. Similarly the requirement for gross misconduct that the behaviour must be \u201cblameworthy,\u201d seems to me to necessarily draw-in strong consideration of a child\u2019s special needs.) Again, the behaviour would also need to be considered a harmful and dangerous example to other children in the school. The last of the three options \u2013 to do with the safety of that student and / or other students \u2013 is of a different nature than the first two categories since this is not about discipline per se, so much as safety itself. If the safety concern can be managed in any other way short of removing the child from the school, then those other measures must be used. Again, you can see how having appropriate measures in place to help and support special needs children would be relevant here too. Even after all this, just because a school could justify and go ahead with a stand-down or suspension, doesn\u2019t automatically mean it should do so. That is a separate consideration that must also be thought through. If there are special circumstances or a need for \u201cmercy or compassion,\u201d then a school should be trying to avoid these extreme measures and find other more appropriate solutions to the issue. There are various circumstances in which a student may (and in some cases, must) still be allowed to attend school even though they have been stood-down; a stand-down does not mean there are no circumstances in which the child may continue to attend the school during the stand-down period. A stand-down can also be lifted before the time period has expired, similarly the time period can be shortened. If the time period of the stand-downs is exceeding the term and year limit, then the principal must use an alternative action or may choose to consider suspending the child instead. Again, as for stand-downs, there are circumstances in which it\u00a0is possible and circumstances where it is necessary to allow a student to attend school during the suspension period. The suspension meeting held by the board following the principal\u2019s decision to suspend, is another area where things need to be done very carefully, reasonably and fairly, with an eye to natural justice. For example, if the board deliberates in private on the matter with the principal present, this may lead to a claim of bias; the role of the principal and board during a suspension meeting is not that of an ordinary board meeting. The board may choose to lift the suspension, lift it with conditions, extend it with conditions, or exclude / expel the student. The board must explain the reasons for its decision to the student\u2019s parents. If the student is excluded, the principal has an obligation to try to arrange for the child to attend another reasonably convenient school. The student\u2019s original school may choose to refuse to re-enrol the child, unless the Ministry of Education lifts the exclusion, and another school may refuse to enrol the child, unless the Ministry directs it to do so. The same applies to an expelled student, except that it is the child\u2019s decision whether to continue attending school. So what about when you think the school got it wrong? The short answer appears to be that you don\u2019t have many (or sometimes any) options for consequential review, and even the options that exist don\u2019t have much in the way of teeth. You could seek a judicial review through the High Court, but that is very costly and the courts have limited powers to quash school decisions. Complaints can also be made to the Ombudsman and Education Review office, but apparently they \u2013 though less costly \u2013 are also time-consuming and considered ineffectual. The Ombudsman can investigate complaints against a school\u2019s decision. They can recommend solutions or remedies to an issue, and has powers to get information that you may have otherwise found difficult to obtain, but it cannot enforce its recommendations. The Education Review Office may look into the complaint and refer the matter to be considered by the Ministry of Education; I can\u2019t see any specific powers it has to make any orders or recommendations to the school itself from my own research into it. The Ministry of Education though does have the power to direct a school to re-enrol a student, after they have performed their own investigations. The High Court can review whether the school met its legal obligations, in this situation as to whether it followed the correct procedures and acted in accordance with fairness, flexibility, reasonableness, and natural justice, as laid-out variously in legislation and in case-law. I\u2019m having trouble finding specific information on the extent of its powers of review in this area, and its ability to order a school to act differently, but clearly it has the capacity to quash a decision made by the school around exclusion since that was exactly what it did in the most recent high-profile case about the behavior of a young man with special needs. So there you have it: my single-night-of-research attempt to make sense of and draw together the various information you can find linked to below. If you find any errors or major over-sights in my post, please do let me know and I will rectify it as best I can. And I remind you once more: If you are in difficulty, please seek legal and professional advice, my post is neither, but I hope you find it useful nonetheless. *** \n Guidelines for Principals and Boards of Trustees on Stand-Downs, Suspensions, Exclusions and Expulsions , Ministry of Education (pdf). \n Out of School, Out of Mind , summary document from Youth Law (pdf). \n Complaints about a school made to Education Review Office,  ERO website, includes link to chart of process. \n Re-enrollment of expelled student , information on Ministry of Education website. \n Complaints about State Sector Agencies , and the  Powers of the Ombudsman and what the Ombudsman can achieve , Ombudsman website. \n New Zealand\u2019s High Court , Ministry of Justice. \n \u201c Judge quashes school\u2019s decision to exclude student ,\u201d NZ Herald, Feb 24th 2014. \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.flickr.com/photos/62645094@N00/52338136/in/photolist-5CfiE-5Bsyu1-5Uyp3X-7Afe9M-aj4GM8-8fnJRQ-anGgw2-ecLHtM", "http://www.minedu.govt.nz/~/media/MinEdu/Files/EducationSectors/PrimarySecondary/StandDownSuspensionExclusionExpulsions/SuspensionLegalGuideWEB.pdf", "http://www.youthlaw.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/Out-of-School-Out-of-Mind-Summary1.pdf", "http://www.ero.govt.nz/Help/Complaints-process/Complaint-about-a-school-or-early-childhood-education-service", "http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/StanddownsSuspensionsExclusionsExpulsions/PartOne/ReEnrolmentExcludedOrExpelledStudent/ReEnrolmentOfExpelledStudent.aspx", "http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/what-we-do/investigations/complaints-about-state-sector-agencies", "http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/faq-s#What powers does the Ombudsman have?", "http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/high-court", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11208985"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/stand-down-suspension-exclusion-expulsion-what-do-they-mean-and-what-are-your-rights/", "title": "Stand-down, Suspension, Exclusion, Expulsion; what do they mean and what are your\u00a0rights?"},
{"date": "March 5, 2014", "body": "Lately when I use the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d \u2013 whether in my writing or my speech \u2013 I\u2019ve been coming up against people who attack my use of the phrase. The arguments I encounter don\u2019t come from a singular line of reasoning or view-point, and so replying to them requires first being very clear what the complaint is. By Thijs Hooiveld, via Flickr There are those who think the term has become derogatory, and there is no doubt many do use it in this derogatory sense: Someone will do something perceived as stupid and will be told they must be \u201cspecial.\u201d So people want this term replaced with another less derogatory term. The intention is nice, but the problem remains: The people who think it\u2019s funny to compare stupid people to disabled people, will continue to do so despite the change in terminology. (Please don\u2019t have me up about the use of the word \u201cstupid,\u201d I\u2019m fully aware that\u2019s considered problematic too.) What you really need to address there is the bad attitude, the word-use is just symptomatic of the underlying problem. I have some sympathy for those who want to remove the word \u201cspecial\u201d because of this issue, much in the same way I have turned a  highly critical eye to derogatory use of the word \u201cretard,\u201d  but I don\u2019t think constantly changing terminology is going to solve the problem; you\u2019re just stuck in the same endless word-elimination game with people who still don\u2019t understand or care. Furthermore I believe changing the term to something else instead of \u201cspecial needs\u201d ignores the reason that term is in common use in the first place, so that is my next point. Its usage \u2013 both here in New Zealand and in many countries overseas \u2013 is used to signify the part of the population that has needs exceeding those already catered for in the standard public health and education system. It is a term that declares that the person needs and is entitled to extra supports and services, beyond those of the \u201caverage\u201d citizen. It signifies this without declaring the reason for the needs, so it is a usefully broad term. It also signifies the need without moral judgment as to the nature of the needs; the word \u201cspecial\u201d is not inherently negative, in fact if anything it is a word historically associated with something good or exceptional. It is, if anything, a kind way to declare extra needs. Why \u201cspecial  needs ,\u201d though? The word \u201cneeds\u201d there is important for understanding why the term is still one in high use: There is a movement (for better or worse) that insists it is respectful to distinguish the person\u2019s condition from the person them-self, in the same way that people like me get told over and over to say my son \u201chas autism\u201d or \u201cwith autism,\u201d not \u201cmy autistic son.\u201d However if you\u2019re at all familiar with my blog and my values, you\u2019ll already know I don\u2019t find that line of reasoning quite as respectful or well thought-out as it may first appear; very often disability and difference can define a person and that need not be a bad thing, indeed many are proud of that part of their identity and feel no shame or lack of humanity in recognizing what a large part their disability/difference plays in their identity.  I wrote an entire post on the point , so I won\u2019t re-hash it all here. There are very many people within the disability community who feel the same as I do, and their numbers appear to be growing, despite the continued prevalence of the \u201cperson first\u201d rhetoric. The point here though is that the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d recognises and reflects this idea that we should separate the needs of the person from the identity of the person, so you\u2019re meant to say \u201cmy son with special needs,\u201d not \u201cmy special-needs son,\u201d and so on. I\u2019m not convinced by it, but we need to recognise the point anyway to understand why the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d is still so loved by many. What then of those who argue we need to get rid of the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d because it helps shape an education system where each child is not treated like an individual, but separated into \u201cspecial needs\u201d and \u201cnormal needs.\u201d That is to say, an education system where there are the mainstreamed schools and the special schools, and that any integration of special students into mainstream students is somehow always going to be problematic. The typical preference for people with this concern, is that we instead talk of inclusion, a practice that benefits everyone and treats each as an individual, a system that is constantly responsive and recognises the cross-hatched continuums of needs and abilities of humanity; as compared to a sharp-dividing term like \u201cspecial needs\u201d that seems to pretend there is a defined group on one side and the \u201cnormals\u201d on the other. I consider this attack on the term to be aspirational: It is referring to an ideal system that currently doesn\u2019t exist, and a perspective that doesn\u2019t currently inform the reality of the public education system. In an ideal world, we would talk of and teach a broader notion of inclusivity, and at the micro-level of individual schools some may indeed embrace that approach. However, in terms of actual funding pools, dedicated resources, legislation, and changes made to existing classrooms, the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d remains important and relevant. I think it is important to recognise that the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d does reflect current educational realities, and that \u2013 if you like \u2013 the ongoing use and existence of the term at government and school level in turn reflects the short-comings of that education system. Changing the term doesn\u2019t change the system, it arguably just masks the problems with the way the system is run and funded. I therefore think those who run this argument are better off acknowledging this aspiration and fighting for the change, rather than focusing on the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d as if changing it would force institutional revolution. I\u2019m not one to tell people not to aim high, or not to fight for change, I also openly recognise that there is more than one way to force change. What I\u2019m saying rather is let\u2019s not pretend that a change in term would signify that the system that required the delineating term in the first place, is somehow now transformed or corrected. Indeed, the term \u201cinclusion\u201d is already in wide-spread use, but again only to refer to \u201cthe inclusion of those with  special needs  into a \u2018mainstream\u2019 setting,\u201d which is just a reiteration of the core complaint against arbitrary binaries of who is disabled and who isn\u2019t. Whereby arguing for a shift to the language of inclusivity and inclusion, won\u2019t be seen as particularly revolutionary to those already steeped in the current education system and its existing rhetoric. What term then could or should replace it, if \u201cspecial needs\u201d must be replaced. What term can reflect concern for person-first language, truly break-free of existing paradigms, and not be turned over time into a derogatory term against the disabled? It\u2019s a tall order, and every suggestion I have heard to replace it has inevitably bumped into one of the other arguments anyway. Words carry connotations, words get misused and abused, words that are highly respectful to one are deeply insulting to the next. So you see, I\u2019m not convinced that we need to or should change the term \u201cspecial needs.\u201d I think what we really want to change is attitudes towards disability, and a faulty education system. Changing a term \u2013 a word \u2013 might make us feel better about these things or momentarily hide the injustices that lead us to want a new word in the first place, but I don\u2019t think there are strong arguments to discard it at this point. Were it to become clearly and consistently used in the same insulting way as \u201cretard,\u201d or come to no longer represent the way the education system is actually run, I think the arguments would be that much stronger. Until then though my own fight continues to be focused at the system and attitude level. My son has special needs. I have a special-needs son. This causes me no shame, or humiliation, and doesn\u2019t make him any less human to say it out loud. It\u2019s just a factual statement about him in the world as it\u2019s currently run, for better or worse. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.flickr.com/photos/90889565@N00/2206508102/in/photolist-4mYVZ9-59Su3B-5c3D7a-5mWTTj-5ySAZr-5ySB5D-5yWVcb-5FfgsG-5QM6Bt-67Ct6E-6gDxpY-6kAjMZ-6mDr1a-6pa2cY-6rvpsH-6BN7rD-7668MX-78fxfA-7nBDAd-7u5j45-7vtUHP-7W5zZU-fbm7pY-jLQMYc-ajQ9wN-ajQ8Eh-8hAg4h-banvEZ-banx8k-aq8gxs-7xPcwN-7WfNfb-attgyK-dX7vX7-7LRQgD-bviDjY-bJdsBv-bviCaG-9kFY13-8Y81bu-dSo3QQ-89kkse-9SvZ4v-9f7Yx8-9Ur8jZ-7RE5Zh"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/the-s-word-attacking-and-defending-special-needs/", "title": "The \u201cS\u201d Word: Attacking and Defending \u201cSpecial\u00a0Needs.\u201d"},

Similarly someone can have a\u00a0neurological\u00a0condition and yet\u00a0we\u00a0can and should still recognise that their\u00a0individualism\u00a0and individual\u00a0interests\u00a0and\u00a0ways of\u00a0doing things, is not automatically part of some pathology.

Persistent non-conformity in\u00a0at least one of the following: \n Refusal to fit inside the middle\u00a0of a current bell-curve model for normality, \n Insistence on holding own views even when they do not match those of the majority of peers, \n Interests outside normal gender, age, race, or other societal grouping. \n B.  The differences result in standard education, health and welfare\u00a0suppliers being\u00a0forced to rethink their views and practices, causing disturbing questioning of existing\u00a0assumptions and current paradigms. May also cause defensiveness, aggression, and resistance to change in those already taking part in established services; these reactions are the fault of the person with Individualism Disorder and therefore evidence of the depth of the pathology. C.  The onset of Individualism may appear at any time, but will often be preceded by birth. D.  Individualism Disorder frequently co-occurs with other disorders,\u00a0and is associated with being a human being.\u00a0Individualism is very common among those with autism. Recommended intervention : Label the individual and their views as pathological, frown a lot and show parents latest bell-curves until parents also frown a lot and look suitably distressed. Make the affected individual change behaviours, speech and thoughts until they all outwardly conform. Success in this program is often marked by the individual becoming sad, disillusioned, and no longer pursuing their personal interests. The depth of pathology must be marked on a severity scale of\u00a0Level One (requiring substantial reprogramming), Level Two (requiring lots of disapproving looks \u2013 which may be directed at parents if child is not old enough to respond to the disapproval of strangers yet \u2013 and social isolation), or Level Three (requiring muttering behind the child\u2019s and family\u2019s back until pressure to conform builds up appropriately). Under no circumstances should society\u00a0or statistics be rethought or altered\u00a0to recognise Individualism, this will only encourage other members of society to think Individualism is normal and acceptable, and lead to a pathological society where abnormal would become the new normal and we\u2019d have to rewrite this whole damn diagnostic manual again. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.co.nz/2014/02/autism-and-average.html", "http://www.disabilityandrepresentation.com/2014/03/24/on-normalcy-and-identity-politics/", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/27712028@N06/5584227883/in/photolist-9vsCp6-8CFSbD-aFp13X-aFp2qD-fnJhzc-8hC2HL-8DRGfg-8MSiG9-8MSitf-ekEPJz-eGEMYA-8aea89-ci4akQ-8xqN18-a8YHZz-dFyJnL-dFti2c-buaDXj-8M7aXU-bAzR4P-bsFe76-eWrPhr-8c8jcE-gi41Rg-dbWFvu-dbWFuG-edPx3o-8E1Shm-bC36s4-fpfoJv-dpVdRS-dquhjz-cj3vd1-eZ6AdR-eZhWWY-avPGtN-f3Hve8-btkkU3-912s1N-8ZYmpK-912rYU-8ZYmqX-8ZYmrX-afY7KN-fjF5Qr-bmFmjK-9urR1r-cj2yHA-cj2sQb-cj2uRj-cj2r3A"], "link": "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/individualism-disorder/", "title": "Individualism Disorder"},
{"date": "March 20, 2014", "body": "I have been following the case of Green Bay High School excluding a student who has Aspergers and other special needs, a case that the school lost in the High Court. The school lost that case for very convincing reasons. Despite the strong and clear judgement from the High Court that the school failed the student in a number of ways and should not have excluded him, Green Bay High School is  seeking leave to have the case taken to the Court of Appeal. Bu Michael Kappel, via Flickr When I first heard about the appeal I went from incredulous to outraged, and the more I read about the school\u2019s perspective and actions on the matter, the more annoyed I became. This is not just a case of a school under-supporting and misunderstanding the supports made available to a student in their care, not just a case of a school that performed inadequate investigations into an incident that they used as a basis for excluding a child; more than that, this is a case \u2013 in my eyes \u2013 of a school that is willing to spend money, time, effort on whatever it takes to exclude a child rather than put the same money, time and effort into including them. This is clearly a case where inclusion  is possible , strategies for successful inclusion had been shared with the school but not implemented when needed, strategies for successful inclusion had worked at other schools too; this is not an impossible child who can\u2019t be managed, rather this is a  school that is failing in its own management  of students. I\u2019m basing my views here on every type of public report I can get my hands on, but most of all on the court\u2019s own decision which does a comprehensive job of outlining the circumstances that lead up to the incident. I found the decision to be rather damning of the school, and with good reason. The school was slow to implement support, took away some supports that had been put in place, and was not utilising strategies suggested expressly by specialists, yet argued in the court case  that the Ministry of Education was at fault  for failing to provide adequate support. The school was meant to perform a thorough investigation into the incident that lead to exclusion, but didn\u2019t even hear from the mother at the Board of Trustees meeting on the matter, and the court considered that what the mother had wanted to share with them was important and relevant. Furthermore the principal was ill-informed, thinking an IEP was in place in order to help the student, without realising the IEP had been focused on removing supports. (The judge also raises the question of whether the incident was even severe enough to qualify as gross misconduct, though they didn\u2019t feel the need to ultimately express an opinion on that point due to their previous findings.) And so Green Bay High School was meant to start taking steps to allow the child to return. It did not. It has not. The case\u2019s outcome meant the student was still enrolled at and entitled to attend class. A month has passed since that first decision, and  according to the family and their lawyers the school has not engaged with them  to follow through on the court\u2019s ruling. Instead we hear the school is going to now appeal the case. On what grounds, I don\u2019t know and can\u2019t see yet, but I suspect they\u2019re going to claim the child is some sort of uncontrollable demon based on  a set of quotes in this news piece : \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with someone who goes from calm to angry, to very angry, to angry and aggressive, in a millisecond \u2013 and that\u2019s a really hard thing for staff to deal with,\u201d [the Board Chairman] said. \u201cWe have to put a huge priority and importance on the other students. They have to be safe and the teachers have to be safe.\u201d Even if that description of the child is entirely accurate (and frankly it sounds like a rather obvious and simplistic exaggeration to me), I feel like they\u2019ve still missed the point: the student needs support, appropriate support, and with appropriate support the student can and has flourished in the past. It sounds to me like the school has given up, or doesn\u2019t want to try, or thinks it shouldn\u2019t have to try. If we as parents of special needs children took the same stance a the school seems to, all our kids would end up in institutions, separate from the rest of society because it was just too hard or we weren\u2019t willing to try.\u00a0But we fight, and we learn, and we don\u2019t give up, and we expect schools to do the same, rather than seek to just get these kids out of sight out of mind. If Green Bay High School really wants to keep its staff and students safe, it should be willing to do whatever it can to help this student to manage his own behaviours, with the calming and coping strategies suggested by specialists. If they are unwilling to do that, they are doing a disservice to the entire school population, not just this single child; a school that is unwilling to learn and adapt and fight for the well-being of all its students, is not one I would ever send my own child to, with special needs or otherwise. It is the opposite of modern inclusive education; it is old-school exclusion based on difference, on disability in this case. It is hurtful, harmful, and threatening to families like mine whose children just need a little understanding so they can get the education every other child gets in this country. But really, who am  I  to say the school should be ashamed? I don\u2019t attend or run the school, I didn\u2019t sit through the court case, and I don\u2019t pretend that I have. I leave you to make up your own mind, draw your own conclusions based on the facts presented by all sides. The news stories take their various leanings \u2013 to such a degree that sometimes you even wonder if they\u2019re talking about the same student and situation \u2013 but the court case was a search for truth and justice, and presented agreed-upon facts, used objective evidence, and applied the relevant law; if you want a real overview of what sort of child and school this case is all about, please take the time to read it for yourself. I\u2019ll give the school this much: A mind that can be changed. I will see what case they make for the appeal, I will see how they think the judge got it wrong, and I want to see whether the grounds are considered strong enough to grant the appeal, and then of course I will read any appeal case too. I will let the facts change my mind about the school and the way it is run, because I would like to be wrong, I would like this school to have actually tried its best and genuinely acted in the best interests of all students, and not simply put this poor boy\u2019s future and education in the too-hard basket. And if I am wrong, I will come back to this post and apologise and set the record straight, with the same willingness to learn and be corrected that the school should be showing its community; a community that does not and should not exclude those with special needs. But on what I know so far, the school should be ashamed, and should be examining its  own  short-comings, rather than continuing to publicly defame a 14 year-old boy in the media as they drag the family back into court instead of getting on with educating him. *** To access the pdf of the High Court decision from February 2014, click the first search result that comes up  through this link .
