I had hired a babysitter to come with us, so the twins wouldn't be stuck in the stroller.  But when we picked up our packets (which included cowboy hats, bandana and sheriff's badges), they introduced us to our \"Rodeo Buddies\".  Each child had a buddy assigned to him or her, so that the parents could relax and have fun.  What a great idea! B. was fine with his buddy, but G. was terrified by his.  So Rob, a ninth grade boy scout, followed me around, and pretty much talked my ear off. After about twenty minutes of knock-knock jokes, and verbatim routines from sit-coms, I was starting to get a feeling about Rob.  Then, out of the blue he said to me, \"Have you heard of Asberger's Syndrome?\"  He claimed to be \"five-percent Asbergers\".  He was really a great kid, but struck me more like a sixth grader.

As far as I know, nothing in particular has changed (although G. did come back out of his no talking/no signing stage, which was, as always, a huge relief).  Anyway, I just have the feeling that things will be alright.  I spoke to my \"autism mom mentor\" this past weekend, and she gave me a lot of encouragement.  Her son was never as delayed as the twins are, but she thinks he was more distant and aloof. Now he's doing very well although of course he's still on the spectrum. Part of her advice to me was not to worry about money for the next year or two, and get all the therapy we possibly can. My husband is always more laid back about money than I am, so I'm lucky in that way.  The last few days I've put a lot of my energy into sensory integration--learning about how to do the brushing protocol, and ordering a swing which we can hang in a doorway.  Since we've put a little climbing structure in our backyard, B. has been so happy!  He has stopped biting his hand, and I suspect it may be because he now has the outlet of climbing.  I'd like to get him something to climb on inside, but right now he settles for hanging off the back of the couch. One of the reasons I love our current OT is that she gets so excited about B.'s climbing or even about his sitting on the arm of our rocking chair.  She is always able to see strengths in him that I so need to hear about right now. G. said his first three-syllable word today.  It was \"Tortoro\", the name of a character in a Japanese children's movie that a friend gave us.  It's funny, he'd only said two or three words all day (although he has been signing a lot), and then suddenly he was saying \"Tortoro......Tortoro\" very quietly. Next week we have B's MRI.  I'll stay home with the other two boys, and my husband will take him.  I wish I could go, but we couldn't find anyone  who could come over early enough to babysit.  A few weeks later, G. will have his MRI, and we can both go to that one.  I'm not expecting that there is anything wrong in their brains, but the devl. pediatrician said they have strangely-shaped heads.  They were monoamniotic twins, meaning that their cords were tangled throughout the entire pregnancy, so things have been unusual from the beginning.  For three weeks we believed that they were conjoined, and someday I plan to blog about that crazy period of our lives. Oh, the second part of the title of this post refers to a comment we got recently.  I didn't actually hear it.  A friend of mine was with B. at a playspace when a man and his son joined them.  The son really wanted to play with B., and B. was happily ignoring him.  My friend mentioned that B. has autism, and the dad said, \"Oh, I don't believe in any of that!\", along with a few comments about everyone having a diagnosis these days, etc.  When my friend told me, for some reason it struck me as funny (If an in-law of mine had said it, I'd be outraged.)  It hadn't occurred to me that I could choose not to believe in autism.  Is it like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?  Even if that were true, I'd  keep believing in it, because it helps me understand the odd, funny, loveable ways of my twins. For some reason, this got me wondering about what Tom Cruise and Scientology think of autism. I'll have to Google it. My new attitude about blogging is that I am going to try to stop being intimidated by the blogs which strike me as so well-written and wise and the type of thing which could actually be turned into a book someday.  I feel my style is more of a stream-of-consciousness, sleep-deprived, I'm-trying-to-ignore-the Heffalump-sounds-coming-from-my-older-son's-room style. It does feel therapeutic to blog, and it's definitely very helpful to read other autism parents' blogs and comments.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/04/feeling-optimistic-autism-vs-easter.html", "title": "\nFeeling Optimistic/ Autism vs. the Easter Bunny\n"},

J. holds the hose, with a sprinkler attachment and waters the grass, and the deck and parts of the house.  B. stands in the spray with a huge grin on his face, laughing out loud.  J. is thrilled to be able to make B. smile.  We aren't sure but we think we heard B say \"wawa\" for the first time. G. is in a funny stage where he acts as if he's forgotten most of his signs.   But he did use the sign for \"mom\" (in reference to his large toy duck, not to me, but we're getting closer) and he did kiss me two times in the last two days.  He's kissed his toys before, but never me til now. I am going to assume that G. hasn't really forgotten all those other signs, because whenever I freak out about one of these stages, so far they have always passed. I have GOT to download that browser that will let me load photos.  We still have dial-up service which seems to be the internet equivalent of using carrier pigeons or the Pony Express, and the download says it will take three hours.

{"date": "Thursday, April 26, 2007", "body": "\nLately I have been reading the book \"Let Me Hear Your Voice\", by Catherine Maurice.  I'd heard of it many times, but avoided because I associated it with the words \"Lovaas\" and \"recovery\", both of which I have mixed feelings about. I  was immediately drawn in by her writing, and by the fact that she's not any sort of zealot (so far, but I haven't finished it yet), just a very hard-working and loving mom.  Even though she gives so much credit to her ABA therapists, I think equal credit goes to her, and all her \"incidental teaching\". She sang songs and played and talked with her kids for hours every day. I was particularly moved by the section of the book in which she realizes that her youngest child is also autistic.  The huge effort she put into convincing herself that it wasn't true reminded me of myself almost a year ago.  I remember staring at each twin thinking, \"He just smiled at me, he can't be autistic\"...\"He is climbing up into my lap, so he can't be autistic\" and so on.  It is a little hard to read this book and not think \"If I hired enough people, and spent every second getting my boys to interact, could they also progress so fast?\"  G. is pretty easy to engage, and even seeks me out, but B. spends quite a bit of time doing his own thing.  It's hard work to get him interested in things, and it might help if I hired a fresh face to work with him. While I think he should have times to relax and be himself, I also feel like I could use some help from somebody with experience interacting with kids like him. As far as the concept of \"recovery\" goes, neither my husband nor I consider ourselves completely \"normal\", so we've never expected to have kids who were so.  To fit into our family, it really benefits one to be, at the least, eccentric. But I do find Maurice's book encouraging, because her kids started out from a point a lot like mine.  I feel re-energized, not necessarily to go out and set up an ABA program, but to believe that the songs we're singing and the goofy games we play are on the right track. Movie Note: Finally saw Little Miss Sunshine, and loved it.  I never cry in movies, and I cried all through this one, although officially it's a comedy, so that's a little odd.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/04/overcoming-my-prejudices.html", "title": "\nOvercoming my prejudices\n"},

Well, it's a Unitarian Universalist church, so I hardly feel that I can say I'm teaching Sunday School.  It's pretty non-traditional, but it is on Sunday morning, and I am teaching, more or less. Anyway, I dropped G. off in the toddler room.  They only had three kids total, with two teachers, so the outlook was good.  This particular teacher hadn't had G. in there before, because the twins stayed a few extra months in the infant room, until I decided to bite the bullet and admit that they really are two.  So far, they haven't quite managed the whole hour in the toddler room.  Sometimes they end up back in the infant room, and other times a woman who has a soft spot for them ends up carrying one around with her. Usually someone ends up coming to get me because one or the other is inconsolable after 40 minutes or so. I heard some whining and complaining (in G's high-pitched \"I'm not at all happy with this situation\" little voice), but amazingly enough, no one came to get me for the entire hour.When I went to get G., the teacher seemed apologetic, and said, \"I think he may be very tired.  He alternated between wandering around the room and lying on the floor.\"  I probably confused her, because I was so excited and grateful, and said, \"You don't know how great this is.  It's the first time he's stayed the whole hour in the toddler room!\"  I really felt we'd made some important progress.

By the time I finished it, I was a bit disappointed there was no mention of valid non-ABA approaches, such as floortime and RDI.  Although I should check the publication date, because I don't know what form they were in when she was writing. I think I'm still in the \"Somebody please tell me what to do\" post-diagnosis flailing stage.  I can see how people start plunking down a lot of money to consultants and doctors, because you feel like you need to do something FAST.  When I read about DAN doctors, part of me thought, we've got to see one of those.  When I read about RDI, I wanted to sign up (still true).  The ABA thing I go back and forth on.  Initially I was absolutely not interested, but now that I've been trying my own thing for almost a year, I wonder at times if it could be good for B.  Not thirty hours a week, but maybe some kind of ABA-lite. I'm trying (once again) to take a deep breath and look at the big picture.  When I first figured out we were \"on the spectrum\", I knew the kind of approach I felt comfortable with.  I started doing what I thought was best, basically some sensory integration, PECS symbols all around, sign language, and lots and lots of interaction. I still believe in what I'm doing, the root of my doubts is that I think B. needs more.  We are starting our private OT and speech in the next few months, and I think that might help me see which direction to head in.  I've met the OT twice, and have a good feeling about her.   In any case, I still think that \"Let Me Hear Your Voice\" was a good read, as long as you also read a lot of other books along with it (and what parent of an autistic child doesn't?)

It is a real relief to have everybody up and being as demanding as ever (a pain in the neck, but still a relief). Great new development: sometime in the last few weeks, B. has learned to raise his arms when he wants to be picked up, which I find completely irresistable.  It's interesting how those social milestones still happen, but so delayed (he's 27 months old now). G. is trying so hard to talk! Except for waffle, he hasn't added any words recently, but he will walk up to me, stomp his foot, yell out one syllable, and slap his thighs with his hands.  I'm not sure if he has a word in his mind, or if it's a more general dissatisfaction he wants to express.    I went to my first Chuck E Cheese birthday party today. Ye gods! I'm not someone who thrives in an atmosphere of a lot of flashing lights and noise. I'd say J. dealt with it well (his first birthday party that didn't eventually dissolve into tired tears), but he did spend almost all of his tokens riding on a Telletubby ride that was intended for the really little kids.

My husband tries to be helpful.  He is still convinced they are going to grow out of this, and just be slightly eccentric.  Believe me, that sounds like a great outcome.  And I do love them the way they are (which is very sweet, most of the time), but I also worry about them too. Despite my current gloom and doom, we had a really fun time this morning.  For the first time, I took them to a playground all by myself (well, I have done it before, but usually kept at least one of the twins in a swing or stroller, to prevent anyone going AWOL).  It's a fenced playground at our local elementary school.  We even had a picnic, and they all had a blast. G. and J. jumped in puddles, and B. went down a slide a couple of times before becoming fascinated with the mulch. It's a beautiful day out, and it did jolt me out of my slump a tad.  Sometimes I'm so glad that no one (except my husband) knows I blog.  I can say whatever I like.  There are several people (family members and friends)  who are determined to say that the twins are just fine. My coping mechanism right now is to respond with,  \"hey, I bet you're right\" and change the subject.  It's not my job right now to explain early childhood milestones, and that it's strange when your child does not hug you, or know his name, or want to get your attention.  On this blog, I can go ahead and say that I'm worried and I'm not always as optimistic as I could be.  For one thing, there aren't many people reading it.  And those who do read it have probably been down this road themselves. So, bah humbug, or whatever the seasonal equivalent is.  I'm sure this mood will pass!

I have mostly focused on behavioral approaches (PECS, Floortime, etc.) so far, because I find the biomedical approaches so overwhelming.

Their brother could take a toy from them, we could go anywhere, leave anywhere, put them down for a nap, pay attention to them, ignore them, and no matter what, they were mellow and relatively happy. G. was always more attention-seeking by far.  He'll whine, or do a dance, or use signs or a word to get our attention.  With B., I've never known just how much he understands of what's going on around him. Suddenly they are trying to out-do each other in attention-seeking, with most of it being the wailing, throwing-yourself-down-on-the-ground variety.  They get mad if the other one's waffle looks larger, or if I comfort one after a tumble, seemingly neglecting the other, and on and on.  It makes for a noisy household, but it feels far more \"normal\" than the quiet of the previous two years. I have to admit that they've gone through cranky stages before, but this is the first time that the crankiness has seemed related to other people (rather than colic or teething, or some such thing).

When I was living my single life back in Boston, we saw each other every weekend, which was great. The last time we went to the aquarium in July or so, B. and G. seemed completely unaware of where we were.  This time they loved it.  G. (who has a slight penguin obsession) stood with his face squashed up against the glass, staring at the penguins.  Some of them swam right up to where he was to check him out.  B. went into his happy dance, clapping his hands and doing his fancy footwork the whole time that he watched the penguins.  J. enjoyed it, too, although he was torn between the penguins and the seals and had to keep running back and forth.  He especially liked a glass tunnel in which you could see sharks swimming overhead.   We had a picnic lunch and then walked down to look at the water.  We happened upon a great playground, and spent a while there until all three boys started to hit the fatigue wall and get cranky.  This time it was J. who got into the fire ants, but we got them off before they bit him.  He wanted to play with the giant chess set which was near the playground, so we gave it a try.  He's starting to be very interested in playing games, although chess for him right now consists of hugging the knights and ignoring all the other pieces. I can't wait until we can really play board games. This afternoon I felt as if B and G were trying to prove the doctor wrong about the MR thing (which at this point is pretty meaningless to me, anyway).  B has been saying \"up\", and a few other things.  G. was trying to do the motions to \"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\".  When J. and I were playing hide-and-seek, both the boys tried to chime in whenever I counted to ten.   Playing hide and seek with J. is funny, because first of all, he usually hides in plain sight.  Then when I try to ham it up, and look all over, saying \"Where could J. be?\",  he can't help yelling out, \"Here I am!\"  Today the twins got very excited whenever I counted, and ran around the house when I got to ten.  It was nice because we were all playing together, even though they weren't actually looking for J., as far as I could tell.  Although, I can certainly see how the point of the game isn't clear to them, given the way we play it! My short term goal right now is to replace some of G's lost wooden penguins.  He started with three, and right now we are down to one, which has been chewed on quite a bit by the dog.  I actually called the toy store in Massachusetts where my friend bought them, but they were out.  I'll try the internet.  I know he'll deal with it if the last one gets lost, but he's so cute when he plays with it.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2007", "body": "\nWell, I finally realized why I'd been feeling so negative lately.  Our appointments with the dev. ped. were coming up, and I know deep down that we wouldn't hear \"mild autism\" or \"sensory integration problems\", which is what Early Intervention said originally. So we went in to TX Children's Hospital, yesterday and today.  B. and G. dealt with it amazingly well.  G. was especially excited by all the fish tanks, and Brendan was just happy to run around the waiting room with a big grin on his face. Everyone kept commenting on how calm and happy they were (they were there on different mornings, but we got the same comments).  Mom and Dad weren't so calm, but we did okay, considering.  We always seem to get along best in real high stakes situations. The doctor saw G. first.  She (the dr.) has a very nice manner, relaxed and encouraging.  Even though G. and B. basically couldn't do much of what she presented them with, she still said lots of positive things about them.  In the end, though, she said that she believes they both have autism, and fall in the category of mental retardation.  They each have their areas of strength, of course, but overall her assessments of them were similar. She did say that they have lots of potential, and she's impressed with how much expressive language they have already learned.  When she was observing G., he kept making his little toy man kiss his toy duck, which I thought was pretty impressive (not to mention very cute).   Her diagnoses weren't a surprise for me, but I still feel like I'm grieving in a way. It's one thing for me to believe they are delayed and autistic, it's another to have a specialist tell me they definitely are.  On the other hand, we now have letters of medical necessity, which we hope will force the insurance company to pay for private therapy.  They had to get blood drawn, to check for genetic anomolies.  G. was relatively okay with it, except for the actual stick. B. was so mad about being held still that he didn't even react when the needle went in.  It took him a long time to settle down.  They both fell right to sleep on the ride home. We are supposed to schedule MRI's, and also speech and OT evaluations.  For the MRI's we have to go back to TX Children's, but I'm happy to say we can do the other evaluations and therapy practically in our own neighborhood. I feel like this post sounds kind of detached and cold, but I'm a bit burned out after the last two days.  Telling my parents was the worst part, although by the end of the phone call we were all just talking about what wonderful happy boys they are, and my mom had basically convinced herself the diagnosis is wrong. I don't blame her.  It doesn't matter that much what the label is if they are happy.

We made a speedy tour through Petco, checking out fish, cats, birds, chinchillas and other creatures in under fifteen minutes. B's favorite moment is always passing through the aisle of dog toys...\"BALL, BALL, BALL!\" (I've given up on the Wiggles'-based pseudonyms...I don't get enough sleep these days to keep such things straight) After this we always stop at a family restaurant, Sweet Mesquite (now under a new name, but I prefer the original).  They have a cuarto de familla (sp?) which features a slide, one of those sliding bead toys, and various video games.   The last few times we've been, B. has become absolutely fixated on one video game, which features various combinations of scary looking men fighting with each other.  He stands in front of it, shaking with excitement.  G. and J. are indifferent to it, although at one point when a muscle-bound Ninja type was boxing with a giant kangeroo (!!), J. did comment, \"That's not nice\". I tell myself he likes the quick movements and flashing colors, but I really don't understand it. We did manage to distract B. for short periods, during which he climbed up the slide several times.  We lucked out and had a really understanding group of kids there.  One boy joined B. in climbing up the slide, and the other kids just moved aside. G. spent most of his time eating, but did a little playing, too.  J. formed an alliance with a cute little girl, who tolerated him following her around. I think he prefers to play with girls, which is interesting. It felt like such a laid-back, run-of-the-mill family outing, and I was thrilled. The twins seem to be decreasing in their instinct to run immediately in opposite directions when released from the stroller.  And, I may have imagined it, but I thought B. just possibly might have turned around when I said his name today.

On our last few outings, I've noticed some funny looks, and I'm realizing that the twins' differentness is becoming noticeable to others.  I believe we're are entering into a whole new phase of autism-parenting: deciding how much to tell to whom.  For a long time I've been relying on saying, \"They're very shy\", which is true in a very extreme sort of way, I suppose. So far it's not actual misbehavior setting them apart.  They have an unusual way of approaching playgrounds, they tend to dance around a lot, especially in front of mirrors, and they use signs rather than speech, most of the time. It makes the twin situation feel so much more real now that others are finally noticing.  For months, it's been me trying to convince people (Early Intervention, their dad, their pediatrician) that there was a problem, namely PDD.

{"date": "Saturday, September 15, 2007", "body": "\n Warning: self-pitying vent ahead I'm up too late, tonight, seeking solace in reading other bloggers' thoughts.  I feel as if almost every day someone says to me, \"I don't know how you do it\"  I usually say something about caffeine, or that I'm lucky the twins are very mellow. Recently that mellow-ness is disappearing, which may be good for them, developmentally (I think!), but not for my ability to cope. I feel as if I've hit a wall, and I can't find the energy and optimism that usually gets me through the tough parts.  J. can't understand why B. cries so much, or why G. plugs his ears and cries in response to B's crying. J. acts out, and then I end up mad at him.  It's not a great cycle to get into, but it happens at least once a day.   Going places with all three kids on my own is really, really difficult. Even with just the twins it's hard.  I'd like to take the twins to parks while J's at school, and let them get some exercise. Both are pretty good climbers on playgrounds, but their balance and judgement has not kept up with their ability to climb.  They won't walk places with me...they go limp and lie on the ground, or try to run away.  Occasionally one will walk well with me, but I can't risk it with two, especially if there are cars around.  So they end up in the stroller, which they are out growing.  What will I do when they don't fit in the stroller? Right now my plan is to find a bigger stroller. The twins hardly eat any foods that are really food, if that makes sense.  I know this is common, but I'm not sure what to do about it. My husband says maybe we are at the hardest age right now.  Once the twins can communicate better, and when J. is old enough to understand the situation better, things will get easier (we hope)  And, most likely, they will graduate from the stroller in the next couple of years. I remember when I worked at a private school for kids on the spectrum, almost all of the kids would follow along when we took walks through the neighborhood.  There was some bolting, occasionally, but I don't remember many kids lying down on the ground and refusing to move.  So maybe that's a toddler thing. I really look forward to being able to take walks with all the boys, and I've got to believe it'll happen. Usually I fixate on the bits of progress I see, and that keeps me going.  G. is a riot these days, saying new words all the time and trying his best to sing the alphabet song.  He is replacing \"Oh, no! Careful!\" with \"Okay!\" as his favorite utterance. B. has taken to quietly reciting the alphabet, but almost without moving his lips (I don't know if it's progress, but it's interesting to watch).  J. is really liking Pre-K, and is asking tricky questions like \"Do clouds sleep?\"  I feel a little better having written this.  I'm thinking of finding another college student to help us get out of the house more.  With another adult I can actually work on the walking problem, and go to playgrounds, the mall, etc. Something needs to change to get us back to our old happy state. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/RuzYJIOso8I/AAAAAAAAAEc/5t9ylNmby9o/s1600-h/IMG_2988.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/RuzXIoOso7I/AAAAAAAAAEU/mnms9hm0YPY/s1600-h/DSCN1766.JPG"], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/09/down-in-dumps.html", "title": "\nDown in the Dumps\n"},

J. answered him by saying, \"Good choice,\" which sounds like an echo of my special ed. teacher-y way of speaking.

If you are used to New England beaches, it's a bit of an adjustment.  To me it doesn't seem as clean, and there's no zoning, so the development on Galveston isn't exactly quaint or charming.  On the other hand, you find a nice cross-section of the local poplulation on the beach, with a fun, multi-lingual, multi-cultural feel. It was very grey and very windy.  The boys loved the waves, which seemed a lot bigger than usual.  Afterwards we went out to Mooyah Burger, which everybody liked or tolerated really well.  When we go out and have such a normal family day, it's a really great feeling.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4PIfCnZj_u8/TaNXJ338DZI/AAAAAAAAAdg/togHfUZTQ7g/s1600/IMG_0294.jpg"], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2011/04/galveston.html", "title": "\nGalveston\n"},

B. was sitting in a chair on the deck, looking around at the trees, as he often does.  I overheard our neighbor's son saying, \"He's so boring!\"  J. just laughed nervously.  Then the little boy said, \"Make him scream again!\"  I think he was talking about the happy shouts that B. tends to make when he's jumping around the house.  J. was at a loss and just looked at me.  I was so disappointed in this boy's attitude, but I tried to think to myself that he's nervous around B., and doesn't understand what's going on.  So I did my best to explain autism in a few sentences, but I couldn't tell if it made much impression.  I was so annoyed by the whole interaction.  I don't know the boy's parents well, but I know the dad is always very kind toward the twins, and invited us to join a camping group he's in.  I think I'll ask the dad to talk to his son about it. Afterward I talked with J., and said there will always be some kids who don't know much about autism, and if he wants, I'll explain things to any of his friends.  J. seemed much less concerned about it than I was.  Looking back, I'm realizing that the rest of J's friends are amazingly accepting about the twins.  Our next door neighbors have a daughter with developmental delays, so between our two houses there's a lot of happy shouting, partially-clad escape attempts, and toilet-training mayhem.  To live on our street is to have at least some understanding of six year olds with special needs!  I think it was good to have a wake up call that there will be rude questions and clueless comments from kids J's age, and I need to think up some strategies to deal with them.

At the very end, in a huge crowd of Houston schoolchildren waiting for buses, a paraprofessional spaced out, and Brendan disappeared.  I had G., and I walked up to the group of aides, and asked, \"Where's B.?\"  They hadn't noticed he wasn't there.  Next came fifteen minutes of running around like a mad woman, asking the zoo officials to close the zoo gates, and saying to random people, \"If you see an autistic-looking boy in a blue shirt, grab him\".  The teacher had stayed back at the school, so I had to take charge of the situation. Despite all these years of private therapy, public education, etc., the twins have no sense of danger, and no sense of the need to stay with a group. They might respond to their names in a quiet setting, but definitely not outdoors in a crowd.  Luckily, a para found him standing in the gift shop.

Lately the ABA center keeps scaling back on what they are working on with both boys.  Each week they cut back on something.  Last week they decided not to work on motor imitation anymore because they are \"not ready\" for it (fine with me, it was just stressing them out).  Then they decided not to focus on fine motor skills. Okay.  Today they said they are going to try to make them \"feel successful\" and really reinforce eye contact and pointing. For three hours?  That's a lot of eye contact and pointing. The therapists themselves are wonderful and warm.  But I have to say, I don't know how long we are going to stick with this  G. learns things on his own, no matter what we do.  B. has definitely gotten something out of the ABA, so I'm more willing to send him for longer. I'm formulating some questions for the lead therapist, but deep down I'm relieved that ABA is not the be-all and end-all for us. For whatever reason, the twins learn more by playing at home than they do at any therapy we've tried. We do a mix of sensory integration, hanging out, being silly, going to playgrounds, watching movies and goofing off. We eat a lot of gluten and casein. And starting in the fall...preschool.  We are going through with it this time! Really, I mean it. I'm glad we are giving the ABA a try, and I think we'll stick with it through the summer. Part of each week, and the rest of it will be the usual summertime business.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/SDOSZg0MkXI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/VCPfIswCwss/s1600-h/DSCN2058.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/SDOPFQ0MkVI/AAAAAAAAAOA/KV4fhgJtCn4/s1600-h/DSCN2525.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/SDOPvA0MkWI/AAAAAAAAAOI/zpVITxp7TmI/s1600-h/DSCN2516.JPG"], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2008/05/applied-behavioral-what.html", "title": "\nApplied Behavioral What?\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2008", "body": "\n At the twins' eighteen month check-up, a little light went off in my head which said \"autism\". The first month after realizing this was the hardest, partly because no one believed me. Feeling sure that I was right, I went into a flurry of researching, reading, and generally freaking out. By the time they turned two, no one tried to argue. The last year and a half or so, i've often thought of my state of mind as \"waiting to exhale\" The phrase comes from the novel by Terry McMillan, which I read in the early nineties.  My life is so different from the women in her novel, but the title exactly fit the feeling I had. For the first year, I threw myself into Floortime, combined with what I could figure out about Sensory Integration.  I put all kinds of pressure on myself (and the rest of the family), trying to create \"circles of interaction\".  G. seemed to respond, and B. remained ever-cheerful and pretty much happily self-absorbed.  Finding the Signing Time DVD series jump-started our communication, and gave me more hope, but I was still worried and driven. That whole time, I never relaxed, never stopped spending every day wondering if I was interacting enough, engaging them enough, should I be doing GFCF, etc.  I'm still this way, some of the time, but I feel...like I'm thinking about exhaling.  I don't know if it's turning three or starting at the new ABA center, but the twins are changing.  G. is talking and making connections (he looked at a little CD player, glanced at me and asked \"Telephone?\" B. is showing interest in activities (coloring, painting, looking at books), and is repeating all sorts of words to get what he wants. More importantly, he is seeking us out for attention (which he used to do a couple of years ago). In G., it's a speeding-up of his usual learning style. In B. it's sometimes a subtle change, but a really, really nice one. The twins have always been sweet and wonderful.  And now it's great to have the experience of \"When did he start doing that??\" with them--that feeling of realizing they are growing up, and you don't know if you are ready. I feel it all the time with J., and now I'm beginning to think it about all three of them.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/R-HYAKmJI_I/AAAAAAAAANA/SLnK07FaVM8/s1600-h/DSCN2469_1.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/R-HXp6mJI-I/AAAAAAAAAM4/EhZrrtaOvQE/s1600-h/DSCN2473.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/R-HW86mJI9I/AAAAAAAAAMw/zIeoi_38Cpk/s1600-h/DSCN2460.JPG"], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2008/03/thinking-about-exhaling.html", "title": "\nThinking about Exhaling\n"},

It all felt like a normal, fun family outing, and less like a desperate attempt to have a fun family outing. Next I made a sweet potato casserole.  Making it was fun, but it turned out more like a dessert than a casserole.  Not too healthy unless they discover the life-extending effects of two sticks of butter very soon. Finally we actually went to a Thanksgiving get-together with a bunch of friends from my husband's work.  For the last few years we've had quiet Thanksgivings at home, but this year I was determined to change things up. The only other child there also has autism, and had brought many alphabet-related items, so the living room was filled with boys looking at letters for a good part of the evening.  It was great to see people I hadn't seen in a while, laugh, eat too much and relax.  J. had a nice time with a box of space-shuttle type toys, and also experimented on the piano.

There's a clinic about fifteen minutes from our house which uses a Verbal Behavior approach, and had been recommended by some parents in our Meet-up Group.  So far, B. ssems to love it, and G. is okay with it.   I was dreading the first few days, because I've seen a pattern where therapists have seemed to be angry with G., because they know he knows a lot, but he won't do anything for them.  It drove me nuts both times, but I tolerated it, because things got better once G. got to know each therapist. At this place, it's completely different.  The therapist is so sympathetic to G.  He tells me, \"No one should be forcing him to do anything.  Right now we'll just play together and earn his trust\".  Of course, this is how everyone should have approached G. I feel so much better about this man.  G. has enough anxiety without pushy therapists trying to force him to perform. I don't even know if I think ABA is right for G., but at this clinic, I think they understand him. I don't know if it has to do with the new clinic, but B. is down-right chatty, by his standards.  He counts to ten, sings \"Tinkle, tinkle, ya, ya, ya\" and murmurs the alphabet under his breath.  It's mostly for his own entertainment, but I'm fine with that. One thing that's a definite improvement in our quality of life: we have zero therapists coming to our house and driving J. nuts with jealousy.  I liked the ECI women, but I don't miss rushing home for thirty minutes of \"developmental services\". Now J. and I have two mornings a week to spend together, and I can see him relaxing and acting happier. PS the picture above is J. wrestling with his cousin.

The teacher hasn't responded to my email or phone call asking how it's going...I think she's a little overwhelmed.  She's very competent-seeming and warm in person. So all we have to go on are the two words B. kept saying after his first day...\"Careful!!\" and \"Shick!\"  We understand \"careful\" (B. is quite the climber and acrobat), but we are wondering about shick.  We think there might be another final consonant sound. The paraprofessional looked as if she might cry after escorting  the two of them to the front of the school where I pick them up. They are very good at flopping to the floor and staying completely limp when you try to coax them.  By Wednesday the school had decided I should park in a handicapped spot and come get the boys at their classroom. I had had visions of PPCD finally teaching them to walk well from place to place, but so far they actually walk better for me than for the teacher or aide.  It's just the first week, so I still have high hopes for the walking thing.  I'm glad we are still doing ABA, so I mostly think of PPCD as a chance to be in a group of other kids.  The other kids are so sweet, and for the most part pretty social, which I'm thrilled about. The special ed director wanted to bus them to another school with a smaller class, but I'm hoping this one will work out.  I do think they need another aide.  Right now it's seven children with one teacher and one aide (possibly the source of our new word, \"shick\"). I'm in constant communication with the special ed. director due to my stubborn-ness about keeping them in ABA.  And to think that in some states the school districts actually provides ABA!  It's as if we were in another decade from the east coast.  I send all my communications in bulleted-lists, trying to make the impression that I'm a parent who has a lawyer on retainer. At the same time I try to be diplomatic, because I might actually want to teach in this district again.  I'm being paged by J. to lie down and help him sleep.  Tomorrow is his Pre-K meet=the-teacher day, and he's got a bit of the jitters. Hopeing PPCD will turn out to be helpful.  But why hasn't the teacher returned my email or phone call.

I can't stand it when people say \"it's so much safer than driving\" because I have an actual phobia of driving fast) We had had a great flight, and were making the descent into Newark when the plane pulled up sharply, and continued flying.  The pilot made an announcement that the instruments indicated that the nose gear was not coming down.  He said something vague about having someone check it out. I immediately got a very bad feeling in my stomach.  I looked at my husband, and he said, \"Oh, we can land without nose gear!  We'll just have to get out the emergency exit fast\".  My husband has always taken a sunnier view of things (he is still certain the twins will grow out of their autism), but I can't say I was convinced. The plane started making a grinding sort of noise, which my husband guessed was the pilot trying to \"shake the landing gear down\". That's when I decided he probably wasn't lying to me to calm me down, or else he was doing a bad job at it.  I buckled the twins into their harnesses, but my hands were shaking, and a neighbor across the aisle had to help me.  After a while, maybe ten minutes, of me thinking some pretty grim thoughts, the pilot announced that everything was okay.  I was still nervous until we got down, and the actual landing was pretty bumpy.  As we looked around, we saw fire engines and ambulances standing by.  This seemed dramatic to me, but as my sister says, \"If they haven't sprayed foam on the runway, they aren't expecting the worst\". I'd like to think I gained some wisdom and perspective in those shaky moments, but the most I've taken from it is a desire to appreciate every moment, stop worrying so much about the future, and stop worrying so much what other people think.

He basically did nothing for them.  I heard one woman say to another \"Have you seen him gaze at an object for five seconds?\" Now, B. might not be much at the usual academic tasks, but he definitely has extended gazing down, when he's not completely over-stimulated.   At the end, just to show them a little of what he is capable of in calmer settings, I did the manual alphabet, and he said the letters up to \"g\", when he started skipping around and then said \"sing with me...Yay!\"  They seemed to think this was miraculous, which I guess it would seem to be if you've watched someone jump around a room for 90 minutes singing the word \"Mail\". Wow, didn't know I had that in me.  Guess it's still bothering me.  Anyway, I called the diagnostician and suggested that they have fewer people in the room when testing G.

J. tries to sing along, which sounds great except for one which he thinks is \"Pop Goes the Weasel\". I think  it's really \"On Christmas Day in the Morning\".

As anyone who reads this blog much knows, I am a big baby about being far from family and old friends.  I'd be willing to go through a lot of travel angst to get there. And that's a good thing, because there will indeed be angst. Last year it all went surprisingly smoothly.  The hardest part was getting through security with three two-year-olds.  We had to let them X-ray the strollers, so there was a scary moment when all three boys were \"loose\", and we were scrambling to hold onto them while getting everything through the X ray machines.  Biggest lesson learned: take off all their shoes and stow them away, long before you actually hit security.  I am going to try to have everything as stream-lined as possible...no one wearing shoes, no change or keys in the grown-ups' pockets, and anything else I can think of.   Last year I got an adrenaline rush out of schlepping everything through the airports...this is embarrassing, but I imagined it was the reality show the Amazing Race, and it really helped my attitude. The Amazing Race with two-year-olds would be entertaining, but not ethical to produce, I suppose. This year we'll have two two-year-olds and a three-year-old on the way North, and three three=year-olds on the way home. I can feel the adrenaline kicking in already. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/R14CCsjjKxI/AAAAAAAAAKA/aATxVdkycq4/s1600-h/DSCN1418.JPG"], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/12/countdown.html", "title": "\nThe Countdown\n"},

At dinner, he sat at the kids' table with no protest, and I wished I had my camera--he looked so mature. And next time he may even eat something more than a frozen waffle. And now for my favorite moment: All of us adults were lingering over dessert when G. climbed into a chair across from me and sat down.  He looked at a lit candle for a little while, and announced \"Birthday!\" I'm so happy about this, I can't describe it.

My parents were visiting for the last week, and I chose staying up talking to them over blogging.  They lived here for six months after the twins were born, and I've missed our late night talks, attempts at the New York Times crossword puzzle, exploration of Texas ice creams and just the chance to hang out with them. It was interesting to see that they both really connected with B.  I think it was really good for them to have him come up and put his head in one of their laps, or touch their cheeks.  I know my dad loved it when B. took him by the hand and led him places.  G. tried to ignore them for the most part, and stuck to acting out scenes from videos using wooden alphabet puzzle pieces (this is new, and interesting to watch, but distracts him from actual live people). This morning while waiting for the cab to the airport, my dad picked up a toy guitar and started strumming.  B. stood and stared at him, and then started hopping around and making elaborate arm movements.  My dad loved it, and kept up the strumming til B. finally wandered off to other things. Last night was a dramatic end to their visit when my doctor told me to take G. to the ER, due to shallow, rapid breathing.  Right before I left home, we managed to get a good dose of Tylenol in him.  By the time we saw the triage nurse, he had made almost a full recovery.  He ended up running around the waiting room, yelling his version of the Bob the Builder theme (\"bah bah buh buh, uh ee ill ih\" and so on). I finally took him home without having him seen.  I did learn that a fever can cause rapid breathing, and that you can buy Tylenol suppositories, so it wasn't a complete waste of time. Our other excitement this past week was a trip to the audiologist in the Medical Center.  B. passed his hearing test, and G. failed his.  The technician had given G. some stickers which he got all stuck to each other.  I think a freight train could have gone through the room and he wouldn't have flinched, he was so intent on unsticking the stickers.  He did respond to voices, but that wasn't enough to pass the test.  Now we are scheduled for him to have a sedated test (ABR, I think?).   I am able to write this because I am letting J. watch a Disney Princess movie (!) on a little DVD player in his room.  He is fascinated by all things \"princess\".  I used to try to steer him to Diego or Cars, not wanting him to get made fun of, but I've decided I should let him be who he wants to be.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/11/last-week.html", "title": "\nThe last week\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 23, 2007", "body": "\n When it gets to be the holiday time of year, I go into a weird state of remembering the last months of my pregnancy with the twins. It was one of the scariest times of my life. I've mentioned before that we had just accepted J's adoption referral when I realized I was pregnant.  It was quite a surprise, but we were thrilled at the idea of a sibling for J.  During the same ultrasound which told us they were twins, we were told they were conjoined.The doctor could see two brains and two hearts, but below that you couldn't tell what was going on.  He couldn't get them to move apart. After three weeks of that situation (there are not many support groups for parents of conjoined twins on the internet...it's almost the opposite of the autism situation in that regard) we found out they were not conjoined, but monoamniotic (sharing an amniotic sac and placenta, but with two umbilical cords, which were extremely tangled from the outset).   The ob said, \"Don't go looking on the web, because you'll just get worried\".  When has anyone ever taken that advice, I wonder? The websites we could find all mentioned 50% survival rates for monoamniotic twins. If one twin doesn't make it, the second twin can't survive.  There is not much you can do except monitor things, and then deliver the twins as early as is safe.  The other parents on the website  www.monoamniotic.org  probably saved my sanity.  There were stories of loss, but also a lot of wonderful stories with happy outcomes. It was such a strange experience.  I didn't feel the twins moving that much, which in a way was a blessing, because when they did move I kept thinking about their umbilical cords, and wondering if they were getting more tangled.  On the ultrasounds, B. was very active, and G. seemed to be asleep.  I'd have to drink a really sweet drink to get G. moving to the ob's satisfaction. We didn't choose names until right before my c-section, and we didn't decorate their room at all, because we felt superstitious about doing too much preparation. Once the twins were born, and doing okay in the NICU, we just assumed everything was fine. And it is fine, but a complicated kind of fine, as you all know!

Lots of people have bought gas cans to bring their own extra fuel.  G. will only drink milk, so we'll bring a lot of that in a cooler.  B. will drink soy milk in a pinch, so I can have some cartons that don't need to be refrigerated.  Last time I thought we could buy food along the way, but most stores were closed.  I wonder if they would drink water or juice if they got thirsty enough? I hope so! According to the projections, we may not even need to evacuate, but you have to prepare, just in case.

He shakes with pleasure when he sees an FBI warning on a favorite DVD.  He says a word now and then, for his own enjoyment. He absolutely loves the pool and the bathtub. He finds Angelina Ballerina hilariously funny. When he hears the \"Between the Lions\" theme, he screams with excitement. He likes to rough-house and jump on the big bed. Occasionally he'll stare into my eyes.  I've read a lot of other moms describing this feeling, but I didn't get it.

I'd never met any of the families, but connected right away with a few of the other moms.  One was a fellow New Yorker, there with her 13 and 11 year old sons, the younger of whom has autism.  She is appalled at the services available here, and kept advising me to move back to NY as soon as possible (we'd love to, but need a job!).  She's been going to school district meetings, and says \"No one here speaks up or complains!\"  She was very supportive of our decision not to send the boys to PPCD. J. loved her two boys, and they helped him ride the merry-go-round, while I rode with G.  He was desperate to get on the thing, and then was afraid to sit on an animal.  So we sat on a bench, with him covering his ears and grinning from ear to ear.   We ended up separated from my husband and B., because B. fell in love with the fish building, which was dark and cool, and which allowed him to run free.   J. discovered the goat-brushing area, and happily brushed goats for a long, long time. G. did not want to get close to the goats, but was interested in the chickens, and kept trying to find a way into their pen.  Shortly after that, my friend's 11 year old disappeared, and we spent twenty minutes locating him.  She stayed amazingly calm (I would have been frantic, but I guess he doesn't usually go far).  He is pretty quiet, but can write his name and address, if someone thinks to give him paper. She said he used to have a medic-alert bracelet, which I've thought about for the twins. We all met up for lunch, and got a chance to get to know one another. Both twins fell asleep, and J. talked me into a giant bag of popcorn, so I actually talked to adults for almost an hour!  We live all over the greater Houston area, but many of us want to get together again soon. We automatically had so much to talk about. especially food issues.

He loves to be swung back and forth with my arms under his armpits, watching himself in the mirror (although I don't know how long my back can keep that up).

B. and G. are so different, it really has no meaning to say that B. is where G. was at any given time.  She also said that they are both at about 12 months in their fine motor skills.  They are light years apart in their fine motor skills, as far as I can tell.  I don't know if we'll bother going back again in six months.  She also wants us to put both of them in intensive ABA programs.   I was feeling very ready to leave when G. gave me a pick-me-up.  The social worker and I walked into the exam room together, when  G's face lit up and he said \"Hello\" in a loud cheesy voice.  The social worker was thrilled.  Only my husband and I knew that he was being King Midas from a \"Between the Lions\" CD we have in the car.  I almost shrugged it off at the time, because G. is constantly singing something from a movie or CD these days.

Yesterday someone from the developmental pediatrician's office called and said, \"I forgot to tell the doctor that you called about the MRI results, but I'll tell you what it says.\" I wasn't really  processing what she was saying, but first she said \"otherwise normal\", and I just heard the word \"normal\" and started to relax.

Now I keep thinking I should have said, \"Stop talking, let the doctor tell us!\" Anyway, the doctor had already left, and we just have this word \"hypomyelination\" to think about.  Googling it led me to things like muscular dystrophy, so I'm trying to stay very, very busy, and pretend I've never heard the word. But I don't know what to think.  G. is the one who is saying words, and smiling at me, and pointing, and laughing at silly things.  Could he just be missing some myelin, not losing it? And if the twins are identical, how could this be on G's MRI and not B's?  Although a lot can happen after the egg splits. It seems to cruel that G. would have autism and also some problem with his myelin.  In my googling, I couldn't seem to find any benign myelin problems, but I did have to get off the internet at a certain point, just to save my remaining sanity.   We don't know how to page this doctor, but it just occurred to me that I have an email address. I'm going to try emailing.

G. did what I thought was his sign for banana, and then said \"Chugga, chugga, woo, woo!\" (the woo, woo is a new accomplishment, and I'm thrilled about it).  He ran across the room and got a train.  A light went on in my head, and I finally understood why he'd been signing banana in strange contexts  and refusing the bananas I offered him (when they make a request, I fall all over myself trying to respond, thinking it'll encourage them to keep requesting).  Overall, G. is much more interested in trains than bananas, so it all makes a lot of sense.  I wonder how many other of these misunderstandings we're having.  It's got to be frustrating for him, but I think he's getting a lot more motivated to make us understand, which is so great.

Now this is a child who has never drunk a clear liquid in his life.  And the MRI is at 12:30, so he is going to be like an angry grizzly cub at that point.  My plan is to give him apple juice in a medicine dropper and see how that goes.  B.'s MRI came back totally normal.  it almost seems that we could cancel G's, since they're identical twins, but I don't think the doctor would go for that.

She is an extremely optimistic, bubbly person, which makes me feel like the cranky New Yorker I often am, but so far I love her. The twins seemed to react positively to her, which is great for a first meeting.  G. was lying on the floor making his baby duck kiss the mommy duck, and B. was jogging around smiling.  At this point we are going to do ten hours a week, for B. only.  I got the feeling she'd like to work with G. also, but since he's progressing pretty well, and we aren't rich, it's just going to be B., so far. My husband is a bit worried about how much ABA will cost, but I think it's worth trying.  I was very pushy with Early Intervention, but I ended up with each twin getting two hours of services a week (up from 30 minutes/week). That's speech and OT.  For kids with so many challenges, that's just not enough. I think it's worth spending our money now, while they are so little. I don't mean put ourselves into financial ruin, but do what we can with what we have. (Piece of advice: if you have kids with special needs, do not move to the Lone Star State.) Off and on during Ms. Marie's visit, B. was trying to get himself one of the Signing Time DVD's, which was hidden on a very high shelf  (running around looking at a DVD case is a current preoccupation).  He even dragged a chair across the room, and kept looking from the chair to the shelf, but couldn't decide what came next.  I find it so interesting that he can think of bringing a chair over, but hasn't figured how to use the chair to reach something (I know it's just a matter of time!) G. is singing songs all the time now, although  much of the time we aren't certain which song it is.  One of the lines he gets stuck on is from a song the Wiggles sing in Italian (something like \"baila, bambina\").   A friend of mine heard him singing it and said, \"You're teaching him Italian?\"  Okay, I'm a bit of a crazed autism mommy, but not that crazed!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/05/new-ventures.html", "title": "\nNew Ventures\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 27, 2007", "body": "\nAbout the following post: my mom and my husband have convinced me that a two-year-old screaming about having to leave the pool is not such a huge deal.  It was the end of a long day, and I was feeling overwhelmed.  Today I'm feeling good about having heard two new words in one day. For the first time today, I took G. to the pool.  i had taken J. and G. to the neighborhood playground, not realizing that our pool had opened today.  They both ran to the fence and stuck their faces through, staring at the people in the pool. Last year, during the summer of realizing all was not well, I never got my nerve up to try taking a two-year-old and a one-year-old to the pool (not to mention all three of them). This year I feel it's going to be possible (two at a time, as long as one of them is J.)  We had a lot scrambling around looking for swim diapers and pool shoes, and headed out. G. loved it from the start.  He  splashed around, and smiled at our neighbor who was splashing alongside him.  We stayed in the baby pool, I don't think I could have managed it otherwise.  G. tried two new words in one day, which never happens: splash and pool.  He ventured off on his own a little, coming back each time to sit in my lap. We were there for almost an hour, with both of them perfectly content. After I had marveled at how well it was all going, I tried getting them out of the pool.   J. was stubborn but managed not to have a tantrum.  Despite being the NT brother, he's been the most tantrum-prone until just recently.  G. started to scream as soon as he realized we were leaving, and kept it up almost continuously for 20 minutes, until I finally got him in the door of our house.  I had taken them there in the stroller, so we provided a screaming spectacle for all the pool patrons for our entire walk home.  Our next door neighbor came out to see what was happening.  I'm not sure if he knows what's up with the twins, but this may have given him an inkling. I'm trying to focus on how much he loved the pool, and how happy we all were in the water.  But I'm so discouraged by how hard it was to leave.  I know that I've been lucky so far...I'd read about other kids' tantrums in public and wondered if that was in our future.  Apparently it is, and I'm going to have to develop a thick(er) skin.  Last week we also had a huge meltdown in the grocery store. That one involved J. crying, which made G. plug his ears and start his own yelling to block out J's noise. Luckily B. was blissfully unaffected.  I decided I would stand there in the bakery department until it blew over, and it worked.  I may not try taking all three of them to the store again for quite a while. I'm telling myself it's the terrible two's combined with autism, and thinking that once the boys can communicate more, the screaming will decrease.

At Christmas time, I was still the only one who thought the twins were autistic, so there were a lot of \"oh, they're fine, don't worry\" comments flying around.  But I have to say, this week has been wonderful.  My mother-in-law cuts out articles and gives them to me, but I don't feel pressured.  In fact, it's a pleasure to watch both of my in-laws enjoy all three boys just as they are.   J. made sure to explain every minute detail of our lives to them, while B. and G. have pretty much ignored them.  G. did repeat \"Papa\" several times and clap, which was a great moment.   G. also used a two word phrase! (not repeating it...he came up with it on his own).  When he wants something, he says and signs \"Please\" (\"peajh\"), and then signs \"more\".  This is really, really cute, but still leaves me with no idea of what he wants. Other times he just seems to scroll through every word or sign he can think of.  We are really making progress, but we've got a ways to go before I actually know what he's talking about. At this point, it is so wonderful to hear his voice trying to say words, I'm happy to wait for him to figure it all out. B. had his first meeting with Ms. Marie, his ABA therapist.  He responded very well, and did some things for her that I hadn't seen him do in a long time.  She is a really  warm person, and spent most of her time singing to him and playing in a gentle way.   Another B. milestone:  he took the red chair, dragged it across the room, climbed on it and would probably have reached the forbidden DVD boxes if my MIL hadn't caught him!  This opens up a big child-proofing can of worms.  J. can climb up and get things, but his preferred mode is always to remain at ground level and talk a grown-up into helping him.  G. isn't trying to climb at all yet.  But our days of being able to stick dangerous things up high are coming to a close! (Note: I'm not trying to say that the DVD boxes are dangerous.  If he gets hold of one, however, B. will cease to interact with us for the entire time he has it in his hands) So, we're having some hopeful days around here\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/05/in-law-visit.html", "title": "\nThe In-Law Visit\n"},

It was held by our local branch of the ASA, and it was encouraging, relaxing (as much as taking our 3 boys to a big park can be), and just such a relief to be with families who understand. There was a ton of food set up in one pavilion, but not many people sitting down at any given time.  Most of the conversations took place quickly, as we passed each other on the playgrounds or swings, or while juggling plates and children. One thing I noticed was that the parents of teenagers got to sit down and eat a regular meal.  The parents of kids under ten or so were doing lots of running, chasing and generally following kids around.   Once the twins had worn themselves out I had some actual conversations with other parents, and felt validated for sticking with my approach of some ABA and a lot of intensive playing, singing, jumping and so on, in a natural enviromnent.  One mom kept telling me \"Buy them a computer!\" because her son has taught himself to read and do all sorts of other things on the computer.  He was the cutest little five year old, walking around reading every sign he could find.   I finally figured out what G. means when he points to his chin and says, \"Boo\".  He saw a lady with a plastic spoon, and started following her around saying \"Boo!\" and \"Peesh!\" (please), until she went and got him his own spoon. He has a thing he does where he bounces a spoon up and down, and says \"one, two, fwee, foe\".  I'm sure it's from a movie. Now if I could just figure out: \"Fwee, fwee...oooooooooo\" \"Care-a  bear-a\" (it's not care bears, because he doesn't know them) and  about twenty other things that he says all day long, I'd have some peace of mind.

I'm getting much less sensitive about what other moms may think of me.  Just getting from the van into the playspace is a workout, and we kind of explode through the doorway, with G. plugging his ears and making sad sounds.  At this point, I think, if someone can't tell that our family is, shall we say, a little special, then they just aren't too observant, and that's their problem.  Most people are incredibly nice, in any case. In the afternoon I took J. to the pool, where he met a five year old girl who proceeded to play with him and boss him around, which is probably a good combination for him.   In the evening I took just B. to the pool, and he was in heaven.  it's a little scary, because he has no sense that he shouldn't walk right off the edge into the water.  I pulled him around the pool, and he splashed and smiled and said \"Zubadee, zubadoo!\" (his happy words).  He also drank a lot of pool water, which is bad but also good, because normally the only liquid which he lets past his lips is milk.  The question is, how do we go from drinking heavily chlorinated water straight out of the pool to drinking regular water out of some kind of cup?

We have certain hard-line therapists who would scoff at this, wanting me to face every difficulty head on.

He babbles like crazy at the ABA therapist...I think she gets him excited with all her effusive praise. G. has decided to learn the English language starting with three syllable words. Of the thirty or so words that he can use, a big percentage of them have three syllables. Recently it's \"animal\", \"dinosaur\" and every once in a while he'll bring back \"octopus\".

She is one of those people who likes to organize, so I guess she got the gene which is totally absent from my DNA.  My pantry is organized, my box of kids' socks is organized, and moments ago she disappeared into the garage to take a shot at the floor of the mini-van.   She also made it possible for my husband and I to go out for dinner (Thai food, ahhhhh), which we haven't been doing enough. G. has decided that he likes his new OT and SLP, which is great.  Now he cries as we leave instead of as we get there, which isn't ideal, but it's an improvement.   B. is doing a little bit of imitating, which is a really hopeful development, because it could make it so much easier for him to learn so many things.  He suddenly learned to sign and say \"clothes\", which is funny because he spends a lot of time taking them off. I wasn't making any effort to teach him that word or sign, but he picked it up from a DVD. This weekend is my scrapbooking retreat at a B and B.  I haven't been apart from all three of the boys at once except for one single night.  It'll be good for all of us, but I'm a little nervous!  Not that nervous,, though, mostly excited.  I scheduled a massage, and I plan to spend a big chunk of the weekend either in the shower or lolling around in bed.

I'm actually pretty much over the hurt, and fully into the mad. What I\"m upset about: After a few minutes of observing him she concludes: G. is on a 16-month level in language (that might be right, but I'm annoyed anyway). He makes little or no eye contact (not true). He can request a cracker with a word and a sign. He has low-set ears. And so on. Then there was a cut-and-paste section of suggestions: - he should sit in the front of the classroom (he's not even three) - parents should try to spend at least 30 minutes interacting with the child per day (I'm a stay-at-home mom!) - use positive reinforecement (she gives examples  such as saying \"Good Job!\" or giving a hug and a kiss)  I know the last section was just there because they must put it in every report, but I think most parents would be offended by the suggestion that they start saying \"Good job\". Yes, that's why we wait months to see a specialist!  I'm supposed to be hugging my child?  Why did no one tell me this before?  No wonder he's autistic  The fact that she wants me to get him 25 hours of ABA, and then reminds me to spend thirty minutes a day with him pretty much sums up the difference in our philosophies.  And I do believe in ABA, for some kids.  And G. is getting some ABA, and probably will get more.   I'd be fine with the ABA recommendation if the rest of the report seemed more personalized, or even as if she had spent more than ten minutes on it. We aren't planning to go back, although my husband doesn't want me to \"burn any bridges\", in case we need the clinic for referrals or letters of medical necessity in the future. I plan to write something up,and then talk to the social worker, who seemed a little more concerned about us as individuals and as a family. I feel like I could go out and run five miles, or fire off a nasty email.  I'll probably take the dog for a walk, then put on my pajamas and read my mystery.  Meanwhile, to counteract all of the above: G. talked my ear off today, to the point where I said to my husband, \"Let's pull B. out of speech therapy.  We need one quiet one in the house!\" (That was a joke, in case the developmental pediatrician ever reads this) B. keeps trying to sing \"Sing, sing a song\" from Sesame St.  He says \"Siiiiiiinnng, dadee sooooooonnnng\". It's very, very cute.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/10/vent-after-reading-dev-peds-report.html", "title": "\nVent after reading dev. ped's report\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 10, 2007", "body": "\nOnce again, I took J. and B. to church with me. I alternate-- one week J. and G., the next week, J. and B.  All three are in the same room, and while J. does great in Sunday School, the twins need extra attention, and there aren't enough teachers for both to be there at the same time. Today a teacher came to get me about five minutes into the service with a very distraught B.  I spent the morning with him, going between the playground, the infant room, and finally the toddler room for snack.  The teacher in the toddler room (whom I really respect and like) said, \"I think B. is okay in this class as long as you are here.  G. is just a little farther along\".  So it looks as if I'll have to stay with B. when I take him to church. (Actually, I have ideas for other solutions, but we'll see what I can work out) Now, he is really progressing lately. He'll walk holding my hand when we go to stores (sometimes).  He recognizes some of the PEC symbols in our schedule, and I swear he said \"Sleep\" when I showed him the sleep picture today (!!) He says something like \"teeth\" and \"brush\" when he sees his tooth brush.  This is fantastic for someone who recently took a month or two off from saying anything at all.  But despite all this, he is not fitting into his Sunday school class.  Church has been a haven for me so far, with a group of people who seemed happy to watch out for the twins and their unusual needs.  I hope it will keep being such a place, but I can see that I need to enlist extra help. Maybe pay a teenager to stay in the room with B., and take him out to run when he needs it.  Another thing about B:  a long time ago (maybe a year?), B used to get very excited when his big brother would run around and act silly. He would clap and jump and laugh.  This morning I saw him smiling a little when my husband and J. were running around the house, screaming like banshees.  Even G. joined the chase, so I took B's hand and started running after the others.  He got the biggest grin on his face, and I'm sure I did, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/06/another-sunday-morning_10.html", "title": "\nAnother Sunday Morning\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 17, 2007", "body": "\n Lately I've been wondering about B's words.  They come and go, and often when a word goes, it seems to be for good.  I think he peaked last December, when he had maybe ten words that he would occasionally say.  At that point, he could also fill in words in songs (sometimes), which he does not do at all right now. I don't want to be depressing.  We are getting back to a stage of having a few words.  \"Cookie\" came into favor for a while, and got his ABA therapist very worked up.  It seems to have faded out again, although the ABA therapist says that he can say it, so we should expect him to.  He also said \"brush\" for a few days after getting a new toothbrush which he loves. I remember reading The Siege, by Clara Claiborne Park, long before I had kids, and even before I started teaching kids with autism.  I remember being fascinated by her story. One thing that stuck with me was that her daughter would learn a new word, say it all the time, then move on to a different word.  I can't remember how long that lasted, but she did eventually speak in sentences, and as an adult talks well. She's an artist now. I disagree with our ABA teacher about thinking that B. \"can\" say the words, if he wants to.  I think they are in there, but he can't necessarily retrieve them at will.  But her techniques are so gentle, and rely so much on having fun with him, I'm okay with having some philosophical differences.  One great result of her working with us is finding out that I should ignore tantrums (I should have known that, but I always end up either in conversations with J., or trying to comfort G.)  So the last time J. tantrumed, which as always caused G. to plug his ears and have his own tantrum, I went over and looked at a book with B.  It was great, and the tantrums probably did end quicker than usual. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/RnYEC1JncqI/AAAAAAAAABs/NAijGQuWzuA/s1600-h/3066.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ccuTsPgAAcc/RnYDPFJncpI/AAAAAAAAABk/FcPOwZD4POA/s1600-h/3072.jpg"], "link": "http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2007/06/where-do-words-go.html", "title": "\nWhere Do the Words Go?\n"},

The twins actually seemed interested in Duck, Duck, Goose, and really went wild when they brought out the giant parachute.

Other people looked uncomfortable, and didn't meet my eye, and I can see that he was acting weird, in terms of usual waiting room behavior.  But I was so happy!

Of course, the simple answer is to keep the bathroom closed, but in our house we don't always manage it (think four year old brother, and forty-something scatter-brained mom).

It was our first trip that was not a visit to relatives or a hurricane evacuation.  We drove about four hours to San Antonio, stayed in a family-friendly Hilton, and spent a day at SeaWorld. The twins get so loud at night at home that I couldn't imagine staying in a hotel with them.  I figured worse come to worse, I would drive them around in the van if necessary.  But zipping them into individual tents and putting a DVD on \"repeat play\" did the trick.  There was a lot of quiet singing, but nothing that would disturb anyone. The first day was a little tough with B., who was very excited about the Christmas tree in the lobby, and did a total flop on the floor and kept \"combat crawling\" back towards it as I tried to drag him away.  When he did get to it, he was very fast about taking glittery ornaments off and chewing on them. My sister was good at quickly child-proofing the hotel room, which mostly meant putting almost everything on top of the TV cabinet.  I was happy to find that the Hilton securely bolts all of the artwork to the wall.  G. was entertained for a long time by washing his hands in the bathroom sink and even said \"Wash hands\" over and over to himself.   It was only after a while that I realized he was also washing his hands in the toilet bowl.  The big hit, other than Sea World itself, were the outdoor heated pools.  Not many people braved them, but we really got our money's worth. At night the hotel lit a bunch of outdoor fire pits and many kids were out there roasting marshmallows (we didn't include the twins on that one).  SeaWorld was interesting, uncrowded and pretty well-designed for a family with two giant jogging strollers.  They have a huge playground with climbing nets, a pirate ship and big slides.  The boys, Dad and my sister loved it, but I have to admit it gave me vertigo.  I thought I might have to be rescued off of one of the big nets.

Luckily, a slow, controlled headfirst descent.  Our child-proofing has not kept up with his leap in gross motor skills, hence the lack of blogging. Then I went through a very, very anxious stage, which included worse than usual insomnia (and I am a dyed-in-the-wool life=long insomniac).  Not a good combination.  I think it was the end of the school year, combined with early peri-menopause, but I still don't really know what was happening. Things are better now, well, the climbing isn't better, but I'm getting used to it. J. is registered for kindergarten, and is taking swimming lessons--something I've been trying to get to for a long time. G. is his usual self, and seems to be learning to read a lot of sight words.  He's been getting more affectionate lately, in the form of pressing his forehead into mine and touching my face.  Sometimes he smells me, too, which I like to think of as an expression of affection.  It feels like it to me.

I think he was telling me I could go, but it might have been that he was ready for us both to leave.  In any case, he was very interested in seeing the whole school and especially his room.  Mrs. K., the new teacher, asked me all kinds of questions about him, and seemed entertained by him in the way that a proud, nervous mom wants a teacher to be. So I'm cautiously optimistic...
