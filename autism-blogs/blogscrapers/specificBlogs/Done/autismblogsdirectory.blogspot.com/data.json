{"date": "Wednesday, February 25, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nMy best friend's son was diagnosed \nwith autism at the age of 2. I remember the night she called -- I was \neight weeks pregnant with my first child, and it was my third wedding \nanniversary. I had gone to bed early because I could barely keep my eyes\n open and I had spent the day throwing up.\u00a0 But then the phone had rung,\n and it was my friend. \"Happy Anniversary!\" she said brightly, but then I heard the tears behind her words. \"G was diagnosed with autism today.\" I\n hadn't known that A and her husband had been seeing doctors for any \nissues, though I had suspected for about the last year that something \nwasn't right.\u00a0 At G's second birthday party the month before, he had \nseemed much younger than 2, had thrown a fit, had flipped out while the \ncandle was lit and during the singing of Happy Birthday, was still not \ntalking at all.\u00a0 I had not been around a lot of children, and for all I \nknew, these things could be normal, but somehow, I knew something was \nwrong. Still, A and her husband, M, had never told us they were seeking \nout help. I didn't know what to say but I promised to come \nvisit A at work the next day.\u00a0 I had no idea how she would manage going \nto work with the newness -- the freshness -- of the diagnosis.\u00a0 But the \nnext day I met her there, and she took a break and we sat in the waning \nfall sunlight while she explained how G had been diagnosed. How \noverwhelmed she felt. How crazy this all was. G. is 23 now.\n He lives in a group home and goes to a program on weekdays.\u00a0 He has \nnever said a word, doesn't use any form of communication. He understands\n what we say though, and he is sweet and gentle. He can put together a \ncomplex jigsaw puzzle amazingly well and he snuggles with his mom.\u00a0 He \nalso grunts, grinds his teeth, and squeezes his hands together in \nfrustration. He has obsessive behaviors, like wanting to sit on the \nground before he gets in a car and turning lights on and off repeatedly. I\n recently published my third novel, The Place to Say Goodbye, about a 32\n year old man, Carson, with the kind of autism G has -- nonverbal.\u00a0 \nBecause we don't know what nonverbal autistic people think or feel, I \nwanted to give them a voice, so only the reader is privy to Carson's \nthoughts.\u00a0 The novel also features Carson's caretakers -- his identical \ntwin 25 year old sisters who don't know what he thinks or how he feels. Autistic\n people and their families need a voice -- and I hope this novel helps \ngive them one.

{"date": "Thursday, May 1, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \n\"a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement or imitation\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPurchases of this book go to support Eric's care of his son Segev. \n \n \n \nPreferred purchase link is\u00a0 https://www.createspace.com/4652145 \n \n \n \nbut the book is available on Amazon as well. \n \n \nI've been following Eric Fischer's\u00a0 blog \u00a0about his beautiful and profoundly disabled son Segev for several years. Segev has a condition known as\u00a0 Ohtahara Syndrome , which is a progressive disease involving seizures that often don't respond very well to medication. Eric has spent the last sixteen years taking care of his son, who requires 24 hour support. \n \nOver the last nineteen years, Eric has amassed a collection of poetry that is, with no exaggeration, sublime. I have his \u00a0first volume ,\u00a0 Little Job's Book of Broken Poems , on my kindle, and I've found it meaningful and often come back to it when I need to know I am not alone, that others, too, see the wonder and pain of this world entwined. I am always led to think and feel when I read Eric's poetry and it never fails to create a feeling of bittersweetness that I carry with me long after I've set aside the poems. \n \n \n \nEric's dedication to Segev and commitment to honoring his son and other children who live with profound, severe disability is punctuated with loss and struggle and exhaustion. In one poem, \"The Tender Heart,\" Eric writes that\u00a0 \n \nA tender heart may lose its way, \n \nWith resolve returns to win the day. \nFalling down, feeling broken, these things are to be expected, are unavoidable consequences when one battles each day for another day for one's beloved. \n \nIt is not just the tender heart, but also the foolish heart that plays a role in being able to keep going, long day after longer night, weary. \n \nDespite adversity into the fray: \n \nA foolish heart will see the light of day. \nEric knows all too well what he's fighting for and what the cost is, and his dedication to his son and to making the world recognize the value that is inherent in all people, regardless of functionality is heroic, although he would likely reject that characterization. He is, in his opinion, doing what he must. \n \nIn a poem about Segev, he writes: \n \nThe rope that binds his body cannot bind his soul: \n \nThe secret of the heavens that define this role, \n \nNever has a dream garnered such a toll. \nHe continues later in the same poem, \"Darkness,\" \n \n \nThe struggle to survive \n \nUniversal and constant \n \nWhere no one is asked\u00a0 \n \nWhether they can bare it nor \n \nWant it. \n\u00a0Life and death and the things that really matter: Eric's life is wittled down to the essential, as are the lives of other parents loving and fighting for their children and their children's lives. Eric writes in a poem titled \"Ohtahara,\" \n \nDeath is in the fight. \n... \nBrought to our knees \n \nWith aches of love for our children so affected, \n \nDeath is a rampant disease. \nEric writes not just about his and Segev's experiences, but also devotes several poems to other children and their families and tackles the heartrending task of the loss of other children to the diseases they and their parents valiantly wrestled with. Of Jack, in \"Brave,\" Eric writes, \n \nBrave brave, little thing, \n \nAcross the heavens you will sing. \n\u00a0Eric's poetry calls us to feel, to think, to be, to embrace the moment. I can't help but be reminded of Nancy Mairs, a poet and author who has MS, and her interview in PBS's documentary, \u00a0 & Thou Shalt Honor, \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0how \u00a0she feels called to life: \n \n \nAnd having George participate in my care and having other people do the same, calls me into life. It says, despite your losses, despite your limitations, you belong here with us and we want you to stay. We want you to stay enough that we're willing to participate in the labor that it takes. That's perhaps the fundamental of caregiving -- to enable another to want to be in the world. Not just enable them to be, but to enable them to want to be in the world when it would be easier not to. \n \n\u00a0Eric's message, in the end, is similar--he calls his son to life, he asserts the inherent value in all people, regardless of what they can \"contribute.\" He rejects any and all idea of allowing his son to go gently into that good night. \n \nI am honored to be Eric's friend, to be allowed to bear witness to Segev's beautiful life and Eric's passion for giving Segev the best life he can for as long as he can. I encourage you, if you have not had the honor of meeting Eric and Segev, to visit \u00a0Eric's blog \u00a0and\u00a0 Segev's facebook page , and to participate in Segev's support by purchasing\u00a0 I am a broken man/You can't break me . \n \n \n \n \n \n--K Wombles \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TrVPLQfcWdc/U2F5OxMIrwI/AAAAAAACRt8/V8O7K3BZg2k/s1600/BROKENMAN_1.jpg", "https://www.createspace.com/4652145", "http://iamabrokenmanyoucantbreakme.blogspot.com/", "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/ohtahara/ohtahara.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/Little-Jobs-broken-poems-special-ebook/dp/B00DA8DTKM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1398898305&sr=1-1&keywords=little+job%27s+book+of+broken+poems", "http://www.pbs.org/thoushalthonor/", "http://www.pbs.org/thoushalthonor/carefor/nancy.html", "http://iamabrokenmanyoucantbreakme.blogspot.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/SegevFischer", "https://www.createspace.com/4652145"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2014/05/a-review-of-eric-fischers-collected.html", "title": "\nA Review of Eric Fischer's Collected Works of Poetry\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 26, 2015", "body": "\n \n Aspie's and sexuality \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nI believe that the subject of sexuality and Asperger\u2019s needs\nto be discussed more and in an open way. The purpose of this post is to help\npeople understand the topic a little more and discuss some things that can be\ndone to improve outcomes in regards to relationship understanding for Aspies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nI would like to firstly point out Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of\nneeds as it is a good framework to consider when looking at improving quality\nof life. As seen in the drawing below, arguably sex is one of the most\nimportant motivators with sexual intimacy and friendship being on the third\nmost important level. Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different\nlevels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused\non identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they should\nbe met.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n The difficulties that Aspies face vary from individual to\nindividual, however there are a lot of commonalities. Research into the sexual\nunderstanding of Aspies is in its infancy however studies (and my personal\nexperiences and of other Aspies) suggest that Aspies are as interested sex (and\nintimate relationships) as anyone else, but many struggle with the myriad of\ncomplex skills required to successfully negotiate intimate relationships. In my\nresearch into the subject I have also noticed that although some Aspies (like\nmyself) don\u2019t have major sensory issues, others do which can make intimacy a\nchallenge.  AS\nwill also affect communication, both verbal and nonverbal, social interaction and\nempathic thought. It can also cause obsessive interests, need for structure and\nroutine, motor clumsiness \n \n\n People with Asperger syndrome can sometimes appear to have an \u2018inappropriate\u2019,\n\u2018immature\u2019 or \u2018delayed\u2019 understanding of sexual codes of conduct. This can\nsometimes result in sexually inappropriate behaviour. For example, a\n20-year-old with Asperger syndrome may display behaviours which befit a\nteenager.  \n \n Even individuals who are high achieving and academically or vocationally\nsuccessful can have trouble negotiating the \u2018hidden rules\u2019 of courtship.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n\n \n \n As Dr Tony Attwood says in the new book published by JKP \u201cBeen\nThere, Done That, Try This!\u201d \u201cTheir (Aspies) sources of information on\nsexuality may not be peers or personal experiences, but more likely the media,\nliterature and possibly pornography.\u201d This is why specific education needs to be\nprovided to Aspies as more in-depth education will fill in the gaps that cause by\nlack of intuition. Specific sexual education is also important to help avoid such\nissues as Aspies getting into trouble with the law by acting inappropriately\n(such as accessing illegal pornography or stalking potential partners) and\nbecoming victims of sexual assault because they got taken advantage of and in\nsome cases this is caused (through no fault of their own) by not knowing what\nthe intentions of their partner are. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n After searching for a suitable educational programmes that\nrelate to AS and sexuality I found one include many relevant topics and to be\nin a group structure which will also help participants to improve on their\nsocial skills. The program can be found in full in the book \u201cAsperger\u2019s\nSyndrome and Sexuality From Adolescence Through Adulthood\u201d By Isabelle Henault.\nAs far as I know this educational programme is the only programme to be\ndeveloped and tested and is specifically to meet the needs of people with\nAS.\u00a0 The course includes 12 workshops,\neach with its own topic. Although previously unpublished, the programme has\nbeen empirically validated and tested in practice with four groups. The results\nfrom these trials are also found in the book. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n Through more exposure of this issue I believe that more\norganisations will realise that there is a need for specific education programs\nfor Aspies and will look into the issue of sexuality more and develop and\nrefine programs to suit this need for education. Also Aspies will realise there\nare resources out there to help them recognise their deficits and how to work\naround them. \n \n \n \n If you have any comments/questions on this article or there\nis anything that you would like me to cover in a future blog post (as I want to\nwrite an article more in depth in the future regarding AS and sexuality) please\nleave a comment. \n \n For \nanyone interested in reading about the perspective of a male Aspie \n(written in first person) using internet dating successfully please see \nGarry Burge's post  here .  \n \u00a0\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n REFERENCES  AND\nRESOURCES \n http://www.maxineaston.co.uk/published/AS_in_the_Bedroom.shtml  \n \n http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asperger_syndrome_and_adults \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nPosted by\n \n\n \n Ben Wilshire \n \n \n \n \nat\n\n 13:09 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n Email This BlogThis!

{"date": "Friday, February 20, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nFinding the right college is key to successfully graduating\nand lists like the Top 10 Colleges for Autistic Students can only go so far.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHere are a few other resources to check before making any\ndecisions. \n \n \n \n ASAN's Navigating\nCollege Handbook \n \nThe Navigating College Handbook was published in 2011. This\nbook was written by autistic students, for autistic students and its point of\nview is unique. The book is available for free at their website, Navigating\nCollege http://navigatingcollege.org/download.php). The ebook contains\ninformation on getting academic accommodations, housing tips, health and\nsafety, advocacy and social life.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Online Websites \n \nSearching for college is a big business online. There are\nmany websites with information about colleges across the country. Unfortunately\nfew of them include any information on the support services for autistic\nstudents.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThinkCollege.net is a web site that specifically targets\nautistic students. The site has a listing of colleges, universities and post-secondary\nprograms designed for autistic students. However the programs they list are\nsubmitted to them for inclusion on the list and the list is far from complete.\nIf students have a specific school in mind, checking this site to see what\nprograms are available is a good first step. However if the school is not\nlisted here, it doesn't mean they don't have support programs available.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnother website to check is SpectrumU (https://spectrumu.wordpress.com/)\nThis site lists many colleges in alphabetical order or by type of university.\nHowever this is in a list format, not a searchable database. The site does have\nsome excellent information on searching for colleges with appropriate services. \n \n \n \n Print Resources \n \nConsumer Reports has done a review of online and print\nresources for college guides and comparisons. While none of the online\nresources they recommend address services for autistic students several of the\nprint books do. \n \n \n \nThe College Handbook by the College Board, Guide to Colleges\nby Fiske and Profiles of American colleges by Barron's are all top resources\nand all include information on special services. College Handbook is actually\nthe number one recommended book resource as it includes information on costs,\neducational quality, environment and has the largest number of schools included\nin the guide at 3,800. This may be a good first look to understand what is\navailable and learn the vocabulary that goes with a school search. \n \n \n \n Online Forums \n \nThere are also several forums where students and parents can\ngo to learn more about college and post-secondary life from people who are\nliving it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Aspie Central ( https://www.aspiescentral.com/forums/education-and-employment.24/) \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Wrong Planet (www.wrongplanet.net) \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n College Confidential\n(http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1741671-finding-a-college-for-autistic-students.html?new=1) \n \n These forums are all active and provide valuable information and\ndiscussions on college and other post-secondary options. \n \n \n \n Other\nOptions \n \n Not every autistic student is going to attend a college with\nsupport services. However there are independent programs who will provide\nneeded support at the college or university of choice. These programs are fee\nbased and vary widely in cost and services.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Here are a few examples: \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n AHEADD - http://www.aheadd.org/ \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n College Internship Program -\nhttp://cipworldwide.org/ \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n College Living Experience -\nhttp://www.experiencecle.com/home.aspx \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n College Steps Program -\nhttp://www.collegesteps.org/ \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Student Curriculum on Resilient\nEducation - http://www.scoreforcollege.org/propel \n \n Autistic students can be successful in college and beyond with the\nright supports in place.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 Dawn Marcotte is the CEO of  WWW.ASD-DR.com , a website designed to help teens and young adults on the spectrum live to their highest potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asd-dr.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2015/02/dawn-marcotte-resources-to-help.html", "title": "\nDawn Marcotte: Resources to Help Autistic Students Choose the Right College\n"},

I lost a person I considered a close friend over what I still believe was a miscommunication rather than a real difference of opinion. \n \nThis last week a Canadian single mother of a severely autistic teenage son killed her son and herself and once again the community erupted and people find themselves on opposing sides. \n \nPart of this is truly a difference of opinion. There are those of us who are horrified at how the victim in this kind of crime is portrayed as the perpetrator of the murder rather than the murder victim. \u00a0That, should, I think, be the way we react instinctively: the victim is the autistic person who has been murdered. No matter what the reasoning behind the parent's actions, the primary victim is the autistic individual who has been murdered. \n \nThe lead in the news coverage is that a disabled individual has been murdered by his/her parent, not how hard the parent had it. \n \nAfter that acknowledgement, in a separate conversation it is reasonable to wonder what drove the parent to the point of murder and whether there are actions the community could take to safeguard vulnerable individuals. What is an appropriate level of governmental intrusion into the lives of families? Would that have made a difference? \n \nWhy did this mother do this? Why didn't the medical community help? Why didn't the Canadian equivalent of CPS assist? \n \nThe list of why questions are endless, and the reality is there aren't answers for all of them. \n \nWhat is the solution for families unable to provide safe living spaces for their disabled children? Turning them over to the state? Relinquishing their parental rights? Should they have to do that to get their child help? \n \nWhy aren't there enough resources for families and adults who are disabled? \n \nThe one clear answer is that there should never ever be a time where we condone the murder of a disabled child by a caregiver. That action is never understandable, always reprehensible. \n \nCondoning an act of evil and having compassion for people breaking under what they find to be insurmountable situations are not the same thing, though. \n \nWe can feel compassion that this mother was turned away time after time. We can feel for her that the state, the community, and her family failed to assist her or to see the level of despair she was operating under. We should, I hope, feel even greater compassion for her son, the child she made a choice to murder before ending her own life. \n \nHe was failed all the way around, by every one. He was the one deemed not worth helping. \n \nCompassion for autistic individuals in maladaptive or dangerous environments that don't meet their needs and routinely fail them--that ought to be the number one concern--we must care before we can act. We must deem autistic children and adults to be of equal value to non-disabled individuals. And then we must advocate for adequate resources and assistance for these individuals so that they are safe and in an environment that they can thrive. That means assisting families. \n \nCompassion for families who don't know where to turn and face closed doors every time they reach out should be the secondary concern. These two concerns work in tandem and we need to recognize that. \n \nThe solutions for families struggling to access resources to assist their disabled family member is going to be family-specific. It will look different for each individual. We cannot afford cookie-cutter solutions, and the ongoing debates in the online community tend to detract from any real action occurring. \n \nHow do we move from advocating to action? \n \nWhere do we start? \n \nCalling on the media to remember who the true victim is in a murder/suicide is an action that must occur. \n \nCalling on the state and local organizations and the medical community to make sure adequate assistance and resources are available is necessary. \n \nHelping families in need by being there to listen, to provide respite care, to put your money where your mouth is are all needed actions. \n \nWe must build local cooperatives in our local communities, create strong ties between families and communities so that when a family is in crisis, it isn't happening out of sight. \n \nInvestment in each other and commitment to being there for each other goes a long way, as those of us who have had the benefit of having a circle of friends who have our backs know all too well. \n \nAs we work to create real change in the real world, we can also resolve to treat each other with compassion, to listen to each other and to be willing to ask for clarification before we decide we've hit that wall that terminates what had been a supportive relationship. \n \nI don't know about you, but I certainly don't have so many friends that I want to lose a source of support and solidarity over a misunderstanding. \u00a0Let us have compassion for each other and understanding that these tragedies are horrible for the families they happen to, but also to us, as well. \n \n--Kim Wombles \n*Please know that this post reflects my opinion alone.

As a young single woman I just went to the next aisle and tried to ignore it, vowing that my children would never do that. \u00a0 Why doesn't mom just pick her up and take her to the car - I'm sure they could come back another time. \u00a0I wasn't raised that way - I would have gotten spanked for sure if I put up such a fuss in public, or at home for that matter. I could tell by the looks of the other adults that I wasn't the only one who was thinking that. \n \nFast forward 15 years - God has a sense of humor \nNow I am the mother with the child pitching a fit on the floor. \nNow I understand that trying to pick her up will just make it worse. All I can do is ride it out and do my best to calm her quickly. This is the first chance I have had in a week to get to the grocery store and if we don't have the right foods she won't eat, so we have to get it done now. \nI saw the looks from the other adults in the store and I know what they are thinking - then it hit me: \nWho died and made you Dr. Spock? What makes you think I am a bad parent? \nIn the United States justice system we are supposed to assume innocence until proven guilty - can't we apply that to parenting too? \n \n\u00a0I think that most parents love their children and we want to do the right things for them. \nWe want to teach them to be patient, kind, generous, strong, self- reliant, smart, honest etc. \nIf we assume that all parents want their kids to grow up to be good people, why do we assume that when a child is misbehaving it is the parents fault. That somehow the parent has missed a vital step in raising that child and they need to learn to 'parent' better. Like they forgot to feed them or tell them that screaming in the middle of a store is not acceptable behavior. \n \n\u00a0We don't think that way about ourselves do we? \u00a0I know I don't. I happen to think I am a pretty good parent. I have worked hard to help my girls grow up to be intelligent, articulate, strong women who don't just accept what the world tells them. (Unless of course it is me and then they just have to do it because I'm the Mom.) \u00a0I am not perfect and I have made my share of mistakes along the way, but overall I have tried really hard and I think I have been at least partially successful. At least they are still talking to me and aren't making plans to get AWAY as soon as they can. \n \nChildren are actually people too. Yes they have limited life experience, but that doesn't make their emotions any less real. It doesn't make their needs any less important. \nIt is time to give each other a break. Real life isn't television where Dad is too incompetent to properly care for his own children and moms are too overwhelmed to even know what their children are doing. Neither is it Sesame Street where every adult knows exactly what to do in any given situation. Reality lies somewhere in between. \n \nWhat if we assumed that the parent in any given situation is doing the best they can? \u00a0How would that change our reaction? \n \nWould we perhaps he a bit kinder and offer some assistance? \u00a0Even just a smile and a nod of recognition that we know they are trying their best. \n \nWould that small change in our behavior help other adults to make the same change? How would that change the world? \n \nI think we need to start fresh with each other as parents and adults. Starting today I am going to try very hard to be more supportive of other parents, especially when they are having a hard time. \nWhat do you think about how adults and parents treat each other?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asd-dr.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2014/12/who-died-and-made-you-dr-spock-guest.html", "title": "\nWho Died and Made You Dr. Spock?

Please share!\u00a0 \n \ncontact info is Phil Geelhoed \u00a0 PhilG@somaine.org  \u00a0 To whom it may concern-or Hey Person who picked the venue for today's state swim meet! \u00a0 \n \nI sat at the special Olympics today. It should have been wonderful. \u00a0It is not often that people with disabilities (either physical or developmental) are able to get together without judgement to participate in sporting events. But it wasn't wonderful. I sat there and quietly seethed because I knew of at least one individual who worked equally as hard-but was unable to participate. This was not through any fault of their own-it was simply because the\u00a0 chosen \u00a0venue had no hoist to help them into the pool. Imagine that-a \"Special\" Olympian excluded because of the very thing that made them \"Special\". Equally as unthinkable-a Special Olympics venue that was not\u00a0 fully handicap accessible! It boggles the mind. Yes, there were people who were eager to help-\" We'll hoist them in and out of the the pool ourselves - whatever it takes! \" \u00a0To add fuel to the fire-there were no accessible changing rooms for this person. \" Oh \u00a0 we'll let you use an open area and stand around them holding up towels .\"\u00a0 While I am sure that these were well intended suggestions, that there was no malice-I am equally sure there wasn't any real thought behind them either.. This is a human being. Someone with thoughts, feelings, a personality. A person \u00a0deserving of dignity and respect. Someone who wanted their moment to shine-not for the spectacle of being hauled into a pool by strangers-or made to change behind a shield of towels-but because they were an athlete-a participant. Accepted and Included. \u00a0 Oh sure, I heard the excuses-when someone complained about this athlete being excluded, they were told-\u00a0 \"You find a venue big enough to hold everybody!\"\u00a0 \u00a0That doesn't \u00a0make sense. Really- \u00a0 what is more important? \u00a0A venue big enough to hold all the athletes or a venue that accommodates all the athletes?\u00a0Had people known there was an accommodation issue(meaning \u00a0more than two days before the event) maybe they could have found a way to rent a hoist-or fund raised to buy one. Maybe a smaller more accessible venue (spread the event over two days) could have been used. Who knows what could have been done. \u00a0I do know however, what should have. \u00a0 I thought about this as I sat there today-watching all of the happy faces-seeing the pride in accomplishment, the joy in success. I sat and thought about the person who wasn't there-who didn't get their moment and wondered how left out they were feeling. \u00a0I looked around and saw all of the bright yellow Special Olympic tee-shirts - emblazoned with \"Inclusion\" \"Friendship\" \"Unity\" \"Respect\" -all such lovely sentiments. I tried to measure those sentiments against the person who wasn't included...and sadly realized that today- they were just words. . \u00a0 That athlete (and any others that may have missed out today) is owed a big apology. Accessibility, accommodation and inclusion-especially in the Special Olympics, should \u00a0NEVER \u00a0be an issue.Nor should they only be words on a tee shirt. This was unacceptable. \u00a0 As the mother of a \"Special Olympian\" and of other children with disabilities, I have heard far to many times about why my kids can not be included in some things. I can't tell you how much I loathe the sentiment \"The needs of the many outweigh those of the few\" I did not however expect that attitude to bleed in to the Special Olympics. I am appalled.

By this point everyone is aware-so, now what? Really? What does awareness mean or do anyway? \u00a0This past week-I have learned what it means to my Sam.(I didn't even know that he was paying attention..*sigh*) He is fifteen, autistic..and one of the best people that I know. \u00a0He doesn't like the \"lighting it up blue\" or the puzzle piece symbolism. \u00a0In one conversation, he equated all of that with Nazi Germany-telling me that he felt as if he were being marked much like the yellow star or pink triangles from then. He makes a lot of sense-and, being autistic-he has even more of a say in what this month represents to him than most other people. The following (in red) are his words-his thoughts. \u00a0the drawing is his as well...So, without further ado-I'm going to kick off this whole awareness month with the thoughts of my son. These are his words. This month always separates us into two groups-the \"afraid\" and the \"feared\". \u00a0The afraid, not knowing what autism is- create hate (or the opportunity to abuse) making the \"feared\"(autistic peoples) lives miserable. The people trying to \"help\" are filled with pride which makes them feel special. \u00a0They always talk about the problems, what \"they\" can not do and NOT what they CAN do.Making not only themselves blind..but even some autistic people as well- especially when they try and embrace this blindness.

Restoring the original whitewashing with a new url sometime in 2013 (according to  Alyssa ) is nothing short of a dick move. \n \nDespite deep reservations about the organization, for a short time I tried to work with it in my city, since at the time they were the only way autism families got to meet each other. I felt the former president, who I had met and talked to, genuinely listened and wanted to improve the organization. I knew the people in my city who worked on the walk were genuine, real, and invested in making autistic individuals feel welcome as they were and in providing support for them and their families. \n \nI was able to live with the cognitive dissonance for two walks. I felt the volunteering done by my family and students to make the walk happen was good work for the local community and I gained many friends in the process. I also saw some things at the paid worker level and in the organization itself that troubled me deeply. It was all about raising the most amount of money with the least amount of help from the larger organization. It was push, push, push. \n \nI also witnessed a failure to recognize the families' concerns and interests. \n \nI walked away from the organization quietly and when I finally did publicly announce I couldn't support it, people who had treated me like a traitor wanted to welcome me back like I'd just suddenly seen the light. \n \nI don't like agendas nor people whose interactions with others arise out of their agenda. \n \nI came online looking for community, for my tribe, for people who would understand my kids and me. And I was very blessed to find numerous kindred spirits, people who have become my closest friends and my strongest supporters. I found controversy and hate along the way, which I have no interest in, and it's amazing when you don't want to incite rioting and vitriol how much more supportive the people in your life are. \n \nI know that there's a true autism community online and in the real world as I experience it every single day of my life. My facebook friends are autistic individuals, parents, the whole gamut, and with a diversity of beliefs, but the one thing we share in common is our desire to be there for each other in the good and bad times and in all the in-between. \n \nWe have thousands of people represented on this directory, from those who despise Autism Speaks to those who still support it. And I wouldn't dream of going on any of their pages and deriding them. I'm here to support at the individual and family level. \n \nWhat you will no longer find on this website, though, is any link to Autism Speaks. \n \n \nOver the years, their actions have varied from somewhat hopeful to downright evil. Some of their rhetoric approaches, if not reaches, hate speech. They incite fear of autistic people, and they make families think that their lives with their autistic children are doomed. \n \nRaising autistic children, much like raising children, is not easy, but it is an amazing experience, even when it is a difficult, painful experience as our hearts break for our children's struggles. \n \nI love my autistic children and my BAPpy husband and extended family, and I also happen to love my BAPpy self. I didn't meet people like me till I found the autism community. They made me realize I wasn't alone and that there were plenty of people who got me, got my obsessive interests, even appreciated them. \n \nKassiane wrote  a lovely post  in November that I recommend highly, that is by far the best response to Suzanne Wright's horrible op-ed. \n \n \nAutism Speaks, you owe her more than a public apology for profiting off of her work without her permission, for disrespecting her as a published author with the right to say no to having her work appropriated without permission, despite making it clear she wanted her work and her name nowhere near your stuff. \n \nYou owe autistic people an apology for making them into caricatures to profit off of. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y0ysSEXUU5U/UuRr6OHrMBI/AAAAAAAB5s8/EIbYqx-UwBA/s1600/kassiane+sibley+autism+speaks+-+Google+Search+-+Google+Chrome+1252014+72704+PM.bmp", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/01/when-national-organizations-offend-those-they-are-supposed-to-serve.html", "http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/2014/01/autism-speaks-are-work-stealing-white.html", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-autism-really-is.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2014/01/not-okay-autism-speaks-owes-kassiane.html", "title": "\nNot Okay: Autism Speaks Owes Kassiane Sibley More Than a Public Apology\n"},

I wouldn't be surprised if most if not all parents of special needs students haven't run up against teachers whose education was inadequate to the task, especially when are children are mainstreamed with regular education teachers. Even the  National Council on Teacher Quality  notes that \"To ensure that our children receive a world-class education, their teachers need to be world-class. Sixty years of research and the experience of nations whose students outperform our own have proven that we can only achieve this goal by raising the bar of admission to teacher preparation programs.\" \n \n \n \nAccording to the  US Department of Labor , \"[s]pecial education teachers in public schools are required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree and a state-issued certification or license. Teachers in private schools also need a bachelor\u2019s degree, but may not be required to have a state license or certification.\" Is a bachelor's degree really adequate? Even for regular education teachers?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHow much training do teachers receive for teaching? At the secondary level, education courses generally begin in earnest during the junior year, and the  average semester hours  needed for secondary education certification are 30 hours or around 11 courses varying from 1, 2 to 3 semester hours. The average teacher has had one 1 hour course on exceptional needs student.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nTeaching children, readying them for the future, is too important to rely on bachelor's degrees where they only spend one short class on exceptional needs students, especially given  the reality that 13.1%  of U.S. students are disabled. \n \n \n \nAccording \u00a0to \u00a0Martha L.

{"date": "Monday, December 30, 2013", "body": "\n \n Radiating Positivity \n \n \n \u2018Tis the season when many of us start thinking about changes we want to make in the coming year. \u00a0We talk over potential New Year\u2019s resolutions with our friends and family. \u00a0Perhaps we focus on improving our personal lives, such as by resolving to eat healthier, get more exercise, and clean up a cluttered house. \u00a0Or we plan to get involved in volunteer work\u2014serving meals at the homeless shelter, for example, or teaching adult literacy classes at the library. \u00a0By talking about our plans with others, we give the details more clarity in our own minds and become more determined to follow through. \n \n \n But the idea of making long-term changes can be discouraging to us, especially in today\u2019s busy and complicated society. \u00a0It\u2019s hard enough to keep up with everything that\u2019s changing around us\u2014advances in technology, reorganizations at work, and so forth. \u00a0When we consider how many things need improvement, both in our personal lives and the world in general, we\u2019re likely to feel overwhelmed. \u00a0It seems like there\u2019s just too much going on that we can\u2019t control. \u00a0Why even try? \u00a0It\u2019s easier just to fall back on our familiar comforting habits, even though they may not be good for us in the long run. \n \n \n I recently had an email conversation along these lines with a friend who described her perspective on changing one\u2019s own life and the world: \n \n \n Sometimes I feel like all I can do\u2014in a world that can sometimes seem so filled with strife\u2014is continue to be positive in my own life and with my own situation, and then hope that my positivity can radiate out to others and uplift them as well (even if it's just a smile I might share with a stranger). Lately when I meditate, I've been sending bright energies out to envelop Mother Earth. I wish there was something I could do to make everything okay for everybody. And that thought always leads me back to the saying \"If you want to save the world, all you need do is save yourself.\" \n \n \n After I\u2019d had a few days to reflect on her words, I thought more about positivity in the context of the Internet\u2014and blogging in particular. \u00a0There are plenty of blogs whose authors write cheerful, kind, uplifting material, but they don\u2019t get much traffic. \u00a0Although we may browse their blogs on occasion, we may feel that we haven\u2019t got the time to visit more regularly or to write meaningful comments. \u00a0Meanwhile, political bloggers stir up anger and often have long comment threads full of arguments. \u00a0This skews the Internet toward negativity, even though most blog owners just write about everyday life. \n \n \n So\u2014my New Year\u2019s resolution for 2014 is to radiate positivity by making time, for an entire year, to visit a different blog each day that focuses on random acts of kindness or other positive themes. \u00a0I\u2019ll write a detailed comment on each of these blogs, describing why I enjoyed it and thanking the author for creating it. \u00a0At the least, this will make 365 blog authors happier, as well as improving my own mood by giving me positive reading material daily. \u00a0And I\u2019m hoping other bloggers will join in, which would magnify the effects exponentially! \u00a0If you\u2019re interested in participating, please visit my new  Random Kindness Blog Tour  page. \n \n \n Meg Evans lives in Vandalia, Ohio, with her husband; has two grown children; works in the legal publishing industry; and serves as the Board Secretary of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://megevans.com/random-kindness-blog-tour"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/12/guest-post-meg-evans-and-radiating.html", "title": "\nGuest Post: Meg Evans and Radiating Positivity Blog Tour\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n\n Autism Freaking Awareness Month. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYay. It's April. It's Autism Awareness Month, and to celebrate, me and the five million other people who blog about autism have set out to piss each other the hell off. Or at least, some think we do. \n \nUghghggg. \n \n \n \n This is what autism looks like. So handsome. \n \nIt's tough. I think we go into this \"community\" thinking that because our children have the same diagnoses, we are ALL the same. It's totally ironic. We shout from the rooftops about how great it is to be different, but the minute someone thinks differently from us, to hell with them! ( This isn't just an autism community thing. It happens everywhere. ) \n \nJust like autism is a spectrum, parenting a child with autism is a spectrum. We approach it differently.\u00a0 We have our own beliefs as to\u00a0 where it came from, \u00a0 how to treat it , and\u00a0 how to help others .\u00a0 And that's good.\u00a0 I have my own beliefs. I have my own damn blog. You're here. You're reading it.\u00a0 These are MY views. They are not that of the autism parent community and definitely not shared by people who HAVE autism themselves. \n \n Where it Comes From: \n \nThis question is huge. And it's a huge source of fighting within the community. Despite all of the research, the vaccine debate rears its ugly head in too much of the source-of-autism discussions. I do not believe that vaccines CAUSED Casey's autism. I think this jump in numbers of autism cases sort of lends itself to \"proof\" that vaccines don't cause autism. If they did, this anti-vax movement would have AT THE VERY LEAST slowed the prevalence of autism. It has not. \n \nI do believe that\u00a0better diagnostic criteria can be attributed to the rise. It doesn't nearly explain ALL of it though. If so, there would be a HUGE subset of adults who are autistic and were never diagnosed. It's called the \"Hidden Hoard\" theory. Granted, I think there are A LOT of people who have high-functioning autism who were never diagnosed, but that still doesn't account for all of those who went undiagnosed. \n \nBut what it really comes down to is that we just. don't. know.\u00a0 Which makes research so vital. \n \n Treating Autism \n \nThere are the Mommy Warriors. The Jenny McCarthyers, who say you can \"cure\" autism through diet, cleanses of different sorts, vitamins, etc.\u00a0 There are the behaviorists. These believe that the way to \"cure\" or treat autism is through a regimented program ( ABA and the like ) that is akin to a full-time job for kids on the spectrum.\u00a0 There are those who don't treat it at all. They think it's completely natural. And then there is EVERYTHING in between. \n \nI get comments from people ALL OF THE TIME about how it's wrong that I medicate Casey. Their child does not have the same autism my child has. If your child can be \"cured\" through Music Therapy, your child does not have the same autism.\u00a0 I treat my kid based on my own research, his personality, my personality, and his medical and behavioral needs. I personally do not believe that he will be \"cured\" and I think this \"curing\" autism speak is dangerous. Not all kids on the spectrum respond to dietary changes\u00a0 (Casey didn't) , not all kids need or can do 40 hours a week of ABA.\u00a0 You treat your child based on their needs. Don't compare your child to others and please, for the\u00a0 love , do not tell another parent that what they are doing is wrong just because it's not how YOU would do it. If they are asking for your opinion or help, that's one thing. But to seek out parents to preach to is something else completely. \n \n Helping Others\u00a0 \n \n \n \n If we all believed staunchly that research was key, we'd all go to every Autism Speaks walk and hold hands and sing. But we don't.\u00a0 I understand the criticisms of Autism Speaks. Too much money spent on ads you don't agree with, too much money spent on research, not enough spent on services towards individual families.\u00a0 Many have criticized the amount of money that the head of Autism Speaks makes ( $391,892; the highest paid employee of Autism Speaks, the Chief Science Officer, makes $456,420\u00a0 ). It's a lot of damn money. It does make me cringe a little when I think of how hard I worked to raise the little money I did for the Autism Walk\u00a0the year after Casey was diagnosed, only to have it\u00a0go to make someone rich. But then I looked into it. Check out the salaries of the top paid people at these organizations: \n \nAmerican Cancer Society: $2,222,000 \nAmerican Red Cross: $1,000,000 \nSusan G. Komen: $481,000 \nUnited Way: $864,000 \n( figures are from www.charitywatch.com, verified through BBB Charities ) \n \nThese non-profits are run JUST like other businesses. In order to grow the charities, they need to compete; in order to compete, they need to have CEO's\u00a0who know what they are doing. It may not be right, but it's the way it is. If you don't like it, don't support them. \n \nI do believe that Autism Speaks ( and the other organizations listed above ) does a lot of good. Autism Speaks is educating people. They are raising awareness. They are giving families who are newly diagnosed some direction. The reality is that they can't help every family with a child with Autism.\u00a0 There are just\u00a0TOO many of us.\u00a0 They should have more on their staff who have autism themselves. I think it would prevent some of the outrage that has come over some of their ad campaigns and terminology. Regardless, they aren't going to be able to make everyone happy. \n \n There are many fantastic organizations that deal mostly in research. Research is important. It will help future generations in better diagnostics and treating. I particularly like http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/ . If you believe in the importance of good research, this is a great organization to give to. \n \nFor Autism Awareness Month, I'm asking the same thing I asked last year: for your help. Specifically, to help parents YOU KNOW who have children with autism. \u00a0Call a mother of a child with autism and ask her if you can take her kid(s) for a couple of hours. Respite is what I think we, as parents, need most. And it's really one of the hardest things to get. With Abby, I got respite just because she has an extra chromosome. She got the funding for it right away. For parents of children with autism, even here in Virginia, it's TERRIBLY tough to get. I looked into it with Casey. The waiting list is 5 years. He's been on the waiting list for respite services in Washington State since he was 18 months old.\u00a0 Autism is TOUGH, there is very little relief. We don't sleep. We deal with more stress than I think others would even believe.\u00a0 \n \nIf you don't have the capacity for whatever reason to babysit a child with autism, send their parents a check. Tell them to get a babysitter. Or even just get a movie and treats to watch after they've sedated their child for the night. But not us. Lance and I are good. We get a lot of help from the wonderful people around us. We have our nanny coming. \u00a0So not us. \u00a0You have to know someone else who has a child with Autism. If you do not, email me, I'll send you an address. Do something, then tell me.\u00a0 I'd LOVE to hear what you did. \n \nBack to my original thought. Autism is a spectrum. The ways we approach it and deal with it are going to be as different as our children are. As we are. And that's okay. If you disagree with me, that's totally fine! In fact, I welcome it! It's how I learn about other points of view. It's how I see things I haven't seen. If nothing else, it gives me someone to fight with. \n \nMy husband won't fight with me. \n \nBut remember, not everyone who speaks their mind wants to be fought with. Sometimes they're just airing things out as a way of dealing with them. Working through them. My views on autism have changed a lot in the last seven years. I'm still learning. Be nice to the jerks who aren't as awesome as you. \n \nAnd, I'm a little late, but I'm linking up over at\u00a0 Adventures In Extreme Parenthood , if it's not too late. If it is, Sunday, I will murder you in your sleep. Love. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mostlytruestuff.com/2012/04/autism-freaking-awareness-month.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1J62pzY1NeA/T3i16qanl6I/AAAAAAAAC7U/CE_58bc1uxk/s1600/6122518911_951f796bf8_o.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--wM6P9tLPE8/T3ivduAur8I/AAAAAAAAC68/ZxI2qdbfdYg/s1600/images.jpg", "http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/health/autism-speaks-in-new-york-ny-1456", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GrNZjU3k4W0/T3i1EpDtJWI/AAAAAAAAC7M/bt5MJcW8xL8/s1600/ddddd.jpg", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.extremeparenthood.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gmviCYF1igk/T3i4oTJfmCI/AAAAAAAAC7c/WXEtWs55Rvw/s1600/rg.png"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-mostly-true-stuff_05.html", "title": "\nFrom Mostly True Stuff\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n\n Was It World Autism Awareness Day? \n \n \n \n \n \nI can't believe I let World Autism Awareness Day pass by me like that! The truth is, autism is something that I'm pretty aware about. The other truth is that I hope my blog (and many others out there) try to increase autism awareness year-round. The latest statistics the CDC issued is that 1 in 88 children are diagnosed with autism. As I look around the playgrounds and schoolyards that statistic does not surprise me at all. In fact, it's still probably on the low side. I can't help but feel that most people are in close contact with somebody who is on the autism spectrum whether they're aware of it or not. \n \nMy beef lately isn't so much about the general public's awareness or lack of awareness regarding autism. It's with the autism \"community\" itself. I put quotes around the word community because that is exactly what this community lacks--a sense of community. \n \nFirst, you have the parents of children with autism fighting amongst themselves on what the cause of autism is and how best to approach treatments. If one group doesn't agree with another group, instead of respectfully agreeing to disagree, everyone puts up battle zones and argues their point. This often occurs in a disrespectful manner. \n \nThen, you have infighting among the parents regarding what the goal is. One group wants a cure for autism, the other group wants society to accept their children with autism. \n \nThere's a similar battle between the parents of children with autism who are looking for a cure and people with autism who are offended by the notion that they need to be fixed. \n \nPersonally, I think the mission of increasing autism awareness would work a lot better if the autism community worked as a community. \n \nThe first step would be to acknowledge that the goals of a subgroup does not (and should not) reflect the goals for the whole group. People with high-functioning autism and/or Aspergers (and their parents) have very different goals than parents of very low-functioning children have. I think the community needs to have sensitivity to the different needs of the different members of its community. \n \nFurther, I think the community needs to be respectful of each other when they do not agree. Instead of belittling the other's opinions, try to understand what is fueling them. \n \nMaybe with some patience and understanding, the autism community can come together to fully educate the general public on the complex range of issues--good and bad--that accompany autism. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.littlebitquirky.com/2012/04/was-it-world-autism-awareness-day.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-little-bit-quirky.html", "title": "\nFrom Little Bit Quirky\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Autism Awareness and Acceptance? BULL! \n \n \n \n \n \nI have no doubt that the title has caught your attention - good! What I need to say needs to be read by everyone within the autism community. Before I get into the nitty gritty details of this post, I want to preface it by saying that there are some truly amazing and wonderful people in this community! After my daughter was diagnosed (and then my son), I found a lot of support and comfort from some great autism groups and parents out there. I'm always amazed by your strength, courage and perseverance - I truly am! Now I'm going to make some points that some of you may not like. I'm going to point out some things that some of you may get upset about. That's OK by me. I'm not here for popularity. I've done my best to hold and bite my tongue (hard!) on this issue for a long time, but after recent developments in the autism world, I saw a sort of re-birth of activity and I can no longer stand by and watch silently. Today is World Autism Awareness Day. It should be a day to bring more awareness, more education, more acceptance, more understanding, more help and more love to those with autism. But instead of everyone coming together, everyone is walking on egg shells trying not to say something that's going to offend someone else. If someone asks, \"Are you going to 'Light It Up Blue' for autism?\" the responses are: 1- \"I REFUSE to light anything blue!\" 2- \"Why does the color have to be blue?! We didn't choose that!\" 3- \"I am so tired of awareness! People already know what autism is!\" 4- \"NO! I'm not participating; my child was vaccine injured!!\" People within the community can't ask a simple question anymore! Things have turned political, and I'm so tired of seeing everyone bully each other! How\u00a0 dare \u00a0a person say \"I support Autism Speaks\" or heaven\u00a0 forbid \u00a0someone asks, \"I'm looking for a DAN doctor, can someone help me?\" And we\u00a0 definitely \u00a0can't have someone say, \"Does anyone know if there's a cure for autism yet?\" These questions are taboo, they're\u00a0 THE \u00a0questions to ask if you want to stir up trouble. The question I ask is WHY? Or better yet, WHY DOES IT MATTER?! The truth is it shouldn't matter. These things shouldn't devolve into an online screaming match. NO ONE should be told that their therapy methods for their children are wrong, and NO ONE should be told the way they choose to celebrate World Autism Awareness Day is wrong. NO ONE should be scolded because they choose to support Autism Speaks, and NO ONE should be scolded for choosing to support Generation Rescue. In case you haven't figured this out yet, in case it's never occurred to you... YOU'RE ALL RIGHT! Let me explain. There is a need for all of these organizations. Each organization focuses on specific areas and possible causes of autism. Each organization holds important fundraisers, events, and does their part to educate the public on what causes autism, what exactly autism is, and how families are affected by autism. They also do their part to create programs to help those on the spectrum, whether it's with therapy, training, passing legislation or providing other services they need. There is no \"one right way\" for treating autism and there is no \"one autism.\" We all know how many different types of therapies are out there. We are well aware that the spectrum is vast and wide. We also hold true to the saying, \"If you've met one person with autism, you've met ONE person with autism.\" Meaning everyone with autism is different, therefore their needs will be different as well. So I put this question to you: If everyone on the spectrum is so different and there are so many different types of therapies (since one therapy doesn't work for everyone), did it ever occur to you that there just might be more than one cause of autism? Did you ever stop to think that there couldn't possibly be only one explanation as to why there are over\u00a0 67 million people \u00a0with autism worldwide? Did you also ever stop to think that what you think is not the only way of thinking? Just because you feel a particular way regarding an issue DOES NOT give you the right to bully and force your opinion on other people! If a parent says, \"I hope they find a way to cure / fix autism soon. My son really needs it.\" this does not mean they don't love their child! What gives you the right to judge her and her circumstances? You don't know their life, their struggles and their stresses. There are parents out there hoping someone finds a solution because their kids need it. That doesn't make them bad parents. It doesn't mean they don't love their kids. It means they're doing the best they can. It means their autism is difficult to deal with. Not every autism is a gift. There are also parents of high functioning children and adults on the spectrum who, if there were a cure for autism, would not take it. And you know what? That's fine too! There are some exceptional people with autism who are extremely intelligent and provide some wonderfully unique perspectives on things. Autism is a part of them and they are proud to be autistic, which is a wonderful gift! That brings up another issue - autism lingo. A person can't say, \"My kid is autistic\" without someone jumping down their throat and correcting \u00a0them with \"You should say 'your child has autism.'\"\u00a0 I am autistic.... I have autism... I am a person with autism...\u00a0 Do we really have to fight over this? Don't you see how\u00a0 trivial \u00a0an issue this is? Here's the bottom line: a- Whichever verbiage you use - autistic or person with autism - everyone should be respected. b- Whatever your belief - Vaccines or Genetics or Environmental Factors or act of God - everyone should be respected. c- Whether you want a cure or not - everyone should be respected. d- Whether you medicate or don't medicate your child - everyone should be respected. e- Whatever organization you support - everyone should be respected. f- Whether you Light It Up Blue or choose another way to recognize the day - everyone should be respected. Until the autism community comes together -\u00a0 truly \u00a0comes together - those outside of our community will not pay attention to us. Those outside the community will never learn to adapt and accept those with autism because we can't even adapt and accept ourselves! We need to learn to be more tolerant. We need to learn patience. We need to learn to respect those whose viewpoints are different than ours. How can we go around preaching autism acceptance when we do not accept each other? We need to practice what we preach. We need our community to be supportive, not judgmental. We need our community to be embracing and understanding. We have to stop getting angry and pointing fingers at one another. We need to stop getting offended by every little thing. Let's take this day to change our attitudes, change our perspectives. There is no \"one autism.\" Be the change! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://speakingonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2012/04/autism-awareness-and-acceptance-bull.html", "http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press_display.asp?id=1851"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-speaking-on-spectrum.html", "title": "\nFrom Speaking On The Spectrum\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 1, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Dear well-meaning strangers \n \n \n \n \n \nDear well-meaning strangers, \n \n \nStarting tomorrow, you are about to be bombarded with public service announcements, billboards, letters, emails, graphics, and all manner of multimedia about \"autism awareness.\" \n \n \n \nHere's a revolutionary idea. \n \n \n \nEvery time you see or hear something that says something about April being \"Autism Awareness Month,\" mentally replace that \"awareness\" word with \"acceptance.\" There is a wide gulf between \"awareness\" and \"acceptance.\" Not all awareness is good awareness, and awareness itself can be the farthest thing from acceptance. \n \n \n \nSome Autistics have decided to reclaim April and call it Autism Acceptance Month. Paula Durbin-Westby's\u00a0 blog for the Acceptance Day and Month \u00a0has spearheaded an effort that has spread to the Thinking Person's Guide for Autism, the Autism Society of Northern Virginia, and across the internet. (Go ahead, type \"autism acceptance month\" into Google. I can wait for a minute or two while you do that.) \n \n \n \nAwareness only means some peripheral knowledge that something exists, whether as an idea, a fact, or a reality. One might be \"aware\" of Al Qaeda, but that says nothing about your knowledge or understanding of the group's structure, leadership, ideology, or history. All it means is that you are aware that something called Al Qaeda exists. Maybe you know that Al Qaeda is a terrorist group. Maybe you know that Usama bin Ladin was its leader until he was killed a year ago. But if you were to walk into a room full of Al Qaeda's leaders or full of counter-terrorism agents discussion a sensitive operation targeting Al Qaeda, and proclaim to be \"aware\" of Al Qaeda, they would all laugh at you. \n \n \n \nAwareness means very little. \n \n \n \nTo be aware of autism means only that you know that something called \"autism\" exists. You may not even know any Autistic people. Or you may know one or a few, but still have very little grasp on what exactly autism is or means, never mind the full breadth and depth of Autistic culture and community. \n \n \n \nAutism acceptance is a revolutionary idea when juxtaposed with autism awareness. Anyone can be aware. It takes about two to five seconds to become aware of something, perhaps slightly longer if you have cognitive delays. Acceptance requires actual effort and the willingness to set aside misconceptions, preconceived notions, stereotypes, and media-branded images and ideas. Gone with the idiot savant, the slightly socially awkward genius, the presumption of incompetence, the pity and fear based campaigns, the debunked theories of causation and recovery. \n \n \n \nAcceptance means the active consideration of the idea that Autistic people have a unique and natural and normal way of existing in the world. It comes with its challenges but also with many rewards. Disability does not mean defective or broken or diseased. It means lacking typical abilities or lacking specific abilities. Autistic is not a swear word. It is a beautiful word, a name for an identity that represents an entire group of people who are diverse in their personalities, characters, abilities, and deficits. Autism is not homogeneous. Autistics are not homogeneous. But we are everywhere; we are a part of your community. We are in your children's schools, your houses of worship, your neighborhoods, and your workplaces. \n \n \n \nWe cry for acceptance, but usually our voices are silenced or ignored. Awareness campaigns are very rarely created by us about us, but about us without us.\u00a0Please pay very close attention to what you see or hear about autism this month. Question what you read. Examine the rhetoric used to grab your attention while passing through a subway station or driving along an interstate. What words are used? How often will you hear \"intervention\" or \"treatment\" or \"devastating\" or \"awareness?\" How often will you hear \"acceptance\" or \"supports\" or \"self-determination\" or \"self-advocacy?\" You will hear words taken from the fields of biology, psychiatry, psychology, and charity. You will hear very few words taken from the fields of sociology, public policy, and disability studies. \n \n \n \nIf you have children, teach them to pay attention to the type of language they see or hear, and teach them to question what the people who put that language there wanted them to think when they heard or saw their words. Introduce them to Autistic people you know -- children, youth, adults. Instead of carefully-positioned, stark images of Autistics on billboards, let them see the real faces of autism. Show them that accepting their peers is far more important and respectful than merely tolerating them. \n \n \n \nAnd if you can, take a stack of sticky notes (or better yet, paper and that blue painter's tape) and a permanent marker, and write \"acceptance\" on them. Write messages of hope and community -- there are Autistic youth and adults who are there to welcome Autistic children into the community, support them as they age into adolescence and adulthood, and speak for them as policymakers try to remove access to necessary supports and services. And whenever you see a billboard or a poster somewhere about autism awareness this month, take one of those sticky notes and cover the word \"awareness\" with \"acceptance.\"Leave a website or email address for people to copy so they can learn more. \n \n \n \nDon't fall for the awareness campaigns this month. Fight for acceptance. \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \nAn Autistic person \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autistichoya.blogspot.com/2012/03/dear-well-meaning-strangers.html", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-lydia-brown.html", "title": "\nFrom Lydia Brown\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 2, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Autism & Child Abuse: Both for April. Oh IRONY. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [Trigger warning: fairly graphic description of physical, emotional, sexual abuse.] \n \nApril is \"let's make autistics hate themselves!\" month. It's also child abuse awareness month, though you don't hear much about that. They talk all about the devastation wreaked by autism, but you barely hear anything at all about child abuse. That's fucked up, in case you were wondering. \n \nThere have been a couple murders of disabled people recently, murders by family, and the general caregiver reaction seems to be to pull into little self congratulatory circles and say that it can't be true, it must be an aberration,\u00a0 they \u00a0and no one they know would do that. Parents of autistic kids are fucking saints. \n \nLet me tell you, that is not the case. My parents are not saints, and my story is middle of the road based on what a lot of autistic people I know have said to me. Parents of autistic kids want us to shut up and not say this, they want to erase our stories, but that does no one any good. Trying to erase our experiences helps no one, even if it does make parents feel better for a few days. Don't dare step that close to abuse apologism, it is not acceptable. \n \nNow I am going to tell you about some of the things my parents did when I was growing up. And yes, if you empathize with them I absolutely believe you are a horrible person. \n \nSo let's start with a brief description of my family structure, because it's kind of effed up: I have a mother, and my half-siblings' dad is on my birth certificate. They got divorced, I have a stepmom via my not-really-dad, and am on my second or third stepdad on my dad's side. Annnnd I have a biological father. Annnnnd a lot of siblings. Got all that? \n \nWe'll start by talking about when I was young. Both my mom and not-really-dad were spankers, by which I mean \"kid, you have pissed me off and I am going to vent my spleen on your bony little ass,\" and, in my mom's case \"also your face because your ass is really fucking bony.\" Offenses that got me hit until their hands hurt include such awful things as flapping, not being able to stop giggling, zoning out (both of which can be manifestations of seizure activity), arguing, and not understanding a statement or direction. That's right, these people were hitting a kid with language comprehension delays for not comprehending language. And I do mean hitting. Hard. Bruise leaving. I got a black eye and a cut across my cheek once from my mom; I was about 6 or so. The offense? Freaking out because shampoo got in my eye. \n \nAs things got more stressful and they divorced, these people got worse. My mother would absolutely lose her shit and hit me for no reason. She would scream and scream and scream at me, usually while I was stuck in the car with her. Then when I covered my ears or cried, she'd hit me and pull my hair. She did this once and then chased me around with a camera to try to get pictures of the ensuing meltdown, threatening to send them to everyone in school. \n \nGo read that again. That's emotional abuse on top of physical. Contrary to what Autism Speaks thinks is a fucking awesome idea, triggering meltdowns intentionally to document it to show people is fucking emotional abuse. \n \nBut this was a thing she did frequently. She'd be pissed off about one thing or another, looking for a fight, and I wasn't exactly in tune enough to avoid her. Unlike my siblings I didn't have friends whose houses I could vanish to for days at a time, so I was stuck with her. She'd want a fight and she'd pick and pick, she'd file her nails in my ears-this is not a sound I can tolerate on the same bus as me, much less right next to my ears-and she'd start calling me disrespectful and yelling and demanding an explanation when I covered my ears. No explanation was ever ok, and she'd keep yelling and yelling until I lost my shit, then she'd keep yelling. Or she'd touch me and it'd startle me and that'd be the most offensive thing in the world, again with the yelling. Or she'd try to have a conversation, but it'd be about why I didn't have friends or couldn't be normal or wasn't girlier or whatever. Then no matter what my answer had a \"tone\" or my face had a \"snotty expression.\" Nothing I could do was right. \n \nRegardless of the method she used, the result was always a meltdown that would.not.end. She wouldn't back off no matter how I asked, & I wasn't big enough or strong enough to shut the door & keep it closed until I was about 14. She'd keep yelling and poking and trying to argue until I was completely nonverbal, biting myself, and too exhausted to keep crying. Then she'd try to hug me and all I wanted was for her to go. away. but she wouldn't. And she'd tell me it was love and she just wanted to \"help me\". \n \nA favorite technique during the meltdown provocation procedure was to throw absolutely terrifying threats on top of the sensory poking and the demanding the impossible. The first time she threatened to have me put in foster care I was 7 years old. I believe it was over leaving the room because she was smoking and filing her nails (which she told me she loved more than me when I was 13), but that could be inaccurate. So many minor offenses got this treatment. As I got older she started threatening to have me locked up in a mental ward. I am deathly, deathly terrified of confinement and always have been. My mental images of both foster care and mental hospitals come from a combination of my mother's words and Lifetime television, which did not help the abject terror-and abject terror is not exactly conducive to calming down. My mother later leveraged this fear by instigating meltdowns intentionally-she always did love that game-and then calling police saying she was afraid of me. Now is a possibly relevant time to mention that when I last saw her, she had 4 inches and at least 50 pounds on me. Physically imposing, I am not, and lashing out at people who are not directly touching me is not a thing I ever did. \n \nOk, so now an interlude to talk about my not-really-dad and his new wife. I still went to visitation over there because we have the same last name and, to his credit, he was pretty awesome until he got remarried. His new wife resented the hell out me though-I still don't know why, really; it's not\u00a0 my \u00a0fault the guy signed the birth certificate knowing damn well I'm not his. \n \nMy not-exactly-stepmom has really delicate little feelings. I have never been the most tactful of souls, and frankly, a grown woman allowing an 11 year old to upset her enough to storm upstairs until said 11 year old apologizes is not the most mature of things. The unpredictability & unreasonably high standards for knowing what would set her off were one thing. \n \nThe not allowing me to eat and dragging me antiquing is quite another. I'm not talking \"not allowing junky snacks\". I'm talking \"over 24 hours without food.\" I'm talking \"if you were that hungry you would have apologized for hurting Diane's feelings.\" It does not work that way. Trying to starve an apology out of a 12 year old is unacceptable. I had a seizure in the antique store-one of very few tonic clonics I've had aside from The Year Of The Seizure. I woke up to being yelled at for being an attention seeking little hobag. Again, I was TWELVE. \n \nShortly after that her son stuck spitballs on my bedroom door and he blamed me (which makes no sense) so I had to sit in the living room an entire weekend, except breaks every 6 hours to go to the bathroom. Not long after\u00a0 that \u00a0I hurt her feelings again and she threw a corncob and a glass of wine at me. Another few weeks, and her son was spreading awful shit about me around the neighborhood, he denied it, and then I was again relegated to a chair in the livingroom for...I don't even know what the offense was. Just that apparently there was one. \n \nThe last time I went over there I was 14 years old. Stepmonster's sister and nephews were in town. A stepbrother, a nephew, a sister and I were down in the basement by the computer. My stepbrother told my stepcousin (well, semistep people but whatever) that it was really fun to see how far my arm would twist behind my back-this is nothing that I ever let anyone do, ever. So my semistepcousin twisted it, I said nonostopstop, and my semistepbrother told him to twist it further. My arm popped out of my socket. \n \nAll the way out of the socket. \n \nLike any child who thinks their parents aren't utter sacks of shit would do, I ran upstairs, arm flopping, totally screaming-I have a high pain threshold, but dislocations that don't immediately reduce hurt like hell. My semistepmother and her sister started yelling at me for being a big baby and making a scene. \n \n My arm was hanging entirely out of its socket. \u00a0A scene was utterly appropriate. \n \nI begged my not really dad to take me to the hospital to get it fixed. He refused. I begged him to take me home. Again, he refused. I walked 15 miles from his house to my mom's house, in the rain, on the highway, with my dominant arm out of socket. \n \nMy mother couldn't take me to the doctor until the next day because she was already drunk. To this day it has some laxity beyond what my other Ehlers-Danlosy joints have. \n \nNow we're back to mom's house. As you may recall, my mom was a hitter. Most people who hit their kids stop when their children get big, strong, and/or bold enough to hit back. But not my mother! \n \nThe first time I fought back, I was maybe 12. I didn't even do anything that violent back; she was going to slap me for something and I caught her arm. This is the day I got my first dent in my skull. She was so enraged that I caught her arm that she threw me at my bed-at that point there was nearly a 100 pound weight difference-and jumped on top of me. She banged my head into the metal bedframe multiple times and punched me repeatedly. This is the first time I feared for my life at the hands of my mother. \n \nAbout that time my stepdad started sexually abusing me as well. He had always been a yeller, which terrified me, but there is no terror like a giant coming to the night to try to make you respect him by using his penis as a weapon. I still have the knife I used to defend myself under my pillow, & carry three physical scars...one for screaming, one for fighting, one for biting. \n \nHe wasn't above physical intimidation in broad daylight either. On my 16th birthday I had to jump out the window to get to school because he had his 250 pounds planted against my door, keeping me inside, because I wouldn't bring up my laundry before school started. That was the day I knew my mom knew he was sexually abusing me-she said she did not want to hear anything bad about him unless he was stark naked about to rape me. And then I knew she knew. \n \nBut back to my mother. As I got older, and stronger, she wanted me weak. She had always given my siblings lunch money, but I had to earn mine through babysitting. Rarely did I eat school lunch from about 13 on; the option of taking a lunch doesn't work when there's nothing to take. My gymnastics coaches and some teachers took to feeding me, because I drop weight very quickly indeed. By this point most of my siblings were living with their dad or in their own places, so they didn't suffer the no-food-but-Hot-Pockets years. \n \nMy mother continued to pick fights, and continued to get physical. She learned restraint for work and thought it was a great idea to pick a fight with me to practice. Let me tell you first hand, it is impossible to breathe. Those are not safe techniques. They are completely not conducive to calming the fuck down. Putting your teenage daughter in a baskethold and dislocating both her shoulders in the process is abuse. Pulling handfuls of her hair out is abuse. Digging a knee into her back is abuse. I feared for my life from the time I was 12 on because of how unpredictable and how physical my mother was willing to be, and over things like sensory issues. \n \nThey terrorized me physically, emotionally, and sexually, all while telling me they loved me. They used systems, including the medical and law enforcement systems, to keep me in a state of constant terror. There are other things that aren't on here, there are details I cannot deal with writing out. \n \nDo not dare tell me that parents cannot be monsters. I lived with monsters. I am not a monster for making you think about it. They are monsters for doing it, and anyone who tries to excuse it is as well. \n \nDo not erase my story. Don't fucking\u00a0 dare \u00a0say this shit doesn't happen. It happens every day. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2012/04/autism-child-abuse-both-for-april-oh.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-neurodivergent-k.html", "title": "\nFrom Neurodivergent K\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Generations \u2013 What Acceptance Means to ME! \n \n \nFun facts going in, in case you\u2019ve never read my blog before. \n \n I identify as Autistic and have been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. \n I have two children who are cute, adorable, and thankfully, Autistic. \n I work for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, but the views I express on this blog are my own! \n \n \nKathryn Bjornstad-Kelly\u2019s post on the (awesomely new) ASAN website today for AAM is right.\u00a0 Awareness is not enough. \n \nReasons why AWARENESS is not enough for me? \n \nGrowing up, I was not diagnosed. I did not become diagnosed until my children were. So the \u201csuck it up\u201d attitude is what I usually got.. or the\u00a0 \u201cWatch your P\u2019s and Q\u2019s\u201d \u00a0line\u2026 I was taught that speaking my mind was wrong. That children were seen and not heard.. That women were subservient to men.. That it is NOT ok to be noncompliant (even if your finger is broken and swelling much larger than it\u2019s supposed to be). I learned that the only way to escape home was to work work work. And the only way to survive at home was also to work work work. And to never let the food get cold. And that even if you speak up, the most you will get is a lot of sympathy but no action. \n \nAnd so I drove myself to meet these demands. I drove myself from as far back as I can remember to do all my work.. To do extra activities.. To do the cooking and cleaning. And to never complain. And to never break down\u2026 \n \nUntil\u2026 \n \nOne day, I did. I broke down. I broke down for a year. A solid year that I don\u2019t recall a lot of what happened. My medical records clearly show, but actual memory is not there. And how long did it take me to recover from this one year where my body and mind said NO MORE!? 10. Ten years it took. \n \nI\u2019m finally back to where I was before the breakdown. And much wiser. \n \nHowever, when my kids were diagnosed, do you know what I saw? \n \nI saw parents and professionals talk about awareness. I saw them also talk about how to get your child to make eye contact.. and how to make your child stop flapping and spinning.. and how to make sure your child isn\u2019t rude to others.. and how to make sure they were indistinguishable from their peers.. and how the only way to truly make them better is to rob them of their childhood by doing therapies before school, after school, on the weekends. \n \nI say NO! I say no because I know where that leads.. and I\u2019d rather these children not be told that they aren\u2019t good enough.. and that they need to stop being the way they are.. Because in the end, what is going to happen to them? I don\u2019t want my kids to lose 10+ years of their life just because they aren\u2019t allowed to flap their hands, or spin in an empty room or on the grass, or speak up when they can\u2019t do something any longer! \n \nAutism Acceptance is about accepting those things that make each of us different. It doesn\u2019t mean to not nurture and help in the areas that are difficult. It just means that after you become aware of Autism, that you become accepting of the good, the bad and the really disgustingly ugly.. and instead of trying to hide it all, you take the person that\u2019s there and try to make them an even better by strengthening what is there. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asparenting.com/2012/04/02/generations-what-acceptance-means-to-me", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/04/awareness-is-not-enough/", "http://ps-and-qs.urbanup.com/1596414"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-as-parenting.html", "title": "\nFrom AS Parenting\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 3, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n\n Where are the autistics? Or why I'm not going blue for autism awareness \n \n \n \n \n \nThis isn't to say that there isn't some good from the world autism awareness day and general autism awareness month. Definitely some good can happen from people being aware and people who usually don't blog about autism to 'come out' about it. \nProblem is that there is something called negative awareness, which harmful misinformation and stigma is spread. Contrary to popular belief, intent does no erase harm, nor does it excuse the damage. There is much potential for good, but there is also the potential to spread the harmful attitudes that contribute to ableism, abuse and hate faced by autistic individuals and disabled people. Without acceptance and inclusion, even the most well-meaning awareness can go horribly wrong for the people it's trying to help. \n\"But Corina, isn't that incentive for you to add your voice to the day/month?\" I hear the argument, that I should join in order to present both myself and the autistic community. And to be honest, a few years ago I would agree and eagerly pull together some hopefully inspirational piece on community, or try for some insightful look at my life as an autistic adult. But not anymore. Now I save those words for when I'm actually inspired to write them, when I'm not treating my activism like a school assignment, trying to write something by the deadline. \nThere are also other reasons why I will not join in. One is that with so many 'voices' during April, it is some times very hard for autistic people to be heard, even during awareness events supposing to be about them!! Yes, there are pockets where a conscious effort is made to follow \"nothing about us without us\". Yes, I am happy about that, and yes, usually i don't concern myself with how many people I reach. But for this, it's more about the principle of the matter; I shouldn't have to compete in order to be heard. \nI refuse to turn my activism into a competition of how loud I am. I also do prefer substance over quality. This is part of why I haven't been updating as often, even though I have a couple of articles waiting in draft. The other reason for my lack of regular updates leads to my next reason for not deliberately being a part of autism awareness month*. \nI'm tired. Not tired enough to give up writing, but enough that I have to be careful with how I spend my batteries and spoons. And it's more than just being tired of having to be on top of everything and the feeling that I have to comment on every little drama in the communities (seriously, I got out of a lot of fandom communities due to drama; it's just a waste of energy sometimes). \nI'm really busy. It sounds like an excuse, but it's the truth. I write a lot on autism, because I am Autistic, but I'm also ADHD and Learning Disabled. I am in school, which means reading, writing assignments and essays, and a lot of sleepless nights. On top of that, I work retail in a position that uses a lot of my weaknesses instead of my strengths. Some how, between all that I squeeze in a modest social life and my household chores. Between all THAT, I squeeze in self-care, both physically and mentally. I sometimes have to remind myself that this is all a part of being a responsible adult and not to mentally beat myself up for 'taking a break' and not being productive. Taking care of myself means letting myself enjoy things, like playing a game, watching a movie, reading a book, painting, writing novels, drawing comics, and knitting. \nSometimes, I have to make a choice between writing activism or taking care of myself. This is actually a lesson I had to work with therapists to get, to be 'selfish' and do what's right for me instead of burning out. This also means choosing which autism events I participate instead of jumping at every event that I hear about. I'd much rather focus on events that I know will be building positive awareness and promoting acceptance and inclusion, not to mention pride. \nSo, to wrap it all up, I refuse to turn my activism into an assignment, competition, or burn myself out, especially when 'autism awareness' is what i do all year long, not just one month or day. And that is why I am not 'going blue' this month. \n*other than the fact that I'm Canadian and autism awareness month is a US thing, primarily. I've never really been one to let a border get in my way when I have the means to do something I want.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://nostereotypeshere.blogspot.com/2012/04/where-are-autistics-or-why-i-not-going.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-no-stereotypes-here.html", "title": "\nFrom No Stereotypes Here\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n We're continuing to run posts by bloggers on advocacy and dialogues. This time, it's Rachel's eloquent piece. Please remember, we welcome your pieces here, so if you'd like to be showcased, please email me your piece or a link to it to kwombles@gmail.com. \n \n \n \n Impact, Intent, and Dialogue in the Autism Community \n \n Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis post discusses an issue arising from the Parent/Self-Advocate Dialogues that began last week on\u00a0 The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism . \n \nFor those who haven\u2019t been following the Dialogues, a rather contentious argument arose about a Twitter exchange between Rob, one of the participants, and Emily, one of the editors, in which it appeared to many people that Emily had ill intent. As it turned out, she did not \u2013 quite the contrary \u2013 and the ensuing conflict was based on a misintepretation. Given that Twitter does not allow for much in the way of nuance or explanation, a misinterpretation wasn\u2019t all that surprising. Twitter probably wasn\u2019t the best medium in which to attempt a conversation about a serious issue in the first place. \n \nK over at Radical Neurodivergence Speaking has a\u00a0 great post \u00a0up about the whole incident, with a very good discussion of why the larger social/emotional/historical context in which it happened made misinterpretation almost inevitable. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the situation and want to have some idea of what the rest of this post is about, take a look at K\u2019s piece. \n \nI originally began my post as a comment on what K had written. But as I wrestled with my feelings about the situation, I began to see larger issues that I want to explore here. \n \n\u2014 \nIn the context of a world in which autistic people are so often rendered invisible, I understand why people interpreted Emily\u2019s words as they did. We\u2019re used to people not listening to us, and when it appeared to be happening again, people drew conclusions based on life experience. I completely understand it, and for anyone who doesn\u2019t, I hope that K\u2019s post makes the reasons clear. From the outset, I did not interpret Emily\u2019s words the way that others did, but I understand why other people arrived at a different conclusion. \n \nThat\u2019s not what troubles me. \n \nWhat troubles me is that, despite Emily being a respected member of the community with an impressive track record on advocacy issues, the rush to judgment about her intentions was so swift. I watched it happen in the comments section to the Dialogues, and I kept wondering when someone was going to say, \u201cYou know, given that it\u2019s Emily we\u2019re talking about, we must be missing something. Perhaps we should ask for clarification.\u201d Instead, I saw commenters looking at the Twitter exchange and then drawing very pejorative conclusions about Emily\u2019s intent \u2013 that she was attempting to derail dialogue, to silence autistics, to encourage dismissal, and so on \u2013 without asking what her intent actually was, and without considering the fact that the conclusions being drawn and her track record were so much at odds. \n \nIn the context of dialogue, the failure to ask about intent worries me, because dialogue involves a willingness to ask questions in order to discern intent. Without that, a crucial part of the picture is missing, and dialogue becomes unproductive. \n \nIn fact, a failure to ask about intent ultimately discourages dialogue. Because of the pejorative things said about Emily\u2019s intentions, it\u2019s taken me days to post my feelings about the situation. For the first time since I\u2019ve started blogging, I\u2019ve felt inclined to stay silent about my feelings regarding an issue I care about. And if someone like me could feel that way, I can only imagine what people new to the community must have felt while they were watching the whole situation unfold. \n \nAs I\u2019ve struggled with speaking to the issue, I\u2019ve been asking myself questions along these somewhat worrisome lines: What will happen if people misread my words as an attack? What will happen if they think I\u2019m dismissing the pain involved for everyone? What if they think I am assigning ill intent to them? \n \nWill they ask me to clarify my intent? Will they try to understand where I\u2019m coming from? Or will they assume ill intent where none exists? \n \nIt\u2019s taken me four days to say: I hope they\u2019ll read carefully. I hope they\u2019ll consider who they know me to be. I hope they\u2019ll ask if something is unclear. But I really can\u2019t worry about that. \n \n\u2014 \nI know that this whole debacle came out of the pain that so many of us carry, and out of the injustices we\u2019ve suffered. I do. When people read words that appear to be dismissive \u2013 even if they are in no way intended to be dismissive \u2013 the impact is going to be profound. That reality has to be part of these conversations. And what also needs to be part of these conversations is an understanding that it\u2019s often very ill-advised to draw a conclusion about intent based on impact, especially in a dialogue. When that conclusion is wrong, it can cause a lot of hurt. As a community, we have a responsibility not just to explain why these misinterpretations happen, but also to acknowledge the impact on the person who was misinterpreted. \n \nEmily had people saying some pretty awful things about her thoughts and intentions last week. She\u2019d have to be made of teflon not to feel hurt while it was happening. So while it\u2019s crucial that we talk about the impact of power and privilege and context and silencing and dismissal on us, it\u2019s also crucial that we acknowledge what happens to individuals at the epicenter of these blow-ups, and about the ways in which these kinds of things can fracture a community and discourage dialogue. \n \nSo I\u2019m doing now what I should have done in the Dialogues thread last week: I\u2019m speaking up. I hope that people will understand that I\u2019m doing so because I care about the future of dialogue in our community, and because I care about our community being a safe space. If this sort of thing can happen to Emily, it can happen to any one of us. \n \u00a9 2011 by Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2011/09/on-dialogues-accompanying-twittergate.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/showcase-rachels-impact-intent-and.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Rachel's Impact, Intent, and Dialogue in the Autism Community\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Disability is a Social Construct: A Sociological Perspective on Autism and Disability \u00a0by Lydia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (Special Note: Today is Autistics Speaking Day. With the end of midterm examinations and the second annual Autistics Speaking Day, I\u2019ve prepared a special article during a time that might otherwise have been occupied with some intense studying.) Earlier this year, someone I knew told me about meeting a man who obtained very high levels of education (probably a doctorate) in a technical field and who is reputed as one of the top minds in the entire country in his field. He was sought by some of the most prestigious educational institutions in America. Instead, he chose to work for the government, for one of the agencies in the intelligence community. At forty-something years old, he lives with his mother, who drives him every day to work.  When I told my mother this story, and suggested that he might have been Autistic based on the facts that I know about him, she immediately shook her head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s sad. His mother didn\u2019t do the right thing for him. He should be able to live on his own and take care of himself, and take himself to work. That\u2019s not a successful ending.\u201d \u201cNo it\u2019s not,\u201d I responded immediately. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to live independently to be happy or a contributing member of society.\u201d \u201cBut what\u2019s going to happen when his mother passes away? Who\u2019s going to take care of him then? He\u2019s not going to have anywhere to go.\u201d  That, to me, is the most significant problem, and it is a societal one.  Disability is a social construct. That may seem like a revolutionary idea, or perhaps the proud declaration of someone who would rather not use an \u201cugly\u201d or \u201cpejorative\u201d word. But what that means is that the way that we understand disability is ingrained in our society\u2019s attitude toward  ability . When most people say or read \u201cdisability,\u201d they understand that word to mean a person who is unable to fully participate in typical life activities because of a mental or physical impairment.  Our culture says that to be fully functional and able means that one should be able to attend a mainstream school, complete university or vocational training if desired, obtain housing, obtain and keep a steady job, and marry and support a family if desired -- all without significant outside support or assistance. While it is considered socially acceptable to speak to a college counselor while in high school, see a math tutor for algebra or calculus, and even depend on one\u2019s parents for financial support through young adulthood (twenties or so), an individual is not considered fully able and functional if he or she is unable to do one or more of those activities without significant amounts of support from others.  By this definition, the definition propagated and permeated throughout the societies in which we live, we Autistic people are disabled. Some of us may be more disabled than others -- as some of us are more able to participate in life activities with less amounts of outside support, and others of us do now and will throughout their lives only be able to participate in some of those activities with significant amounts of outside support.  For the other Autistic folk reading this article, please understand that I am not classifying or differentiating \u201ctypes\u201d or Autistic people. I feel very strongly that you are either Autistic or not Autistic. I do not believe it is possible to make meaningful distinctions between types of Autistic people through terms like \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d or \u201chigh-functioning\u201d or \u201clow-functioning.\u201d Those terms are not only demeaning and offensive, but also lack scientific validity. I do not think it is possible to be \u201cmildly\u201d Autistic.  Why is that? Autism is a bio-neurological developmental disability (and there\u2019s that \u201cdisability\u201d word again) defined by a certain set of characteristics -- differences in sensory processing, information processing, and communication. Those marked deviations from a typical neurological profile (or, in any case, most non-Autistic people) manifest themselves in a variety of ways -- some fairly positive, some fairly challenging, and others simply -- different. For us Autistics, autism affects and influences every aspect of our lives, throughout our lives. In short -- you either have this particular grouping of characteristics or you do not. You are Autistic or you are not Autistic.  Let me take a moment here to draw an analogy with religion. Of people who identify as religious (and one\u2019s faith, or choice not to align with a particular faith, necessarily impacts all of one\u2019s ideas and beliefs about everything else -- politics, ethics, and otherwise, informing and influencing all aspects of that person\u2019s life), some are immediately recognizable as religious by glancing at them. You might see a man wearing a skullcap and yarmulke, or a woman wearing a  hijab  headscarf, or a man with a clerical collar -- and you would know immediately that that person is religious. In other cases, you might know a certain person fairly well, speak to him or her quite often, and never think about religion or whether the person is religious -- but that does not change the fact that that person belongs to a particular faith tradition or that that person\u2019s beliefs about religion are an integral part of his or her identity and worldview (regardless of how deeply involved with \u201ctraditional\u201d religious activities the individual may be.)  Similarly, some Autistic people may appear at first glance to be Autistic, based on common ideas of what it looks like or means to be Autistic, while others have become skilled, through life-experience or coaching, at \u201cpassing\u201d for non-Autistic. Not all Autistic people are interested in Autistic culture (which, quite frankly, I think is tragic -- but a personal decision.) Not all Autistic people choose to identify themselves as Autistic -- and for a myriad of reasons, not least of which is the justified fear of discrimination or misunderstanding. When you live in a world where people think it is a compliment to tell you \u201cBut you seem normal,\u201d and where you are under constant pressure to appear as non-Autistic as you can, that creates an environment where it is supremely uncomfortable to disclose that information.  And like people who all belong to the same faith, each Autistic person -- while sharing a common identity -- is an individual. We are not identical, and we each have our own individual strengths and weaknesses. Autistics are a diverse lot. Some of us speak, and some of us do not. Some of us have attended mainstream schools, and some of us have attended schools specifically for special education. Some of us have gone on to university, and some of us have not. Some of us can effectively advocate, and some of us have not yet learned how to advocate. Some of us can live independently, and some of us need intensive supported living services. Some of us have obtained jobs and worked toward careers in a competitive environment, and some of us struggle to find employment. We are not all alike. But we  are  all Autistic.  But what does this have to do with disability? Why do I use this word? Because it would be inaccurate, within the context of our society, to say that Autistic people are not disabled. It would also be inaccurate, within the context of our society, to say that no Autistic people are more or less disabled than other Autistic people. Within the context of our society, some Autistic people are more disabled than others, because of how we have come to define and understand ability.  I do not like the word disability. I do not think it should be used. I hope that over the coming generations, it will fall into disuse -- or at least, be redefined. If I could redefine \u201cdisability,\u201d I would start with our definition of what it means to be fully functional and able. To be fully functional and able -- outside the context of our particular societal attitudes -- should mean possessing the ability to live a life that is meaningful and satisfactory for oneself, by one\u2019s individual feelings, with the appropriate amounts of support where required to live that life. By that definition, almost no one would be disabled. Nearly every Autistic person falls into that definition -- and I only say \u201cnearly\u201d because I try to avoid absolutes. Notice that the definition that I have proposed does not say anything about independent living or activities of daily life. It is only in our society that \u201cindependent living\u201d is a hallmark of being fully functional and able. I do not think that \u201cindependent living\u201d has any correlation with the ability to live a meaningful life or to make meaningful contributions to society.  But in our society, I use the word disability. In fact, I use it quite often. And why is that? Because if I need to advocate on behalf of Autistics in order for us to receive needed services or supports, or for systemic changes to be made to benefit Autistics, I have to use the word disability to get attention, to be taken seriously, and to effect those changes.  I think this is a tragedy. I think it is a tragedy that while there are parts of the world -- usually rural, \u201cundeveloped\u201d (another word with such nuanced connotations behind it) areas -- where people who need significant amounts of outside support are welcomed and supported by the entire community, and where this is natural and normal, it is abnormal or exceptional in most of the \u201cdeveloped\u201d world, and indeed, in the places where most people live. We look down on people who require significant support from people, especially non-family members. We pity them. Sometimes, we think of them as burdens to society because of the public funding that goes to support them. In these other parts of the world, in these isolated hamlets, these people are equal parts of the community that joyfully supports and encourages them instead of reluctantly giving to charity cases.  That is why I found my mother\u2019s response to the story so problematic. It encapsulates, in only a few fell sentences, the attitude our society has developed toward ability and disability.  I am Autistic. For now, I am disabled.  Today, I am speaking.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autistichoya.blogspot.com/2011/11/disability-is-social-construct.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/11/showcase-autistic-hoyas-disability-is.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Autistic Hoya's \"Disability is a Social Construct\"\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, September 3, 2011", "body": "\n \n It is a pleasure to introduce  Follow the Rabbit.  It is a wonderfully illustrated story blog about the daily adventures of Wabbit and his friends(ghost bunny and big blue snail). Each post details these colorful characters in short but very funny blog entries. \u00a0I think that everyone-no matter what age, can enjoy this. \u00a0In order to thoroughly appreciate it-I suggest that you start from the  beginning  and read your way forward. \u00a0We were very lucky here at the directory-we were able to find an interview with the Wabbit himself. I hope that you all go on over and visit the Wabbit. \u00a0It really is a lot of fun\u00a0 \n \n The Wabbit gives a personal interview We were asked to give an account of how\u00a0 writer and photographer, Coinneach Shanks and illustrator, Clari Csuk collaborated on development of the\u00a0 Wabbit Adventures . So we decided to hand the whole matter over to the Wabbit .\u00a0\u00a0 Well, he rather insisted ... \n Producer : Silence in the Studio please. Commander Wabbit is just arriving ... \n Interviewer : Welcome Commander Wabbit. \n The Wabbit : Commander is just fine!\u00a0 May I press these buttons? \n Interviewer : Better not, Commander. \n \n The Wabbit : Oh all right. How may I be of assistance to your listeners? \n \n Interviewer . Would you tell us of your rise to prominence?\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n The Wabbit : It is all due to my originators, Coinneach and Clari. For some time\u00a0 I was merely an idea, a whim but a substantial whim. \n \n Interviewer : How does a whim become a reality? \n \n The Wabbit : Through Twitter! I leapt onto the page and started calling out that I was delayed. Which I was. Everyone was waiting for the Wabbit. But before very long, Coinneach started to recount my adventures to all my followers in a blog on that Internet device thingy.\u00a0 \n \n Interviewer : But we couldn't really see you Commander, could we? \n \n The Wabbit : Well what the viewer saw was what I could see. They saw through my eyes. Coinneach used to bend down with his camera to my height but of course no-one could see me, only what I saw!\u00a0 It was Clari Csuk who made me visible. First she fashioned a fine Twitter avatar and then one day Coinneach received a wonderful\u00a0 portrait through the mail. It is an extraordinary thing! It clothed me in a superhero costume and conferred upon me some extra-special abilities.\u00a0 \n \n Interviewer : \u00a0 Perhaps you could give our listeners some examples of your Clari Csuk super powers? \n \n The Wabbit:\u00a0 Of course! Super hearing, hovering and a universal translator. Now I only wear the cloak for formal occasions like a Gala Dinner or marching or jumping from high buildings into heli-choppers. \n \n Interviewer:\u00a0 Ah yes, your adventures. How did all the characters come into being? \n \n The Wabbit : (laughing through his 28 teeth) The first character wasn't me it all! It was that Skratch the Cat Burglar. Coinneach's cat set off the burglar alarm one night and the very next day Clari made Skratch. He's a rogue but rather useful on occasions, even if he makes eyes at my beloved, the Lovely Lapinette. Clari modelled Lapinette on Camilla, Coinneach's partner. Now she's becoming more popular than the Wabbit, I dare say. She is very special. Clari works with materials, like fabrics, board and found objects and so we all look as deliciously 3-D as we are in real life.\u00a0 \n \n Interviewer : About those colours and shapes?\u00a0 \n \n The Wabbit :\u00a0 Clari's colours and shapes are distinctive and sometimes I think I have never seen these shades or colours ever before. Coinneach cuts out the characters and other shapes for every episode so I am always different, just like Clari's pieces. I am very pleased that I was at the centre of Clari's most recent exhibition, \n \n Interviewer : And your role as a Secret Agent ? \n \n The Wabbit:\u00a0\u00a0 Some say we are the wabbit version of John Steed and Emma Peel in the Avengers, but of course they don't seem to have all the paperwork we do (laughs) . \n \n Interviewer : What about the shadowy yet powerful Department of Wabbit Affairs? \n \n The Wabbit: \u00a0I can offer you little comment beyond the public domain. Nothing special, all very governmental and bureaucratic. Wabbits with green filing cabinets. \n \n Interviewer:\u00a0 Perhaps you can comment on autism for our listeners? \n \n The Wabbit : Thank you. That is why I came. Clari has an autistic son Oscar. He is a great friend of the Wabbit and it is he that is responsible for administration of any mail sent to my headquarters. The Wabbit adventures are strongly against social exclusion and you may have noticed that in the stories, the Wabbit always gets included. No matter where he goes, he is accepted. That is the policy of the Wabbit and what he wants for all beings. People with autism - I hope I have that right - are misunderstood and the Wabbit wants to remedy this. Acceptance and inclusion is the way of the Wabbit and of the collaboration of Coinneach and Clari. Thank you. \n \n Interviewer : Thank you Commander. I may assume that listeners can go to the\u00a0 National Autistic Society \u00a0for more details? \u00a0 \n \n The Wabbit:\u00a0 You may! Can I press these buttons now? \n \n Interviewer : No! \n \n The Wabbit \u00a0Oh OK then. May I keep the microphone?. \n \n Interviewer:\u00a0 Definitely not \n \n The Wabbit : Grrrrr \n \n \n Interview Ends \n \n Follow the Adventures of the Wabbit at\u00a0 Follow the Wabbit \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://followthewabbit.blogspot.com/", "http://followthewabbit.blogspot.com/2010/07/wabbit-saw-bike.html", "http://wabbitinterviews.blogspot.com/", "http://followthewabbit.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autism.org.uk/", "http://www.autism.org.uk/", "http://followthewabbit.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/showcase-follow-wabbit.html", "title": "\nShowcase-Follow the Wabbit\n"},

During\nthe consecration, the priest held up the host and repeated the words of Jesus:\n\u201cTake this  all  of you and eat.\u201d The word \u201call\u201d resonated in the spacious\nchurch and we realized that our 7-year-old daughter Danielle, who has autism,\nwas certainly part of that \u201call.\u201d But as we fixed our eyes on the consecrated\nbread and wine, we were both praying  God\nin heaven; don\u2019t let her spit it out .  \n \n \n \nFortunately, when a few minutes later the time came for\nDanielle to receive her First Holy Communion, our prayers were answered.\nDanielle received the precious Body of Christ reverently. Kneeling together in\nsilence, our family shared this very special moment in our daughter\u2019s life, a\nmoment we thought might never happen. \n \n \n \n \n \nBut our story didn\u2019t begin that August evening. When\nDanielle was age 4, she was diagnosed with autism, a neurological condition\nthat affects language, social interaction, and behavior. Danielle is non-verbal\nand we realized early on that for her to receive the gifts of the sacraments\nshe would require a different approach than what is used for most children,\nincluding her two older brothers. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0Like many children\nwith autism, Danielle is a visual learner and uses a picture-based language to\ncommunicate. Therefore, she needed a visual, picture-based approach to learn\nwhat was needed in order to be ready to receive her sacraments. She prepared\nfor her First Holy Communion using a variety of homemade teaching tools. With\nthis approach, she was able to satisfy the bishops\u2019 requirements of\ndistinguishing the consecrated host from ordinary food and receiving communion\nreverently. We were so proud of her! \n \n \n \n \n \nSome time after this, our son Brendan, a Boy Scout, was\nnearing the rank of Eagle. As part of this process, he had to organize and\nimplement a special project. He remembered how we had prepared Danielle for her\nFirst Communion and told us that other parents \u201cshould not have to reinvent the\nwheel.\u201d  \n \n \n \nTherefore, for his Eagle Scout Project, he developed a\nspecial needs resource library in our parish to be used by children who might\nrequire special approaches to prepare for their sacraments. Out of this we put\ntogether additional materials that ultimately became  The Adaptive First\nEucharist Preparation Kit , now available through Loyola Press. \n \n \n \n \n \nThis brings us back to the words of Jesus quoted at the\nbeginning of our story: \u201cTake this  all  of you and eat.\u201d We believe that\nJesus was reaching out to all people everywhere, including people with\ncognitive and developmental disabilities. We believe strongly that Jesus meant\nto include all God\u2019s children and that is why we are so excited to see the\nAdaptive First Eucharist Kit available as a resource to help this  all \nbecome a reality. \n \n \n \nMercedes and David Rizzo \n \nAugust 28, 2011 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/adaptive-first-eucharist-preparation.html", "title": "\nAdaptive First Eucharist Preparation Kit\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, August 21, 2011", "body": "\nToday we're interviewing Xanthe from  Asperger's Child. \n \n \n \n \n Parts of your blog are fairly edgy. For example, your  latest  posts regarding  Penelope Trunk, are as you put it, blunt. You question her honesty, and it had to take some courage to do so, given her past reactions. Do you weigh the pros and cons before writing posts you think might cause you negative attention? \n \n \nYes, of course I thought about it, especially because PT has a hoard of admiring fans and because she wrote about how she hassled a man over a tweet - she pretty much stalked him.  To her credit, she leaves her criticism posts up too (so do I) and she wasn't very popular over her 'I have David...' post - some said she got the nukes out over a bow-and-arrow comment.   \n \n \nSomeone tweeted me and said they thought my hub article would be more credible if I took out irrelevant stuff which just makes it look judgemental.  He offered some specific pointers and I revised it to be more about questioning whether her behaviour is Asperger's or not.  A internet psychologist writer that has recommended PT in the past said it was an excellent analysis and certainly food for thought.  \n \n \nWhen I started my 2 blogs on Asperger's and rejecting my religion, I was already aware of internet nutters from debating on the religious forum of hub pages - plenty of extremists there.  I decided to blog under a pen-name because 1.  I don't care about fame  2.  I want to protect my family from stalker nutbars 3. I don't want employers and potential employers looking me up and judging me - I'd rather people at work don't know everything about me 4. I write about personal stuff, yet am a private person - it's not stuff I tell people about that I meet. 5. I don't want my son to be embarrassed by being easily identifiable.  He thinks it's cool we're on a website 'undercover'.  6. I don't want the stress and drama of being sued  \n \n \nI decided that PT has no problem putting her opinion out there, and blogs are about opinions, so I'd put mine out there too.  I hope that I managed to be objective and not judgemental of her as a person, but rather that I had problems with her claims and behaviour.  My writing is blunt and confrontational, which some people find unsettling.  There's an atheist, ex-minister blogger that is a published author that lives in the bible belt.  He can't get work cleaning carpets because he is known &amp; because of the bigotry.   \n \n \nI've considered taking down any photos of us from HubPages (where I first started writing) - concerns about deranged stalkers. \n \n \nBut I figure if they're old pics that don't really look like us now, it probably doesn't really matter.  Someone would have to go to a lot of trouble to link me to my blog entries about how I find work and link it to my employer to get me fired.  Or to dig around to find my real name.  I don't want to censor stuff (apart from specific identifying details like names) because of fear of getting fired and having my family known and hassled.   \n \n \n \n You also write honestly and openly about issues with your mother and sister and how they treat you. Do you find that sharing this provides an outlet that is therapeutic and makes you  able to continue to interact with them? Do you think there comes a point where the healthier thing to do is break off all contact permanently? \n \nI want to write more about the dysfunction in my family particularly with religion, as it affected me a lot.  I've been accused by my mother and sisters of being mentally unstable and bitter and angry for doing so, but this is not the case.  I am writing about it objectively because there are many people out there in the same boat that grew up to believe they were the crazy ones.  My mother is concerned about what people might think of her, despite the fact I use a pen-name and 99.99% of readers wouldn't know who we are.   \n \n \nI have even set up a facebook account in my pen-name and no longer post my articles on my 'real name' FB (which has several christians from my past).  I have a note on there that if anyone wants to follow my blogs on asperger's and losing my religion, please contact me.  I have a few christians that read my blogs and know who my family is, but they don't judge me.  I got the idea of using a cartoon-style avatar from an atheist blogger who writes honestly about very personal stuff.  He has a facebook account under his pen-name too.   \n \n \nI have suggested to my family that they don't have to read it if they find it uncomfortable.  It is also my perspective and how it affected me.  They want me to 'forgive and forget', yet I get the same hypocritical behaviour of where I get slaughtered and rejected, but they say I love you.  To me, saying I love you and doing the opposite with behaviour is hypocrisy.   \n \n \nAt first when I wrote about leaving religion on Hub Pages, I'd avoid mentioning my family and not reveal what things they said that were detrimental to my mental health and self-esteem.  These family dynamics are an important part of my story, so I want to write about them, not to shame them but to show how religion and family dysfunction can affect people.  I'm not about revenge, but exposing hypocrisy and injustice.  It felt good to write about getting fired from work unfairly even though I couldn't reveal the workplace.   \n \nMy mother has indicated that she's done talking to me, and my sisters don't really communicate with me anyway.  I accepted the dysfunction in my family years ago, so it doesn't cause me a lot of pain if my sisters and mother refuse to have contact with me.  I'd prefer no contact over toxic interactions - where I just get told that everything I do is wrong.  What makes me sad is my mother is making the decision that I don't have contact with my father. \n \n \nI've had awesome support from people that have left messages, comments and emailed me.  Their encouragement and support in complete contrast to my family keep me writing.  For me, writing is not about my ego or being most popular.  Sure it's therapeutic writing, but I know there are a lot of people lonely and isolated out there that are going through what I've been through and might not make it out the other side.  I had a man write to me that he decided not to commit suicide after reading my stuff (on another profile where I put stuff I was too embarrassed to write about).   Maybe I'll get brave enough to join it all together and share some secrets.  Generally I don't write about something unless I've gotten over the pain and can be objective about it.  Also that I can handle any criticism  (which has generally been from my family and a few extremist fundamental christians - the moderate christians can see my points).  \n \n \n \n \n How long have you been blogging and communicating online through other outlets? Have you learned any lessons that you wish you'd known before you started? \n \n \nI used to excel at essay writing at school and university but didn't write much since.  I entered an essay writing competition a few years ago about mental health.  I was shy about sharing my story, so I wrote it using a metaphor and in the second person so it wasn't clear whether it was my story or someone I knew well.  I won a major prize which gave me confidence to write more.   I wanted to start a website sharing what I've learned about food sensitivities, but didn't know how to go about it.  My hubby found Hub Pages and suggested I try that as a hobby.  I started writing on Hub Pages under a pen-name 'baileybear' over a year ago.  I write about any topic of interest to me.  Hubpages was an easy platform with plenty of support from other members and I learnt how to do links etc. \n \n \nI got a lot of positive feedback about my articles on Asperger's and some people encouraged me to set up a website.  I 'came out' that I didn't believe in God anymore. I linked it to my Facebook and waited for my family to react.  My mother went nuts at me and didn't speak to me for months.   \n \n \nI started my Asperger's Child website on an easy-to-use platform, Weebly and put a blog on one page. I started it just 4 months ago. When I got tired of debating on the HubPages forum about religion, I started a blog on Blogger (to try it out and because I didn't want a 'website').  That was 3 months ago.  I don't write on Hub Pages much these days.  I am also nearly ready to publish a website about food sensitivities (finally!).   \n \n \nI'm not a prolific blogger - I try to write at least one post on any one of my blogs per week.  I have so much to write about, but never enough time to. I get told I spend too much of my spare time on the computer as it is.   \n \n \n Do you have a favorite post you want to share with readers? A post you wish in hindsight that you hadn't done? \n \nMy most read article so far is 'Evolution and Unintelligent Design' on Hubpages.  I've won 3 hubpages 'awards' for my writing.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0  \nMy favourite articles on Hubpages are the series I did on colour in nature (as I like science and art) and Old Man's Nuts. If you've got a strong stomach, you can read \"I could have sworn I flushed that\" about our toilet dramas.    I've only removed one article, about a murderer I knew that went to my family's church.  I want to rework it with less identifying details and put on my God Confusion blog.  I've got some unpublished at the moment, as I'm transferring the bulk of the content to my new website.   \n \n \n \n \n \nXanthe's two blogs,  God Confusion  and  Asperger's Child  are both on the directory under bloggers with autism.

{"date": "Monday, August 22, 2011", "body": "\n Self-Advocates: Parents Are Not (Always) Our Enemies   by Lydia After reading conversations in the comments on blog posts or news articles, or even on posts on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, it is very easy for self-advocates to assume that all (or at least most) non-Autistic parents of Autistic children are our enemies. After all, most people who want to cure Autism are parents; most people who claim that \"high-functioning people with Asperger's\" aren't really Autistic; most people who claim that all self-advocates are in fact \"high-functioning people with Asperger's\" (which isn't true); most people who want research to focus on curing Autistic children; and most people who loathe the word \"Autistic\" and much prefer \"person with Autism...\" Well, most (but certainly not all) of these people, or at least the most vocal among them, are the non-Autistic parents of Autistic children. The vitriolic fights between self-advocates and parents can be found quite easily anywhere on the internet -- and occasionally, in person as well. There was, actually, a very nasty email exchange quite full of ad hominems and personal attacks about two weeks ago among some of the members of my subcommitteealong those lines. (I did not add fuel to the fire, for the record.) Parents get furious with self-advocates for presuming to understand their children; self-advocates get furious with parents for completely misunderstanding the entire nature of Autism. Parents make us out to be the villains; self-advocates make out parents to be the villains. This in mind, it never ceases to surprise and excite me when I actually encounter parents who agree with any or all of the issues most important to Autistic self-advocates. Last week, I had a wonderful conversation with the non-Autistic mother of a young Autistic son. Her son is non-speaking and has some difficult, destructive behaviors. According to her, he regressed with Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), but is doing very well with the TEACCH program. This woman told me how she eschews the phrase \"person with Autism.\" \"My son does not have Autism,\" she said, \"he is Autistic. Autism is a part of him. It's part of his personality. I love him the way he is. Other parents don't get it.\" She told me that she doesn't want to cure her son. \"I'm so inspired by you -- by Autistic adults who I read on the internet. I'm fascinated by you. I wish other parents would understand that my son, their children, are going to grow up to be you, Lydia. They're going to grow up to be Ari [Ne'eman.]\" \"Parents think, I got a good placement for my child, I don't want to rock the boat. No, sorry, I can't help you,\" she said to me. \"But what happens to one child affects all of our children. We have to treat it like a civil rights issue.\" Now that piqued my interest, because the self-advocacy and neurodiversity movements treat our advocacy with the civil rights model as opposed to a medical model. It was strange and yet reassuring to hear this from a parent! Not only is this woman not Autistic, but her son is what most people would call \"low-functioning\" or \"severely Autistic.\" She fits the profile perfectly of so many parents who viciously attack the self-advocacy movement. Yet she shares in many of our goals and beliefs. So yes, the mythical parent allies of self-advocates do in fact exist. Let's remember this before accusing all parents of being our enemies. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autistichoya.blogspot.com/2011/08/self-advocates-parents-are-not-always.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/showcase-autistic-hoyas-self-advocates.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Autistic Hoya's Self-Advocates: Parents Are Not (Always) Our Enemies\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \u00a0  This week, I had the pleasure of interviewing Alisa Rock of  Rockautismexperience.com \u00a0 Her blog \u00a0is edgy, well written, sometimes\u00a0humorous\u00a0and always thought provoking. I hope that you all take the time to go on over and check her out. \n \n \n \n 1) First things first. Tell us a bit about yourself...who you are, what you do..what is your biggest personal dream..what's the absolute silliest thing you have ever done..likes, dislikes..guilty pleasures.\u00a0 \n \n I am 41 years old, have a 12 year old with autism and a typical 9 year old who seems to be developing a bit of an anxiety disorder (not surprisingly). \u00a0I am a stay at home mom married to a retired banker. \u00a0We live in Baltimore, MD. \u00a0I am on the board of a nonprofit here in Maryland, Pathfinders for Autism ( pathfindersforautism .org is the link). Pathfinders was started by a group including former Major League Orioles baseball athlete B.J.\u00a0 Surhoff \u00a0and his wife, Polly\u00a0 Surhoff \u00a0(herself an Olympic caliber swimmer), and operates a free referral and resource center. I was President of the Board of Pathfinders for two years. \u00a0Thankfully B.J. has taken over! \u00a0 \u00a0 I have an M.B.A. with a specialty in Strategic Planning from Johns Hopkins University and for undergraduate, went to Western Maryland College (now McDaniel) and graduated cum\u00a0 laude \u00a0in 1991 with a B.A. in English and and minor in Writing. I have worked in finance, publishing, and most recently, in nonprofit development, i.e.\u00a0 fundraising . I'm sorry, I have given up my personal dreams over the years after coping with my son's diagnosis and the ensuing travails. I don't have any personal dream. It's easier that way. My greatest desire right now is to visit Paris. \u00a0I'm not sure why, but that city intrigues me. If I am unable to travel anywhere else, I\u00a0 will \u00a0go to Paris. I like\u00a0 Pinot \u00a0 Noir, cheese, dinner out with my closest girlfriends, \u00a0shopping at Target, and I LOVE to read. \u00a0Murder mystery thrillers are my guilty pleasure, and I have recently discovered Jo\u00a0 Nesbo , a Norwegian author I would highly recommend. \u00a0Laura\u00a0 Lippman \u00a0is excellent, too, all her books are based in Baltimore. The silliest thing I ever did was to marry a divorcee eleven years my senior, and it was the best thing I ever did. \u00a0He told me he was sterile (it led to the demise of his first marriage) and two children later, I still tease him about this. (He claims I'm \"uber fertile\". \u00a0I guess I can't deny this. The proof is in the pudding, I mean, the boys.) \n \n \n 2) Why did you start\u00a0 blogging ? \u00a0Your\u00a0 blogging /writing is different now than when you started. Is the reasoning behind your\u00a0 blogging \u00a0different now than when you first started? \u00a0I asked the above for this reason. In your first posts (back in 2004) Your posts seem more about things you were trying/using to help your boy. \u00a0 \n \n I started the blog initially to communicate with family and with friends that I don't see very often. \u00a0It was also supposed to help me track what we were doing with our son. We did biomedical interventions, as well as behavioral interventions and a home-based academic program. \u00a0Additionally, I was overwhelmed with working a full time job trying to raise money for a nonprofit that sends Baltimore City public school students to college, and so I didn't keep up with it very much. When the recession hit, I decided to stop working for the nonprofit (at that point I had cut back to part time) to focus on my writing. \u00a0Unfortunately, I got quite ill with some stomach thing, and that put me out of commission for a good year. \u00a0Lost twelve pounds and spent most of my time in the bathroom. And canceled \u00a0the trip to Paris. \u00a0Le sigh. My son was finally stable and the blog was sort of on the back burner. Finally, felt better (thank god for gluten-free), and, wham,\u00a0 Conor's \u00a0behaviors went off the charts (they still are). At this point, I started a personal\u00a0 Facebook \u00a0page. \u00a0An old high school friend that I barely remembered remarked that I complained a lot about spending time with my children, and that maybe I should spend MORE time with them. We had five feet of snow that year. (Keep in mind that my son had been schooled in my home for six years; I spent more time with him than most parents spend with their typical children. She had no idea.) I immediately un-friended the high school friend that I barely remembered, but I began wondering... \u00a0why IS it so hard to raise a child with autism? \u00a0What AM I complaining about, and why? And thus, I began blogging more frequently, trying to answer this question for myself, my friends, my family... and for the random reader.\u00a0 Everything I read, I feel like it doesn't sufficiently explain the complex, complicated lives parents of children with autism lead. \u00a0Especially for those of us whose children are on the more affected end of the spectrum. \u00a0(My son has \"moderate\" autism, which I don't need to explain to you doesn't mean he has Aspergers or HFA. He's pretty disabled. Yes, disabled, not \"differently-abled.\") \u00a0 I was NOT expecting my son to have to go inpatient for his severe behavior. \u00a0But this is the journey autism takes us on. \n \n \n 3 ) I saw a difference in your writing from then till now.. I noticed a clear divide..not so much in emotion-but in how you are facing the\u00a0challenges\u00a0of raising a son with disabilities. One post that very much moved me was written on 8/19/09.. you wrote- \"I have come to love you as you are not as I thought you would be\" What brought about this piece? \n \n \n The poem... I think I reached the point where I accepted that I was not going to cure my son. I'm no quack... I wanted to be in the 47% of the Lovaas study and dove into ABA. \u00a0But it's not that simple I guess. We've tried everything, ABA, RDI, biomedical, horseback riding, craniosacral... \n \n \n 4) Your writing is very real, raw-and sometimes difficult to read because of the depth of emotion in it. \u00a0In other words you do not sugar coat anything-BUT at the same time, \u00a0your absolute love and passion for your son shines through.\u00a0 \n \n \n \u00a0 You are correct, I do not want to sugar coat this. \u00a0Raising a child with autism is difficult, it is challenging, it is heart-wrenching. \u00a0I read blogs, and as I said in one of my posts, they're all hug hug hug and I'm all fight fight fight. \u00a0There have GOT to be parents out there like me, who love their children with all their hearts but that are struggling... financially, emotionally, and even physically. Who speaks up for these families? \u00a0 Who communicates why public and private funding is so important? \u00a0Who else wants to let parents of typical children understand why it's important for our communities to support these families? \u00a0We won't get anywhere advocating for more funding if people don't really, truly understand what the challenges entail. What is the future for these families? \u00a0Our loved ones? \u00a0Because despite the challenges they present us with, we still love them, deeply and passionately.\u00a0 But there I go, preaching again. \u00a0As my roommate from college would say, preach it, sister. \u00a0And so I try. I try. \n \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rockautismexperience.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/showcase-alisa-rock-from.html", "title": "\nShowcase-Alisa Rock from rockautismexperience\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 4, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Wildeman's words. \n \n \n \n WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 3, 2011 \n \n \n \n \n Sensory school supplies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Now that the school year is drawing in close, it's time to get school supplies for many of us. As we do this, I wonder how many of us are on the watch for things that are \"sensory friendly\"? I'm not necessarily talking about pens and pencils, but anything at all that you would need to get for your child. In the world of our senses, it's amazing what can trip us up when they are turned up too high. In clothing, seams and scratchy material are the enemy to many an ASD child. It can cause high distraction and inability to sit still for very long. That's minding that our kids don't sit still long in the first place. Tags aren't ASD friendly either. Thankfully, there are tagless shirts out there. Some companies are printing their information right on the fabric. That has to be helpful right? If you inspect the clothing you buy (and I bet you do) you can see what kind of tags are easiest to cut out without damaging a shirt. You can also see what kind of seams are just too stiff to soften. Most T-shirt seams are pretty soft, but you know your child's sensitivities better than anyone. What about the designs printed on the shirts? Are they really stiff also? Don't forget socks either. Look for seamless designs in socks that fit to your child's size. You can order specialties online. \n \n When dealing with clothing, a good practice is to always wash all new clothes with a good dose of fabric softener before wear. You'll wash out any \"fillers\" used by the companies to keep the clothes from wrinkling on the sales floor. Those are most commonly used in jeans, but I've heard of them in shirts too. This will still go a long way toward making clothing softer and more comfortable. Now, what about pens and pencils? I've actually heard of children who don't like the pencils and pens with flattened sides on them. I think this is particularly rare, but maybe your child is one of them? I've come to wonder if this may get in the way of an ASD child's handwriting? If it's uncomfortable or distracting to use such an implement, wouldn't it make the task harder? Our kids can't necessarily tell us, so maybe a few experiments are in order. Then there's markers. Unscented is the way to go, as well as washable. I don't know about all our kids, but marker scent gives me a headache. Scent is one of my downfalls with my own condition. It's that way for my son too. Then there are those who like the scent a little too much. Either way is a distraction in class. \n \n Some of our kids are very sensitive to sound. I've seen that some schools have headphone ear protectors that make it easier for some kids. You can also order these from locations online. Now is the time to get prepared. Some of these items are not cheap, so the earlier you get them the better. Best of luck and a great start to all our kids' new school year. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["", "http://thewildeman2.blogspot.com/2011/08/sensory-school-supplies.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OSE_Z9KZHgk/Tjlajw7PtxI/AAAAAAAAAWA/wLYou3S-MbE/s1600/itching.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i1WQIAlKOsc/TjlatJ5C4VI/AAAAAAAAAWI/2wmILsg681w/s1600/stop%2Bscratching.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lClEOcLl9Us/TjlbZ0ryrgI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/0ZLkMuRY58o/s1600/loud.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/beat-back-to-school-jitters-wildemans.html", "title": "\nBeat the Back-to-School Jitters: Wildeman's Words' \"Sensory school supplies\"\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n An interview with Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg of  Autism and Empathy . \n \n \n \n \nWhere does you interest in the subject of autism and empathy come from? \n \nFor a long time, I've been very troubled by the stereotype that autistic individuals lack empathy, and by the lack of specificity that people bring to the discussion. There are three kinds of empathy -- cognitive, emotional, and expressed -- and yet it's unusual to find people taking care with which one they're talking about. Much of the time, one hears generalized statements along the lines of \"autistic people lack empathy\" or \"autistic people have impaired empathy,\" and most people interpret those statements to mean that we lack the ability to feel with and for other people. In my experience, and in the experience of many others in the autism community, that is very decidedly not the case. \n \n What made you decide to create a separate blog on autism and empathy rather than just continue to discuss it on your own blog? Is this in  part a response to Simon Baron-Cohen's latest book, The Science of Evil? \n \nWhile I've had an interest in the subject for a long time, Simon Baron-Cohen's latest book was the catalyst for my decision to create the site. Both the book and the interviews he's done about it trouble me a great deal. While he himself acknowledges that it is very difficult to measure emotional empathy, he continues to assert that autistic people have an impairment in this area. I'm also very concerned that he considers autistic people to have zero degrees of empathy -- and that he includes that assertion in a book about various forms of psychopathy, which he characterizes as deriving from zero degrees of empathy as well.  \n \nI should point out, in fairness, that Dr. Baron-Cohen considers autistic people to have \"zero-positive\" empathy while psychopaths have \"zero-negative\" empathy, but his assertion that we are on the zero end of the scale fails to account for the fact that many autistic people, autism parents, and autism professionals report normal-to-high levels of emotional empathy, and that there is no test that can reliably measure emotional empathy at all. And for most people, the idea that we are \"zero-positive\" isn't going to be particularly comforting or result in greater acceptance; all it really says is that we lack empathy but do not mean harm. I work as a caregiver, and I can tell you for certain that my employers would not hire someone they believed would do harm and not intend it! They want someone with empathy, sensitivity, and responsiveness, and fortunately, they are able to see that I have all of those things. But for many people, the stereotypes loom very large. \n \nIn order to counter the prevailing mythology, I decided to start the Autism and Empathy website. It exists as a place to gather together two types of information: 1) the stories and experiences of autistics, autism parents and family members, autism professionals, and anyone else with an interest in the subject and 2) critiques of current autism theory, along with research that counters the stereotypes. The Autism and Empathy site allows people to come together and read about the subject in one place. \n \n What bothers you the most about the research involving autism and empathy? Do you think the wrong kinds of questions are being asked?  \n \nMy main difficulty with the research on autism and empathy is that it so often fails to take into consideration the nature of autistic experience. It tends to see autistic people only through the eyes of the non-autistic observer, and then interprets the results as they might be interpreted if a non-autistic person were manifesting the same responses. So, for example, if you have a child who laughs hysterically when someone is hurt, a non-autistic observer will likely draw the conclusion that the child has no empathy; after all, the observer thinks, why else would the child laugh in response to another person's pain? But if you look at the situation through the eyes of the autistic child, who has an acute experience of the sensory and emotional world,  who is flooded with sound, with visuals, and with the intense emotion of the situation, and who does not have the language to describe his or her experience, then the hysterical laughter signals something very different. It is a physical response to being overwhelmed and a sign that the child is in distress. In fact, it may signal a very high level of empathy on the part of the autistic child, who may be having immense difficulty shielding from the experience of the person in pain. \n \nCertainly, for the sake of a child's ability to navigate the world and relate to a variety of people, it makes sense to work on more appropriate responses; but for some autistic people, who have great difficulties with communication, conventional expressions of empathy aren't possible. The lack of conventional expression is not the same as a lack of emotional empathy; but, all too often, the research makes that huge, unwarranted interpretive link. \n \nThere is also the difficulty of judging cognitive empathy only from a non-autistic point of view. It's clear to me that people with similar minds and similar experiences have an easier time understanding one another's cues and guessing at one another's feelings. And, because there are more non-autistic people than autistic people, the average person is able to guess correctly more of the time. On the whole, autistics do have difficulty interpreting the nonverbal cues of non-autistic people; however, many of us do quite well at interpreting what's going on in the experience of another autistic person. When a non-autistic person generalizes that autistic people have impaired emotional empathy, he or she is showing equal difficulty in reading the nonverbal cues of autistic people and understanding our states of mind.  \n \nTo me, the difficulty of  reading people who are very different from oneself and imagining how they might feel is not a problem of impaired empathy. It's a problem of reaching across the divide of vastly different experience, which is a challenge for all human beings.  \n \n Do you think that a subset of individuals with autism might truly lack all forms of empathy, that the spectrum is wide and encompasses all ranges of empathy levels or do you see those individuals with autism who apparently lack empathy as being misunderstood? \n \nOf course, there are autistic people who lack empathy, just as there are non-autistic people who lack empathy. We're human beings, after all. But I don't think that these differences in the autistic population have anything to do with where the autistic person is on the spectrum; some parents of kids on the moderate-to-severe end of the spectrum have reported seeing empathy in their children, and nonverbal autistic people who can write describe their experiences of empathy quite well. \n \n Do you see a difference between the autism community itself and how it views autism/empathy and the larger world and how it views autism/empathy?  \n \nVery much so. The myth that autistic people are cold, emotionless robots who cannot understand or care about the feelings of others is alive and well in the larger world. Inside the autism community, though, one of the few things that most of us agree on is that this stereotype is highly inaccurate. So often, I read words from parents like the following: \"When we first got the diagnosis, I was afraid that my child would never feel empathy, never care about the feelings of other people, never love me. And as we progressed on our journey, and I saw that my child feels the emotions of other people acutely, and shows care and concern, that was my first preconception to fall by the wayside.\" \n \n Who do you hope will read your blog? Who do you hope will contribute to it?  \n \nAt this point, my goal is for parents, family members, and autistics to come to the site and see that their experiences are not an anomaly. So far, I have obtained permission to post numerous pieces by autistics, parents, and professionals, and I've only just begun the process of collecting all the information that's out there. The site also contains links to research about autism and empathy, and to critiques of the current literature. \n \nUltimately, of course, I want people outside of the autism community to come to the site and see a wealth of information that dispels all the stereotypes they've heard. \n \n \n What do you hope will be the end result of a blog on autism and empathy? \n \nI hope that the larger world will come to see autistic people as full human beings, with the full range of human feelings, and that we can turn away from the stereotypes toward greater understanding. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismandempathy.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/interview-with-rachel-cohen-rottenberg.html", "title": "\nAn interview with Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg of Autism and Empathy\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 18, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nFrom Carolyn at\u00a0 http://neurotypicalmom.com/ : \n \n \n \nMy seven year old has Aspergers and I need to become a Pediatrician. \u00a0It still feels very strange to say both of those things. \u00a0Perhaps because we have only had an official diagnosis for 5 months? \u00a0But that's not it, not really. \u00a0Getting the diagnosis was such a relief, after years of Z being thrown out of schools, acting oddly on play dates, destroying our house and making me curl up in a ball and cry weekly. \u00a0No, once we had the diagnosis I actually exhaled. \u00a0Consciously, I never even knew that I was holding my breath, but I must have been. \u00a0For five years at least, because once I heard Aspergers, my first thought was, 'finally, thank god! \u00a0Now we can actually help him!' \u00a0And help him we did. \u00a0A whole new world opened up to our sweet boy, he began to blossom in ways that I could never have imagined. \u00a0Our relationship flourished as it never has before. \u00a0We are close now, he comes to me when he's sad, just last week - he told me he felt sick! \u00a0Hence the need for the aforementioned medical degree. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhat a huge victory that was! \u00a0I can assure you that has never happened before in his entire existence. \u00a0I've spent most of his life feeling as if I were a perfect candidate for 'Worst Mother of the Year' award. \u00a0Especially when I would do things like take him on a plane and he would say, casually, mid-flight, \u00a0'huh, my ear just popped'. \u00a0Why - you might ask - does his ear pop? \u00a0Well, that would be because of the raging ear double ear infection that he had prior to getting on the plane. \u00a0The one that I never knew about - I swear! \u00a0 \n \nThe doctors would always look at me with reproach, 'this looks like it's been going on for a while, Mom', they would say as I looked at them helplessly, a mix of guilt and anger churning in my gut. \n \n \n \n'Do you think I knew and I kept it from you? That there is any part of me that would want him to suffer, EVER? \u00a0No folks, he didn't tell me. \u00a0He didn't act different in any way. \u00a0He was his normal self, running around the house, banging into walls, falling on the floor and laughing. \u00a0He was only BUSIER, MORE EXCITED and MORE FRUSTRATING - that's all! \u00a0That's the only clue I would ever have that all was not right in Z's world. \u00a0And, I'm sorry, sometimes I missed the signs. \u00a0I didn't do it on purpose, I would just get busy, in the way that parents do and suddenly it would occur to me that Z was acting like he was on a day pass from the loony bin and had been for the past 48 hours... \n \n \n \nHow much would be solved if I was a pediatrician. \u00a0Then, if Z started acting a little more hyper and I could break out the stethoscope and look in his ears. \u00a0Or pull out a throat swab and test for strep. \u00a0How I could avoid so much pain for Z (not to mention all of the judgement for me). \u00a0If I have one more doctor look down his or her nose at me and treat me like I'm a bad mother I think I will lose it. \u00a0I may actually scream the words throbbing in my head! \u00a0 \n \n'I'm not doing it on purpose!' \u00a0 \n \n'He didn't tell me!'\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnd when he's really sick, the times that I actually do know how bad he feels because his behavior is soooo over the top, \n \n'I want to help him too', \u00a0 \n \n'I want to hold him and make it better', \n \n'I want him to stop screaming every time I touch him' \n \n'I want some peace' \n \nMost of all, I just want to know how to make my baby feel better, it must be hell to be in his mind sometimes. I can\u2019t even imagine and if I try to, it hurts my heart. \u00a0Maybe if I was a pediatrician, this would all be better. \u00a0At least, that's what I tell myself. \u00a0Soooo, anyone know any good schools that take stay-at-home moms? \u00a0Or perhaps there is a way you can get that M.D. online? \u00a0Any thoughts? \u00a0Anyone?

Each day, I am amazed at how awesome, how giving, how compassionate so many of the families impacted by autism are (and that includes the family member on the spectrum--awesome, giving, compassionate). They and their family members with autism should be celebrated, appreciated, and applauded for getting up each day and moving forward, working harder, giving a little more. \n \n \n \n I\u2019m the Parent\u2026. by Tanya Gonzales \n \n I\u2019m the parent of a beautiful young boy with Autism. So often I find myself thinking what it means to be the parent of a special needs child and the feelings I often wish I could scream from the roof tops. I have captured some of them here and share them as a way of hopefully building understanding, for I\u2019m the parent of a special needs child. Teachers, I\u2019m the parent of a special needs child and I know that as a special needs teacher, you face many challenges in the class room, I know this because I\u2019m the parent. Sometimes I wish you would be as quick to tell me about his victories as you are about his problem behaviors. I long for the day you can\u2019t wait to tell me about something he has accomplished and that you would realize how bad I need to hear that, because I\u2019m the parent. The parent who mourns lost dreams and wonders if my child will be able to accomplish even just the basics, and live a fulfilling life. The next time you say to me in disgust that \u201che was in time out most of the day and just out of control\u201d please take a moment and remember, I\u2019m the parent, and a few kind words, or a gentler approach would be much appreciated. Please also know that I will always have concern for his safety, want the best education, advocate on his behalf, and will not make apologies if, while I am caring for my son, I use a strong tone, stand my ground, or fight for what my son is entitled to because I\u2019m the parent of a child who cannot do this for himself. Strangers, as you stare and wonder why I can\u2019t control my child or if he\u2019s a spoiled brat. I wish that you would just know, I\u2019m not a bad mother, my son is not a spoiled brat, I\u2019m the parent. I\u2019m the parent of a child who sometimes can\u2019t handle his environment, has a hard time waiting, is over stimulated, or is just trying to process all that is going on. Instead of staring, offer a hand, or just a simple act of kindness, a smile, a wish for a better day. I\u2019m not a bad mother, I\u2019m the parent of a beautiful child who blesses me in more ways than your staring, judge mental eyes will ever know. Friends, most of you know me as an outgoing, some say strong, independent, no nonsense woman and most of the time that is true but please also remember, I\u2019m the parent of a child who has needs that sometimes drain me but mostly break my heart. I\u2019m often filled with questions, \u201cwhat will happen to Jordan if something happens to me\u201d, \u201cwill he drive? Love? Marry? live on his own? have a seizure and hurt himself?\u201d \u201cwill he eat regular food? have I been a good mom? have I done enough?\u201d Sometimes I am so overwhelmed it\u2019s all I can do to get out of bed but I must, for I\u2019m the parent. Please understand that like Jordan, I can\u2019t always cope with my feelings and at these times please know that sometimes I need space, sometimes a strong shoulder and listening ear, sometimes a cheerleader to tell me to keep going. Sometimes I just need you to know that underneath the silliness, the sometimes false bravado, the \u201clife of the party\u201d mentality, I\u2019m the parent of a child with special needs. And my dearest Jordan, you are a child who constantly amazes, inspires, and enlightens me in ways that I can\u2019t always articulate. Each time you touch, hug or kiss me, look at me with those beautiful big eyes, lay your long arm, with man like hands around my shoulder, I thank God that I\u2019m the parent. The parent that gets to brag to all my friends about your genius qualities. I\u2019m the parent that gets to laugh every day, see your face light up every day when I pick you up from school, and know soul deep love that overwhelms me and fills me with the greatest joy.

Always. Notice.\u00a0 And it always sucks when they do. \n\u00a0 My heart sinks like my secret is out.\u00a0 Not that it is a secret.\u00a0 I'm not embarrassed \n\u00a0that he is on the spectrum, but I've lied to myself enough to think that other \n\u00a0people really don't notice.\u00a0 It's not for my sake that I don't want them to \n\u00a0notice- I'm the first to tell people about it, but it's for his.\u00a0 Because I know \n\u00a0one day people won't think his quirks are so cute anymore.\u00a0 And they'll judge. \n\u00a0 I know we're getting closer to that day. \n \nWe left the office to go get my prescription.\u00a0 While putting him in his car seat, \n\u00a0Isaac looked up at the sky and said, \"Look! People!\"\u00a0 I told him they were \n\u00a0clouds in the sky. \u00a0 He repeated me, but then said, \"Look! People in the sky!\" \n\u00a0I shrugged.\u00a0 Who knows what he really sees?\u00a0 I'm starting to realize just how \n\u00a0different things must look to him.\u00a0 He has a totally different nervous system \nand brain than \"normal\" kids.\u00a0 It was 3pm.\u00a0 His singing for speech class \n\u00a0would be starting in a half hour.\u00a0 My need-to-be-in-control brain was trying \n\u00a0to push this little boys limits.\u00a0 He looked tired and not himself, but I was still \n\u00a0determined to get him to that class after picking up my medicine.\u00a0 After \nthat doctor's inquiry my \"fix it\" mom mode was kicked into high gear. \n\u00a0 He would go to speech class.\u00a0 He would learn to talk \"normally\". \n\u00a0People wouldn't notice so much.\u00a0 We pulled into Meijer and I called my dad. \n\u00a0 I just had to tell someone what that doctor asked about my baby, \n\u00a0and how it made me feel.\u00a0 \"It's just hard.\u00a0 When he's like this, \n\u00a0I don't know what to do. \n\u00a0 I don't know how to help him get back in balance.\"\u00a0 I sobbed. \n\u00a0 Dad gave his usual calming \"I know.\"\u00a0 I said goodbye and hung up \n\u00a0to go into the store. \n\u00a0 I turned around to look at Isaac.\u00a0 He was sound asleep in his car seat. \n\u00a0 I sighed.\u00a0 This boy didn't need singing class. \n\u00a0He needed a nap so that he can get over this cold. \n\u00a0He had been up since 6am.\u00a0 So we went home instead. \n \nHe's napping.\u00a0 I'm blogging.\u00a0 It's been something I've wanted to do for a long time, \n\u00a0but haven't until now.\u00a0 I didn't want people to think I felt sorry \n\u00a0for myself or that I was complaining.\u00a0 But I think part of going \n\u00a0through the process of accepting that your kid is different, and that it's \n\u00a0going to be a long and windy road takes talking about it.\u00a0 My poor dad \n\u00a0has been my sounding board for the past 3 years.\u00a0 It's time to give \nhim a break, and give other people a chance to read the day to day \n\u00a0of one mom's journey with a quirky kid. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://gftgd.blogspot.com/", "http://gftgd.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-ive-decided-to-blogdoctors-always.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/showcase-libby-from-grateful-for-good.html", "title": "\nshowcase: Libby from Grateful for the good days\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Autism success stories \u2013 Bram Cohen \n \n This\nweek\u2019s autism success story looks at internet entrepreneur Bram Cohen. This is\nthe latest in a series of guest articles looking at success stories from  Autism Care UK \nwho provide autism support services and  autism care homes \nacross the United Kingdom.  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Who is Bram Cohen? \n \n \n \n Born\nin 1975, Bram Cohen is an American computer programmer, who has Asperger\u2019s\nsyndrome. Like last\u2019s week success story Satoshi Tajiri he may not be a\nhousehold name, but like Satoshi his ground breaking invention shaped the\nmodern landscape, although Cohen is yet to have a theme park made based on his\nidea. Bram is the author of BitTorrent protocol, a system for sharing large\nfiles over the internet. Some estimates suggest that BitTorrent accounts for\nbetween 30-50% of all internet usage. As well as BitTorrent protocol and his\nbusiness BitTorrent, his other achievements include co-authoring Codeville and\nco-founding CodeCon.  \n \n \n \n In the spotlight.  \n \n Now based\nin San Francisco with his wife and three children, Cohen grew up in New York.\nAged just five, Cohen says that he learnt the BASIC programming language. Whilst\nattending high school he qualified for the United States Of America\nMathematical Olympiad. \u00a0  He studied at\nSUNY Buffallo, but dropped out of college and spent much of the nineties\nworking for a succession of dot com companies, including MojoNation.  \n \n In 2001,\nCohen quit MojoNation to begin work on BitTorrent and unveiled his ideas at the\nfirst CodeCon conference which alongside his roommate Len Sassaman created to\nshowcase technology projects. BitTorrent came to public prominence as users\nutilized its ability to quickly share files as a way to share movies and music.\nCohen claims that he has never violated copyright law using his software, but\nmillions of people did as its popularity grew. \u00a0\n However, it wasn\u2019t until the age of 29 that Cohen decided to form a\nbusiness built around his software.  \n \n \n \n Bram\u2019s experience of Asperger\u2019s. \n \n \n \n Like many with Asperger's\nsyndrome, Cohen is rooted in the world of objects and patterns, puzzles and\ncomputers, but leaves him disoriented with everyday human interactions and he admits\n \u00a0 social conventions that ease everyday\ninteractions can still elude him. For example he doesn\u2019t like to shake hands or\nmake small talk, often the staple of office relationships, and he often plays\nwith a Rubik\u2019s cube. He is also prone to the odd outburst of unwelcome candour.\n \u00a0 \n \n He cites his childhood as one of\nloneliness and isolation. Despite being able to programme in three languages he\ncould not comprehend and decipher the social hierarchies that make up teenage\nlife.  \"I was picked on a lot,\" he says. \"There was\nsomething obviously wrong with me. But it wasn't acknowledged until I was much\nolder that something had always been off-kilter. Were I to have to redo high\nschool, I would just drop out immediately.\"  \n \n Although no  longer\nCEO, Cohen's original concept has taken him a long\nway taken him a long way and his software is be used by a global audience of millions. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismcareuk.com/", "http://www.autismcareuk.com/", ""], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/autism-success-stories-bram-cohen.html", "title": "\nAutism success stories \u2013 Bram Cohen\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Thoughts on \"Horse Boy\" \n \n \n \n \n \nI heard about this book months ago at the library, and the premised sounded interesting. Of course I did lift a huge eyebrow on a shamanic horseback ride in Mongolia with their autistic son. That made me go \"Oh. White people.\" Hate it when privilege families do this crap. I do have my linger doubts about this movie as an autist and one that is also a shamanic path. I am curious to see how much of this is hokey New Age and White privilege and how much of it is genuine love and an acceptance with a dash of spiritualism. Now, I will say, I find horse-back riding to be powerfully soothing and it's probably the only natural talent I have, it doesn't make my symptoms go away, but it does allow me to think, and be as I am. I could give up all my meds, to be riding regularly again. I miss riding a lot. The beginning of course starts off with the typical 'Autism ruin us and our child blah blah we tried everything blah blah nothing work, we were desperate.\" I wasn't terribly intrigued with that. Though hearing Rupert go on about how Rowan was calmer and opened up to him on horse back was kinda interesting, I thought to myself \"Hippotherapy could be us-oh.\" Then he mentioned he wanted use shamanic healing because he had experience with it when he was in Africa. Oh. Well. At least his wife had some common sense. But they did decide to go Mongolia to travel on horse back to he shaman after shaman\u00a0 and being crazy white people with shit tons of money Christ They give this kid\u00a0 Valtrex \u00a0 really . Oh they believe in the \"Heavy Metals\" shit. Great.... I have to admit though, the drumming by the shamans sound like a horse galloping, I was getting really into it. However I kinda rolled my eyes, as they describe that the spirit of Kristin's grandmother was on Rowan, according to the shamans and she is bi-polar, and trying to \"take their son away?\" Good God. Quote: \"I had to ask myself, did really have his best interest at heart? Was I terrible father?\" Oh Jesus Christ on a Cracker. You dragged our autistic kid to Mongolia. For whacky shamanic crap and you decide that this time was good idea to matyrize. Spirits of the earth...please help me. Well at least Rowan got use to the shamanic ritual and chilled out, nice adjustment little bro, however I kinda felt bad for Tomo the little Mongolian boy who seemed put off by Rowan. However his interaction with him is endearing and seeing him doing more play with him is nice. Maybe I am jealous because I played by myself and I never liked playing with others. Mostly because I jut got sick of being the \"retard\". Though the whole thing with auties being one of the reason humanity is successful is nice little ego boost. THANKS TEMPLE! Rowan is supper cute with the goats though. However when he reject the horse-riding I did feel for Rupert a bit. But...At the same time. Why didn't Rupert let Rowan easy himself on the horse? Let Rowan get to know his partner? It felt like the forced him on the horse. It was bit...jarring. Eventually Rowan did calm himself while riding and I think this line touched me Quote:\" I am a better father because of his autism.\" Awww that is kinda cute. The part of the reindeer herders that live on the Siberian border, is kinda...cute. Over all I was expecting the same, spiritual mumbo jumbo. What I got was something that didn't surprise me, but still made me happy. The reindeer herder believed that Rowan could be a shaman in the future. This brought a grin to my face, because it's common for some indigenous cultures to believe autists could be shamans and that they are different because they are more spiritually attuned to the earth. Personally I rather take that tripe over poisons by vaccines. As a shaman myself, this is kinda encouraging. Near the end, the shaman said to Rupert and Kristin, that Rowan's incontinence and meltdowns will go away immediately, after he finished healing him. I lifted an eyebrow. Yeah he maybe potty trained, but the meltdowns won't go away. However just as I expected, he was bathrooming on his own and there were more shots of him being chilled than tired and cranky. Oh ok. Was it the power of the shaman, or Rowan learning to adapt? I be the family believes the former...*shrug* I did like the prayer that Rupert gave was to intergration and understanding than a cure. Not bad. Over all the movie was...meh. I was more annoyed at the privlege of the family than anything else. At least the movie pushed the, \"Accept not cure\" idea. Which was at least reassuring. Rupert said his son is still autistic but lost all the suffering that came with it and moved passed the emotional and physical incontinence through shamanism. I am still waiting for my shamanic miracle as I pray and listen to the sprirts, but then again. I don't need a miracle. 3 and half hand-flaps. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://prismsong.blogspot.com/2011/06/thoughts-on-horse-boy.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/showcase-nightstorm-from-prismsong.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Nightstorm from Prism*Song\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, May 22, 2011", "body": "\nHappy Elf Mom from  Homeschool and Etc . offers us this post. \n  \nThe Trip to Holland. \n I know you've heard the story. You get ready for a trip to Italy, and you learn Italian, and you're all ready to eat the native foods and go to the native places and see the sights, but you get dumped off in Holland. Then somehow you're la-la-la-ing your way through Holland, clicking your wooden clogs happily and revelling in the blessings of tulips and windmills. This, or so the analogy goes, is just how it feels to have a \"special\" child, and aren't we all glad we're in Holland together? Dang straight, I'm not. Twerp alert: I paid for Italy. I'm feeling gypped. And gimme a break. Don't even tell me that the second you got off that plane, that you wouldn't be yelling at every single ticket agent, the pilot, the stewardesses, the radar tower people, God and some random puppy that got in your way that day. (No, you'd kick the puppy. You're just that mad.) I'm telling you, I'd have the most colossal temper fit you'd ever seen, right in the airport. It would look something like  this , but you have to picture this scene with a middle-aged fat white woman roly-polying all over the ground and snotting everywhere. But the analogy isn't really a fair one. Because really, you're IN ITALY but no longer able to speak Italian with the people who surround you. You can no longer eat the foods you wanted to eat or go to the places you wanted to see as a parent. Sure, you can love your little Dutchman and pinch his little Campbell's soup kid cheeks, and you can rejoice in the fact that your child is a gift from God. And you can yodel with him or whatever it is that those Dutch people do. (I know they don't yodel... that was just me trolling for comments by being provocative.) That doesn't mean that when your child doesn't speak and the other kids the same age in the church nursery are using the potty and giving an entire monologue, that you don't feel jealous. And angry. Why are we all working so hard, and things are still difficult? It doesn't mean you don't want to smack some people upside the head, either. Do you know how aggravating it is to deal with stares and comments, knowing this is some horrible joke God is playing on your poor child? Here, you can be reasonably assured the know-it-all who advises you on child rearing in the local Wal-Mart hasn't had to deal with one stinkin' tenth of the problems you've been handling. And her kids don't have one stinkin' tenth of the obstacles to overcome your child does. You feel jealous of the easy life those people have. You wish *you* had the easy life with *your* children and that you could be the one giving the stupid advice to Ms. Stupid and the Stupid Twins on checkout aisle 15. But nooooo. God puts all this on your family, and then you're supposed to suck it up and be gracious. It isn't fair. Not that I'm doing so hot on the being gracious thing, and not that I'm doing so hot on even caring about not doing so hot on the being gracious thing. I just don't have any energy left to do that, you know?

If you haven't met Sasha yet, take a minute and read our Q&A with her and her post, and tell her hi and welcome to the community!  Please tell readers a little bit about yourself.\u00a0 \n I am the stay at home mother of 7 children, one of which is on the spectrum.  Before becoming a stay at home mom I dropped out of nursing school and then worked as a performer in a dinner show theater and then as the administrative assistant to the director of nursing at our local hospital.  I met my husband while working there.  After the birth of my second child my husband stayed at home while I worked doing data entry for the department of immigration.  Kindergarten didnt end up working so well for us with our oldest and we decided she would do better in a homeschool environment so I quite work to stay home and homeschool our children.  I had no idea at the time we would end up being blessed with so many children, or that one of them would have special needs.  My life has had many ups and downs but I feel like I am exactly where I need to be.  You can hardly ask for more than that. How long have you been blogging? \n \n I wrote my first blog post shortly after the premature birth of my twins while they were still in the NICU.  That was in November of last year.  So in short right around 7 months.  I didnt start writing heavily on my blog until March of this year.  I am very much still a \"baby blogger\" : ) What kinds of things do you normally write about? \n \n I write about my children and the things I learn along the way.  All of my children are so very different from each other so it gives me a pretty wide range of topics to pick from.  I am a mom of a child with special needs, a teen, twins, premature mom.  I am somewhat of a nature type mom, but in some ways very main stream.  One of my friends described me as versatile and all inclusive. : ) lol  I liked that and thought it probably suited me better than anything I could come up with. Who are some of your favorite bloggers? \n \n I follow and enjoy reading a lot of really great blogs so it makes it hard to pick but a short list of some of my favorites would be autism army Big Daddy autism Imperfect Happiness Apron Stringz TouchStoneZ What do you wish people most knew about you? \n \n That I make a TON of mistakes.  I loose my cool.  I make bad decisions.  Yes, sure I get it right too but sometimes I am afraid that people think I just walk through life in this zen bubble.  I dont have all the answers but I love trying to find them and the more people that help me in my search the better.  What has surprised you the most since you started blogging? \n \n How much I would actually come to care about so many people that I had never met in real life.  There are several people that have been so kind to me as I write about our journey and in return I learn so much from reading about their lives.  I had no idea you could actually form REAL friendships through the world of blogging.   \n \n And here's her guest post! \n \n \n \n \n My Little Escape Artist \n \n \n \n \n \n Most days I feel a lot like our little friend in\u00a0the picture above.\u00a0 Over and over again all day long I stop whatever I am doing and search my landscape for sight of my son J-Bird.\u00a0 For those new to my blog J-Bird is my four year old son that has autism.\u00a0 I do this so often that it has\u00a0became an uncontrollable habit.\u00a0 I will find myself doing it even if he is not home.\u00a0 Even at night I will go and visually check on him several times. Why do I feel the need to do this?\u00a0 J-Bird is a runner.\u00a0 Not that super awesome \"hey my kid is a fast runner\" sort of way.\u00a0\u00a0In fact J-Bird has a tendency of falling pretty quick if he tries to run at top speed.\u00a0 No, he is a runner in that \"OH MY GOD WHERE IS MY KID?!?!?\" sort of way.\u00a0 J-Bird is also amazingly adapt at finding ways to by pass my every attempt to keep him out of things that he should not be getting into and also getting out of our home despite the locks and safety covers over the doorknobs. That information brings us to the story of last night.\u00a0\u00a0Just before dark\u00a0we had a friend over and we were all in the living room watching a movie.\u00a0 J-Bird was sitting on the right hand end of our sectional and was seemingly glued to the television.\u00a0 Ever the meerkat, I look over fifteen minutes later only to discover that\u00a0he is gone.\u00a0 Movie is paused and the search begins.\u00a0 In the bedroom?\u00a0 Under the bed? Closet?\u00a0 Bathroom? No, no, no, and no.\u00a0 At this point I am starting to panic.\u00a0 The house is deemed vacant of our little guy and so the search is brought outside.\u00a0 Our friend gets in his truck and drives down the road to look.\u00a0 We scream and yell his name.\u00a0\u00a0With absolute panic in my heart I realize that he would not answer to his name.\u00a0 He would not come running to our voices.\u00a0 He would not ask anyone for help. Barefoot I run down our road banging on doors desperate for someone to say they have seen my little boy.\u00a0 No one has seen him.\u00a0 The neighbors start forming groups in yards all watching as I run up and down the road screaming, frantic now to find my boy.\u00a0 They watch, they whisper and I feel absolutely adrift in panic.\u00a0 They are not being unkind, only human, but I want to grab them all and send them running in search of my boy.\u00a0\u00a0It has only been\u00a0twenty\u00a0minutes since I last laid eyes on him, we have only searched for five minutes but it feels like it has been an eternity.\u00a0 Then one of my daughters thinks she hears a noise from the back of our fifteen passenger van.\u00a0 My husband opens up the back doors and finds him wedged into a corner so small we didnt think he could fit.\u00a0 It looks as though he was trying to take the bolts off the legs of the back bench seat.\u00a0 I collapse to a sitting position onto the street, they all stare, I dont care.\u00a0 I am\u00a0crying with relief,\u00a0I dont care, my boy is safe and that is all this mommy meerkat wanted to see. \n \n \nMy little escape artist. \u00a0Houdini would have paled in comparison. \n \n \n \nSo today I ask my readers for some input.\u00a0 If your child on the spectrum was also a runner when did they \"outgrow\" it?\u00a0 Did they outgrow it?\u00a0 What safety precautions did you find that helped?\u00a0 On the advice of a friend I have decided that we need to get a medical ID bracelet.\u00a0 Any recommendations on what\u00a0information to include on\u00a0the bracelet?\u00a0Know a\u00a0brand of bracelet\u00a0that is extra durable and difficult to get off? \n \n \n \n \n \n Got some input? How about you offer it here or over at  her original post? \n \n Here's my input: we have alarms on our doors, and each of our kids as an id bracelet or dogtags. We made sure that their names, our names, address and phone number and AUTISTIC were on them. And we trained and practiced, and now these precautions are no longer necessary, thankfully, although we really still don't let our guard down. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sashabreeze.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismarmymom.com/", "http://bigdaddyautism.com/", "http://imperfecthappiness.wordpress.com/", "http://apronstringz.wordpress.com/", "http://touchstonez.com/", "http://sashabreeze.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-little-escape-artist.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-En2ew2gq7dM/Tb7N_fV-YqI/AAAAAAAAAPc/geyr_pSPgQQ/s1600/meerkat_crop.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8azMQotmupU/Tb7U7Sk0iTI/AAAAAAAAAPg/c1B0wnGq5yk/s1600/0331111544a.jpg", "http://sashabreeze.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-little-escape-artist.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/sasha-from-one-rich-mother.html", "title": "\nSasha from One Rich Mother!\n"},

This first article looks at Temple Grandin.  \n \n \n \n Who is Temple Grandin? \n \n There are\na number of famous people with autism, and deciding where to start this series\nwas a tough challenge. However we opted for Temple Grandin, because there are\nnot many people can say that they have had an Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award\nwinning film made about them and their experiences. She was also listed by Time\nMagazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.  \n \n Born in\nBoston, Massachusetts she was diagnosed with autism aged three in 1950. She was\nplaced in a structured nursery school, and began speaking at aged four.\nThroughout her middle and high school years she was often bullied, with other\nstudents calling her \u2018tape recorder\u2019 due to her tendency to repeat things over\nand over again. \u00a0  Upon her graduation she\nwent on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree as well as a master\u2019s and doctoral degrees.\nShe is now a  bestselling author  and a P rofessor \u00a0 at \u00a0 Colorado State University and. She is\nwidely regarded for her work on autism advocacy and invented the \u2018hug machine\u2019\nwhich is designed to calm hypersenstitive people.  \n \n In the spotlight.  \n \n \n \n Grandin\nfirst came to the public\u2019s attention after bring described in Oliver Sacks\u2019\nbook  An Anthropologist on Mars . She\nhas gone on to be featured throughout the mainstream media including high\nprofile appearances on programmes such as  Primtime\nLive ,  Larry King Live  and  The Today Show . In addition to her\ntelevision appearances articles about her life have appeared in Time Magazine,\nPeople Magazine Forbes and The New York Times. In addition, in 2009 she was the\nfocus of a three-hour interview on \u00a0C-SPAN-  In\nDepth with Temple Grandin. Most famously, Grandin was the focus of the 2010 film\n Temple Grandin  which went on to win\nfive Emmy Awards. The role of Grandin was played by Claire Danes. \n \n \n \n Temple\u2019s experience of Autism.  \n \n In\nterms of Grandin\u2019s views on autism, based on her own personal experience she\nsupports early intervention and supportive teachers who are able to direct a\nchild\u2019s fixations in constructive directions. Temple says that she is primarily\na visual thinker, and as such words are to her, a second language. However, she\nattributes her success in livestock facility designer due to her extraordinary\nability to recall details which is a common characteristics among those with\nvisual memories. In describing her memory, she has liked it to watching a\nfull-length movie in her head, which she is able to replay as many times as she\nwants which enables her to notice small details.  \n \n She\nis also able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing\nthe positions of the lighting and shadows. Her insight into the minds of cattle\nhas taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are\nparticularly sensitive, and to use her visualization skills to design\nthoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment, the field in which she\ninitially made her name. As a result of her autism Grandin has first-hand\nexperience of the anxiety associated with feeling threatened by everything in\nher environment which cites as the motivation in her mission to both design and\npromote humane livestock handling processes including improved standards of\nslaughter. \n \n Despite\nthe issues she has had throughout her life as a result of autism throughout her\nlife she has famously said  \u201cif I could snap my\nfingers and become non-autistic I would not do so.

We want a place for consensus, a place where we can agree action needs to happen (although you would have thought a sustained cacophony or chorus, your pick, would have occurred over the Judge Rotenberg Center), then this has to be one of those areas. There is absolutely no justification for this. This will not let the child practice his relaxation techniques as this assistant principal so blandly presents. \n\u00a0 \n \n Kathleen:\u00a0I was horrified watching this. Firstly, the language used to describe using this device- \"The child is escorted over by two people and gently lowered on the mat.\" \u00a0Gently? \u00a0I don't know about anyone else's\u00a0experience here, I can only speak from my own. \u00a0There was a time when one of my sons was prone to rather large \"outbursts\"-screaming, kicking, throwing things. \u00a0I can speak from experience in saying that there is absolutely no way that he would have accepted being \"escorted\" by two people-let alone be \"gently lowered\" anywhere. In other words-he would have fought tooth and nail against anyone trying to touch him. Furthermore, asking him to practice his \"relaxation technique\" in a situation where all control was taken away from him is absurd. It is more than likely, he would have quieted down from sheer exhaustion-from fighting the restraints. \u00a0After which of course he would be returned to his seat. I can not imagine what the atmosphere must be like in that classroom. The constant fear-the reminder..step out of line and you will lose your freedom, your dignity and your humanity. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 The justification given for using this device is to \"protect against human error.\" \u00a0What does that mean? \u00a0Which humans are they talking about? \u00a0Certainly\u00a0not the students. \u00a0Now, I understand not wanting a student to hurt\u00a0themselves, or others. I understand not wanting to physically hurt a student. \u00a0All of these things make sense. Restraining someone in order to prevent these things does not. \u00a0Nor does trying to sell the idea that it somehow this helps the student practice their \"relaxation process.\". I find the idea repugnant. \u00a0There are many other techniques and strategies that can be used. \u00a0They do however require skills and training. It would appear that the promoting of the use of restraint is an easy fix-and definitely less costly. My question is-what does it do? \u00a0When does it end? \u00a0One only needs to look at the \"Judge Rotenberg Center\" and the  testimony  of parents who support the use of restraints and electro-shock aversion \"therapy, to see that it doesn't end. \n \n There are people there who have spent DECADES hooked up to electro shock back packs. Decades being treated less than animals.

With more than 36,000 participants today, the IAN Project has the largest pool of autism data in the world. \n \n\"Although similar behavior has been studied in Alzheimer's disease and autism advocates identify elopement as a top priority, virtually no research has been conducted on this phenomenon in ASD,\" said\u00a0 Dr. Paul Law , Director of the IAN Project at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. \"The new survey will provide vital information to families, advocates and policy makers alike as they work to keep individuals with ASD safe.\" \n \nThe survey will help researchers begin to answer important questions: \n \n How often do individuals with ASD attempt to elope? How often do they succeed? Under what circumstances? \n Which individuals with ASD are most at risk? At what age? \n What burden do efforts to thwart elopement behavior place on caregivers? \n What can be done to protect individuals with ASD and support their families? \n \n \nTo understand elopement and wandering behavior in ASD, researchers need information both from families of individuals who\u00a0 do \u00a0and\u00a0 do not \u00a0wander and elope. In order to determine who is at risk, all families in the U.S. autism community are encouraged to participate in the survey, whether or not their loved one engages in these behaviors. Survey participants must be enrolled in the IAN Project (to register, visit\u00a0 www.ianresearch.org ) and be the parent or guardian of a child or dependent adult with ASD. \n \nDue to the urgent need for this information by the autism community, preliminary data will be made available on April 20, 2011, provided the necessary sample size is reached for the research survey. \n \nThis survey is funded by the\u00a0 Autism Research Institute ,\u00a0 Autism Science Foundation ,\u00a0 Autism Speaks \u00a0and\u00a0 Global Autism Collaboration .

The wandering and elopement survey found that approximately half of parents of children with autism report that their child elopes, with the behavior peaking at age four. Among these families, nearly 50% say that their child went missing long enough to cause significant concern about safety. \"This survey is the first research effort to scientifically validate that elopement is a critical safety issue for the autism community,\" said Dr. Paul Law, Director of the IAN Project at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \"We hope that advocates and policy makers use this research to implement key safety measures to support these families and keep these children safe.\" \"Gathering this information is the first step toward implementing public policy changes that will protect our children\" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. \"We need to increase awareness and action among first responders, school administrators and residential facility administrators; we need to develop a medical classification code for wandering; and we need to expand the AMBER alert systems to protect children with autism.\" In just three weeks, more than 800 parents of children with autism completed the survey. The findings highlighted below summarize the compelling results and crucial safety concerns identified by parents. For the preliminary findings in their entirety, read the IAN Research Report: Elopement and Wandering. Dangers of Elopement The tendency of individuals with ASD to wander or \"bolt\" puts them at risk of trauma, injury or even death: More than one third of children who elope are never or rarely able to communicate their name, address, or phone number verbally or by writing/typing Two in three parents report their missing children had a \"close call\" with a traffic injury 32% of parents report a \"close call\" with a possible drowning Effect of Wandering on Families Wandering was ranked among the most stressful ASD behaviors by 58% of parents of elopers \u00b7 62% of families of children who elope were prevented from attending/enjoying activities outside the home due to fear of wandering \u00b7 40% of parents had suffered sleep disruption due to fear of elopement \u00b7 Children with ASD are eight times more likely to elope between the ages of 7 and 10 than their typically-developing siblings Resources, Support for Families Half of families with elopers report they had never received advice or guidance about elopement from a professional \u00b7 Only 19% had received such support from a psychologist or mental health professional \u00b7 Only 14% had received guidance from their pediatrician or another physician Motivations for Elopement Despite speculation that summer is the peak season for elopement, 67% of parents of elopers said they saw no seasonal pattern at all; only 25% felt summer was the peak season. The top 5 reasons parents believed their children eloped included: Enjoys exploring (54%) Heads for a favorite place (36%) Escapes demands/anxieties (33%) Pursues special topic (31%) Escapes sensory discomfort (27%) After further analysis of the data the IAN Project will publish additional findings, such as how children with ASD who wander differ from children with ASD who do not, the financial and emotional burden on parents, and the steps parents take to prevent elopement. \u00a0 This research was funded by the Autism Research Institute, Autism Science Foundation, Autism Speaks and Global Autism Collaboration. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmyemail.constantcontact.com%2FNew-Data-Show-50--of-Children-with-Autism-Wander.html%3Fsoid%3D1102564308585%26aid%3DNGS7girZqxM&h=a28e4s595iVu3UIF8UcTVzfUQiA", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.ianproject.org/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/autism-science-foundation-ian-wandering.html", "title": "\nAutism Science Foundation: IAN Wandering Survey Results\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 13, 2010", "body": "\n One of the things Kathleen and I believe in strongly is community building; in meeting other parents and individuals on the spectrum (and with other disabilities, difficulties, issues, call-it-what-you-will) who are looking for positive, supportive environments in which to work to make the world a more accepting, accommodating and appreciative place. \n \n \n \n It's our three A's, if you will, with a fourth, action, tossed in, because in order to have the first three, you need the fourth (and thanks go to Squidalicious for adding the fourth to our mantra several months ago). \n \n \n \n So, what does that mean? If you didn't know me before we started the blog directory in May, and you haven't been to Countering, you might not know that I spend a good deal of time countering what I believe to be woo, misinformation, and otherwise inaccurate or unhelpful rhetoric out and about. You could in fairness say that I have an adversarial non-relationship with the editors and many posters at Age of Autism.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n And yet, if you look at the directory, you see that there is a good representation of parents who believe their child's autism is vaccine-related. You'll see biomed parents, too. You'll see parents and autistic individuals who believe in facilitated communication, rapid prompting method, and other things I've written against. \u00a0How can that be? If I think it's woo, what are Kathleen and I doing actively directing readers to bloggers who might do chelation? Or HBOT? Now, to be fair, I don't know what all treatments are used by parents, but as long as the parents and individuals are looking for community and support and are focused on making the world a better place for our children, I'm good. Does that make sense? \n \n \n \n You don't have to agree with Kathleen and me to be listed here. We're happy to have a wide range of bloggers here, to get to know others better, to appreciate others' perspectives. \n \n \n \n What we won't promote, though, are sites that we believe are attempting to do harm. \n \n \n \n Otherwise, we try to practice what we promote:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Acceptance \n \n Appreciation \n \n Accommodation \n \n \n \n Below I've posted a piece from Countering from yesterday that explains in greater detail some of my thoughts on how we find ways to work together, regardless of our beliefs about the cause of or best treatments for autism. \n \n \n \n\n Still Good Work? Finding the Way to Balance and Community Building \n \n There are so very many fractures in the online autism community that I often think it's a wonder any of us can talk to anyone else! I can't help but wonder if this is unique to this community because of, well, indelicate as it may be, the BAPpiness that is readily obvious in the parents of autistic children.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I own my BAPpiness, and I work very hard to not be overly literal, to try to see things from other people's points of view, to let people be when I can, even if I don't agree, as long as the point of view being forced on others isn't dangerous. And even when I post on the angry place, I take pains to note when the folks there do something right. I try to see them as the multidimensional people they are. They don't often post positive things at the angry place, and yesterday was a double heap of crap they should be ashamed of, but I'm just not going to dwell in that today. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Instead I want to focus on folks who buy into some of the woo, but who I think also do some good work.\u00a0 Just two days ago, I wrote in my post,\u00a0 Late Night Ruminations , about some books I've been reading to review for Lisa Rudy's About.com site. I wrote, in that late night post (slightly edited for this post), about Rodney Peete's book (review can be found\u00a0 here ): The Peetes are doing some good work. Their tremendous love for their children shines through, and Peete demonstrates on page after page that he gets the important stuff: the need to love and accept the child for who he is while you bust your ass to help that child reach his potential. That matters way more to me than the belief that their son is autistic because of vaccines. After all, Jay Gordon's their pediatrician. I enjoyed reading Peete's book and I think it's worth the time, especially if you're looking for a dad's voice. It has practical tips, too (and I can say this while declaring I\u00a0 am not paid \u00a0for these reviews, not even in scooby snacks; I am however provided with the book -- in other words, I remain with no conflicts of interest to declare). \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peete's book adds another dimensionality, another layer to the community, to understanding where parents are coming from. It was well worth my time. If you're looking for tips and are new to the autism world, it's worth it for you, too. It's worth it if you're just looking to understand folks better, too, if you want a bit of the larger picture. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite having my attention drawn to the fact that the Peetes will be front and center at woo fest every bit as robust as Autism One, I stand by my review of the book. Reviews of books, if one is being as fair as possible, should be about the words in the book itself, as if the potential reader has no other knowledge of the author. Reviews of books should be about the books, with as little possible bleed over of preconceived notions. If I'd known that the Peetes were going to be appearing at the\u00a0 National Autism Association convention in November \u00a0\u00a0 with such, ummm, paragons as Wakefield, Olmsted, Blaxill, Bradstreet, and Soma(!), it would have colored my reading. I can't deny that.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's such a frakking mess. That's not grand company to keep, is it? Ick is my overriding feeling at seeing that line up. Really, it is a massive woo fest. So, what do you do? Do you dismiss, reject, cast out, refuse to work with folks who appear at overwhelmingly woo venues? Do you look specifically at what the individual is saying, what they are after, what they're trying to sell? \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I don't know. I think one has to look beyond the surface and refuse to make snap judgments. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, what non-woo is the conference having? \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well, the first day there is a session on income taxes and disability and one on autism and marriage. Doesn't sounds too woo-ey to me. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are sessions on sensory processing disorder and teaching nonverbal children to speak. Could be woo-ey, could not.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Of course, you've got Soma speaking. Woo.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Olmsted and Blaxill. Holy woo!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bradstreet. Yup, more woo. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wakefield! Ding, ding, ding. Woo-winner \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chantal Sicile-Kira. Hmmmm. Well, you be the judge. She's a big fan of Soma and buys into what AoA sells.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On balance, this convention is focused towards biomed parents who choose to pursue all options regardless of the research or lack thereof. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's not a convention I'd go to. It's not one I'd want to go to. It's one that's sufficiently steeped in the woo that I'd question those who are speaking there. It bothers me that the Peetes are keynote speakers there. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I read this statement on the main page for the conference, I admit I rolled my eyes: \" NAA is the leading autism membership organization for breaking through the myths of autism as a mysterious and incurable disorder. Recognizing that the future of those with an autism diagnosis cannot rely on raising awareness alone, we are committed to empowering parents and caregivers with the most up-to-date resources available to enable all affected individuals to reach their full potential.\" \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NAA promotes actively lots of myths regarding autism, so I don't buy this declaration. But, I have to repeat, the whole conference doesn't appear to be woo. There may be valuable and reality-based information that the parents attending might not get elsewhere, and the NAA isn't excessively gouging them on the conference fee (I've seen the Michelle Garcia Winner charge a lot more for her sessions than the NAA is charging for the full conference for two people to attend). On the balance, though, it will send vulnerable parents into woo, and it will line the pockets of woo-sellers. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So, what do the Peetes get \u00a0out of being speakers there? Are they aware of all the woo, do they actively buy into all of it, are they promoting it? Honestly, I don't know. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That the NAA's sponsor on that conference page is a company pushing HBOT chambers? Well, geez, not good, is it? \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 No, it's not good at all. So, what do you do? How do you decide? \u00a0Do you boycott the Peetes' books, their foundation out of principle? I guess everyone will make his or her own mind up on that. \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Here's how I'm going to keep on working to build community. If your focus is on improving the lives of autistic individuals, being supportive and respectful of their individuality, if your focus is on being a positive support to other families, then I'm going to work with you, be friendly with you, and agree to disagree on things like vaccine-injury as a cause of autism. I am facebook friends with people who do facilitated communication, rpm, and others who do some woo that if I think on it, well, you know. As long as you aren't pulling an AoA, pushing the woo, selling the woo, profiting on the woo, I don't have a problem. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And I'm gonna keep checking into outfits like NAA and other nonprofits to look at what they do with their money, who their sponsors are, what information they provide to the public and how accurate it is. \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But, and this is important, I believe, I'm gonna reserve judgment on folks who support the organizations. And here's why. Most folks don't go digging through tax forms to see how organizations spend their money. Most folks look at the outer shell, see that the organization has stated goals of being helpful, and they support the organization, volunteer for it, heck, even walk for it. They're trying to help. They're trying to make a difference, and they don't deserve to be judged negatively for trying to do good, even if you aren't thrilled with the actual organization. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, I'm not thrilled with Autism Speaks on a lot of things. I don't like what they do with most of their money. I think it's obscene for someone to make more than half a million dollars a year from a nonprofit organization. So, I judge the organization and the person taking the bucks. I don't judge the person donating. Even if they know. Why? Because in a lot of communities, the only thing going autism-wise is the Walk. The only thing going. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We need to work in our local communities to give folks other options, but until we've got that, we're going to have to be pragmatic and work within the structures and organizations that already exist. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We can stick to tightly described principles and accomplish nothing, connect with no one, because no one is going to see the world in the exact same way we do. Or we can branch out and focus on big goals like building a supportive, respectful community and let some things go, or at least not be directly adversarial while we're working on common goals. And maybe by working on those common goals we'll find a way to bridge divides, respect each other, and care, care enough to find a way to talk about the differences calmly. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://counteringageofautism.blogspot.com/2010/08/still-good-work-finding-way-to-balance.html", "http://counteringageofautism.blogspot.com/2010/08/late-night-ruminations.html", "http://autism.about.com/od/booksabouttreatingautism/gr/Book-Review-Rodney-Peetes-Not-My-Boy.htm", "http://www.nationalautismconference.org/allspeakers.htm"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/08/repost-balance-and-community-building.html", "title": "\nRepost: Balance and Community Building\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "body": "\n Diane Yapko writes \u00a0an interesting piece \u00a0 at PsychCentral on neurodiversity, noting that the stark contrasts that many would place, neurodiversity versus cure, on the autism community, really don't exist. Perhaps it's inevitable that the debate gets rendered in black and white so that\u00a0neurodiversity is presented as an ideology that would leave autistics without treatment, without therapies, the them in this us-them tug-of-war. Perhaps there are people who are that two dimensional; perhaps there is a group of people who claim to be neurodiverse and think that means no treatments, no interventions, no help for a child. I hate the thought that there are people out there who would literally do nothing to help their child to grow, to develop, to overcome obstacles, who wouldn't move heaven and earth to help their child. Of course, we know there are parents out there like that in the general community, parents who fail their children in every conceivable way, and that undoubtedly happens for autistic children as well. On the flip side, there are no doubt parents, who in their zeal to cure their child, go too far, and in the process of running down every possible cure, subject their children to nearly equally abusive experiences. And maybe both sets of parents conceivably do all these things and more in the name of love. I heard someone say, in a recent interview I was listening to, that it's out of love parents do things and who are we to judge. But we do, each and everyone of us judge. Even this person. We can't get around that. We hold up other people's behaviors to our owns, we compare, and we place our decisions as the right ones. If other parents deviate beyond the threshold of what we'd be willing to do or believe to be morally plausible, then they are wrong, they're bad parents. We all do it, and we do it with pride in our decisions, in conviction of the superiority of our positions, convinced we've displayed clear critical thinking skills and that anyone who disagrees has failed to exercise those skills. I tell my students, sometimes daily, that we are always assured that if we believe it, we are right, and \"if I'm right and you believe differently, you have to be WRONG.\" A lot of the rhetoric on autism talks about how two dimensional autistic individuals are, how hard a time they have of seeing shades of gray. The reality is that we are all hardwired for black and white. All of us. It's only when we begin to shift our own personal actions into what we'd have considered no-no areas that there become shades of gray. Grays only become visible when we mentally place ourselves in other people's situations and try to get a sense of what we'd do faced with the same situation, when we really think about what we'd do and start chasing down possible consequences. Children see the world starkly: right or or wrong, heroes and villains. Our cartoons and comics often reinforce this flatness: Batman is a moral arbiter; while attracted to Catwoman, he rejects her because she operates outside the law, even though her aims might be laudable; he ignores that his actions arise from the same moral stance (been rewatching animated batman with the kids, offers lots of opportunity to discuss morality and theory of mind issues). Our fiction also renders things flatly, especially the popular fiction. Most of us, despite our tendency to think starkly (us-them dichotomies), find ways to navigate the world more\u00a0multi-dimensionally. We ignore those differences we've decided don't matter in our real world relationships and only attend to those belief systems that are fundamental to our core identities. Not into politics? Then you probably don't care if someone is republican or democratic. Not into religion? Then you don't care overly much whether someone believes. We do this for countless potential differences. If we have one core dimension that we consider foundational to our identity and we find others who have that commonality, we focus on core commonalities and ignore the differences, dismissing the importance of those characteristics. This happens in our autism community as well, but instead of focusing on the overarching commonality of autism, what we do, some of us, is focus on differences, real or imagined, to create a clear us-them dichotomy. We do this, even if it means we create huge strawman arguments to create the other side so that we have a clear group identity. That means some of us set ourselves up as the aggrieved ones who are woefully misunderstood and persecuted. Some of us set ourselves up as martyr parents. Despite the desire to believe there are clear us-them divisions, there aren't, and if one takes the time to read through the lines of some of the more strident postings out there, it should become evident that we are often more in agreement than not. I think most of us, though, reject that hardcore us-them mentality. I see it daily on the blogs on our directory. Some are fringe bloggers, but most just want to talk about their lives, the good and the bad, and get support while giving it. Let's assume that there are fringe elements that would either do every conceivable woo treatment out there as well as some who would do absolutely nothing at all, not even basic parenting skills, to help their children. But let's also admit that we'd be hardpressed to find actual concrete examples of either true fringe as they are often argued to exist. We'll place a bell curve on the autism community, if you please. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOh look, more of us have to be in the middle, with more in common than not. Go figure. \n \n \n \nI choose to not define myself as part of the fringes; I would not do absolutely anything, but I would never do nothing. I do not believe that believing in neurodiversity means what some insist it does, but let us say it does: that it is a do nothing philosophy that would not help individuals overcome any challenges or learn anything (rather absurd). \u00a0Let us say it is the right side of the curve. Let us say the curebies are on the left and they would do a complete reboot if that's what it took. These fringe elements, these outliers, are not the driving force, either perspective, of the autism community. They're loud, certainly, but that's only if you're fixated on the edges. I'd bet you most people in the autism community are not. \n \n \n \nMost of us agree:\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe want our children to be accepted into mainstream society as individuals who have innate value regardless of functional levels. \n \n \n \nWe want research into therapies that will mitigate the symptoms and behaviors that cause them disability, pain, and difficulty. \n \n \n \nWe want access to effective therapies to help our children overcome their challenges. \n \n \n \nWe want safe places for our children to be cared for when therapies and treatments do not remove all disabilities and impairments. \n \n \n \nWe want meaningful work for our children when they grow into adulthood, so that they can feel they are of service and make meaningful contributions to society. \n \n \n \nWe want support services, education and training for family members and professionals working with our children so that we can best serve our children. \n \n \n \nWe want acceptance for our families as we work to navigate this world and do the best we can for our children. \n \n \n We are members of the autism community and encompass family members, individuals on the spectrum, and professionals who provide services to autistic individuals and their families. We can forget about false dichotomies that do not exist in reality. We can embrace pluralities of opinions and acknowledge that we are one group, united under a bell curve. We can work to create the world we wish for our children and ourselves. Even better, each and every day, most of us do just that. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.psychcentral.com/autism-aspergers/2010/10/neurodiversity-variation-rather-than-deviation/", "http://www.macmillandesign.com/bell/ChangeableBellCurve.ppt"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/11/forget-false-dichotomies-bell-curve-of.html", "title": "\nForget False Dichotomies: The Bell Curve of the Autism Community\n"},

I hope you'll drop by, give her a read, and say hi. Community building begins with conversation. If we don't leave a little note to share that we were there, that we appreciated what we read (or if we didn't, a calm, matter-of-fact expression of disagreement), we'll never get where we want to be. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thedomesticgoddess.wordpress.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N4-gu7BDa8M/TAF58F-sAKI/AAAAAAAABRI/pDyqrW3EYwk/s1600/078.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/05/showcasing-blogs-worthy-of-your-time.html", "title": "\nShowcasing Blogs Worthy of Your Time: Give a Holler\n"},

Sometimes I do. But reading blogs between appointments and swearing I'll do it later does not always translate into action. Life gets in the way. That is why we NEED International Comment Leaving Week. It actually builds comment leaving into our schedules each month! How easy is that?! If comments are the new hug then International Comment Leaving week is like giving and receiving a great big cyber bear hug for a week. Here's how it works: 1. Register your blog \u00a0 here 2. Add the code for this in your sidebar (find code at above link). IComLeavWe: Join the Conversation 3. During the 21-28th each month you are registered go to the master list of blogs each day. Select at least six blogs a day and leave comments. Return at least one comment that's left on your blog. Some people even aspire for Iron Commenter status, whereby they leave a comment on every blog listed. Iron Commenters get listed on \u00a0 The Wall of Honour\u00a0 . This is only for those who have that kind of time and is certainly not required. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH ICLW \n \n September was my first ICLW. I was inspired to participate by my love of community. Mel of the blog\u00a0 Stirrup Queens \u00a0organizes ICLW because she loves community too. A little context - Mel is to the broader in-vitro, infertility, adoption, miscarriage, infant loss community what\u00a0 Kim Wombles is to Autism \u00a0with the directory. \n \n \n Most of the blogs registered were Mel's friends from the broader fertility seeking community. Being one of the few listed from a different community I learned a lot. Those without fertility concerns cannot fathom what these women go through just to have what we take for granted. It reminds me of how parents of typical kids have no idea how our children struggle for milestones that come so easy to their kids. We never know what it is like for someone else until we take the time to listen. I'm so glad I did. \n \n Reading their blogs I felt empathy. \u00a0Is that strange since I don't share those fertility issues personally? Not really. These blogs house stories of struggle and actualization, from the joys of motherhood to the agony of child loss. I may be fertile but I know grief and loss. My child is still with me, but I did lose my son as I knew him. Of course, this is not the same as actually losing a child, but grief recognizes grief, no matter the degree or manifestation. Such loss splits the heart in a million pieces, then sends them out compassionately in all directions. \n \nICLW week is electric. You can feel it in the air as people buzz from blog to blog leaving a little dose of positivity behind. My blog had so many wonderful new visitors. \n \nI told Mel what a moving experience September's ICLW was for me. She encouraged me to invite the disability community to join in for October. So far Kim Wombles and I signed up. I hope others decide to join us. You'll be glad you did. \n \n \n \n \n \n ... \n \n \n \n Kim:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I've signed up to do it, and I hope that directory members will also take advantage of the opportunity to build community. :) \n \n \n \n More blogs have been added to disability-related blogging lists. I hope you'll give them a look-see. Ah, and let us know of other wonderful blogs we've not found yet! \n \n \n \n And to Autism Mom Rising for showcasing this great chance to meet new folks, I give her our Sunshine Blogging Award for this week! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismmomrising.blogspot.com/2010/10/international-comment-leaving-week.html", "http://www.stirrup-queens.com/2010/09/icomleavwe-october-2010/", "http://www.stirrup-queens.com/2010/09/icomleavwe-october-2010/", "http://www.stirrup-queens.com/2010/09/icomleavwe-october-2010/", "http://www.stirrup-queens.com/2008/06/icomleavwe/", "http://www.stirrup-queens.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N4-gu7BDa8M/TKXj-1Y9-2I/AAAAAAAABzQ/N_dsNx2lHCs/s1600/sunshine+blog+award.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/10/autism-mom-rising-international-comment.html", "title": "\nAutism Mom Rising: International Comment Leaving Week\n"},

It was born out of a conversation between both Kim and myself.(The name is from the idea that whenever I spoke positively or humorously about my children and disability-some people acted as though I were indeed \"kicking kittens\") It was one of our first steps towards \u00a0community building. \u00a0There just seemed to be so much fighting on the internet, that we wanted to create a positive place for people to go to. \u00a0A place to share positive stories, ideas and experiences. We also wanted to give people who didn't want the responsibility of a blog a chance to tell their stories. I contacted various forums and groups and individuals. \u00a0Some people ignored it, some people said it wasn't \"pretty enough\" and many participated. It isn't a fancy blog, nor is it stylish. The idea is that people's voices make it beautiful-without needing any embellishment. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0There are so many wonderful blogs in our community here-and there isn't enough time in the day to read them all..although we do try. So I am asking anyone who is interested to come on over and participate-or just read. \u00a0What better way to start your day than with a positive story. \n \nToday we have a funny piece from Papa Bear who blogs over  here .

It's short and sweet. \n \n\u00a0It skips everything.\n\nWhile \"Welcome to Holland\" has a place, I used to hate it.  It skipped over all of the agony of having a child with special needs and went right to the happy ending. \n \n\u00a0The raw, painful, confusing entry into Holland was just glossed over.  And considering the fact that this little poem is so often passed along to new-moms-of-kids-with-special-needs, it seems unfair to just hand them a little story about getting new guidebooks and windmills and tulips. \n \n\u00a0If I had written \"Welcome to Holland\", I would have included the terrible entry time.  And it would sound like this: \n \n\u00a0 Amsterdam International\u00a0 \n \n Parents of \u201cnormal\u201d kids who are friends with parents of kids with special needs often say things like \u201cWow! How do you do it? I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle everything---you guys are amazing!\u201d (Well, thank you very much.) But there\u2019s no special manual, no magical positive attitude serum, no guide to embodying strength and serenity . . . people just do what they have to do. You rise to the occasion, and embrace your sense of humor (or grow a new one). You come to love your life, and it\u2019s hard to imagine it a different way (although when you try, it may sting a little). But things weren\u2019t always like this . . . at first, you ricocheted around the stages of grief, and it was hard to see the sun through the clouds. And forget the damn tulips or windmills. In the beginning you\u2019re stuck in Amsterdam International Airport. And no one ever talks about how much it sucks. \n \n\u00a0You briskly walk off of the plane into the airport thinking \u201cThere-must-be-a-way-to-fix-this-please-please-don\u2019t-make-me-have-to-stay-here-THIS-ISN\u2019T-WHAT-I-WANTED-please-just-take-it-back\u201d. The airport is covered with signs in Dutch that don\u2019t help, and several well-meaning airport professionals try to calm you into realizing that you are here (oh, and since they\u2019re shutting down the airport today, you can never leave. Never never. This is your new reality.). Their tone and smiles are reassuring, and for a moment you feel a little bit more calm . . . but the pit in your stomach doesn\u2019t leave and a new wave of panic isn\u2019t far off.\" \n\u00a9 Dana Nieder 10/2010 \n \nPlease click over to Dana's  site to read the rest of the piece  (the formatting didn't work here and was bleeding across the right side, making most of the piece unreadable). \n \n\n\n\nKathleen wrote a similar post last year;  No one goes to Italy, and it has nothing to do with autism. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://niederfamily.blogspot.com/2010/10/amsterdam-international.html", "http://www.our-kids.org/Archives/Holland.html", "http://niederfamily.blogspot.com/2010/10/amsterdam-international.html", "http://autismherd.blogspot.com/2009/12/no-one-goes-to-italy-and-it-has-nothing.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/11/danas-uncommon-sense-amsterdam.html", "title": "\nDana's Uncommon Sense: \"Amsterdam International\"\n"},

Joint attention skills include showing, pointing, and sharing an event or object with another person in an effort to share the experience. Children with autism tend to lack this ability. Research indicates that if joint attention skills are improved, language development may follow. The progress of participating Young Learners students will test this hypothesis. \n \n \n \n The Alliance is a unique partnership between The Help Group, a leader in autism education, and the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, an Autism Center for Excellence. Through the pioneering vision of Dr. Barbara Firestone, President & CEO of The Help Group, and Dr. Peter Whybrow, Director of the UCLA Semel Institute, the Alliance has grown into one of the most innovative autism research partnerships in the United States. \n \n \n \n For more information about the research projects currently in progress through\u00a0 The Help Group \u2013 UCLA Autism Research Alliance , please contact Dr. Liz Laugeson at (310) 206-8139 or\u00a0 elaugeson@thehelpgroup.org . \n \n \n \n \n \n _____ \n \n \n \n Founded in 1975, The Help Group is the largest, most innovative nonprofit organization of its kind in the U.S. serving children with autism spectrum disorders, learning disabilities and other special needs.

There were many new discoveries and so much for our community to celebrate. I\u2019m especially excited to see that the genetics studies we\u2019ve been funding are starting to yield valuable information about autism\u2019s biological roots. While we have learned a lot, there is much more for us to uncover about what causes autism and which treatments are the most effective. \n \n \n \n Scientific discoveries are only possible with the right blend of ingredients. We need smart scientists, with great ideas, asking the right questions, and the resources necessary to carry out their work.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n The \u201cright ingredients\u201d metaphor reminded me of baking holiday cookies with my kids. My daughter, Jodie, has a tendency to want to pour lots of flour into the bowl (and to watch it fly around the kitchen).\u00a0 While that\u2019s certainly fun, it doesn\u2019t make for a yummy cookie.\u00a0 She is getting better at measuring and mixing, but she still has a way to go.  \n \n \n \n In fact, this is true of the autism community overall. We have made good progress, but there\u2019s still so much we need to do.\u00a0 At the  Autism Science Foundation , we are committed to funding and supporting the most promising scientific leads.\u00a0 Although we are under two years old, we have already funded our first round of grants and have been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health. Leading scientists from around the country are serving on our Scientific Advisory Board. And our websites, YouTube pages and social media efforts are helping bring new research information directly to families so that science can be put into practice to help real people. \n \n \n \n It is in this spirit of science and hope that the Autism Science Foundation created the  Recipe4Hope  campaign. This special year-end giving campaign is  raising critically needed funds for autism research . This holiday season, won't you join us in giving the  gift \u00a0of o utstanding research to children, teens and adults with autism? \n \n \n \n The centerpiece of the  Recipe4Hope  campaign is a  heartwarming video \u00a0that showcases a mother and child baking holiday cookies, mirroring the message that sound scientific research takes the right ingredients used the right way to create the right results.\u00a0 Maybe we don\u2019t need  sugar and spice for autism research, but we do need insight, creativity, tenacity, hope and funding.  That\u2019s why every dollar donated through  Recipe4Hope  will go directly to autism research. \n \n \n \n We welcome your financial support and encourage you to share why you believe autism research is important with your own social network. By lending your voice to this cause, we can do amazing things for people with autism. \n \n \n \n There are several social media tools you can use to help spread hope through the  Recipe4Hope  campaign for autism research this holiday season. Read about all the fun ways you can get involved, including  sending us photos  of your family baking cookies to be shared on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n \n \n This holiday season, outstanding research is the greatest gift we can give our families.\u00a0 I hope you will  give that gift \u00a0\u00a0through the Autism Science Foundation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aXAnwPpgQuo/TP1ndqP7EgI/AAAAAAAAAAw/zULR_9H8_eU/s1600/ASF+Logo.jpg", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.recipe4hope.org/?page_id=5", "http://www.recipe4hope.org/", "http://www.recipe4hope.org/?page_id=7", "http://www.recipe4hope.org/?page_id=5"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/12/guest-post-by-alison-singer.html", "title": "\nGuest Post by Alison Singer: Won't you be an ingredient in our Recipe4Hope?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 13, 2010", "body": "\n Last week, Kathleen and I were delighted to post a guest post by Alison Singer for \u00a0 Recipe4Hope \u00a0 at the Autism Blogs Directory. This week, I'd like to share here my recipe for hope and encourage readers to be moved to action. Kathleen and I have written \u00a0 over the last year \u00a0about acceptance, appreciation, and accommodation. At Squid's prompting, we added action to that list of As. Earlier this year, I wrote in response to Autism Awareness month: \"On this day, this week, this month, and every other day, we should seek to help, to reach out in compassion, to those who are still new to this journey, to gently remind them that this isn't about them, the parents. Autism awareness is about the individual on the spectrum, about seeing them, their value, their worth, and appreciating them as they are: human in all its glorious diversity.\" Awareness is important, but it's not enough. In psychology, I teach students that there are a series of steps we must all go through in order to get to the action. It is not enough to be aware of a situation (although that is the necessary first step). We must believe that it is something that requires action, then we must decide that it is our responsibility to act, choose how we'll act, and finally, carry out that action. At any point along this decision chain, we can abort and do nothing, even if we feel action is needed, even if we think we should act, even if we know what we should do. Action comes after awareness. Acceptance, appreciation, and accommodations are all actions; they are all conscious decisions that require behavior to be implemented. If I accept you, my behavior will demonstrate that. I will include you in my in-group; I will converse with you, and I will treat you with respect and appreciation. In order to appreciate you, I must first accept you. If I accept you, if I appreciate you, then I will make whatever accommodations are necessary for you to function successfully. Action is not, unfortunately, an inevitable consequence of awareness. You have to decide that action is needed, and that it is your job to commit to an action. There are a lot of charities asking for money, a lot of individuals, as well, out there, asking for assistance. Far too often, we see people in need, and we do not act. In a \u00a0 zero sum world , there will always be losers. I think many of us may feel impotent or incapable of helping. Too many people asking, too many people needing, and we can be overwhelmed at the decision of who to help and how much to help. I don't have any easy answers, but I believe that when we find a charity or a foundation whose principles or outreach we agree with, we should help to the degree we are capable. We should carry out our convictions and act. I'm not tooting my own horn, and I'm not suggesting that my contribution to the ASF is vast, but it is what I could give. While most of my charitable contributions I keep to myself, I think that writing about and promoting a charity, asking others to act, is more likely to prompt that action when we can show that we have the courage of our convictions, that we mean what we say, that we do what we can do. That's why my name \u00a0is on the \u00a0 Chefs page \u00a0at Recipe4Hope. I wanted readers to know I believed in the ASF enough to act. That act, that simple charitable contribution, is a recipe for hope. In the act of giving, we receive much more than we let go of. I don't believe in a creator, but I do believe in man's fundamental character: most of us care about others, most of us want to make the world a better place. Sometimes, that involves our wallet. Sometimes, it involves our words. And sometimes, it requires a little more overt action on our part. Whatever you decide, I hope you will act to make the world a better place. Maybe it's not the ASF's mission that speaks to you. Maybe it's the local food bank. Maybe it's the Salvation Army. Maybe it's Toys for Tots. Maybe it's to provide respite care for a family in need. Whatever it is, I hope that you will feel joy in the act of giving and help to prove that this is not a zero sum world. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.recipe4hope.org/?page_id=5", "http://www.autisable.com/724675660/acceptance-appreciation-and-accommodation-begin-at-home/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum", "http://www.recipe4hope.org/?page_id=6"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/12/autism-science-foundation-and-recipe.html", "title": "\nAutism Science Foundation and A Recipe For Hope\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "body": "\nI read a comment this morning on a blog that had me cringing at the lack of understanding of genetics. As parents, we need to work to be better informed in the basics of science, and we need to guard against the assumption that we understand something (this comment was offered with complete confidence but was woefully off the mark). \n \nReposted by permission. Please see the original at  The Epi Times . Thank you for writing this! :-) \n \n \n... \n \n True story (maybe): I was working as a medical technologist, a lab boy, in a rather large hospital near the nation's capital. That night, I was working in the blood bank section, doing routine blood types and setting up blood for patients going to surgery the next day. I loved that job because, about every hour or so, I'd have to literally run to the emergency department to deliver O-negative blood for someone who had just been shot, stabbed, or been in a bad car accident. That allowed me to take in some of the adrenaline that late-night weekends brought with them. Oh, the stories I can tell you. Yet the one story that has stuck with me all that time is the interesting case of a child whose blood type made no sense when compared to the parents' blood types. It took five hours, lots of research, and one phone call to clear up the mystery. More on that case and an intro to \u00a0 Mendelian Genetics , as always, after the jump... \n \n \n Their genes are varied, unique, but never \"defective\" or \"faulty\" \n \n BLUE EYES OR BROWN? My wife was surprised to know that people in my extended family had blue or green eyes. She was even more surprised to know that there are plenty of Mexicans with blue eyes. Now, my wife is in no way someone that would stereotype on purpose, but it is a reasonable assumption that people from one country or region of the world outside the United States tend to be homogeneous (of one consistency) in skin, hair, and eye color. After all, you don't see a lot of short, black-skinned Germans, do you? \n \n Uh... Well... Uh... Move on, nothing to see here... \n \n There is a simple explanation as to why some of my cousins have blue eyes while I don't: GENETICS. Very simple genetics (so simple that they are taught in elementary schools nowadays) are often called Mendelian Genetics, named after \u00a0 Gregor Mendel . Mendel explained in the 1860s that seeds (peas) seemed to inherit their traits (color and texture) in a patter that could be statistically predicted. Of course, more and more people worked on this as the years went by, and we came to the understanding that there are two types of genes (alleles) that rule over inheritance patterns. DOMINANT GENES Dominant genes are those genes that code for something (eye color, skin color, height) regardless of their inheritance pattern. That is, they always \"express\" themselves. Brown eyes are coded for by a dominant gene. So it doesn't matter what my wife brings to the table (genetically speaking) with her beautiful hazel eyes. Our children have a very good chance of being brown eyed. Then again, there is a slight chance that they inherit blue eyes. Why? Because I might carry a recessive gene for blue eyes. (I haven't tested myself, nor do I need to.) RECESSIVE GENES Recessive genes, on the other hand, code for something but are susceptible to being \"covered\" by dominant genes. So I might have a recessive blue eyes gene which is being covered by my brown eyes. My wife, on the other hand, has both recessive genes (one from each parent) for blue, hence the color of her eyes. There is a 1 in 2 chance that I'll pass on the recessive gene, while her chances of passing it on are even at 1:1 (since she has no dominant brown eyes gene or she'd have brown eyes, too). Our overall chance of having a brown-eyed baby (a latte baby, if you will) is 1 in 2 (because 0.5 chance of blue eyes multiplied by 1.0 chance of blue eyes is 0.5, or a 50% chance). If she had brown eyes too, then the chance of a brown-eyed baby would be 75% (1 in 3) because 0.5 multiplied by 0.5 is 0.25, or a 25% chance of a blue-eyed baby. \n \n \n \n All we are saying is \"give peas a chance\"! \n \n \n So, just like I can have a blue-eyed baby, my uncles and aunts had blue-eyed babies, my cousins. Those cousins can marry a brown-eyed person and have brown-eyed babies who, in turn, can later have blue-eyed babies, \"skipping a generation.\" See? It's not that complicated, is it? COMPLICATED ENOUGH? As you can see in the graphic above, yellow and green peas can \"give birth\" to white peas. Look closer, and you can see that their texture is different as well. Mendelian genetics is not a very hard concept is you just keep looking at what is dominant and what is recessive. In the graphic, green color (R) and a rough texture (Y) are dominant. So any combination of genes from both \"parents\" that have an R will be green, and Y will make them yellow. Lowercase \"r\" will mean yellow, and lowercase \"y\" will mean smooth \u00a0 IF AND ONLY IF \u00a0 there are no dominant genes to cover them. REAL LIFE In reality, there are a wide variety of genetic conditions that afflict many. They are rare, yes, but they are still important to look at. One condition that behaves very \"Mendelian\" is \u00a0 cystic fibrosis \u00a0 (CF). Cystic fibrosis is a condition where the lungs produce excess mucus, and they are not good at getting rid of that excess mucus. Folks with CF suffer from all sorts of lung infections because viruses and bacteria that get in there are difficult to clear out. The pancreas of a person with CF also produces a thick mucus that prevents the proper processing of food. As it turns out, a person with CF inherits two recessive genes for CF that cause the overproduction of that mucus. Someone who has only one recessive gene from one parent is okay (though they still have some slight problems). Those folks with the recessive genes grow up, get married, and the gene moves on down the lineage. Now, if two people meet and have a child, and they both have the recessive gene, then, like with blue eyes, there is a 25% chance that their child will have CF. Other \u00a0 conditions that behave the same way \u00a0 are sickle cell disease and Tay Sachs disease. Together, they are called \"Autosomal Recessive Disorders\". WHERE IT GETS CONFUSING It is confusing and very frustrating to parents of children with autosomal recessive disorders that they gave birth to children with the disorder without any prior warning because they were healthy. If they were healthy, why would their children have such horrible conditions? Why didn't the gene \"die out\"? Well, it didn't die out because it's recessive, meaning that you need to be \"unlucky\" enough to have two people with one gene each get together in order to have a child with the disorder. Even then, it's only a 25% chance that the child will be full-on sick. There's a 25% chance that the child will have none of the recessive genes and only the dominant ones (in which case the genes do end there). But 25% and 25% do not make 100%. There is the remaining 50% chance that the child will also be a carrier of the gene, like the parents... And the gene lives on. A 50-50 CHANCE Of course, there are those conditions that are caused by dominant genes. In those cases, the affected people usually make it to adulthood. If they were to procreate with someone else who did not have the dominant gene, they would have a 50-50 shot of having an affected baby. The bright side there is the 50-50 chance of an unaffected baby. \u00a0 Huntington disease \u00a0 is such a dominant genetic disorder. \n \n \n \n A very dangerous 50-50 shot... \n \n GENES DON'T DIE, THEY JUST FADE AWAY So you can see from these examples that genetic conditions can't really be \"washed away\" from the population even if everyone was to be properly screened. The Nazis wanted to try this, and they failed miserably not only because of their misunderstanding of genetic conditions but because they were dealing with humans. No one is allowed to tell us who to love and when and how. No one is allowed to tell us whether or not to have children. Choice, it seems, is helping genetic conditions move on down our lineages. And that's not such a bad thing. It's not a bad thing because genetic variations, even if they cause disease, allow for us to be varied and strong as a species. One of the first steps in evolution is mutation, so it's not all that bad that we have some folks with different genes. It may be a very difficult existence to live with a genetic condition, but it's just one of those things that make us human. It's not easy, but it is needed. \u00a0 I know, I know... Easier written than done . However, there is \u00a0 very real evidence \u00a0 that folks with sickle cell disease do not get infected with malaria since the malaria parasite cannot infect and reproduce in the sickle-like red blood cells of those folks. Even CF is believed to be a genetic adjustment \u00a0 to diarrhea-causing diseases like cholera. \n \n Other genetic mutations just make you dress ridiculously \n \n Of course, there are \u00a0 other ways in which genes can cause disorders \u00a0 to be passed down from one generation to the next, but I promised to keep this post simple and short(-ish). THE BABY WITH THE WRONG BLOOD TYPE Alright, so, where was I? Oh, yes... So I received cord blood for a blood type on a baby that was born late one night. The baby's blood type was O-negative. I'll spare you the genetics class and tell you that O-negative babies can only be born from a pair of \"negative\" parents. Type O can be inherited from parents who are both A, both B, one A one B, one A one O, one B one O, or both O. If one parent is AB, then the baby MUST be A or B, never O. Trust me on this one. Guess what blood type the father was? That's right... AB-positive. The mother was O-negative. I had to do the blood type because the mother was a candidate for \"rhogam\", an infusion of antibodies designed to get prevent her from making antibodies against the Rh factor (positive/negative) of the baby if the baby is positive since the father was positive. So, to recap... Baby is O-negative. Mother is O-negative. But father is AB-positive. That is, the father had all three dominant genes (A, B, and Rh). The baby could only be A-positive/negative or B-positive/negative, nothing else!!! OH, SNAP! I didn't know about the father until the obstetrician called me after I released the results of the baby's blood type. \"Lab boy,\" she said, \"I need you to retest the baby's blood.\" \"Why?\" I asked. \"Because the father is AB-positive.\" If you could only see the expression in my face. The father had recently returned from overseas. He was in the military, and he had his blood type on his dogtags. Not only that, but he had been severely injured a few months back, so he knew for sure he had the right blood type on his tags. It was going to be a long night. RESEARCH, RESEARCH, RESEARCH! I spent the latter part of the night researching into whether or not the baby could be that blood type, given what we knew. I called the American Red Cross and spoke to some very experienced blood bankers. We all agreed that the Mendelian Genetics did not agree. \u00a0 There were only so many blood types the child could be . I read through several books on genetics and on blood inheritance. It appeared to me that a divorce was likely to happen. The obstetrician asked me to test and retest the blood. She even sent the father down to the blood bank to be tested. She then drew a sample from the mother for testing. It was all still the same, until... BONUS POINTS If you can tell me what really happened without reading any further down, you get bonus points and maybe even some \"mad props\". \n \n You're not my Dad... maybe! \n \n ELEMENTARY, DR. WATSON Well, her name was not Watson, but what happened was quite elementary. I happened to notice that another cord blood was put in the sample case at around the same time as the child in question. Heck, I only noticed this because I had to re-test the cord blood so many times. So I took out that other sample and tested it. It was B-positive. This made me curious, so I called the obstetrician and asked if I could go up and draw blood from the child, based on my findings. She agreed, and I did. Indeed, the child's blood was B-positive. I called back and asked to speak to the nurse who collected the blood samples. She tearfully told me that she honestly did not know which sample was which since she had not labeled them at the bedside. Instead, she had waited until she got back to the nurses' station, with both samples in her pocket, and then decided to label them there. She was out of a job by the end of the night, from what I heard. \n \n I hear she's doing well, though. \n \n ONE LAST POINT AND A FINAL MESSAGE As I stated above, there are other genetic conditions/disorders that cause trouble and are inherited in different way that plain Mendelian patterns. They are many times unpredictable... and almost always heartbreaking. They are heartbreaking because you see a pair of parents and extended family who blame themselves for their child's condition. If something was wrong with my genes, I would also feel imperfect and thus guilty for my child's disease. Even now, in 2010, there are plenty of conditions which we are discovering to have a heavy genetic component to them. In some cases, genes are necessary but not sufficient to cause a disorder. This may be the case with some conditions like autism or allergies. The other factor is somewhere in the environment. When the environmental factor works upon the defective gene, the disorder is manifested. (\"Defective\" is too strong a word. A gene is a gene is a gene, and we are no where near understanding the \"why\" these genes have come along in our evolution.) If you or someone you know is concerned about a genetic condition or about passing on a genetic condition to your children, please talk to a genetic counselor and your health care provider... And don't think for a minute that your genes somehow determine your worth. Like with everything else, it's what you do with those genes to the benefit of others that will be the true measure of who you are and how you will be remembered... how your legacy will live on. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.epiren.com/2010/12/oh-baby-or-intro-to-mendelian-genetics.html", "http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/mendel/mendel1.htm", "http://www.kildarechildcare.ie/test33/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/children-jump1a.jpg", "", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rnbOy5aZwPY/TRIccy9axJI/AAAAAAAAEBQ/5HBhNRrbq5s/s1600/BlackGermanGirl1930s.gif", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel", "https://health.google.com/health/ref/Cystic+fibrosis", "http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site616/mainpageS616P0.html", "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rnbOy5aZwPY/TRIdRp2VgHI/AAAAAAAAEBU/1Cu0QT7hKmg/s1600/special-kid.jpg", "http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html", "http://www.ionchannels.org/showabstract.php?pmid=7714835", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rnbOy5aZwPY/TRIdpivJV8I/AAAAAAAAEBY/OlrL8rw-_LE/s1600/x-men-evolution.jpg", "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/inheritance/inheritancepatterns", "http://www.biology.arizona.edu/human_bio/problem_sets/blood_types/intro.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rnbOy5aZwPY/TRIem-PsM7I/AAAAAAAAEBc/VmqVZ01TBn0/s1600/angry-baby-fist.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rnbOy5aZwPY/TRIe-x4MgPI/AAAAAAAAEBg/VhoF3OkVUkg/s1600/crazy_woman.bmp"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/12/guest-post-by-epi-times-oh-baby-or.html", "title": "\nGuest Post by The Epi Times: Oh, Baby! or Intro to Mendelian Genetics\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 26, 2010", "body": "\n \n \nTwitter, facebook, various blog directories, Yahoo and Google news alerts are all familiar ways to most readers to get caught up with the world, and specifically for us, the autism-related world. This morning I read Susan Senators'\u00a0 serious post \u00a0about the way the world views her two oldest sons and\u00a0 Autism and Oughtism's piece \u00a0on when it's okay to laugh and when it's not. These are heavy pieces and speak to our human frailties, tendencies to inaction or covert action. They both speak to the pain we can feel as parents and to our darker moments. They're not light reading, but they're thought-provoking and worth the effort. It was not a bad way to start the morning, just a serious way to start it. \n \n \n \nWhat came next in my things to read \u00a0this morning came through Wrong Planet's twitter feed: \" Asperger vs NT war.: Who would win?Why? Assume that the Neurotypicals and ASD in the war are both equal in terms... http://bit.ly/gjOzT9 . \"\u00a0 There are a few answers to the thread, most saying NTs would, and one saying whoever had the most money. And all I could think is what the heck kind of question is that to ask the morning after Christmas, any day for that matter? \n \n \n \n What is with this way of framing the world two dimensionally that we all do it? The haves and the have-nots, the in-group and the out-group, the disabled and the non-disabled. It's not that cut and dried. It's not that black and white. And as long as we focus on false dichotomies, it's going to be incredibly difficult to build a truly supportive, inclusive community. \n \n \n \n The personality traits (when we remove aspects of crippling disability that are involved on the severe end of autism) that are involved in autism are spread throughout all of humanity; there is no clear dividing line between a fictional neurotypicality and Asperger's, and neither state of being is superior or more worthy. I look at my children and see my husband, my parents, my brothers, and myself reflected back from them. I see shared personality traits and quirks and issues that make us the complex, interesting people that we are. I see the adversities that my children work to overcome, some of which I've had to overcome as well. The idea, the very notion, of positing a war with Asperger's and NTs is absurdity.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I get that my kids are literal thinkers; so many who are not on the spectrum are literal thinkers as well. That isn't something the ASD has the corner on. I get that many on the spectrum have difficulty with theory of mind. So do a whole lot of folks who are not on the spectrum; drive through a school parking lot and you'll see lots of evidence that most folks aren't using their theory of mind. There is a tremendous overlap of traits, attitudes, and behaviors between all people, so that we have more in common that not. We must focus on these areas of commonality in order to build community. We must see the humanity in others and recognize that it is the same humanity within ourselves. \n \n \n \n We must be willing to join our friends in their darker, sadder ponderings, as I did with Susan and Autism & Oughtisms this morning, so that we can be a support, so that we can bear witness, even when we're not quite certain what to say in response, so that we are none of us alone on this journey.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n But I think we have to reject the kind of rhetoric displayed, even if in jest, on Wrong Planet this morning. I think it's easy, terribly easy to set ourselves up as one side in a battle against an implacable enemy, and I have no doubt that many in this community do indeed set themselves up in this way: bitter enemies on a battlefield, each certain of their mental superiority and the righteousness of their cause.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I read them hammer down the other, time after time, day after day. There's no exchange of ideas, no transmission of information, just an incessant, pointless hammering, with\u00a0 people thinking \u00a0it perfectly acceptable to call pediatricians \"Propaganda Prostitute for the Vaccine makers\" and another to cast me as her \"old foe, KWombles, hi Kim, speaking out in deception on the side of toxic vaccines...Good thing people aren\u2019t duped by you here working to do so as most are awake now a days & those in the dark or on the fence are soon to meet reason & logic once they start paying attention.\" The one thing I can say absolutely is that I've never considered this particular individual a foe. \n \n \n \n Reading blogs and forums in our community can be landmines waiting to be set off, setting us up to take a tailspin if something connects too painfully, or if we read something so utterly off the deep end that we wonder at both the moral compass and sanity of some of the people we come across. And I wonder, when I read those so far entrenched, what must the weight of their burdens be to be so utterly lost and devoid of hope, of light, of reason? I do not consider them my enemy, my foe, or an outsider; I am not naive enough to think we can change those people, reason them out of positions they didn't reason themselves into in the first place, but keeping a check on them is a good thing to do. There is an underbelly to this community and at any moment, it can reach out and try to tear us down into it. \n \n \n \n But it is an underbelly, not the whole beast, not the entire story, and there is so much love, so much light, and so much beauty in the midst of pain and heartache that the journey of being part of this community is well worth the price of admission. Heather writes\u00a0 about embracing Christmas , this first one without her daughter, and I am overwhelmed by her grace. Eric\u00a0 writes about his son \u00a0and celebrating Christmas and the issues they face with his son's seizures, and I am honored to watch this father battle for his son's life and well-being.\u00a0 Born 2b Me \u00a0wishes his readers a merry Christmas, as do many of the bloggers on the directory, and there is joy and peace and love on most blogs this holiday weekend.\u00a0 Corina\u00a0 offers a lovely drawing at her blog, and\u00a0 Clay \u00a0shares some coca-cola videos at his blog. Matt has a cartoon on \u00a0Rudolph \u00a0that will make you smile.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n And so this morning, I end my reading on an upnote, amazed at the grace, the fortitude, the joy, and the compassion that is out there in our community, just waiting to be found and shared. I have seen into the dusty corners where our fears lay, I've seen into the closet where the monsters lie in wait, and I have pulled the shades to the sides of the windows and let the sun in. All these things are a part of our world, our community. And we must face them all, ideally together, so that we are none of us alone and without hope. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://susansenator.com/blog/2010/12/the-polar-extremes-of-brothers/", "http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/humorless-and-humorous-autism/", "http://bit.ly/gjOzT9", "http://shotofprevention.com/2010/12/23/do-you-believe-in-vaccines-part-iii-experience/", "http://samsmom-heathers.blogspot.com/2010/12/well-hello-christmas.html", "http://iamabrokenmanyoucantbreakme.blogspot.com/", "http://born2bme.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/love-joy-and-peace-to-all/", "http://nostereotypeshere.blogspot.com/2010/12/merry-christmas.html", "http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/12/coca-cola-christmas.html", "http://dudeimanaspie.blogspot.com/2010/12/rudolph.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/12/after-christmas-smorgasbord-rhetorical.html", "title": "\nAn After-Christmas Smorgasbord: Rhetorical Questions, Political Correctness & Tone Deafness: Rejecting the Angry Places\n"},

We are not about selling products or directly advertising. There are times when we are willing to have a guest post in order to just pass on information for those who might be interested. This is not meant as an endorsement . We prefer to look at it as if we are acting as a conduit.-Kathleen and Kim \n \n \n \nRecovery at its Best: About the Center for Autism & Related Disorders, Inc. by Joe Mohs \n \n No one could have predicted how devastating the increase of autism found in young children would become. Once considered a rare psychological disorder twenty years ago, affecting one in every 2,000 children under the age of five, this ratio has risen at a frightening pace, now standing at roughly one in 100 in the United States alone. Autism Spectrum Disorder has become nothing short of a worldwide epidemic.  But during these last twenty years, one organization, the Center for Autism & Related Disorders (CARD), has challenged, and triumphed over, on many occasions, this intimidating statistic since its founding. Starting as a small office clinic in Los Angeles and transforming into the largest and most dedicated provider of autism treatment has been only one of its many accomplishments. CARD has also proven itself, time and time again, as a positive role model amongst the entire field of psychology, refuting the once-popular belief that even the community\u2019s leading authorities thought as fact; that autism is a life-long disorder and untreatable. Just recently, the results of a three-year study done at a CARD office based in Phoenix, backed by the Arizona Legislature, revealed further evidence supporting the possibility of recovery. Inspired by working with children diagnosed in the autism spectrum, CARD founder and Executive Director Dr. Doreen Granpeesheh studied autism treatment under the supervision of the late Dr. Ivar Lovaas, pioneer of the highly effective behavioral approach, Applied Behavior Analysis, which demonstrated a near 50% rate in autism recovery as written in his world-renowned study released in 1987. Dr. Granpeesheh was highly motivated by the profound outcome that came through autism recovery as she witnessed through a number her young clients. Upon receiving her PhD in 1990, Dr. Granpeesheh found the necessity to establish an organization that would provide only the highest quality of treatment to children and families affected by ASD. CARD  is well known for offering multiple treatment programs not only to affected young children, but also to young adults. The CARD I program provides comprehensive curricula to children between the ages of 0 and 8 that are individualized to fit the needs of each child. The CARD II program provides exceptional quality services to older children and young adults from ages 9 to 21. In addition, Specialized Outpatient Services (SOS), assessment, and off-site parent/therapist training and workshop services are just a few of the many treatment options available  from CARD . With nineteen offices spanning across the continental U.S. and two international locations, CARD currently has the privilege of treating over 1,000 clients with a working staff of over 700. Celebrating its 20 th  Anniversary last year by spreading autism awareness through fundraising events held across its office locations, the world\u2019s most influential autism treatment provider has deserved every ounce of its success. The remarkable results demonstrated from its clients after are solid proof of that. Children who could not respond to their parents or participate with their peers have been given the precious gift of a potentially successful and happy life. \n \n Joe Mohs is a determined and creative individual whose life can be defined as a success story. Having recovered from severe autism at the age of four, Joe shares a special history with the famed Dr. Doreen Granpeesheh, in which she personally treated Joe using ABA treatment at the UCLA where Joe recovered. Now, at 26, Joe holds a BFA in Graphic Design from the University of Minnesota Duluth and is the founder and co-owner of Living Proof, an inspirational web organization dedicated to addressing that recovery from autism is possible, as well as any personal or family crisis. Joe has spoken publicly about his life before and after autism at a number of venues across his home state, Minnesota, and reunited with Dr. Granpeesheh in the summer of 2009 to catch up and receive advice about his future goals.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2010", "body": "\n Community is important; all too often in our lives as special needs parents, we can and are isolated. We are left to our own devices; we are given inadequate guidance, advice, or information regarding our children and their issues. We don't know where to turn and we don't know who to turn to. Back when our journey began with our son, there was barely an internet; there was hardly any chatter on autism. I've written about those times: the bad books, the bad shrinks, the bad times, all around. It wasn't easy. There were years of fractured days and splintered nights, times I felt like I was barely holding on, and that no one really understood. And there was no help, no break, little hope. It was not good. So I get it. I do. I have the utmost compassion and empathy for those new parents struggling with this bewildering diagnosis, their child's staggering needs, the confusion, the isolation, the sheer exhaustion. I get the fear. I get the despair. I can close my eyes and be 22 again, with an infant son who screamed unless he was nursing, to be 25 again and have a preschooler who was nonverbal, still in diapers, and preferably naked. I can close my eyes and be 30 and holding my nine year old son in his hospital bed, after his stroke, his right side paralyzed, his speech gone. I remember those months after the stroke when he had to learn it all over again, when we were once again cleaning his bowel movements off the floor and wherever else he cared to go. \u00a0I get it. I get it. I do. It can be incredibly draining to parent children with autism and other neurological disorders. We're ill-equipped to think of ourselves as caregivers past a certain point in our children's lives, and we are often left with no community support, with no respite care, with no one but ourselves to work with our children. And when we have multiple children, the demands increase, especially when each child has an neurological condition. It's daunting, overwhelming, and it can feel like there will never be a light at the end of the tunnel. And we need to vent. We need a safe place to let it out, our pain, our fear, our frustration, our exhaustion. We need desperately to know we are not alone. I really do get it. And I get when you are at the bottom of the pit, it's impossible to think there's any other place but the pit. You think it will never get better. You can't remember a time different, and it's impossible for you to imagine how it will ever improve. And as long as you are in that pit, isolated, alone, and certain in your convictions that it won't get better, it won't. You may not have put yourself in that pit, but you're there now. And the only person who's going to get you out is you. YOU. Friends can be lined up along the pit, holding their hands down to you, throwing you lifeline after lifeline, but if you don't reach up and grab, you will stay in the pit. We each of us draw lines, boundaries, that we believe we will not cross until we've crossed them. We may not realize until it's way too late that we've smashed these lines we've drawn, obliterated them out of existence. We can and should be there for each other, support each other, and we should be able to express when we are in despair, when we are broken, when we need some help. We must learn to ask for help when we need it, and we need, even as we are mired in that pit, that wasteland that we think goes on forever, to realize that our actions in that pit will follow us out and into the world and into our children's lives. Our pain does not give us license to hurt or abuse our children. It does not give us license to degrade them or dehumanize them. \u00a0These are not lines we can cross. Our children depend on us, need us, demand the better angels of our nature. We are not perfect and we will fail them, but we can not for their sakes or our own afford to fail them when it comes to respecting their innate value and dignity. I don't know what the answer is, how to respond, what to say, when I've seen that line obliterated. It gives me tremendous pause. But let me suggest this: if all you see is pain and the pit when you see your child, you've walked up to that line and started stepping across it. It's time you reached out and got some help. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2010/12/lines-drawing-them-stepping-over-them.html", "title": "\nLines: Drawing Them, Stepping Over Them, Obliterating Them\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, February 20, 2011", "body": "\n   The 7 people who ask you why you're in a wheelchair I know this is true for pretty much any disability that\u2019s visible in some way. I\u2019ve seen it happen to people with hearing aids, crutches, and the like, to people who have a noticeable limp or speech problem or anything like that. I\u2019m using a wheelchair in most of my examples because it\u2019s one of the most obvious and universal signs of disability, most consistent with my own personal experience, and I just spent the weekend in Chicago using a wheelchair to get around.  I\u2019ll use gender-neutral terms where appropriate. I need to rant a bit and I hope at least someone finds this amusing. 1.       Curious Child (and hir mother) Honestly, you probably saw this one coming.  When you wheeled into the room, Curious Child (usually between the ages of four and ten) looked up at you with wide eyes and an open mouth, and you could see the wheels in hir head turning.  You knew the question was coming eventually. And Curious Child hirself not really the problem here.  Kids are naturally curious about the world, and it\u2019s hard to be angry at people who genuinely don\u2019t know better for asking questions.  The problem is the Curious Child\u2019s mother, who is, of course, horrified that her child has asked you why you\u2019re in a wheelchair.  You begin to politely explain to the child why people in general use wheelchairs, but the mother is panicking, afraid you\u2019ll think she\u2019s a bad mother who encourages that sort of thing, calling Curious Child rude and apologizing profusely to you while dragging her poor confused child away.  I\u2019m all for teaching kids that questions like that aren\u2019t polite.  But at that age it\u2019s an honest mistake.  My problem is that this method doesn\u2019t really teach Curious Child how to interact with disabled people.  If the mother wanted to do that, a gentle explanation would be best.  I can remember my mother explaining to me, either in front of the person I\u2019d inadvertently offended or in private afterwards, that that\u2019s not a polite question, but I can never remember being immediately removed from the disabled person\u2019s presence.  I learned how to behave appropriately around disabled people, in wheelchairs are otherwise, and not comment on their appearance.  And most importantly I had a healthy respect for the fact that they were just normal people. But when Curious Child is strongly chastised for hir behavior, ze has only learned from hir mother that disabled people are taboo and you shouldn\u2019t talk to them.  This is probably what the mother was taught as a child, which would explain a lot about her reactions to you.  Because this is the same sort of mother who will abruptly yank her child away from you if ze is anywhere near you, even if neither of you are about to run into the other.  The first few times this happens you\u2019ll think it\u2019s for your benefit, but it\u2019s really not.  Watch a few times and you\u2019ll see that the many mothers think you have the plague, and any contact with you will cause Curious Child to catch it too. 2.      Sympathy Addict This person is nearly always female (at least 90% of the time), and usually over the age of 35.  She\u2019s addicted to giving sympathy, and sometimes to receiving it back.  Sympathy Addict may follow you around, shaking her head sadly at the sight of you bravely wheeling your chair through the building (because that\u2019s brave, clearly).  This may happen for a while before she strikes up a conversation with you.  I\u2019m clueless enough that I won\u2019t always see this one coming until it does, so it\u2019s kind of a surprise when she asks why I\u2019m in a wheelchair. Sympathy Addict is interested in everything about me.  I am simply the most fascinating thing in the world.  My medical history is no longer a private matter but is knowledge that should rightfully belong to everyone around me, and any obvious casts or braces will be pointed out as if I didn\u2019t know they were there (\u201cHey, you have a cast.\u201d  \u201cNo shit.\u201d).  I shift uncomfortably and explain why I\u2019m in a wheelchair, answering questions about what caused it and what I\u2019ve tried and so on, often while listening to Sympathy Addict making strange (comforting?) noises and saying things like \u201cYou poor thing!\u201d  Sometimes she will try to describe her own medical problems in a desire to connect with you on an emotional level.  You broke your foot?  She once stubbed her toe on a dresser.  The two of you are practically related. This isn\u2019t so bad the first time you run into it, but after you meet several of these people a week, you will start to get tired of stopping whatever you\u2019re doing and revealing your complete medical history to a stranger.  (Really.  I\u2019ve thought about just handing out business cards.) You\u2019re a Bad Cripple \u2122 if you don\u2019t indulge in at least some of these questions, and if you\u2019re rude to Sypmathy Addict you\u2019re probably not a Real Disabled Person \u2122.  The best method I\u2019ve found of dealing with this person is to be conveniently in a hurry.  Just hope she doesn\u2019t follow you around all day offering to open doors.  More annoyingly, this person wants to be your own personal cheerleader, because you need more than anything to be told by a non-disabled person that You Can Do It.  Try to avoid their pep talks.  The more irritated and bored you are, the more elaborate they get.  Your family or significant other will get it, too.  They\u2019re brave for wanting to be seen in public with you, or for ever associating with you, or for not immediately locking you into an institution at birth.  Hopefully your family or significant other doesn\u2019t get off on this sort of thing, because some families of disabled people enjoy having Sympathy Addict around to justify their choices and praise them for knowing a disabled person.  Family members who enjoy Sympathy Addicts, or who are Sympathy Addicts, are extremely annoying. 3.      Amateur Doctor A specific type of the Sympathy Addict, it isn\u2019t enough for this person to just listen and make strange cooing noises as you explain your disability. Amatuer Doctor doesn\u2019t have to be involved in the medical profession at all.  Ze doesn\u2019t need to know anything about your disability, or even about the human body in general.  But as soon as your problem is described, have no fear, Amateur Doctor is here! Amateur Doctor has the answer to all your needs, real or presumed.  Ze knows the right question to ask (Just like a real doctor)!  And once Amateur Doctor understands your diagnosis or has rediagnosed you, ze can roll out so many suggestions for treatment that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re watching TV on a weeknight at four AM.  Amateur Doctors often approached my younger brother when he was in a wheelchair, and when they found out he had brittle bones, they usually glared at my parents and reproachfully asked why they didn\u2019t feed their kid milk.  It really pissed my mom off, because these people seriously thought that we and all of my brother\u2019s doctors were so stupid that they hadn\u2019t thought of that first.  It doesn\u2019t even matter if they\u2019ve heard of your disability before.  They still have an answer for it, because Amateur Doctor has a solution to every problem. Oh, you\u2019re so brilliant, Amateur Doctor.  I could never have thought of that on my own. Yes, I will certainly ask my doctors for some x-rays on my back, and I\u2019ll add them to the pile of x-rays I have sitting around at home. Yes, I\u2019ll try some Aspirin, because I need some more drugs and am too stupid to know how to deal with pain.  Yes, I\u2019m sure that homeopathic remedy you took for your cold would do wonders for my broken leg.  Oh, Amateur Doctor, no amount of medical training could compare to your years of experience in telling disabled people what to do.  (And after all, you did once take a biology class in high school.  Never mind whether you passed it.) 4.      Busybody Busybody uses similar methods to Sympathy Addict and Amateur Doctor, but is a little different.  There is nothing polite about the way Busybody openly gawks at you, like ze has never seen a disabled person before, and ze loudly and obnoxiously ask questions about your medical history.  Extremely personal questions are not off-limits.  (One seriously asked me how I had sex.) To Busybody, disabled people are not people.  It may be that they don\u2019t think of most people as real, or they just don\u2019t think or care about how their actions affect other people.  But to Busybody, you are not a living, breathing person.  You are an object there for their entertainment. Again, failure to respond properly to this person makes you a Bad Cripple \u2122.  Luckily as soon as Busybody\u2019s questions are answered his or her attention span will wane and you\u2019ll notice them staring off into the background and not even listening to you anymore.  You\u2019ve served your purpose already.  They seriously won\u2019t notice now if you slip away.  5.      Detective A specific type of Busybody.  Detective is determined, by whatever means necessary, to get to the bottom of why you\u2019re in a wheelchair.  Hir interest wanes less quickly than a normal Busybody\u2019s, and you will soon wish that wasn\u2019t the case. The problem with Detective is that immediately upon seeing you, ze has an inkling that you don\u2019t really belong in that chair.  Ze will ask you rapid-fire questions that make you feel like you\u2019re in an interrogation room.  Any time you run into Detective afterwards, you\u2019ll see hir staring at you and waiting for you to slip up.  Because Detective doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019re a Real Disabled Person \u2122.  You\u2019re just faking it for the attention, because clearly you love fighting with the oppressive architecture of every building, and clearly you love answering stupid questions asked by nosy people about your own body.  The best part is when Detective thinks you\u2019ve finally been caught in a lie.  If you can walk at all, or at least shift from the wheelchair to a chair or bench for more comfort while your group rests or eats or something, you\u2019ll see Detective\u2019s face light up in an Aha! moment.  Ze caught you, buster. The Disability Police are coming to take you down to the station now, because you\u2019re a liar and a faker.  The fact that you can move at all is proof that you have no disability.  (Detective, by the way, sees the world in black and white, so there\u2019s no escaping this.  You\u2019re either all disabled or not disabled at all.) If Detective confronts you publicly about it, people who don\u2019t know what conversation you had earlier with the detective may assume that you really are a faker.  I mean, Detective is right, you do have a wheelchair and you really aren\u2019t in it now.  Even if these people don\u2019t care about disability in any way under normal circumstances, suddenly you\u2019re the worst person in the world, stealing priority seating, parking spots, and toilet stalls from Real Disabled People \u2122--even though they (and Detective, too) would gladly do the same any time it\u2019s convenient.  There\u2019s really no escaping this one.  Detective wants too badly to prove ze is right about you, because although Detective doesn\u2019t want to admit it, ze doesn\u2019t think Real Disabled People \u2122 exist.  There are just scroungers like you who pretend to be disabled or exaggerate for their own personal gain (like the priority seating, parking spaces, and toilet stalls you really can\u2019t use anyway because able-bodied people get to them first).  Even if you\u2019re not on government assistance, Detective is convinced that you get special privileges for being disabled and wishes that those privileges were hirs.  We could pause to ponder the psyche of Detective and ask why this person is so suspicious and angry, but it really wouldn\u2019t do any good. 6.      Conspiracy Theorist Like Detective and Amateur Doctor, this one asks a lot of questions and is suspicious\u2014but not usually of you.  Conspiracy Theorist, in addition to offering what they consider sage advice, will suggest that what you\u2019re doing to treat your disability is bad for you in some way.  Although often well-meaning, this kind of person can become quickly exhausting and hard to converse with.  Conspiracy Theorist Type A is usually kind. but full of bizarre and just-plan-wrong ideas.  Ze doesn\u2019t realize what ze is doing is exasperating you. Ze will, upon hearing you have had cortisone injections, advise you that doctors who suggest them are quacks and you should either take this supplement or just wait for the pain to stop, because your body makes your own cortisone.  Ze often thinks, even when presented strong medical evidence otherwise, that your disability has probably worsened because of what your doctors have done wrong.  Pain pills?  What are you thinking? Those are poison.  What you need is some chamomile extract, or you need no medicine at all because you\u2019re probably really normal anyway. Unfortunately for you, Conspiracy Theorist A has no idea why this kind of conversation would upset you or how frustrating it is to hear again and again that you don\u2019t need/shouldn\u2019t take your medicine, and because ze hasn\u2019t been purposely rude you are stuck in the (incredibly uncomfortable) conversation until they\u2019re ready to move on. Conspiracy Theorist Type B is aggressive and considers you to be just as guilty as your doctor.  Why?  Well, it\u2019s just ridiculous that you didn\u2019t get Educated and Enlightened like Conspiracy Theorist B, and frankly you kind of deserve to be in the horrible pain you\u2019re probably in.  Hir message is basically the same as that of Conspiracy Theorist A, but everything is your fault, even if you know otherwise.  Conspiracy Theorist B may be belligerent enough that you don\u2019t mind seeming rude by ending the conversation abruptly.  But since Conspiracy Theorist B is telling you The Truth, they will only get angrier as you ignore or argue with them.  Because now you\u2019re not just an idiot who isn\u2019t Enlightened, but you\u2019re part of the problem and are probably a Big Pharma Shill.  But it\u2019s okay.  You\u2019re probably not really disabled anyway, you\u2019re just faking for attention.  (It\u2019s presumed that Real Disabled People \u2122 fawn over every word these people say.) What\u2019s the difference between the two Conspiracy Theorists?  You might be tempted to say there\u2019s a huge difference, but there\u2019s really not. The two share the same philosophy and both are equally wrong.  Even when Conspiracy Theorist B is over-the-top, you can find Conspiracy Theorist A defending hir.  The only difference between the two is tactics\u2014one is polite and makes you uncomfortable and one is rude and makes you uncomfortable.  In fact, they might be the same person having a good day or a bad day.   7.  Asshole There is really no better term for this person, because Asshole refuses to even talk to you, except maybe in simpering tones and treating you like you're a baby.  Asshole probably assumes you're intellectually disabled (because all disabled people are probably intellectually disabled in Asshole's mind), and Asshole assumes that intellectually disabled people should be spoken to in baby talk.   That by itself is positively revolting, but Asshole usually doesn't talk to you.  You're too stupid to give hir answers.  Asshole asks whoever is accompanying you, or whoever is standing nearest to you if you're alone, what's wrong with (him/her/it).  Asshole often continues addressing people around you no matter how many times you remind hir that you're there, you understand what ze's saying, and you don't appreciate hir attitude.   Asshole is often combined with other types of people on this list, but the most distinguishing feature of Asshole is hir complete refusal to accept you as a human.  You will leave a conversation with Asshole feeling thoroughly humiliated and losing faith in humanity.  Good luck because there a surprising amount of Assholes out there.  That\u2019s it for now.  Let me know if you think of any more and we can do a continued list later.

{"date": "Thursday, March 10, 2011", "body": "\n Is it merely a rumor? Is it a dirty secret only traded in backstreet biomedical support groups and web forums? Is autism recovery (bad terminology, by the way) a myth? Of all the things in the autism world that surprises me, this idea is perhaps one of the most interesting to consider. You do see adults on the spectrum arguing they are fine as they are, whatever the level of impairment may be and they don't need help. Okay. Your life, your right, your choice. If you're fully functional, self-sustaining, and a happy camper, if your autism isn't limiting your ability to function in the world in the way you'd like to, good for you. Then you're not disabled, are you?  I think there's room to discuss language usage; I think there's room to work towards the least stigmatizing language as possible, to work to promote the value of all people, regardless of functional levels. And I absolutely don't think of my children as broken or needing fixed. They are, however, either disabled significantly like my son is or dealing with significant issues that do rise to the levels of impairments when  assistance is not rendered. They  need assistance and remediation to overcome or work around these issues, and I can only hope and work my ass off to help them to do so.  So maybe recent discussions in the blogs on the directory reflect a semantics issue rather than a true divide, but maybe they do not. Scientifically, though, is there any real debate about the ability of children to move off of the spectrum, to lose their diagnosis, to in effect recover from autism? No, I don't think there is. In 2007, Kleinman et al. write that 19% of young children in their study moved off the spectrum over time. Later, in 2010, one of the et al.'s from the Kleinman study , Deborah Fein,   revealed that based on her research, she \"believes that at least 10 percent, and possibly as many as 20 percent, of children who receive a diagnosis of autism or autism spectrum disorder can \u201crecover\u201d from it if they are provided the right kind of intensive behavioral therapy.\"  The whole goal of early childhood intervention is the assumption that the earlier one starts, the more progress the child will make, the more likely the child will be to \"recover\" from autism, or at least to mitigate the more disabling aspects. Everything we do as parents to help our children overcome their issues, surmount the obstacles facing them, is done with at least an eye towards helping to leave the crippling aspects of autism behind them. Perhaps some parents work hard at the same time to look towards positives they believe their children's unique brain wiring confers on them. I believe here we're going to see the ideological divides in parents and individuals: those who ascribe gifts and benefits to the way autism has shaped their child or themselves, given them talents or unique insights, and those who see nothing in autism but the misery the child or person suffers. In the end, it's a semantic and ideological divide predicated on the perception of autism itself. I can't fix that, render it moot. I can say that if I can move my children towards being able to function capably in society in a way that their unique issues are not disabling, I don't give a damn whether they have the label or not. I don't think they need to be fixed because I don't see them as broken. I see their issues as just that: issues that impair functioning, and I think that arming them with the tools to surmount those issues is my job as their mother. I do see them as complex individuals with a unique cluster of issues that can be or are disabling, and I would do anything within reason to help them overcome the disabling aspects, and I take hope in the realization that when scientific examination of the loss of the diagnostic label is addressed, anywhere from 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 sufficiently overcome their issues to lose a diagnostic label that in the medical world connotes disability.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2011", "body": "\nOne of the endlessly fascinating and frustrating things in the autism community are the issues that crop up and manage to work to divide the community. \n \nI almost want to sound like a boxing announcer, in this corner here are the autistic individuals who are in favor of  this petition \u00a0and in this corner the parents who are in favor of  this petition . \n \nIf my experiences this week, both  publicly and privately+,  are any indication, it's a pretty clear divide that isn't going to be bridged. How can it when one side is certain that it will lead to be autistics being restrained despite  evidence  that  it will not  and the other side is convinced  this is needed in order to get the technological and behavioral supports to help them prevent their autistic child  from wandering from home or darting into traffic. \n \nI took care with my posts at Countering this week to be fair, to be balanced, to demonstrate that the likelihood of hundreds of thousands of autistic individuals being labeled as wanderers was highly unlikely and that restraints were even less likely. \n \nMuch like the vaccine debate and the treatment debate, this is one that is clearly based on different perspectives and deep-seated fears on both sides. On the one side, autistic individuals are concerned that their autonomy will be restricted, and the petition, which caters to those fears, just reinforced that fear. On the other side, parents, many of whom have dealt with children who have wandered, who have darted into traffic, the opportunity to get help from the medical establishment, to get a handle on the problem, well, it's compelling. We love our children and we look at those  screaming* \u00a0arguing about abuse, torture, and restraint and wonder where they're coming from. We want to protect our children, keep them safe. Abusing them, torturing them, and restraining them aren't \u00a0a part of that equation. We'd fight to our dying breath to prevent that. \n \nOkay, truth be told, most of us would; some parents so desperate they've lost all hope send their children to that hellhole the Judge Rotenberg Center*  (Landon Bryce would like credit here because he mentioned a current story about the center on his website in his mischaracterization of my posts and my mood; he believes it is his idea and deserves credit+ ) and then testify on the center's behalf. I don't understand that. I really don't.

{"date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "body": "\nWhat follows is the recent blog post on Autism Science Foundation, the petition and letter from the NAA. Posted with permission from the ASF. \n \n \n \n Keep Our Loved Ones Safe From Wandering-Related Injuries and\u00a0Death \n \n \nWe have a unique opportunity to provide protection for our family members from autism-related injuries and death, but we need to act quickly. \n \nThe\u00a0ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee is currently considering a proposal to create a medical diagnostic code for wandering.\u00a0 A\u00a0diagnostic code for wandering will help protect at-risk individuals who have a documented history of wandering and will help to avert dangerous restraint and seclusion practices. \n \nASF strongly supports the proposal to include an ICD-9 CM secondary diagnostic code for \u201cwandering in conditions classified elsewhere\u201d under subcode \u201csigns and symptoms\u201d, where it can be applied to a range of disorders including autism,\u00a0 as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0 This is a critical addition to the diagnostic code.\u00a0 Every year, individuals with autism wander away from safe environments and are injured or killed due to drowning,\u00a0 exposure to the elements or accidents. Better data on wandering associated with autism and other developmental disabilities should help to increase awareness and action among first responders, school administrators and residential facility administrators to recognize and understand wandering and develop proper emergency protocols and responses while supporting self-determination principles.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A subclassification for \u201cwandering\u201d is an important, needed addition. \n \nASF is working with the National Autism Association and other autism advocacy groups to\u00a0protect our family members from both wandering related injury (and death) and restraint\u00a0& seclusion.\u00a0 This new diagnostic code has the potential to do both. Here are\u00a0just a few of the reasons we support adding a diagnosis code for wandering: \n \n A diagnostic code for wandering in disabled minors could open up critical dialogue between physicians and caregivers that have an at-risk child with a history of wandering/elopement from safe environments. \n \n \n A diagnostic code will allow for data collection on the incidence of wandering, thereby increasing opportunities for prevention-education for doctors, caregivers, school administrators and staff, first responders/search personnel. \n \n \n Many nonverbal ASD individuals are unable to respond to their name when called.\u00a0A diagnosis code will lead to increased awareness and the development of emergency search-and-rescue response protocols. \n \n \n Every disabled individual with a history of wandering \u2013 along with increased risk of injury, trauma and death because of wandering \u2014 deserves access to safety devices and prevention materials regardless of the caregiver\u2019s income. A medical code for wandering could potentially provide insurance coverage for those unable to afford critical protections for their children/adults. \n \n \n A medical code will enhance schools\u2019 understanding of wandering so that children with a history of wandering will be better protected. Oftentimes wandering is not viewed as a medical condition, but one of choice, bad behavior, or happenstance. This has led to a lack of school training, prevention and emergency response. In January alone, two children with autism went missing from their schools. \n \n \n Children and adults with ASD who suddenly flee, bolt or run (elope) because of a trigger are at greater risk of restraint. A\u00a0medical code will help establish protocols that work to eliminate triggers, thereby eliminating the need for restraint. \n \n \n Please take these two action steps right now: \n \nFirst,\u00a0 sign the NAA petition \u00a0in support of protecting our family members! \n \nSecond, send a brief public comment to CDC indicating your support for protecting our family members. Two or three sentences will suffice. \u00a0Simply write: \u201cI support the\u00a0ICD-9 proposal to create a medical diagnostic code for wandering.\u201d\u00a0Share your family\u2019s personal story with the CDC. The comment period closes\u00a0 April 1, 2011 . Comments can be submitted by e-mail to Donna Pickett, Co-Chair of the Coordination and Maintenance Committee, at DPickett@cdc.gov \n \nThe Autism Science Foundation,\u00a0together with other\u00a0leading autism advocacy groups, is funding the first major survey to study, quantify and categorize the experience of wandering and elopement among individuals with autism spectrum disorders through the Interactive Autism Network (IAN). The\u00a0survey is expected to be released later this month. Other funders are the Autism Research\u00a0Institute,\u00a0Autism Speaks, and the Global Autism Consortium. \n \n \n Keep Our Loved Ones Safe From Wandering-Related Injuries and Death \u00a0OVERVIEW The ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee is currently considering a proposal to create a medical diagnostic code for wandering. Please sign this petition to show your support of this effort. The National Autism Association has brought this issue to the urgent attention of our federal health agencies.  We believe a diagnostic code for wandering will help protect at-risk individuals who have a documented history of wandering and will help to avert dangerous restraint and seclusion practices that are currently in use.  Here's why: \u00a0- Physicians are largely unaware of this issue; therefore, cannot provide prevention materials or advice. A diagnostic code will increase awareness, advice and prevention-material distribution.  \u00a0- A diagnostic code will allow for data collection on the incidence of wandering, thereby increasing opportunities for prevention, education for doctors, caregivers, school administrators and staff, first responders/search personnel. - Many nonverbal ASD individuals are unable to respond to their name when called. We feel a diagnosis code will lead to increased awareness and the development of emergency search-and-rescue response protocols. - We believe a medical code will enhance schools\u2019 understanding of wandering so that children with a history of wandering will be better protected. Currently, wandering is not looked at as a medical condition, but one of choice or bad behavior. This has lead to a lack of school training, prevention and emergency response. In January alone, two children with autism went missing from their schools. - Children and adults with ASD who suddenly flee, bolt or run because of a trigger are at greater risk of restraint or seclusion. We believe a medical code will help establish safe protocols that work to eliminate triggers, thereby eliminating the need for restraint.  - We\u2019ve seen reports of parents locking/secluding children in their rooms to keep them from wandering outside. While this is anecdotal information, we believe parents, schools and other care providers need better solutions. A medical code has enormous potential to help provide safe alternatives.  - We believe every disabled individual with a history of wandering \u2014 who is at serious risk of injury, trauma or death \u2014 should have access to safety devices and prevention materials regardless of the caregiver's income. A medical code for wandering could potentially provide insurance coverage for those unable to afford critical protections for their children/adults. If you would like to submit a personal or organizational letter to the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee, please email Donna Pickett at DPickett@cdc.gov.  The deadline for submission of public comments is April 1, 2011. \u00a0PETITION LETTER I support the ICD-9-CM code for Wandering Dear Ms. Pickett I am in full support of the proposal to create a new ICD-9-CM code for wandering. This is an urgent safety issue affecting individuals with developmental disabilities including autism. I believe that in addition to significantly increasing awareness of wandering, this code will help with the development of resources for families and caregivers, safe prevention strategies and education of first responders and search personnel on the challenges associated with searching for a person with a developmental disability. Additionally, it will work towards precluding the use of harmful restraint for individuals who are at risk. Thank you for your work on this vitally important issue.

Last week, the\u00a0ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee met to discuss the future of medical coding in the United States. The ICD-9-CM stands for the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and is the US government's official system of assigning codes to medical diagnoses and procedures. The day before the meeting, the Centers for \u00a0Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posted for the first time information on the codes under consideration - including\u00a0 a new medical diagnosis \u00a0for \"wandering\" related behavior in children and adults on the autism spectrum and with other developmental disabilities.

Furthermore, this diagnosis carries no clear definition and the CDC's proposal uses poor quality research to claim that it should apply to the majority of autistic children and those with other developmental and intellectual disabilities. \n \n \n \n The CDC's last minute proposal was made public only the day before the public hearing on these coding was scheduled to occur - well after the registration for people to give public comment had closed! Our only chance to have our voices be heard is to flood the written comment session before that deadline passes on April 1st. \n \n \n \n\n\n PETITION LETTER \n \n \n Say NO to \"Wandering\" ICD-9-CM Code \n \n Hello, \n \n I'm writing as someone who cares about disability rights to ask you to reject the proposed \"wandering\" ICD-9-CM code. By medicalizing a behavior like wandering, CDC runs the risk of doing more harm than good. No research support exists to classify wandering as a medical rather than a behavioral attribute. Furthermore, the quality of the research on wandering in general is very poor. For example, CDC's proposal uses a statistic (92% of parent report that their children had wandered from a safe environment) garnered not from a high quality research study but from an online survey on the website of an advocacy group. Is this what CDC considers high quality research? In addition to the lack of evidence in support of this coding, the creation of a \"wandering\" ICD code threatens to cause real harm to individuals with disabilities and families. Labeling hundreds of thousands of children with a \"wandering\" diagnosis will increase restraint and seclusion in schools. Research shows that when schools expect that restraint will be necessary for a child as a result of a medical label, they are less likely to plan for less restrictive measures to support positive behavior and are thus more likely to subject a child to dangerous and potentially lethal restraint and seclusion. Finally, CDC's proposal will hurt the civil rights of both adults and children with disabilities. For children with significant communication challenges, attempting to exit a situation is one of the few means of communicating abuse. CDC's \"wandering\" coding would make no meaningful differentiation between these attempts at communication and other forms of wandering. Furthermore, a \"wandering\" label will lead to the increased use of guardianship on adults who have had this label applied as children, even if they are no longer exercising \"wandering\" behavior. A \"wandering\" label will also increase the use of overly restrictive residential service-provision placements, like institutions and large group homes, as a way of preventing a perceived \"flight risk\" on the part of people with disabilities. This runs counter to the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the landmark Supreme Court case Olmstead v. L.C. Thank you for taking the time to hear from the community on this important issue. We know CDC is working to improve the lives of people with disabilities and our families and thus hope that you will realize the unintended consequences of your proposal and reconsider this ill-advised coding. \n \n [Your name] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["mailto:dfp4@cdc.gov", "http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-the-cdc-no-on-abuse-enabling-wandering-code?share_source=share-petition_em&ue=sei", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "mailto:info@autisticadvocacy.org", "http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-the-cdc-no-on-abuse-enabling-wandering-code#comments", "http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-the-cdc-no-on-abuse-enabling-wandering-code#comments", "http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=sdpblmeab&et=1104820739663&s=0&e=001PZrepffIW34TRtTVl-ChChBy6UcPx6Khokku3p-ljFpKESD8D6d2yeIVtGTv0wmj75mXUXc0BVli4HvvQrJyiorcK68eIls8QP52kKLJ0fA9rX4bH5JiWPHilqLQyBPgq6HChy0YWSqnxcUdeBJJiP8syQx0QERsHcsc8c-bcnM="], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/03/no-on-wandering-code-asan.html", "title": "\nNo on Wandering Code: ASAN\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 24, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Frequently Asked Questions about CDC\u2019s\nProposed ICD-9-CM Diagnostic Code for Wandering Behavior \n \n \n \n Prepared by the Autistic Self Advocacy\nNetwork \n \n \n \n Q:\nWhat is this proposed \u201cwandering\u201d code that so many people are talking about? \n \n A: The Center on Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) has proposed the addition of a new diagnostic code to the International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)\nfor wandering behavior [1] .\nThe ICD-9-CM is the United States government\u2019s official system of assigning\ncodes to medical diagnoses and procedures.  \n \n Q:\nWhy are disability advocacy and professional organizations concerned by this\nnew proposed coding? \n \n A: Disability advocacy and professional\norganizations from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the Autistic Self\nAdvocacy Network (ASAN), The Arc, TASH, the National Association of State\nDirectors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS), the National\nDisability Rights Network (NDRN) and others, are worried about the potential\nunintended consequences that may emerge from a medical diagnostic code for\nwandering behavior. Some of the reasons for these concerns include: \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n No research exists to classify\n\u201cwandering\u201d as a medical rather than a behavioral phenomenon and the code has\nno definition that would differentiate wandering as a medical symptom from behavior\nof individuals who simply wish to move from one place to another for any number\nof reasons. \n \n \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n By turning the behavior of wandering\ninto a medical diagnosis, people with disabilities with the most significant\nchallenges in communication could be made more vulnerable. For many adults and\nchildren who cannot speak, attempting to leave a situation is one of the few\noptions available to communicate abuse, a sensorily overwhelming environment or\nboredom from repetition of the same tasks over and over. By creating a medical\ncode for wandering, \u00a0  professionals could\nmisinterpret behavior as a medical symptom and miss the legitimate concern the\nindividual is trying to communicate.. \n \n \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n A wandering code could be utilized by\nservice-providers, educators and other professionals to restrict the freedom of\npeople with disabilities, particularly those in residential service-provision\nsettings. This code could easily be used to justify the use of overly restrictive\nplacements and techniques, such as restraint and seclusion,\ninstitutionalization, restrictions on freedom of movement and chemical\nrestraint. \n \n Q:\nIsn't this code just going to help gather data? \n \n A: One of the stated objectives of this code is to\nhelp gather additional data on wandering behavior. However, that is not the\nonly purpose of this new coding. First, advocates of this proposed wandering\ndiagnostic code have stated from the beginning that part of the purpose of this\nis to shift clinical practice  as well as to get private\ninsurance to pay for tracking devices and other anti-wandering measures.\nSecond, CDC\u2019s proposal states that among the things this proposal is designed\nto promote are provider deliberations on safety. While safety discussions are\nimportant and necessary, many advocates are seriously concerned that this\nwandering code will skew those discussions to increasingly more restrictive\nservice-provision settings as \u201cpreventative measure\u201d against wandering.  \n \n Furthermore, there are other methods of gathering\ndata than creating an ICD-9-CM medical diagnostic code.. \u00a0  Questions on wandering behavior have already\nbeen added to a national health survey to be conducted by the Health Resources\nServices Administration (HRSA) as well as to an additional survey effort\norganized by private funders. This represents a much less intrusive way of\ngathering information on this phenomenon without labeling people and without\nthe potential unintended consequences associated with a medical wandering\nICD-9-CM diagnostic code. \n \n Q:\nI\u2019ve heard conflicting things about the public\u2019s opportunity to comment on this\ncoding. Some people have said that the proposal was made available months in\nadvance \u2013 others have said that the CDC only informed the public about this new\ncoding the day before the public hearing on the topic was scheduled to occur.\nWhat\u2019s true? \n \n A: While the agenda for the public hearing on new\nICD-9-CM codes was made available in February and wandering was listed as a\ntopic under the agenda, details of the proposal \u2013 including the lack of any\noperational definition of wandering and the broad language the proposed code\nutilizes \u2013 were not made available until the evening of March 8 th ,\nthe day before the March 9 th -10 th  meeting of the ICD-9-CM\nCoordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. As a result, by the time that\nadvocates had the opportunity to review the specifics of what CDC\u2019s proposal\nincluded, the public hearing had already been closed to new attendees. \n \n Q:\nWhat does the research say about wandering and the advisability of an ICD-9-CM\ncode for it? \n \n A: No research exists that suggests that wandering\nbehavior is a medical rather than a behavioral issue. Of the seven citations\nCDC uses in their proposal two are incidence studies used to establish the rate\nof intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder in the general\npopulation, four are studies used to establish that wandering occurs in the\nintellectual and developmental disability population and that deaths do\nsometimes occur at the same time that accidents occur, and one is an online\nsurvey from an advocacy group\u2019s website. None of the seven citations includes\nany information that supports looking at wandering as a medical rather than a\nbehavioral issue. \n \n Q:\nWhat about children who wander and are injured or even die, and what do the\nopponents of this new code suggest we do to help them? \n \n A: A number of options exist for addressing\nwandering behavior that results in children and adults ending up in dangerous\nsituations, without resorting to overly restrictive or even abusive practices,\nor needlessly restricting freedom of movement of people with disabilities. One\nproposal that has received support from advocates on both sides of the proposed\nICD-9-CM code would be to include children with disabilities in the AMBER Alert\nsystem, which exists to mobilize communities to respond to abducted children.\nOther options that have been proposed include additional educational and\nbehavioral supports, accessible swimming lessons, police training and other\nmeasures, which do not carry the same risks as an ICD-9-CM diagnostic coding. \n \n Q:\nWho will be making the final decisions about this coding and how can I\ncommunicate my opinions on it to them? \n \n A: The final decision on the coding proposal will be\nmade by the Director of the National Center for Health Statistics within CDC, Dr.\nEdward J. Sondik.The period for written public comment extends to April 1 st ,\n2011. Written public comment should be e-mailed to Donna Pickett at  dfp4@cdc.gov \nor sent by regular mail to the address below: \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  ATT:\nWandering ICD-9-CM Code \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  National\nCenter for Health Statistics  \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  ICD-9-CM\nCoordination and Maintenance Committee  \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  3311\nToledo Road, Room 2402  \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Hyattsville,\nMaryland 20782 \n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n [1] http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd9/TopicpacketforMarch2011_HA1.pdf \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["file:///C:/Users/kwombles/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Low/Content.IE5/GO985ZXZ/FAQ%2520on%2520Proposed%2520ICD-9-CM%2520Wandering%2520Code_FINAL_3.23.11%5b1%5d.doc#_ftn1", "", "mailto:dfp4@cdc.gov", "file:///C:/Users/kwombles/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Low/Content.IE5/GO985ZXZ/FAQ%2520on%2520Proposed%2520ICD-9-CM%2520Wandering%2520Code_FINAL_3.23.11%5b1%5d.doc#_ftnref1", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd9/TopicpacketforMarch2011_HA1.pdf"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/03/asans-faq-courtesy-of-asan-on-proposed.html", "title": "\nASAN's FAQ, courtesy of ASAN, on the Proposed ICD-9-CM Code\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "body": "\n  Crossposted on Countering yesterday (today was the walk; will be following up later) For those of us who've been on this journey with autism for awhile, it comes as no surprise that research into autism has been increasing at a rapid rate the last couple decades. It's worlds away from what was known when our family first dealt with the word autism at a personal level, and that is a good thing. It's a really messy thing, though, as there is not only an abundance of research being done (some good, some bad), there are autism sites out the wazoo for families to get information from (some good, a lot bad), and there are lots of folks promising magic cures and products that, if taken for a lifetime, promise to normalize autistic children. The best way out of the thicket of autism woo and nonsense comes through the research; we need good quality research that ever increases its scope and moves towards what therapies best help autistic individuals achieve as much independence, functionality, and adaptive coping skills as possible so that they are able to reach their potential and live the kinds of lives they want to. Research has grown from a rate where one could almost reasonably hope, with some dedication, to keep fully abreast of progress to a rate where no one, regardless of time and energy, could possibly keep up with it all. According to Amaral (2011): \nThis increased impetus for autism research comes in the midst of an ongoing process that has brought autism out of the darkness of psychiatric institutions onto the covers of major news magazines. Much of the credit for the increased research is due to the dedicated advocacy efforts of parents of children with autism throughout the world. \n Parents continue to be vocal and often ferocious about the kinds of research they want to see done, as do self-advocates. This passionate reaction to how research dollars are targeted has the community often divided into pro-Autism Speaks camps, anti-Autism Speaks camps, pro-biomed, pro-vaccine studies, pro-environment, pro-genetics camps, and undoubtedly dozens more camps that we could get riled up at and create even more divides amongst us. One of the  largest providers  of research dollars from the private sector is Autism Speaks. One of the most hotly contested autism-related organizations is, no surprise, Autism Speaks. Everyone's got an opinion on it, and it can create divides in the online community. There's no doubt that the organization pays out a lot on salaries and fundraising; there's also no doubt they spend a lot on research. There's also no doubt that some PSAs have been oh-so-bad. It's a complicated, messy organization with competing interests and mixed reception in the online autism community. I believe that it's an organization that is so large and so well-supported that it's not going away and no other grassroots organization will be able to overtake it. It's important to work with it, within it, to push for greater awareness and acceptance of autistic voices, of working to shift research dollars towards therapies that benefit people now. Some of the posts on my facebook wall, with my diverse mix of friends (many of whom are on the directory) reflect this mixed bag relating to Autism Speaks. Some hate Autism Speaks, some dislike it, some are eh about it, some support it, support the blue, support the autism awareness, support Autism Speaks completely. I respect all opinions on this matter, even those that shift, like mine has as I've become active in my community to encompass an accepting approach of diversity: diversity of neurology, diversity of opinion, diversity period. And that's why I've worked with the local walk committee to organize this year's autism walk. That's why I've worked with my college's student population to create a team, fundraise, and increase awareness and acceptance (and appreciation) of autistic individuals. These volunteers are wonderful, caring, incredible people who've worked hard to create a fun day for autism families. It's why tomorrow my family and my students (and students from the psychology courses) will be at the walk. It's why my husband and son and student volunteers (and I) were there today setting up for tomorrow (crossposting this 24 hours later; we are home from the walk). \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://iacc.hhs.gov/portfolio-analysis/2008/index.shtml", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sWPPtY1Dc8w/TZZPMZUP2eI/AAAAAAAAmIc/NsgxDUCQMJo/s1600/P4010073.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/community-over-cacophony-going-on-walk.html", "title": "\nCommunity over Cacophony: Going on a Walk\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "body": "\n \u00a0\u00a0It is that time of year again..you know..where we are supposed to be \"aware\" or \"More Aware\"..or perhaps \"spread awareness\"...Time to tweet and blog and join face book events..and generally talk to the same people you do all throughout the year. \u00a0Yes-Autism awareness month is once again upon us..It is time to take off the brown ribbon of colo-rectal awareness month(March) \u00a0and don the blue or the puzzle piece one for autism (move over colons! Autism is in town)..or the green one for IBS awareness (that's too is in April..along with Alcohol awareness(red ribbon), and sexual assault and prevention awareness(teal ribbon) and a myriad of things we ought to be aware of-each with coinciding ribbons) . What to wear what to wear.. \n \u00a0\u00a0I know without a doubt that when I walk into my\u00a0children's\u00a0school next week-there will be many puzzle piece ribbons..Well meaning individuals who are saying Look!\"I am aware- I have a ribbon! I know someone with autism!\"(Hey-just because I know people with colons-you won't catch me wearing a brown ribbon! The same goes for autism) .... I got a call from the school yesterday. It seems that Oscar was being teased. About what? I don't know. The only reason we do know about this is because one of his friends brought this to the attention of a teacher. \u00a0It was suggested that another child or children may have been making fun of Oscar's stimming. For reasons beyond ridiculous-I am not allowed to know who this child/children was/were or what exactly it is that he/she/they/they did. Only that he/she was/were firmly dealt with. No, I was told that it would be up to Oscar-(who may or may not be aware of what it is that happened) to tell me. That's right-put it on my son who has struggles with pragmatic language. \u00a0I stated that Oscar-was well aware of everything that goes on in his day-but, it might take him as much as a month to process it-and let me know. I then asked whether or not the other child/children \u00a0knew that Oscar was on the spectrum. I was told \"no.\"..I asked what the kids at school were taught about autism..I was told \"I don't know\".. So where does that leave my boy? \u00a0Is he becoming the elephant in the room? \u00a0 Oh sure, he might stim and giggle inappropriately, flap and \"eee\"-but we can't tell anyone why..can't explain any of it..no, somehow that would violate his privacy No, we'll just let him be who he is and not explain anything when\u00a0somebody\u00a0notices. Are you freaking kidding me? We can't explain that there might be a reason behind the things that he does-we'll just let other kids think he's weird. So, while we are being internationally \"aware\"-we are locally not going to\u00a0acknowledge..and instead rely on assumption-and maybe a ribbon. \u00a0 We'll just \"assume\" the other kids will figure it out? \u00a0 As my fourth grade teacher -Sister Catherine Marita always said \"Assuming makes an ass of you!\" she also said \"Your cruising for a bruising\"-but that's a post for another day.. \n \u00a0\u00a0I am sure that many will \u00a0say \"But this is why we have an awareness month!!\" \"This is why it is so important!!\"..Sure, we can talk and tweet and blog about acceptance or a cure (depending on where you stand) we can say that more research needs to be done, more supports given,\u00a0accommodations\u00a0offered..We can argue and sign petitions or not-yell about experience or inexperience and point of view and\u00a0privilege...we can take a month and wear a ribbon....until next month when the topic changes (along with the ribbon). I don't negate the need for any of these things. I'm just saying that one month and a ribbon do not convey what my kids live every day. It doesn't even come close. \n \u00a0\u00a0Oscar came home from school yesterday in a messy mood. He told me that his day had been \"all mixed up\" (*sigh* part of this is my fault-I mixed up lunch boxes-and one does NOT interfere with Oscar's snacks!!) and that he was bullied at recess. Someone wanted his attention and he didn't want to give it. Now, I have no idea if this is the \"incident\" that I was called about. (believe me, I WILL find out) But I will say this-the boy he spoke about has issues of his own. Reasons for behaving the way in which he does. It does not excuse his behavior-it does however, help to explain it. Which goes a long way towards understanding. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \u00a0\u00a0Three of my four kids are on very different places of the spectrum-with Oscar being the most affected (for lack of a better word) \u00a0Oscar knows that he is different-he is aware.. He knows that most people don't \"stim\" like him..or flap or say \"eeee\". He knows-As do the people in his life. They also know that he is caring, and kind and very very funny. What some people need to understand-is why he does some of the things he does.There is a big difference between awareness and being aware. My kids don't need a ribbon or a puzzle piece or a color-they don't need a month...they need twelve..and they need it forever. \n \u00a0\u00a0So today, I wore my pajamas( all day)-as it was a snow day and the kids were home from school. (yup-just when we thought spring had sprung-mother nature played a nasty April fools joke..I'm so not laughing) Tomorrow-I will wear whatever is clean. Because awareness isn't a color-or a month. \u00a0It is every day. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/caught-unaware-with-my-ribbons-down.html", "title": "\nCaught unaware with my ribbons down..\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 3, 2011", "body": "\n   The Social Skills Superhighway To say that 'Bot has a hard time with social skills is like saying skunks smell a little unpleasant--it just doesn't quite cover it.  Children with Aspergers Syndrome tend to see conversation as a way to relay information.  They do not generally see the point of conversation just for the sake of talking. The best analogy I can use is a long car trip.  Most of us don't mind taking the scenic route through the beautiful countryside.  We might stop and take pictures.  We will remember how lovely that drive was for years to come.  On the other hand, if he is given a choice, 'Bot will take the interstate every time.  His conversation highway is fast, straight to the point, and you only stop if you really have to pee. I've been trying to teach 'Bot some basic conversational expectations.  Right now we are working on saying goodbye before walking away from someone.  To him saying goodbye is completely pointless.  Why tell someone you are going to leave?  They can obviously see you walking away.  I chose this as a starting point because I have actually seen 'Bot walk away from another child while that child was mid-sentence.  He just turned and walked away.  As for other social skills, well, lets just say our house is one big learning experiment, and some days, those experiments go straight to hell.  Today was one of those. It started in the van on the way home from school.  'Bot heard a joke at school today.  Now, you have to understand that 'Bot doesn't get most jokes, because they usually involve a play on words, and his autistic brain doesn't process those kinds of language details.  However, his classmates thought it was funny, so he decided to share it with Princess.  Usually we are able to explain jokes to him. He still doesn't quite \"get it,\" but he does at least understand why others were laughing.  However, Princess didn't want to deal with that today.  On the other hand, 'Bot was determined to tell his joke, paying no mind to Princess's eye rolling, sighing, and ear covering.   (Social cues like facial expressions can be hard for him to decifer.)  Finally, she told him point blank to stop talking to her, he got mad, and it was on from that moment.  They fought the rest of the way home.  They fought after we got home.  Princess knows exactly which buttons to push to send 'Bot over the edge of insanity, and today he wanted to play with Tinkerbell and completely ignore her, so Princess got Tinkerbell to play with her instead of 'Bot.  I tried to get them all involved with hide and go seek together.  No dice.  'Bot chased Tinkerbell around, trying to get her to play with him instead of Princess.  Of course, he was screaming at Princess the whole time, which made Tinkerbell definitely not want to play with him.  Princess was running through the house saying, \"Come on Tinkerbell, this way!\"  Tinkerbell was running behind Princess, crying because 'Bot was chasing her.  'Bot, who didn't realize that he was scaring Tinkerbell, was furious and chasing both of them.  On the upside, Tugboat thought all of the running and screaming was hysterically funny.  Finally, as a last ditch effort to get what he wanted, 'Bot came to me and told me that Princess wouldn't let Tinkerbell play with him.  I explained to him how he should apologize to Tinkerbell so that she would play with him.  Instead, he chose to pick up a ball (a soft one filled with air) and throw it with all of his might at Princess's back.  It hit her in the back of the head.  So, now I've got three crying kids, all in their underwear (though I can't tell you why), and a laughing baby.  I'd rather have had a crying baby and three laughing big kids.  I also had parent calls to make.  Swell. I decided to talk about apologizing to Princess later, and instead I explained to 'Bot how to get Tinkerbell to play with him.  Thankfully, he followed my advice, was forgiven, and everyone settled down.  Later, I told 'Bot he'd have to write an \"I'm sorry\" or give Princess a hug.  We try to give 'Bot concrete consequences when he does something wrong.  He can't usually see connections between abstract things and his actions.  So, saying I'm sorry mean little to him, doesn't help him understand why what he did was wrong, and when he's upset, his words always sound a little mean.  Therefore, his I'm sorrys don't sound very sorry at all.  And yes, I admit that for him, hugging anyone is a consequence, and so is having to write something.  Princess had to do time out for her part in everything.  By the time it was all said and done, poor Tinkerbell decided to play by herself.  The whole thing could have been avoided if 'Bot had understood to give Princess some space this afternoon.  I realize that I can't follow 'Bot everywhere for the rest of his life.  I can't explain to his boss, his wife (if he gets married), or anyone else in his adult life why he misses social cues that are obvious to everyone else.  All I can do is pray that he finds, in adulthood, a group of interstate drivers that won't mind when he chooses not to go the long way.

I will be highlighting some of the other stories, as well as offering posts from a variety of experts, as well as offering product and book reviews, giveaways and space for you to share your opinions.   Anytime you see the Autism Awareness Month symbol you can click on it and go to the Autism Awareness month page which will archive all of the posts. In our house, Autism is kinda like those gremlins from the Family Circus cartoons - Not Me, Ida Know - you know the ones that get blamed when something goes bump, gets spilled or just isn't right.  It's sometimes hard to separate the normal 4 year old things from the things that Liam can't control because of his diagnosis.   It doesn't rear its head every day, but when it comes into play, you definitely know its there.   In our house. Autism takes some planning but doesn't change our family - We are still a never-stay-at-home family - and things are always changing at our house.  At school Liam sometimes struggles when change occurs, but since change always occurs at home, we rarely see this. In our house, Autism is like a pesky mosquito, buzzing just out of reach- we often see marked progress in Liam's stimming behaviors or his ability to make eye contact, only to lose it again on bad days that can turn into weeks. In our house, Autism is trial and error.  Liam has been on a gluten free diet for over a year and we saw some marked progress, but wonder if it was just him or the diet.  He doesn't seem to mind it though, so we continue with it.  We've also tried other supplements, but he tends to reject them, so we haven't pushed.   In our house, Autism is a super power.  Autism is part of what makes Liam who he is, a singing, dancing, crazy man who loves to obsess over trucks and cars, cuddle with his stuffed animals and sometimes his mama, and make his belly button talk when you leave his shirt off... In our house, Autism is a roller coaster - some days you're up, some days you're down and some days you just hang on for dear life and hope that the ride comes to a full and complete stop for a minute so you can catch your breath. What is Autism like at your house?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.actingbalanced.com/2011/04/aam-autism-in-our-house.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/guest-post-by-heatheractingbalancedcom.html", "title": "\nGuest Post by Heather@Actingbalanced.Com\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 4, 2011", "body": "\n Siblings as Saviours. Being the sibling of an ASD child is a tough gig I reckon. There's the meltdowns to deal with. The odd mannerisms. The lack of reciprocal play in many cases. Then there's all the attention their brother/sister gets, not just from parents, but all the professionals coming in and out of their lives. Many families are socially isolated by the difficult behaviours most ASD kids display when out and over stimulated. This adversely impacts the sibling bystanders. Many must find themselves acting as school playground bouncers in an effort to thwart bullies who often target ASD kids. Others, perhaps less robust or as a consequence of age, forced to ignore their family member's social difficulties in order to avoid teasing by proxy. My NT daughter always wanted a brother. A playmate. When we announced to her we were expecting a boy she shrugged as if to say, well of course, I knew that. When he arrived she was disappointed that he didn't do much. Except cry and demand copious amounts of attention. Eventually he became mobile and our daughter took this as a signal he would now be ready for fun and games. Of course he wasn't that interested in her, much to Ali's chagrin. But with the irrepressible spirit only a five year old can muster she persisted. She badgered, hassled, pestered. Relentlessly and ignorantly she slowly engaged Harri in play. And now at two and (just turned) six they are great mates. He loves to climb onto her bed while she tries to sleep in the mornings. Jumping all over her and giggling. She takes it well despite the odd kick to the head while he scrambles up. I know that some of Harri's improvement in this respect is due to the natural process that comes with growing older, but I don't doubt the influence his sister has had on drawing him out. In fact it has been enormous. I am so thankful for her persistence in the face of constant rejection. Her good grace in making so many allowances when he does not take turns, when he destroys her block tower, lego building, or Thomas train tracks. Her good humour and resilience have been a blessing for Harri and subsequently the whole family. It is easy to become focused on your disabled child to the point of tunnel vision. It can take a conscious effort to ensure you are spreading your attention widely enough so other children do not feel forgotten. I have not bothered as yet to discuss Harri's diagnosis with Ali. I would not expect her at six to comprehend such a complex disorder. But more importantly I don't think it would matter to her. He is her lovely, quirky, little brother. The brother she waited for and is finally enjoying. Seeing the loving bond they share eases my anxiety about Harri's life after his father and I have shuffled off our mortal coil. I am coming to believe more each day that although early therapeutic intervention is essential to maximise a positive outcome for ASD kids. A loving family with happy siblings (NT or otherwise) is a poweful therapeutic tool in itself. So thanks and kudos to all those brothers and sisters living with an Autistic sibling. You are remarkable healers.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/2010/12/siblings-as-saviours.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/guest-post-by-sharon-siblings-as.html", "title": "\nGuest Post by Sharon: Siblings as Saviours.\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 4, 2011", "body": "\nEmpowering Our Kids\nby Trish @  Another Piece of the Puzzle\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0Earlier this year, I had the immense honor of sitting in the audience at a local school board meeting (not my own district) while a young man who is a junior in one of their high schools addressed the board regarding the lack of accommodations being provided so that he can be a successful learner and meet his goal of being an independently employed individual after high school.\n\nI have tears in my eyes just writing that sentence.  \n\nMike C. is one of my heroes.  He is an extremely bright young man who has Asperger's Syndrome, is legally blind and has some other health issues.  Although he is an honor roll student, he was not at school from Thanksgiving until mid-February after his doctor recommended that he receive homebound instruction until the proper accommodations were provided for him. \n \n\u00a0Here is what Mike is asking for: \nText-to-speech software and instruction on how to use it \nA computer with a larger screen \nTexts provided in audio format \nClass lectures, including discussion, to be taped for him \n \nIt was amazing to see how composed he was during his speech and to hear how clearly he articulated what he needs and why he needs it.  And he got a standing ovation from the many people who turned out in support of him from his district and beyond. \n \n\u00a0I have embedded the video from one of our local news stations about it.  I don't know if the clips and stories rotate or how long this video will be available, but it came from the CBS21 website:\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0I took my son Michael with me and explained that we were going to show our support for Mike.  Michael was very upset that the school was not giving Mike what he needed and was extremely well-behaved during the meeting, for which I was very thankful.\n\nThe next morning, we had a two-hour school delay due to snow, and Michael was upset about something that he was afraid would not happen because of the shortened day.  I asked him if he wanted me to email his teacher about it and he did.  As I opened up a new email window, I realized that it's never to early to start teaching the kind of self-advocacy Mike's mom had taught him, so I had Michael dictate what he wanted to ask his teacher and then sent the email from him.\n\nI think it was a good start, and I can only hope that one day my own son will be as confidently able to express his needs and goals as clearly as Mike did last night.\n\nUpdate on Mike C:  After some continued back and forth with the school district and a facilitated IEP meeting moderated by a representative from the Office of Dispute Resolution, Mike has returned to school with the following assurances - class lectures will be taped, there will be a \"timely\" assistive technology assessment, a larger screen will be provided in the interim, appropriate physical education will be discussed and proper modifications will be made for classes missed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://anotherpieceofthepuzzle.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/empowering-our-kids-by-trish-another.html", "title": "\nEmpowering Our Kids by Trish @ Another Piece of the Puzzle\n"},

For this reason, I want to share this particular experience... \n \nI had seen Jenny Mcarthy and Holly Robinson Pete on television and various magazines, talking about their Autistic children. I was impressed with the amount of research they each had done on the disability and I\u00a0began thinking that maybe I should educate myself more on the subject. \n \nSomewhere along the line, I came across material that talked about people with Autism having vitamin deficiencies. I searched it out and found a\u00a0pharmacy on the Internet that would custom make vitamins according to\u00a0a particular ailment or disability. I ordered the vitamins and gave them to\u00a0my son\u00a0every morning. \n \nA few weeks later, he had a seizure; then a few weeks later, another. My family and I tried to figure out why this was happening. He hadn't had a seizure for years!\u00a0All we could think of that he was doing differently\u00a0 was \u00a0taking the vitamins. Immediately we stopped; then we\u00a0did some more research.\u00a0We learned\u00a0that a particular vitamin in the multi capsule we were giving him would make\u00a0the drug that he was taking for seizure control ineffective. \n \nI wish to make other parents aware that this could be a problem for them as well.\u00a0Please\u00a0seek advice from your child's physician before you give\u00a0him/her\u00a0something that sounds even as harmless as a vitamin. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.snippetsnstuff.com/2010/06/autism-and-vitamins.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/guest-post-deann-from-snippets-n-stuff.html", "title": "\nGuest Post DeeAnn from Snippets 'N Stuff\n"},

They have engaged in 448 incidents of restraint in the first two and a half months of the year. A comparable school has engaged in 11 during the same time period. \n \n The restraint shown in the video appears to be  this restraint : Ultimate Restraint System. \n \n \n Go back to the video. The restraint is demonstrated incorrectly. The person should go face up. Note that the grown woman is too small for the restraint. Note the potential for\u00a0suffocation. However, the school is putting them in FACE DOWN; the news story notes that: \" These are padded mats with a stiff board inside. Students are immobilized while standing up, then laid facedown on the device. Thick flaps are placed over their shoulders, midsection and legs to hold them in place.\" \n \n Now, back to the story: \n \n \n \n \u00a0\"Several times this year, students at Magnolia were held in these devices  more than two hours . Magnolia staff said they follow a strict protocol, bringing in a nurse after 15 minutes to watch the student's breathing and focusing a fan on the child's upper body. If the child is restrained for more than an hour, an administrator must sign off on it.\" \n \n \n \n Again, there's no justification for this. And the fact that they are using the device wrong, may be using it on children too small for it, and are using it for hours ought to give reasonable people pause. Especially given that a similar school in the district somehow manages to deal with the issues in a different way that does not involve restraint. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-restraint-students-schools-sidebar20110409,0,5060035.story", "http://www.pxdirect.com/fullbodyrestraint.htm"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/update-on-restraint-video.html", "title": "\nUpdate on Restraint Video\n"},

It's a great launching point for more serious discussions. \n \nKathleen Leopold and I were able to put together some questions for Todd Drezner, director of\u00a0 Loving Lampposts . \n \nKim:\u00a0In my review, I noted that you had avoided the harshest landscapes of the autism world while still surveying a wide swath of it. In your director\u2019s statement, you write \u201cI've met parents of severely autistic children whose patience, acceptance, and support of their kids are truly inspiring.\u201d Did you meet parents who didn\u2019t accept, who weren\u2019t coping well? Were there families that you met and interviewed that didn\u2019t make it into the documentary? You also write that you \u201ccan't help but be optimistic\u201d at the end of making the documentary; I think that many watching the documentary will feel that way, as well, but that those families whose situations are grim, who are struggling to help children who are severely impaired with multiple co-morbid conditions, who reject the concept of neurodiversity (because they define it differently), will reject the documentary and the optimism. What would you say to those families and individuals? What do you think the autism community and the larger community could do to help these families? Todd: It's true that the film does not show any autistic person engaging in harmful or self-injurious behaviors. There are a couple of reasons for this. Partially, it's because I didn't happen to film anyone who engaged in those behaviors. This wasn't a choice; it just worked out that way (although there are a couple of families who I filmed who didn't make it into the movie, it had nothing to do with the severity of their children or their lack of acceptance of autism). But perhaps a more important reason is that I felt that that kind of behavior has been shown too much in recent portrayals of autism. I started my film in 2007, shortly after \"Autism Every Day\" came out. I have a lot of problems with that film and with other portrayals of autism that suggest it is always and only horrible. As someone says in my film, \"The scales have been tipped too far in the direction of misery.\" I think the wider world needed to see a different view of autism. That being said, I think it's not entirely accurate to say that \"Loving Lampposts\" doesn't address issues of importance to severely autistic children or their families. I'm thinking particularly of the interview with Ralph James Savarese, who specifically says that advocates of neurodiversity need to do a better job of reaching out to parents of children who \"bang their heads against the wall and punch holes in the wall 40 times a year.\" Although he's not a child, I also think about 60 year old Lyndon and his mother Lila. Here is someone who didn't speak until he was ten years old, who grew up in the 50s and 60s when autism was unknown, and who was recommended for institutionalization. In other words, a fairly \"severe\" case. Although I don't say this explicitly in the movie, the issues that Lila has been dealing with for years--how to give Lyndon as much independence as possible, how to provide him with the support he needs--are the same issues that parents of severely autistic children will face as their children get older. The fact that Lyndon is doing relatively well now doesn't make his and Lila's challenges any less relevant to parents who are struggling with severely autistic children today. Then, too, there is a problem of definition: what exactly do we mean by severely autistic? A viewer of my film might look at, for example, Charlie Fisher and see a minimally verbal child with limited reading and writing ability and occasional \"challenging behaviors\" and think of him as severely autistic (he was probably one of the people I had in mind when I wrote my director's statement). And if we don't think of him that way, then why not? Because Kristina Chew doesn't refer to him that way? Because Kristina and Jim are fairly happy? Or for some other reason? Whatever the answer, it's clear that like autism itself, \"severe autism\" is not easily defined and is largely subjective. It's also important to note that no one's place on the autism spectrum is static. The film spends a bit of time on this point when I talk about \"high functioning\" and \"low functioning,\" but it's worth bringing up here as well. Autistic people, like anyone else, can have a bad day, week, month, or year. A child who is engaging in harmful or self-injurious behaviors today may not always be doing so. A family that's feeling very grim about its situation may feel better about it a year from now (and vice versa). To try to sum up, neurodiversity is not a philosophy that only applies to optimistic people whose autistic children are \"doing well.\" It's an approach to thinking about autism that is as relevant to a parent of a severely autistic child as to a parent of a child with Asperger's. I hope that families whose situations are grim and whose children are impaired with multiple co-morbid conditions are able to get their children help for those conditions. But if and when those conditions improve, those families will still have autistic children. How will they think about autism? I think neurodiversity offers the best approach. Kim: How long has the documentary been complete and what have you learned in that intervening time that you wish you had been able to show in your documentary? Todd: I finished filming in the first part of 2009 and finished the final edit in April of 2010. We've certainly seen some more developments on the vaccine front and the Andrew Wakefield saga since then, although I'm not sure how much of that I would have put in the film. One point that comes up in this weekend's NY Times Magazine story about Wakefield is that there is some research that shows that autistic people may have more gastrointestinal problems than other people. However, doctors have been reluctant to address parents' concerns about this because \"doctors associated those concerns with quackery and vaccine fears and the false hope that a diet could cure the autism itself.\" I think I would have put a point like this into my film because it shows how our obsession with cures is actually setting back scientific research that could help alleviate medical problems that autistic children are more likely to have. Kim: What surprised you most as you made the documentary and met autistic individuals and their family members? Todd: We all hear a lot about the great variety of the autism spectrum, but it's something else to see it. What was always the most interesting was to meet a new autistic person and find out what was unique to him or her. At the same time, as different as they all are from each other, I could usually find a trait or two that they had in common with each other and/or with my son. One of the great benefits of making the film (and I hope of watching it) was to understand that I'm not alone. And neither is Sam. He has a community, and we will be raising him to take his place in it. Kim: Is there anyone you wanted to interview for your documentary who you didn\u2019t get? Do you hope to do a sequel in the future? Todd: I was very lucky that just about everyone I approached agreed to be in the film. As for a sequel, autism is obviously going to be a lifelong interest of mine, and I would never say never. But from a filmmaking point of view, I think I need to try something different, and so I think my next film or two will be about other topics.\u00a0 Kim: Who do you hope to reach primarily with this documentary: members of the autism community or the wider world? Todd: Well, yes. Both. More and more, people from the wider world will be meeting autistic people, and I hope that they will not view autism only as a terrible tragedy. And of course, some people from the wider world will eventually become part of the autism community. I hope my film might be helpful to parents or other family members who've just gotten a new diagnosis for a child or even to potential parents who are worried about autism. I think many people in our society could benefit from thinking in new ways about autism. Kathleen:\u00a0What inspired you to make this documentary? What made you do this now, while he was still so young? Todd: Partially, it was because I had edited other documentaries and was looking to make one of my own. This topic was on my mind, and my son's obsession with lampposts seemed like a good way into asking some central questions about autism. Although there are many great documentaries about individual autistic people, I thought there was room for one that looked at how the culture thinks about autism at a time when it's more well-known than ever before. As for why I made it when Sam was so young, doesn't every parent of a newly diagnosed child have a fantasy of talking to everyone else who's ever dealt with or thought about autism? I actually got to live out the fantasy, and making the film was part of the process of coming to terms with Sam's diagnosis. It's not like I was expert in all of these topics when I started. I may not be an expert now, but I can bring what I learned to my parenting of Sam, and if I hadn't made the film, I might be parenting him from a much more scared or confused place. Kathleen: Has your son seen it, and if he has, what does your son think of it? Did he like it? Did you explain to him what and why you were doing this? Todd: He's seen some of the parts that he's in and especially likes watching himself at the lampposts. But the central questions of the film and my reasons for making it are over his head right now, as they would be for any kid his age. I plan to show it to him when he's old enough to follow it, and I'll be very curious to hear his opinion about it. Kathleen: What audience did you make this film for? What are you hoping to accomplish with this film? Todd: I think I covered this one in the earlier question about who I hope to reach with the film. Kim: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to share about this film, any concluding thoughts you\u2019d like to offer? Todd: No, I think we've covered a lot of ground. Thanks for the thought provoking questions. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lovinglamppostsmovie.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-drezner/learning-to-embrace-autism_b_842083.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-drezner/living-autistic_b_844740.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-drezner/autism-the-most-popular-d_b_848332.html", "http://http//autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/let-there-be-light-todd-drezners-loving.html", "title": "\nLet There Be Light: Todd Drezner's Loving Lampposts, A Contrast to MacNeil's Autism Now\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2011", "body": "\n\u00a0 On April 14, I wrote\u00a0 an article \u00a0about the improper demonstration of a full-body restraint system being used in a Florida public school on disabled children. I followed up this article with a series of emails to\u00a0 Gillen Industries , who manufactures the restraint device to the school principal and to the Associate Superintendent of Exceptional Student Education for Orange County Public Schools, and to the bureau chief for\u00a0 Exceptional Education \u00a0& Student Services .\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLast year Florida passed a law regarding restraint and seclusion of disabled students, and parents ought to be concerned, especially if the number of restraints that Orange County has engaged in this year, are indicative of the concern for the rights of their most vulnerable charges. According to the\u00a0 Orlando Sentinel , students in Orange county were restrained \u201c1,910 times this school year \u2014 representing nearly a quarter of the 8,222 cases in Florida. No school district employed the method nearly as much as Orange, where some students were restrained repeatedly, according to new data from the Florida Department of Education.\u201d \n \n \nLeslie Postal and Lauren Roth, the reporters of the\u00a0 Orlando Sentinel piece \u00a0on Orange County restraints, quote Ross Green: \n \n\u201c\u2018That's proof that what we're doing isn't working,\u2019 said Ross Greene, a psychiatry professor at\u00a0 Harvard Medical School . \nAn expert on child behavior, Greene works to reduce restraint at schools and residential programs. \n\u2018Restraints are inappropriate 99.9 percent of the time they are used,\u2019 he said.\" \n \n \n \nThe piece also contains the assistant principal demonstrating how to use the \u201cwrap mat\u201d restraint. Not only is the restraint used incorrectly, with the person placed face down rather than face up, the assistant principal has engaged in a euphemism, renaming the\u00a0 \u201cUltimate Restraint \u201d system the much more friendly sounding \u201cwrap mat.\u201d \n \nAccording to Gillen Industries and PXDirect, the restraint system is available in three sizes, of which the smallest will fit individuals 4\u20198\u201d and over. Readers will no doubt find tremendous comfort in Gillen\u2019s pride in the fact that this restraint system \u201cCan be cleaned easily for quick turn around service.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n Sheriffs.org \u00a0provides information on this restraint and notes that it is for use with \"combative/violent psychiatric patients\"\u00a0in psychiatric hospitals on the East Coast. Is this really an appropriate device for disabled students to\u00a0 spend hours in ?: \u201cSeveral times this year, students at Magnolia were held in these devices more than two hours.\u201d \n \n \n \n \nBelow is my email to the principal, W. Thomas Oldroyd: \n \n \n \nI have several questions regarding your school's use of the restraint device as demonstrated by your assistant principal in a news video. \n \n \nI believe that this is the restraint device showed in the video\u00a0 http://www.orlandosentinel.com/videobeta/?watchId=6903ee18-7a19-4141-a86b-ee0cda354905 : \n \n \n http://www.pxdirect.com/fullbodyrestraint.htm \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0That's a grown woman being shown to the mat, but she's too small for it. In addition, the woman is placed\u00a0face down into the mat, which would put the individual at risk for suffication. Is this how the mat is being used? It's not how it's intended to be used. \n \n \n \nWhat ages are the\u00a0students at risk\u00a0of being placed in this particular restraint and what particular safeguards are being used? \n \n \n\u00a0If the assistant prinicipal can't even demonstrate it correctly, what is the training of the individuals who place students in this? \n \n \nWhat level of supervision is used while the student is in the restraint device? How long is a student left in the device? \n \n \nWhat behaviors merit the device? Who makes the decision on when to use the restraint and what level of accountability is in place to protect students from unnecessary restraint? \n \n \nAt what point are parents informed that their child is in restraint? \n \n \nThank you for answering the questions. I appreciate it. \n \n \nKim Wombles \nConcerned parent and educator \n \n \n \n \n \nI then followed up my letter to the principal with a letter to Dr. Anna Diaz, the Associate Superintendent of Exceptional Student Education for Orange County Public Schools: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. Diaz, \n \n \nI am a mother of three on the spectrum, an educator, and am active in advocacy for the disabled, mostly through the use of scholarly\u00a0 pieces\u00a0 on Science 2.0 and on the\u00a0 Autism Blogs Directory , and a personal blog,\u00a0 Countering . My writing partner and I have been examining the Orlando Sentinal video of Assistant Principal Denise Calio demonstrating the use of the ultimate restraint system, and I am currently working on a piece for Science 2.0 on the use (and misuse) of restraints in Magnolia School. \n \n \nI am including below the email I sent the principal of Magnolia School. I have not heard back from him. \n \n \nI would appreciate answers to the questions I pose below to the principal, as well the following: \n \n \nHow many children under the height of 4'8\" have been put in the ultimate restraint system? The restraint shown appears to be adult sized and was too large for the woman put in. \n \n \nHave they been put in face down? That's the incorrect positioning. \n \n \nWhat behaviors lead to the use of this restraint and what is the longest someone has been in it? \n \n \nWhy do you wait 15 minutes before summoning a nurse to monitor the student? \n \n \nWhat accountability are faculty and staff held to to justify the use of this restraint? \n \n \nHow do you account for the high number of restraints in this particular school and what are you doing to decrease the number? \n \n \nHas any staff or faculty member been disciplined for using the restraint for times where it was not\u00a0justified (let me tell you, if the assistant principal is deciding, since she couldn't demonstrate the device right, I'd be concerned about her ability to decide when it's appropriate. After all, she thinks they \"can practice their relaxation techniques\" in there). \n \n \nBelow is my email to the prinicipal.\u00a0I appreciate your timely response to this matter. (The above email to the principal was included). \n \nIn response to my questions, sent both to W. Thomas Oldroyd, the Principal of Magnolia School, and to Dr. Anna Diaz, the Associate Superintendent of Exceptional Student Education for Orange County Public Schools, I received the following statement from Principal Oldroyd. Readers will note that none of my questions were really answered. \n \n \n \n\u201cMagnolia School Restraint \nMagnolia School is a Special Day School.\u00a0 The educational needs of students that attend Magnolia are extensive.\u00a0\u00a0 Some students that attend Magnolia have Behavior Intervention Plans. Behavior Intervention Plans are developed during an Individual Education Plan meeting with parents or guardians. \nThe intent of the video was to educate the public regarding the use of mechanical restraint as a safety intervention. It is used only as a last resort during times of crisis (continuous self injury or continuous physical aggression.) The mat in the video is one of several sizes made for Magnolia School and is used in accordance with the manufacturers guidelines. \nSafeguards are put in place when implementing manual restraint or seclusion.\u00a0 Safeguards include trained classroom staff in the use of restraint, behavior specialists/analysts, administrators, and experienced nurses. Data is collected and reported on the same day to parents and guardians via email and in writing as well as the Department of Education.\u201d \n \n \nAfter receiving this statement, I sent the following email to the bureau chief; the questions and answers are provided below. \n \nBelow are the questions posed to the bureau chief of\u00a0 Exceptional Education \u00a0& Student Services \u00a0 and the answers I received today. \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm writing a follow-up article to the article ; http://www.science20.com/ countering_tackling_woo_and_ science_asds/absolutely_no_ justification_use_restraints_ florida_school-78130 ,\u00a0I wrote about the improper demonstration of a full-body restraint system at Magnolia School in Orange County.

He sells the ultimate restraint for face-up use, but acknowledges that institutions may and do use the restraint face-down with violent clients to protect the staff and the client from the client's aggression. He does not make the ultimate restraint smaller than the 4'8\" size, but notes that the wraps are meshed nylon and that the top restraint does not have to be fastened. \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter nearly two weeks of looking into this story and trying to find satisfactory answers that the device, when used, is being used correctly, I am left with no assurance that this is the case. The school system did not respond to my specific questions and the vague promise that guidelines are being followed is a cold comfort in light of the video demonstration that the school system had to know would be scrutinized. If they can\u2019t acknowledge that they did nothing short of screw the pooch with that demonstration, then why should parents feel confident that when they do decide restraint is appropriate that their child is placed in the device properly and that appropriately supervised. \n \n \n \nIf the video demonstration is indeed how they\u2019re using the device, then every parent of a child at Magnolia School should be seriously concerned about their child\u2019s safety. With no consistent guidelines, no statewide supervision of the types of restraints purchased and the training provided, there's a definite problem of oversight and accountability. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.science20.com/countering_tackling_woo_and_science_asds/absolutely_no_justification_use_restraints_florida_school-78130", "http://www.gillenindustries.com/ultimate.html", "http://www.fldoe.org/ese/", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-restraint-students-schools-20110409,0,1899531,full.story", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/topic/health/medical-research/harvard-medical-school-OREDU0000185.topic", "http://www.gillenindustries.com/ultimate.html", "http://www.sheriffs.org/userfiles/file/Deputy%20Archives/2011%20Issue%201/DCO_01_11_Weaver_Mental%20Illness_education.pdf", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-restraint-students-schools-sidebar20110409,0,5060035.story", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/videobeta/?watchId=6903ee18-7a19-4141-a86b-ee0cda354905", "http://www.pxdirect.com/fullbodyrestraint.htm", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Py-pmuefLMQ/TbW3LigAdHI/AAAAAAAArSw/V4_2mt3ptpo/s1600/PXDirect+-+Full+Body+Restraint+System+-+Google+Chrome+4252011+124339+PM.jpg", "http://www.science20.com/science_autism_spectrum_disorders", "http://countering%2Cus/", "http://www.fldoe.org/ese/", "http://www.science20.com/countering_tackling_woo_and_science_asds/absolutely_no_justification_use_restraints_florida_school-78130", "tel:407%2F317-3229"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/04/when-restraint-abuse-warrants-little.html", "title": "\nWhen Restraint Abuse Warrants Little Concern And Less Attention: Is Florida Paying Any Attention?\n"},

Below are\ntestimonials from a few of parents able to speak up about what has happened to\ntheir children and a few who have shared anonymously.  \n \n \n Restraint\nand seclusion\u00a0should no longer be viewed as treatment options but rather\nas treatment failures because they risk lives, escalate behaviors\u00a0and\ninflict emotional and physical trauma. \n\n\n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Brevard County  \n \n 2006  \n \n I\nsaw that you requested families to respond who have difficulties with restraint\nand safety issues regarding their child in ESE. I have a 13-year-old son with\nDown syndrome who is staffed into a TMH class with one teacher and one\nassistant. The program was very inappropriate for him (or for TMH students in\ngeneral) and he became a behavior problem in the fall. In addition, there were\nsafety issues for him (elopement) and for the students and teachers (he threw\nclassroom items). Now the school wants me to sign a release to allow CPI\n(Crisis Prevention Intervention), which, I understand is physical restraint. I\nhave many concerns about this, and how it will be used.  \n \n I\nam in Brevard County, Florida.  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Broward County  \n \n 3/2010 \n \n \n \n My name is Lavanda Sxxxxxx and I\nlive in Broward County.\u00a0 On March 17 2010, my son Decarlo age 13\u00a0was\nphysically restrained at Sawgrass Middle school, by the\u00a0security guard\n(Mr. Cxx). \n \nDeCarlo was\u00a0put in a chock hold position, pushed face down on the\nfloor\u00a0and kneed in his back. I was not notified by the school until the\nend of the day\u00a0at around 4:12 pm.\u00a0This incident happened about\n12:30pm. As a parent\u00a0I should have been contacted sooner. The Principal of\nthe school\u00a0  \n \n Mrs.Dxxxxxx called and said that\nDecarlo had to be physically restrained and basically said that it was\nDecarlo's fault. \n \nMy son said that he couldn't breathe properly and that Mr.Wxxxx, the In house\nsuspension teacher\u00a0also made the comment that this action was not called\nfor. I called the\u00a0Coral Springs\u00a0police department\u00a0and an officer\nwas sent to my house to take a statement. I also took my son to the doctor who\nstated that\u00a0his bruises\u00a0were quite visible.\u00a0My son is now\ncomplaining of mid back pain.\u00a0 I have never experienced\u00a0anything like\nthis before\u00a0and I\u00a0don't have any\u00a0problems at home with my\nson.\u00a0 If these problems are only\u00a0occurring at school, I\u00a0would\nlike to know the reason?\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I don't think this should have\nhappened! My son was put at risk. Decarlo said he asked Mr. Cxxx \"what\ndid\u00a0I do?\", But didn't get an answer.\u00a0 Mr.Wxxx,\nthe\u00a0school's guidance counselor\u00a0came over and asked Decarlo if he was\nok\u00a0and patted him on the back.\u00a0MR. Wxxxx also assured DeCarlo\nthat\u00a0he will get to the bottom of the matter. \n \nDecarlo also said that Mrs.Dxxxxxx called him in her offices and\u00a0told him\nthat this was his fault.

She was trying to convince\u00a0me to put PCM on my\u00a0son\u2019s\u00a0behavior\nplan. She told me that PCM\u00a0is a treatment\u00a0that benefits\u00a0children\nwith Autism.\u00a0She told me that she has always used prone restraint with\nchildren and how it was so effective in \"changing autistic behavior\" \n \n The school is \"pushing\" me\nto add\u00a0PCM on his behavior plan\u00a0I have refused to put PCM on his\nbehavior plan.

During his first\nyear in a public high school in Broward my son was victim of abuse when his\naide tried to physically restrain my son to avoid him to get a snack from a\nsnack machine. The first time we realized it was when my son came home with scratches\naround his neck, we immediately reported it to the ESE specialist and she\ninformed us that this aide will be retrained since he had a good performance at\nschool. Then five months later, there was an incident at the school with the\nsame aide who tried to physical restrain my son in the middle of the Science\nclass by pushing him against a desk and squeezing my son\u2019s mouth to make him\nnot to complaint about it. We submitted a formal complaint to the school\nadministration and they opened an investigation. The school administration\nremoved this aide from working with my son immediately and a week later this\naide was transfer to another school. Three weeks after, the school\nAdministration concluded and informed us that there was nobody who could say that\nthe aide put his hands on my son to hurt him intentionally. We collected a\nwritten statement from a student that was present in the Science class when the\naide was physically abusing and embarrassing my son in front of the class and\nhis teacher. We presented this student\u2019s statement to the school investigator\nbut he says that the case was close already and there was nothing we could do\nabout it. My son had a spine fusion surgery to correct 80% scoliosis that was\ndone in 2008. He has a double rack along his spine. A written note from the\northopedic doctor was included in my son\u2019s IEP and PBIP at beginning of the\nschool year explaining that he could not be physically restrained due to this\nsurgery, but the school staff never followed that instruction. \n \n \n \n Finally,\nat the same school, on June 2009, my son was taking a test and he got\nfrustrated since the ESE specialist did not accommodate his test as it was\nagreed. The ESE specialist denied the accommodation and my son got frustrated\nand started crying and complaining about it. The ESE staff called security and\nthe resource police officer. Our private Behavior specialist was present at\nthat time and tried to explain them that my son just needed a waiting time, \n that he\nwas not a threaten for himself or others since he was just on crying the floor.\nThe resource officer did not give my son a waiting time and ordered a Backer\nAct on my son since he already had the instructions to conduct this procedure. \u00a0  Finally, my son was taken to a hospital and was\nreleased two hours later since according to the doctor\u2019s report there was not\ncriteria to Baker Act on my son. This was a very traumatic experience for him\nand us.  \n \n \n \n Broward County,\n2008 \u2013 Public Middle School \n \n \n \n In March 2008, my  Prader Willi Syndrome  son had a  spine fusion surgery to\ncorrect 80% scoliosis. He has a double rack along his spine. Twenty five days\nafter his surgery was done he returned to the school. The same week my son\nreturned to the school there was an incident since the school had hired a new staff\nthat had not been trained about my son\u2019s needs. The aide was supposed to put\naway my son\u2019s lunch bag, but instead the aide gave it to my son. Being my son a\nPrader Willi Syndrome kid (eating disorder), he should not be in food\npossession. The school Principal personally decided to remove the lunch bag\nfrom my son. Thus, my son started to follow the Principal asking to get back\nhis lunch bag. However, the Principal never followed the instructions\ndocumented in the IEP and PBIP for food possession, instead the Principal\npushed my son against the wall to get him out of his way. This Principal made\nbruises in my son\u2019s chest and caused severe pain in his back, which was only\nfew days apart from surgery. The Principal never attended any IEP meetings and\ndid not have the proper training about my son\u2019s especial needs. That year we\nexperienced a lot of incidents due to the Principal\u2019s power struggle issues. \n \n \n \n A\nwritten note from the orthopedic doctor was included in my son\u2019s IEP and PBIP\nexplaining that he could not be physically restrained due to this surgery, but\nthe school staff, including the Principal of the school never followed the\nmedical instructions. \n \n \n \n Maria  \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Broward County  \n \n 2009 \n \n The following paragraphs review the\nchallenges experienced by my son in the Broward County School System. My son is\nimpacted upon by Autism Spectrum Disorder. In a classroom setting supposedly\ndesigned for children experiencing emotional, mental and behavioral challenges\nthe last thing I expected as a parent was to encounter a home room teacher displaying\nphysically and physiologically abusive behavior. My son who is just five years\nold was subjected shouting and insultive verbal statements by his home room\nteacher. A highly trained and credible Child/Parent advocate source was able to\nvalidate several episodes of this conduct from the teacher. Unfortunately the\nabusive conduct went even further. It included restraining my child who is at\nrisk for seizures due to a neurological condition for more than 20 minutes in a\nchair with straps. \n \n \n \n If not for the diligent and\ncompassionate work of a parent/child advocate the objective documentation of my\nson's victimization would not be investigated on a serious level. The intensity\nand duration of these traumatic activities by the home room teacher, have had\nserious emotional trauma on my dear son. He displayed more oppositional conduct\nin the home environment. These behaviors included spitting at adults without\nprovocation, throwing heavy objects in an arbitrary fashion, scratching and\nbiting. The school's special needs team actually had the audacity to state that\nmy child enjoyed being seated in the restraint chair. \n \n \n \n Father\u00a0of 5 year old child with\nAutism \u00a0\u00a0  Broward County, FL \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Broward County  \n \n 2009  \n \n To\nwhom it may concern: This morning Wednesday March 3, 2009, I dropped of my 5\nyear old son at school with an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. My son\nhas Autism and has very limited language and due to his limited language, he\nhas behavioral issues. I feel uneasy because the other day after speaking to\nthe Autism Coach, I found out that one of the strategies used to\n\"control\" my son when he is \"out of control\" is to put him\nin a seclusion room. YES! A room where he is by himself until he calms down. I\nwas in shock because I was not aware of this and had no idea that a room was\nbeing used. This treatment is not appropriate for ANY child. This only worsens\ntheir behavior and makes them not want to go to school. Please, help all the\nfamilies that have children with Autism or Other Health Impairments who are\nbeing put in Seclusion Rooms or Restraint. This needs to stop.

Some time ago, I had donated Items to my\nson\u2019s class and was invited to stay for coffee. While there, I was shocked to\nsee a child, who looked to be about eleven, being wrestled to the ground. He\ncame to the room with an aide to collect something from her purse. She stopped\nto chat for a minute and then told the child to leave. He had wandered over to\nan activity and did not respond. When he did not attempt to leave, the aide\nbegan dragging him from the room. The boy began flapping and screeching when\nanother staff member came over and pulled him into an open space. He started\nkicking at the staff person who was holding him at arm\u2019s length. Both women\ntackled him to the floor and one of them pulled his arms behind his back and\nsat on him. She had to have weighed 160 lbs. the child screamed out in pain and\nstarted to cry. When his cries turned to sobs, the woman got up and pulled him\nup from behind by the arms causing the boy to cry out again. With his arms\npulled up and back in what I could only imagine was a very painful position,\nthe boy was removed from the room. The situation was completely avoidable and\neven after the child ignored the request to leave the room, did not warrant the\nactions of the staff.  \n \n \n \n Kathy\n \u00a0\u00a0 Broward County, FL  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Charlotte County  \n \n 2008  \n \n I\nlive in Charlotte County but also help parents in neighboring counties.

I\npersonally witnessed an aide hurting a child on one occasion, as did another\nmom on a separate occasion (a different child). All of the parents in the room\ndemanded an investigation, which the district did. The aide was removed but to\nthis day works in another classroom, as the case was disputed by the aide and\nso was dropped. Another teacher in Charlotte moved on while being investigated\nand went to DeSoto schools, was let go from there and went on to abuse two\nchildren in Lee County Schools and is under investigation to this day. These\npeople move on and our kids continue to be victims. There is a teacher in\nSarasota County under investigation right now for abusing the severely disabled\nchildren in her class.

He entered kindergarten and shortly thereafter, he was initially\ndiagnosed with ADHD and ODD. He displayed many traits on the spectrum; however,\nhe was not diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome until March 2008. The overuse of\nmanual restraints and CSI was very apparent in the first grade. The use of any\nrestraining methods on an already aggressive child only increases the\naggression. He was also sent to ISS on several occasions. At the time, my son\nwas not very verbal and was not able to express himself. He still remembers the\nteacher and aide who restrained him. It was not until a few years later that he\nwas able to tell us what he went through and the pain he endured. Our son was\naccepted at a magnet school for second grade. I met with the principal to\ndiscuss our son and if this would be a good fit. I also told his teachers and\naide that his last school consistently used manual restraining methods, which\nescalated his behaviors. They never used any types of restraining methods on my\nson and he had a very good year. Unfortunately, this year has been more\nconsistent with what he endured in first grade. My child has been manually\nrestrained multiple times (without my knowledge) and put in ISS for his\nbehaviors related to his disorder. As parents, we need to advocate for our\nchildren and help educate the schools to find more suitable ways of dealing\nwith aggressive behaviors. Manual restraints, CSI, time out rooms, etc. are not\nappropriate consequences for our children. More and more children are being\ndiagnosed with disorders that incorporate \"not so typical\" behaviors.\nInstead of punishing these children, the schools should be trained in how to\ndeal with our children and provide them with a safe learning environment. You\ncannot control aggression with aggression. Children who experience these types\nof interventions are scarred. They do not forget the pain they endured. My son\nwould flinch when someone approached him from behind for a very long time. This\nis abuse and it needs to stop.  \n \n \n \n Debbie\n \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Hillsborough County\u00a0 \n \n 2009 \u00a0 \n \n I reported the Restraint to DCF,\nsecondary to bruises on my son's calves.

This is why I was very hesitant to make a report, and did so\nmonths later due to \nthe way the system operates and the manner in which the report seems to have\nbeen generated or passed on to law enforcement. The Investigator told me that\nshe didn't know why DCF would accept the report if it was based on the\nrestraint in the Rifton, as children are being restrained in their cars all the\ntime, and there is no harm in using the same protocol in school.\u00a0\u00a0My\nson has\u00a0lost his muscle mass on legs and calves and went down 2 pants\nsizes,\u00a0 I\nbelieve as a direct result of constantly being in that chair. \n \n \n \n Jheanelle \n \n Tampa, FL \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Hillsborough County \n \n 2007 \n \n \n I\nam an advocate for children with special needs trying to educate people about\nthe over use of restraint and seclusion in the public school system.

A note was even placed in his cumulative folder after I complained of\nrestraint stating that there was zero tolerance toward him and suspension, police,\netc were to be used. For 1 an IEP meeting is where the parents and the school\ndevelop the child\u2019s individual education program or plan.  \u00a0 The last few weeks I have refused to be\nany distance away from the school and have mostly been at home and have had my\ncell phone at all times, even in the bathroom, knowing the call would come.\nToday it did. I got the call to come pick my son up at school as he was out of\ncontrol. I grabbed his service dog and got in the car and we raced over. When I\ngot there, the police were waiting. My 10-year-old child with autism was\nhandcuffed in the back of the patrol car. I could not go see him and could not\ntalk to the school staff. I was only able to talk to the police officers. I was\nhanded a letter stating he was suspended for 4 days. The police told me they\nwere taking him to the assessment center and they would call me in a few hours.\nThis evening I was able to pick him up after a few hours in the juvenile\nassessment center. Thankfully, the officers were made aware of his disability\nand they placed him in a cell alone. He was fascinated when they took his\nfingerprints and smiled for his booking photo (you know cause you smile for all\nphotos like mom says) and really does not understand what went on. The\ndetention staff said he was good for them and would recommend that charges be\ndropped. At this time he is charged with two 3rd degree counts of battery on a\nschool official. He came home tired and hungry because he had not eaten. He\ntold me his side of the story. He told me he was sitting at his desk cutting\nhis shirt with scissors because it was too hot and he thought it would be cooler.\nThe teacher asked him to stop, but he was too focused on what he was doing. The\nteacher insisted and he got mad, threw down the scissors and ran out of the\nroom. He ran to the principal\u2019s office. This office has been his only safe\nplace in the school as the school has refused to provide a sensory [comfort]\nroom or safe place to deescalate. He has been told he can always see the\nprincipal, but unfortunately, the principal was away. The staff had chased him\nto the principal\u2019s office. He wanted to be alone to calm down and tried to lock\nthe door to the office. Since it would not lock, he put chairs in front of it\nto try to block the door and hid under the table to be alone. They then came\nhim and pulled him out of from under the table [his safe place]. He got mad and\nlost his temper.

I asked her what\nhad happened and she said, \"Mrs. XXX held her down, and it hurt.\" I\npulled out her point sheet and nothing was written on it about any kind of\nrestraint or problem, but points from 11:00am - 12:14 were circled indicating\nthat she, at those times, was having some kind of difficulty. I called Mrs. XXX\nto see what had happened; she said that she had Angelina in a hold for 30-45\nminutes. She said she was trained to restrain students in a new manner not\nusing bear and basket holds anymore. She told me that she INTENTIONALLY used\npressure points under Angelina's armpits to cause discomfort in hopes that this\nwould deter her from exhibiting future bad behaviors. I then looked at\nAngelina's armpits and there was bruising and a broken blood vessel under her\nleft armpit. (I took pictures). Angelina did not want to show me this, she was\nvery upset crying and saying she is never going to school again. She is very\ndistraught! Again, my daughter is being physically and emotionally abused at\nschool. I am hoping that you will agree with me that this type of hold being\nused as punishment and is not acceptable in any way, shape, or form. Holds in\nschool are supposed to be used in a therapeutic way so the student does not\nendanger herself or someone else and only as a last resort, and never used as a\nform of punishment. Mrs. XXX even told you that she had Angelina in a hold for\n3 hours a couple days prior. This needs to STOP!  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tuesday \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Lee County  \n \n 2007  \n \n Some\nof you may have seen the WINK news reports about mentally handicapped children\nwho were placed by their teachers in brick walled \"time out\"\nrooms\" when they \"misbehaved.\" My daughter Caitlin was prone\nrestrained and placed in such a room on a frequent basis. I think it is\nimportant that members of our legislature understand how disabled children are\nroutinely treated by the Lee County School District. Caitlin is now 8 years\nold. Her diagnoses include autism and schizoaffective disorder. That means she\nis a very disabled child with both a developmental and a serious mental\ndisability. It is common knowledge that autistic and mentally ill children\nengage in self-injurious behavior, so putting them in brick walled rooms the\nsize of jail cells is a recipe for disaster in addition to being cruel and\ninhuman. It is astounding that in the 21st Century, in 2008, we still have\nprograms that are using aversive conditioning, with anyone let alone children\nwith disabilities. The emotional and physical pain this failure treatment has\ncaused our daughter is overwhelming.  \n \n \n \n Shawn\nand Kellie  \n \n Lee\nCounty, Florida  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Lee County  \n \n 2007  \n \n My\neleven-year-old son has a brain the size of a nine-month-old baby. Thanks to\nthe work of Dr. Marjie Morales and the Early Intervention Program my son's\nworld began to change for the better. However, upon transitioning from Early\nIntervention into the Public School system, our real nightmare began. Life\nchanging services were cut over our objections and those of grandparents and\nother professionals. Parent and teacher input, was ignored - \"duly\nnoted\", but quashed by administrators more interested in finances and\nschool reputations. As a result, my son's needs were ignored with the hopes he\nwould be transferred to another school for more disabled children. As a six and\nseven year old, instead of receiving the classroom help he needed, he learned\nto crawl under desks and lock himself in the bathroom to avoid further\nhumiliation in front of his peer group. His teachers routinely violated his\ngluten and casein free diet, and then punished him for the behavioral reactions\nhe had to the foods he could not eat. They psychologically scarred him by\npunishing him when his learning disability prevented him from completing an\nassignment and they frequently served his classmates cookies, Twinkies and\nother treats they knew he could not eat. One day my son came home from school\nwith three large thumb print bruises on his arm and leg and he said he got the\nmarks from his teacher who was \"holding him down\". We had to call the\npolice twice to even get a police report. The case was quickly closed without\nany action even though our pediatrician had referred us to our local Child\nProtection Team who assessed our son and said he gave a strong disclosure and\nthat his injuries were indicative of child maltreatment and abuse, the result\nof inappropriate restraint and seclusion techniques. The Florida Department of\nEducation ignored our complaints and referred them back to the local\nSuperintendent who declared our allegations as being \"without merit\",\ndespite doctors' letters. The school refused to change our son's IEP to address\nhis behavioral issues and they ignored the Child Protection Team's directive\nthat he should have no contact with the perpetrator. Out of fear for our son's\nsafety we refused to send him back to school until these changes were made. The\nresult: the district ignored our waiver requests for a transfer to a new school\nas supported by our son's doctor, unenrolled him from the school district and\ndeclared we, the parents, were violating the law by refusing to require our son\nto attend school. Our options were to go through the school lottery choice\nsystem and have him placed at some unnamed school, in a regular education\nclassroom with his non-disabled, same age peers, WITHOUT an IEP or face\ncriminal charges. Our son, and family continue to struggle with the emotional\nscars of his abusive restraint and seclusion school experience and we have no\nconfidence in our public education system to adequately protect children with\ndisabilities from being inappropriately restrained and secluded. Unfortunately,\nthese types of incidents are common throughout Florida, and the United States.\nOur current system excludes parents and protects abusers.  \n \n \n \n Julie\nand Mike  \n \n Lee\nCounty, Florida  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Lee County  \n \n 2006  \n \n Ian\nis in 2nd grade. We are in Lee County. He is in a school for SED students. Per\nhis IEP, he is to have a safe place to go to calm down.

My son, would not stop talking in\nclass and was sent to \"timeout\" where he continued to protest that it\nwas not him that was talking, but the child next to him. Rather than ignore him\nor LISTEN to him, they put him in a chokehold and lifted him off the ground\nwith that chokehold and then they let go. My child fell to the floor, where he\nhit his face, received a black eye and cut lip. I called the school when I\nfound out what happened and they told me that my son was THAT bad. So rather\nthan call the police or call ME, they proceeded to cause him injury. Knowing my\nson and the trouble he tended to cause, I left it there, BUT I kept him home\nand allowed him to finish school with an Option 2 diploma. I know now that I\nshould have held the school accountable, called the police and filed assault\ncharges. I did not and for the rest of my life, I will be trying to rectify my\nactions with my son. This in unacceptable for ANY child, I did tell them that\nmy son responded quite well to PBS, but no one was willing to do the work to\ninstitute it in the school. It is easier to intimidate these kids.

It seems Justin had been hitting his head against the wall in\nfrustration, due to having to use the restroom and not being permitted.\nInstead, when he got up and attempted to leave the room, four of the teachers\nand staff pulled out a mat and put Justin on it, and held him down. Justin [who\nis 7-8 years old and has multiple disabilities] became so upset, he began to\nhyper-ventilate, and at least three on staff saw his eyes roll back and say he\nsuffered a seizure that lasted approximately two minutes. It was at that point\nthe paramedics were summoned and I was contacted. This situation where Justin\nhas been unable to breathe properly, has happened before, usually due to being\nput in a face down, prone position with his arms twisted into an abnormal\nposition, behind his back, and a knee pressed into his back, just above the\nwaist, which interferes with his breathing. I personally witnessed this abuse\nby the Martin County Sheriff Deputy (School Resource Officer) who is at this\nschool on a daily basis. The new principal at Challenger was quick to tell me\nthat the school staff restrains a child differently from law enforcement. What\ndoes it matter, that someone can abuse a child who is in a supposedly safe\nspace, such as a public school? I have repeatedly pleaded with these school\nemployees, to stop using brute force tactics on Justin, and begin communicating\nwith him instead. Talk to him first, and find out why he is so upset. I am\ndeeply concerned that they simply do not intend to show him the respect he\ndeserves, as a human child, with multiple disabilities. Previously this year,\nJustin became frustrated at school and banged his head on the wall. According\nto eyewitnesses, three full sized adults piled on top of him, held him down to\nthe point that Justin was unable to move or breathe. When finally they moved\noff him, Justin was unable to catch his breath, and began to hyperventilate,\nand became so confused and upset that he panicked and became violent with the\nstaff. He was arrested, handcuffed, and taken to Martin County Jail, an adult\njail. That was followed by continuing restraint and seclusion from the school\nstaff, more arrests, and the additional stress of monthly court appearances all\ntook its toll. There is also the constant threat of Justin being adjudicated as\na \"Juvenile Delinquent\".  \n \n \n \n Parent\nAdvocate \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Orange County \n \n 2009 \u00a0 \n \n Here is the info on Waterford\nelementary.\u00a0 It started with the school not giving Brad the age\nappropriate curriculum.

The restraint lasted over 3 hours by six different people\nwho took turns laying on him on a concrete floor. While the staff made sure to\nput padding under their own legs, arms and elbows, none was placed under my\nson. My son was bruised and battered over 80% of his body. Fortunately, for my\nson, the entire incident was caught on surveillance cameras. Later, it was\ndiscovered that the teacher who was supposed to be my son's did not even have\nhis accreditation, certification or any education in special education. All a\nschool board thinks about is their budget, not the care of our children. You\nwould think that the money comes directly from their own wallets!  \n \n \n \n Anonymous\nmom Orlando  \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Orange County  \n \n 2008  \n \n I\ndid not know my son was being beaten and restrained until it was almost too\nlate. My son Christopher is now 16 years old and he has been through more in\nhis 2 years then any teenager should experience. My son Christopher attended a\nCharter School for that specialized in the Autism Spectrum and incorporated\nregular students. My son started to have behavioral issues at school January of\n2008. He was misbehaving in class and was put on a behavioral plan by the\nschool. At the end of January and into February of 2008, my son became\naggressive and violent at home. The last couple of days of January he destroyed\nthe walls, furniture and picked up an 80 pound glass table and threw as if he\nwas lifting a toy. My husband did not know what to do when this occurred, he\ndid not know whether to hold him, stop him or call the police. He called me at\nwork and I came rushing home, and found my son crying and confused, not\nunderstanding why he had done what he done. My son is verbal but his cognitive\nability is limited and he can only express himself in simple sentences. We\nasked him what was wrong, we asked him to draw his concerns but he could not. \u00a0\n I immediately took time off work and contacted about six psychiatrists and\nnone would see him for 2-3 months. One psychiatrist that specialized with\nAutistic children refused to see him and recommend we wait 2 months on their\nwaiting list instead. I found a psychiatrist that did not specialize in Autism\nbut could give me hope of helping my son through medicine. I did not understand\nwhat was happening to Christopher, I thought he was going mad or loosing\nhimself further into Autism. I reassured the school that I would find help for\nChristopher through medicine and a psychiatrist. I also reapplied to Agency\nwith Disability for the DD Medwaiver program. My son\u2019s behavior became more\nstable and he finished school towards the end of May of 2008. I signed him up\nfor two camps, one he enjoyed extremely that was Camp Shriver. His PE teacher\nhad gotten together with Special Olympics to provide a wonderful program that\noffered sports, arts and crafts and swimming. Christopher has never been\nhappier than during these days. Well, school started again and he progressively\nbecame more aggressive and disruptive in class. In October 2008, I had no\nchoice but to temporarily pull my son from school because he returned home with\ncontusions on his forehead, scrapes on the bridge of the nose and a swollen\nnose. The documented explanation of the injuries did not add up. I arrived home\nlate that night and took pictures of my son the next day as well as to the\nemergency room of Arnold Palmer Hospital. They took an examination of my son as\nwell as a CAT scan to rule out brain injury. I kept him out for a week but my\nson became extremely violent and I ended up taking him to a Behavioral Hospital\nthat specializes in Autism Spectrum. Well they only specialized in the\nAspergers. My son was overly medicated and neglected at this hospital until I\nwithdrew him. I am having the state through ACHA investigate for over\nmedication and violation of parent consent. The doctor is also being\ninvestigated for mal practice. I found out about the root cause of my sons suffering\nwas violence performed on him by school staff putting him in prone restraints\nas a form of behavioral modification. All this was brought to my attention by\nthe Advocacy Center for Persons with Disability, Inc. They performed a thorough\ninvestigation on three fronts, the school, the hospital and Agency for Persons\nwith Disabilities. They were able to secure the video showing my son being\nviolently handled by two men that work for the school. In one video, you almost\nsee them bend my son\u2019s neck in the most awkward of positions that could have\ncaused him death. \u00a0  My son was able to get his DD Medwaiver and my\nboy named Christopher no longer lives with us. He is with a group home in\nOrlando. I have suffered through many ups in downs in life such as anyone else,\nbut the pain of knowing Christopher suffered such as he did and I as a parent\nshould have never let it happen is something that haunts me every day. To know\nI had to be stripped of my angel is something that leads me to tears every day.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rose - distraught mother  \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Orange County  \n \n 2008 \n \n \n My\n12-year-old son (adopted with a long history of abuse) was restrained because\nhe freaked out when the school staff yanked the school phone out of his hands\nwhen he tried to call me to ask for help when a teacher tried to blame him for\nkicking a girl who walked behind him when he threw his lunch tray away.

We have had ongoing problems,\nincluding her teacher (a 20+ veteran in Special Ed) walking her out one\nafternoon at dismissal time and stating to me in a very loud voice (in front of\nother parents also waiting for their kids) that she was thinking of filing\ncharges against my daughter because she kicked or hit her (I was under the\nimpression that because she was in an EH program that was not unexpected). The\nlast incident was in December 2007 when I was called by the school and, upon\narrival, found her in a room with the Assistant Principal, teacher, a supposed\ncrisis intervention counselor and a police officer (it looked like an\ninterrogation room). Upon my arrival, she was Baker Acted and taken to Columbia\nHospital. Despite the fact that I told the school that I felt restraining my daughter\non the mat (with someone holding her down) exacerbated the situation, the\nschool continued to restrain her in that manner. My daughter has not been back\nto that school since. \u00a0  I admitted her to Sandy Pines Residential\nTreatment and expect that she will be attending Indian Ridge when discharged.\nHowever, there is a chance she will be returning to Limestone Creek. I was\nnever given any of the reports of restraint. Once I requested her file, I found\nshe was restrained many more times than I was aware of.  \n \n \n \n Leslie\n \n \n Palm\nBeach Gardens, FL  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Palm Beach County  \n \n 2005/2006  \n \n Our\nson Christian was restrained 89 times in 14 months. At the time, we did not\nknow he was being restrained or put in seclusion. We pulled our son out of\nLantana Middle school in Palm Beach County in October of 2005 because we\nthought he was having a nervous breakdown. He started out with small behavior\nproblems, but by the time the school staff at Lantana Middle school was done\nwith him his behaviors had escalated at school and we started having behavior\nproblems at home where there was none before. He became very depressed, easily\nupset; he started having sleep problems and would cry continuously in the\nmorning not wanting to go to school. Christian was so distraught when we pulled\nhim out of school that we had to seek psychiatric help for him and he was put\non medication. At the time, we did not know anything about children being\nrestrained and had no idea what PCM was and did not even know schools were\nallowed to restrain children with disabilities or any children. A year after we\npulled him out of school we were instructed to request copies of the PCM\nrestraint logs. Four weeks later, we received the documents and were shocked to\nfind out how many times he had been restrained over a 14-month period. We never\nknew this was happening to him. We believe that the actual PCM restraint\nnumbers are higher because the 6th grade PCM restraint logs are missing from\nthe school files and we cannot get the school district or the FLDOE to do\nanything to help us locate them. It is a horrible feeling to know we were not able\nto keep our son safe. If you file a complaint with the Florida Department of\nEducation, you are filing a complaint with them about them and nothing happens.\nIt is a broken process that many families have tried to get help from, only to\nfind that there is no help.  \n \n Gianni\nand Phyllis  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Suncoast Region  \n \n 2007 \n \n \n I\nvery much agree that schools and school systems in the Suncoast region make\nvery inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion in the special ed classrooms.\nThese interventions are not used to benefit the student, but instead benefit\nteachers and administrators. I reviewed the Technical Assistance Paper from the\nFlorida Department of Education on the use of Timeout with Special Education\nStudents. I was appalled by what I found. Not only is this Technical Assistance\nPaper very out-of-date in terms of best practices, but it recommends behavioral\ninterventions for problem behaviors that are very likely to aggravate the\nproblem instead of solving it. This very serious problem needs to be addressed\nASAP. The TAP also describes a number of procedures that need to be followed\nwhenever a student is removed from the classroom (level 3 timeout, seclusion).\nI am sure that schools and school districts have not followed the procedures at\nall which will put them in a very awkward position should anyone asked any\nquestions. I want to work with you and your organization to find the underlying\ncause of this issue, as I have been much disturbed by what I have seen in many\nschools in this area.  \n \n \n \n Frans\nXXX Ph.D., BCBA Florida  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Pasco County  \n \n September 2008   \n \n Please\nhelp me. I need to talk to somebody in my local area who may have some experience\nwith something I am dealing with. I am the mother of an 8-year-old autistic\nboy. This school year has been a nightmare. The teachers are restraining my son\nand then when he fights them back he is punished more. The problem is that when\nI ask the principal why, her answer is \u201chis behavior escalated\u201d but she cannot\ngive me a specific description. She always says, \u201cit escalated, that is all I\ncan say because I wasn't there\u201d. Then when I ask for the people who were there\nto call me, I do not get any explanation. I get a referral home that states\n\u201cBrendan kicked a teacher and bit her\u201d but they never write that it occurred\nwhile the teacher was holding him down. From what I can gather, he is not\nkicking them or hitting them until they hold him down. So the real question is\n- WHY is he being restrained? I have been lied to about situations and been\ntold different stories by different teachers. My son Brendan (who by the way\ndoes not lie - he seems to be missing that self-preservation chip) tells me a\ndifferent story than his teachers tell. Today he went to school and I\nspecifically called his teacher and told him to PLEASE not allow any situation\nto \u201cescalate\u201d and to please call his grandmother immediately if there is a hint\nof a problem and she will pick him up. I told his teacher that Brendan woke up\nupset about going to school because no matter what he does he gets into\ntrouble. His grandmother took him to school (I am a nurse and was at work at\nthe hospital) and she had a conversation with both the principal AND the vice\nprincipal telling them if there were any problems at all to call her right away\nbefore it escalated. They agreed. This afternoon his grandmother received a\nphone call to pick him up and was told that for 45 minutes two adults had\ntalked to Brendan about 'choices' and such and he was now sitting on the steps\nand would not go to class. They did this instead of doing what his mother and\ngrandmother requested. By this time, Brendan was a mess. He would not walk; so\nthey dragged him to his grandmother\u2019s vehicle. Then, instead of putting him in\nthe car and leaving it, they climbed in. His grandmother asked them what they\nwere doing and they told her they were riding with her and would have somebody\npick them up. They went off school property with Brendan and grandmother\nrestraining him while he tried to get away from them in the vehicle (a large\nconversion van). He bit one and hit another with a toy. Then when they got to\nGrandma's house, Brendan got out of the van and walked away down the block. His\ngrandmother told the staff to leave him alone, he was fine, and he just needed\nhis space. This is the neighborhood that he grew up in, he regularly walks in,\nand he was now well off school property and with a caretaker who had told them\nto leave him alone.  \n \n However,\nthese staff members ran down the road chasing him and caused him to run away -\nwhere moments before he had been fine walking. A car could have hit him. They\nchased him through yards and called a police officer (again against the wishes\nof the family) to chase the child. They threatened to press charges against him\nfor the bite and toy hitting (after they entered a personal vehicle, restrained\nhim off school property, and chased him down the road all against the wishes of\nthe caretaker) then encouraged the police to Baker Act him. Only when my ex-\nhusband arrived and argued with them about the harm Baker Acting would cause\ndid they stop. This is only one instance of how they have abused my son. I was\ntold that he \u201cchose\u201d to move his desk off by himself away from everybody else,\nbut the day I was in class the teacher told him if he wanted to sit with the\nclass, he had to earn it. He has been ostracized, I have been lied to. I have\nbeen to this school more times this year than I can count and they talk a good\ntalk to my face but never follow through. They put him in a pod classroom open\nto three other classes. The principal TOLD me three weeks ago she wants him out\nof the school... I have tried talking, being extra nice, positively reinforcing\nthem when they do a nice thing for Brendan, but I am at my wits end. I cannot\nsend him back there! He was so upset he was shaking at the school before he\nleft. Not screaming, not hitting, and not kicking. I do not know what to do.\nThe principal told me they do not have the resources for Brendan. However,\nnobody is trying to accommodate him; they are punishing him for not adjusting\nto their classroom (open, noisy, not like last year). I cannot send my son back\nthere to adults who bait him. I need somebody to tell me how I can get him into\nan autism program or legally keep him home from this school. I know as soon as\nI send him back they will call the police the first time they decide he is\n\u201cescalating\u201d and Baker Act him. He is already depressed, rocking (has not done\nthis in years) and sucking his fingers (never did this before). If you bring up\nschool to him, he starts getting the eyes rolling up, etc. I have to protect my\nchild and do not want to cause any problems for him by doing so. Please refer\nme to anybody who could tell me about any resource, a person in the school\nboard who could help. We are in the Pasco County School District in Florida. By\nthe way - the upset was because Brendan was told if he had a good morning he\ncould earn 'Lego Time' with the behavior specialist and when it came time for\nhim to go there his teacher told him he had forgotten to call her and Brendan\ncould not have his Lego Time. So here he had worked so hard and was so excited\n(really loves Lego\u2019s) and the instructor just 'forgets'. But of course, how\ndare Brendan be upset. Mind you not upset 'hitting' or anything. Just not\nwanting to go into his class.

The teachers must be better educated about handling\nthese kids because of the enormous number of children currently being\ndiagnosed. My son has sensory integration dysfunction. I went out of my way\nlast year to speak with his teacher about his condition and she assured me that\neverything would be okay. It was a constant struggle through the year to get\nthis teacher to understand my son. He was never a discipline problem and was\nalways respectful. However, he did speak out of turn (wanted to answer all of\nthe questions and help everyone), and he needed help in staying on task\nespecially in his team. He came home in tears often because the teacher and\nother aids often embarrassed him in front of the class by harshly reprimanding\nhim in front of the other children. FINALLY, two weeks before school ended, we\nhad an ESE meeting (I am trying to get him reclassified) and his teacher agreed\nthat he was not a disciplinary problem and would not embarrass him in front of\nthe other students and deal with him in a different way. It seemed to work fine\nand those two weeks were a pleasure for everyone. It really is not the\nteacher's fault but rather they are not trained. Restraining is happening all\ntoo often in the SLC school system. I personally witnessed a little boy (tiny\nand in ESE 1st grade class) being restrained by three BIG adults in the\nauditorium at Westgate during one of my lunch visits with my son. I was\nhorrified; my son told me that this happens all of the time during lunch.\nAnother friend of mine works as a lunch aide and told me that in her school\nrestraining is a common occurrence in the lunch room and heard that they have a\nspecial room that these children are put in when they act out. LET ME ASK\nEVERYONE A QUESTION... DO YOU REMEMBER KIDS BEING RESTRAINED WHEN YOU WENT TO\nSCHOOL OR KIDS BEING THROWN INTO A ROOM? I certainly do not and I think it is\ndisgusting that it is happening in our \"modern\" and\n\"compassionate\" society.  \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n \n \n Anonymous  \n \n 2007  \n \n In\nthe past, I have seen a severely emotional disturbed student actually set up.\nThe staff had his take down planned.

When he tries to leave the room, the teachers lock\nthe door and \"yell\" at him and Ben tries to push his way out. That\nescalates into more fear and Ben shoves or strikes at them. Ben is then dragged\nto the ground and put into a \"physical restraint\" position - for at\nleast 2 days in a row now.

It\nfound restraints that impede breathing, often when students are held prone on\nthe ground, can be the most dangerous. \n \nPatricia Ortaliz and her husband, Joe, filed a complaint with the Education\nDepartment in October, arguing that UCP had restrained their son for what they\nviewed as \"noncompliance,\" which is not an emergency. \n \nThe school said Alex was kicking and hitting furniture and walls, ran from his\nteachers and was climbing a stairway railing. He kicked at staffer who tried to\nget near him, and eventually the staff restrained him for nine minutes. \n \nBut the school's incident report suggests he was restrained after he left the\nstair railing, seemingly after any danger had passed. \n \nIn December, the department found in the parents' favor, criticizing the school\nfor how it handled Alex. The state noted that the school had not reported the\nincident \u2014 as well as a second restraint   of Alex in September\nlasting 45 minutes \u2014 to the state as required by law. The school, which did not\nrespond to requests for comment from the Sentinel, filed the needed reports in\nJanuary. \n \nAlex's family pulled him from the UCP school after the second restraint and\nhave him enrolled in a traditional public school near their east Orange home.\nNow nearly 6, Alex is bright, curious and loving and doing well in his new\nschool. \n \nHe has not been restrained since those incidents at UCP, but his parents said\nthe events at the start of the year deeply troubled him. \n \nHe was frightened to go to school for a while, and his behavior regressed, as\nhe wouldn't get himself dressed. The district, based on the department's\nfinding, is now providing him therapy. \n \nSylvia Smith, director of legislative and public affairs for Disability Rights\nFlorida, thinks schools are using restraint too often on Alex and other\nchildren. And though 8,222 incidents may seem a lot, she thinks schools are\nunderreporting. \n \n\"We don't think it's all being captured,\" Smith said. \n \nBut Smith said her agency, which gets frequent calls from parents upset that\ntheir kids were restrained, is thrilled the state is finally tracking the\ninformation and happy the Education Department has urged districts to limit\nboth practices. \n \n\"It is a huge improvement and huge step forward,\" she said. \n \n Orange officials concerned \n \nAnna Diaz, who oversees disabled-student education in Orange, said the district\nis concerned about its restraint numbers and dispatches behavior analysts to\nfigure out what isn't working when a child is repeatedly restrained. \n \n\"There are kids who do respond to the restraint,\" Diaz said,\n\"but it should only be used as a last resort. We take that\nseriously.\" \n \nBambi Lockman, bureau chief of the Education Department's exceptional-student\ndivision, said the system is so new that she couldn't yet say whether districts\nwere underreporting incidents or explain the wide differences in cases among school\ndistricts. \n \nMiami-Dade, the state's largest school district, reported 115 restraint cases,\nwhile Hillsborough documented 841 cases, the second-highest number next to\nOrange. \n \n\"We are looking very closely at what is being reported, and we're\ncontinuing to have conversations with districts,\" Lockman said. The data,\nshe added, are \"opening some eyes.\" \n \nIn a document sent to districts in September, the department made its views\nclear: \"It is important that such interventions be used only in emergency\nsituations when an imminent risk of serious injury or death to the student or\nothers exists.\" \n \nOrange educators say restraint allows them to control students who are a danger\nto themselves or other students. \n \nThey point to Hannah Briegel, 14, a seventh-grader at Meadow Woods Middle\nrestrained 35 times this school year. She's a success, they say, because she is\nbeing restrained much less now and is doing well in school. \n \nStricken with meningitis as a toddler, Hannah sometimes lashes out physically\nwhen she can't express herself, said her mother, Liza. Hannah has thrown books,\noverturned desks and once injured a beloved teacher. \n \n Restraint \"was a\nnecessary tool, not a punishment,\" Briegel said. \"It's a way to\nremove her safely to isolate her in another classroom, so she couldn't hurt\nanyone else.\" \n \n ******************************************************************\n \n \n Palm\nBeach County school leaders want input on use of disputed restraint technique \n \n April\u00a06,\u00a02011 \nBy   Jason Schultz \u00a0\nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer  \n \n http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/schools/palm-beach-county-school-leaders-want-input-on-1381265.html \n \n BOYNTON BEACH, Florida \u00a0\u2014\nPalm Beach County School board members will hold a workshop on the fate of a\ncontroversial technique used to restrain unruly special-needs students.  \nThe board voted unanimously today, at the urging of board member Karen\nBrill, to hold the workshop on prone restraint, a technique where school\nemployees essentially pin a special needs student who has gotten out of control\nface down on the ground and hold the student's arms and legs.  \n\n\n\"I have some areas where I am conflicted about prone restraints,\"\nBrill said.  \n\n\nThe Palm Beach Post, in a special series in October, documented hundreds of\ninstances in which district staff held special needs children in the face down\nrestraint that many national experts consider dangerous. It has caused bruises\nand minor injuries in Florida students. A federal study has attributed some\nfatalities around the nation to the use of prone restraint.  \n\n\nSchool board members last week unanimously approved an emergency update to\ndistrict policy on the use of restraint.  \n\n\nIt outlaws the use of seclusion, where a student is locked in a room alone\nuntil they calm down. And the updated policy only allows the use of prone\nrestraint if the student poses imminent danger of injury to him or herself or\nothers. The old policy allowed prone restraint if a student was causing a high\ndegree of disruption to a class.  \n\n\nParents of special needs children who have been restrained in the past\ncomplained that the new district policy does not go far enough and that prone\nrestraint is too dangerous and should be outlawed completely in schools.  \n\n\nThe policy updates were passed last week as an emergency ordinance because\nthe district missed a Jan. 31 deadline for updating its restraint policy to\nmirror state law passed last year, said Laura Pincus, the district's\nexceptional student education director.  \n\n\nThat state law specifies training and reporting requirements for the use of\nrestraint but does not outlaw seclusion or prone restraint. The district must\nstill pass a permanent policy change to take the place of the emergency change\nwithin the next three months. Pincus said prone restraint is only used as a\nlast resort, but sometimes it is needed.  \n\n\nBrill said she expected the permanent change to come to the board for first\nreading sometime in May. She wanted the workshop before that first reading so\nthat proponents and opponents of the use of prone restraint could argue both\nsides. No date was set for the workshop.  \n\n\nBrill said Pincus should reach out to the parents who oppose prone restraint\nto find somebody to speak on behalf of the opponents.  \n\n\n \n\u00a0 ******************************************************************\n \n \n Florida School bus episode costs Sarasota\ndeputy his job \n \n VIDEO EVIDENCE: Clash with\nspecial-needs student quickly escalated \n \n January 13, 2011\u00a0 By Anthony Cormier   \u00a0 &  Christopher\nO'Donnell  \n Click on the link below to view the video from\nthe school bus.  http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20110113/ARTICLE/101131062/2416/NEWS \n \n SARASOTA\nCOUNTY, Florida \u00a0-\u00a0A Sarasota Sheriff's deputy was fired after he aggressively\nthrew a special-needs student onto a school bus seat and threatened to shock\nher with a Taser during a videotaped confrontation on the bus. \n \n The deputy, Mark Perrin, was fired Wednesday\nafter an internal investigation spurred by a videotape that shows him snatching\na 17-year-old girl from her seat and flinging her across an aisle while others\non the bus looked on in shock. Perrin also used profanity during the episode,\nauthorities said. \n \n The situation began when an aide on the bus\ncalled 911 to say that the student threw a plastic bottle, punched her in the\nstomach and kicked her wrist. \n \n The bus, from Sarasota High School, pulled\nover at Cattlemen Road and Cattleridge Boulevard about 3 p.m. on Dec. 15. \n \n Authorities say that Sarasota County\nfirefighters were the first to arrive, and that the aide and driver remained on\nthe bus as the girl refused to get out of her seat. \n \n When Perrin shows up, he sees the teenager in\nher seat a few rows back. He asks, \"What's your problem, girl?\" \n \n The teenager, who has not been named in\nreports, is told to stand up, but refuses. \n \n \"I'll snatch your ass out of that\nseat,\" the deputy says. \n \n He then grabs the teenager by her sweatshirt\nand violently throws her across the aisle and face down into another seat. The\ndeputy climbs on top of the teenager's back and struggles to restrain her. \n \n \"Put both hands behind your back before\nI Tase you,\" he says. \n \n The girl can be heard screaming while others\non the bus back away. She later told internal affairs investigators that she\ncould hear her sweat shirt ripping and that she was surprised the deputy\ngrabbed her out of the seat. \n \n \"I wasn't\nready for that,\" she said. The girl was then restrained with her arms\nbehind her back. \n \n Once Perrin and\nthe girl were off the bus, the deputy's supervisor arrived and learned that the\ngirl failed to take her prescription medication to curb violent outbursts. \n \n Perrin told the\nbus driver that the student was going to jail, but his supervisor took her\ninstead to a mental health facility under the state's Baker Act -- which allows\npeople to be held for 72 hours for evaluation if they are a risk to themselves\nor others. \n \n Soon, the\nagency heard from those on the bus that Perrin acted too harshly. Sheriff Tom\nKnight saw the video that afternoon and immediately suspended the deputy. \n \n \"He was\noff the road within an hour,\" Knight said. \"He didn't finish his\nshift. His actions were totally uncalled for and are disappointing to this\nagency.\" \n \n Perrin was\nhired in June 2001 and was paid about $59,000 a year. His personnel file was\nnot immediately available. \n \n Schools\nspokesman Scott Ferguson said the district was made aware of the deputy's\nfiring on Wednesday. He said the district determined the aide acted\nappropriately and felt the student was too unruly to deal with by herself. \n \n \"She did\nthe right thing by calling law enforcement, then it's up to them -- they have\nto take it from there,\" he said. \n \n I wasn't ready\nfor that,\" she said. The girl was then restrained with her arms behind her\nback. \n \n Once Perrin and the girl were off the bus,\nthe deputy's supervisor arrived and learned that the girl failed to take her\nprescription medication to curb violent outbursts. \n \n Perrin told the bus driver that the student\nwas going to jail, but his supervisor took her instead to a mental health\nfacility under the state's Baker Act -- which allows people to be held for 72\nhours for evaluation if they are a risk to themselves or others. \n \n Soon, the agency heard from those on the bus\nthat Perrin acted too harshly. Sheriff Tom Knight saw the video that afternoon\nand immediately suspended the deputy. \n \n \"He was off the road within an\nhour,\" Knight said. \"He didn't finish his shift. His actions were\ntotally uncalled for and are disappointing to this agency.\" \n UPDATE: Fired\ndeputy had prior reprimand \n\n\n \n January 13, 2011 \u00a0\u00a0  By  Anthony Cormier \u00a0  \n \n http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20110113/BREAKING/110119896/2416/NEWS?Title=UPDATE-Fired-deputy-had-prior-reprimand \n \n The deputy fired this week for violently tossing a special needs student\non a school bus in December was reprimanded by the sheriff's office in the past\nfor a temper outburst in his private life. \n Deputy Mark\nPerrin was fired Wednesday after a videotape showed him cursing at a\n17-year-old girl on a school bus, then roughly snatching her out of her seat\nand throwing her across the aisle. \n\n\n Internal\naffairs records show that Perrin, 43, was reprimanded by Sarasota Sheriff's\nadministrators following a confrontation in which he called his estranged\nwife's employer and demanded to talk to his wife, eventually threatening to\ndrive over in his patrol car to see her. \n\n\n In September\n2007, with Perrin and his wife in the midst of divorce, the deputy called\nDoctors Hospital and demanded to speak with his wife, an employee. \n\n\n He became\n\u201cenraged and verbally abusive\u201d to a nursing supervisor. \n\n\n Sheriff's\nofficials were notified and decided the tirade was \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d of an\nofficer, and Perrin was reprimanded. \n\n\n Perrin, a\ndeputy since 2001, had no other notations in his personnel file. \n\n\n ****************************************** \n\n\n \n January 13th, 2011  \n \n Firefighters should have stopped deputy\u2019s arrest on\nbus? Bad idea. \n \n by Tom Lyons \n \n http://tomlyonstheblog.blogs.heraldtribune.com/10088/firefighters-should-have-stopped-deputys-arrest-on-bus-bad-idea/ \n \n Sometimes a thoughtful reader writes to me and praises my column, but\nsays something I adamantly disagree with. An example, somewhat\u00a0edited, of\nsuch an exchange: \n \n Hello, Tom, \nAs a former resident of Sarasota, I read the headlines most every day. \nThe video of the county deputy manhandling and beating the special needs kid is\nbad enough but there were three fire department officials on the scene, in the\nbus, as well and they did nothing! \nDeputy Perrin deserved to lose his job over that but the three firemen should\nbe disciplined for not intervening and making Perrin stop his assault on the\nkid\u2026.. \n \n My response: Thanks for writing . I have to disagree about the\nfirefighters. They were calm and patient before the deputy arrived, and they\nwere one reason things had calmed down. That\u2019s part of what made the deputy\u2019s\ntone and actions so unexpected. \n \n \u00a0And when he started his forceful arrest actions, I\u2019d say the\nfirefighters DID do something, the best thing they could have done: They\nrefrained from breaking the law by interfering with a lawful arrest. Yes, a\nneedlessly rough arrest showing extreme impatience and over-the-top angry\njudgment by the deputy.\u2026 but lawful. And I don\u2019t think \u201cbeating\u201d is\u00a0\naccurate, by the way, even though it was a premature overuse of use of\noverwhelming force to gain control. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anything the firefighters might have done (during the\nvery few seconds of shocked reaction) to interrupt or even object verbally\nwould have made the deputy angrier and almost forced to be more extreme to cope\nwith the interference and distraction. \n \n As is, a witness on the bus ( possibly one or more of the firefighters,\nbut I don\u2019t know) talked to the deputy\u2019s superior soon afterward, which led to\nan internal\u00a0 investigation.\u00a0 \u00a0And, when contacted, firefighters\nspoke to the IA investigator frankly about what they saw and their reaction.\nThey\u00a0didn\u2019t want to judge whether it was excessive force in the legalistic\nsense, but said they were taken aback by the sudden and rough arrest with\nalmost no verbal efforts to seek cooperation. And, one did say he was tempted\nto intervene. \n \n Had he done so, I imagine we would have a fired firefighter now, and an\narrested one. And things might even have gone worse for the arrested girl, too.\nAt best, we\u2019d have a much more tangled controversy.\u00a0 \n \n (We had a longer, friendly chat, and\u00a0agreed to disagree. He still\nimagined that if\u00a0 firefighters grabbed the deputy in mid-arrest, they\nwould\u00a0have\u00a0prevented improper violence,\u00a0 and clamed\nthings\u00a0down. I still imagained\u00a0 a melee in which things got worse for\nall concerned.\u00a0 Maybe much worse. \n \n Perrin was hired in June 2001 and was paid about $59,000 a year. His\npersonnel file was not immediately available. \n \n Schools spokesman Scott Ferguson said the\ndistrict was made aware of the deputy's firing on Wednesday. He said the\ndistrict determined the aide acted appropriately and felt the student was too\nunruly to deal with by herself. \n \n \"She did the right thing by calling law\nenforcement, then it's up to them -- they have to take it from there,\" he\nsaid. \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Ocala,\nFlorida - School district: Teacher, aide verbally abused disabled student \n \n Tuesday, December 7, 2010 at 10:20 a.m.  \n \n http://www.ocala.com/article/20101207/ARTICLES/101209760/1001/news01?Title=School-district-Teacher-aide-verbally-abused-disabled-student&tc=ar \n Ocala, Florida  - Superintendent of Schools Jim\nYancey has recommended that a teacher and a teacher's aide be fired for\nreportedly insulting and verbally abusing a Maplewood Elementary School\nfirst-grader who is autistic and cannot speak. \n\n\nThe case was brought to the attention of School District administrators when\nthe child's mother brought in a digital audio recording of the abuse. \n\n\nThe recording, made without the teacher and aide's knowledge, revealed that\nthe women had called the female student \u201ca hippo,\u201d \u201ca beached whale sleeping\u201d\nand a \u201chippo in a ballerina suit,\u201d according to School District documents. \n\n\nThe women, teacher Rhoda S. Richardson and aide Deborah J. Adams, were also\nheard chastising and verbally berating the incontinent child for wetting\nherself. And they forced the child to wear soiled clothes and clean her own\nurine. \n\n\nYancey said he's embarrassed by this behavior, as well as the disparaging\nremarks the women could be heard also making about the child's mother. He said\nhe was shocked that \u201cthis was going on in our School District.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI just want to give my most sincere apologies\u201d to the family, said Yancey. \n\n\nYancey said the mother is so upset that she would not speak to him directly\nwhen he tried to apologize. Her name and her daughter's are withheld because of\nthe child's age. \n \n\n\n A mother's intuition \n\n\nThe girl is 7 but has the mental capacity of a 2-year-old. She is nonverbal\nand \u201cwill only sometimes repeat what she has heard,\u201d according to a Marion\nCounty Sheriff's Office report. \n\n\nThat agency investigated but is taking no action. \n\n\nThe mother, 26, told the Star-Banner on Tuesday that she had long suspected\nsomething was not right with her daughter. It all came to a head on Oct. 6,\nwhen her daughter was unusually upset and didn't want to go to school. \n\n\nShe took her daughter out for breakfast. While eating, she decided it was\ntime to follow her mother's intuition. She drove to Walmart, picked out a\ndigital recorder \u201cturned it on, put it my daughter's backpack and took her back\nto school.\u201d \n\n\nWhen the girl came home, the mother listened to the recording and learned\nabout the statements, and actions, of Richardson and Adams, according to School\nDistrict documents. \n\n\nAdams told the Star-Banner she did not have any comment about the case,\nsaying only that \u201cI do not want my name used in the story.\u201d \n\n\nIn the Sheriff's Office report, a deputy stated that he interviewed Adams,\nwho \u201ctook responsibility for her actions.\u201d The report says Adams was very\napologetic and remorseful. \n\n\nRichardson could not be reached for comment. The Sheriff's Office report\nstates that she was considered by her peers as one of the best teachers and a\nvery caring woman. Richardson would not speak to deputies without her attorney,\nRobert Bradshaw. \n\n\nThe mother said she had been calling and visiting the school for weeks\nbecause she knew something was wrong. She said nothing was ever done. After she\ntook matters in her own hands, she has seen great progress from the School\nDistrict. The mother said she went directly to the district because she felt\nshe couldn't trust Maplewood administrators. The mother said the district-level\nadministrative team has been great. \n\n\nThe child has since been moved from Maplewood to another school that cares\nfor the severely disabled. She has not decided whether she will file a lawsuit\nagainst the teachers and/or the district. \n\n\n\u201cI just don't know right now,\u201d she said. \n\n\n \n A\nseven-week investigation \nYancey said the employees were immediately placed on paid leave on Oct. 11,\nwhen the district learned of the allegations. \n\n\nThe School District has been investigating for seven weeks, mainly because\nSchool District officials had to verify whose voices were on the recording.\nHence the delay in announcing the findings. \n\n\nYancey said once staff determined who was speaking on the tape, then the\ndistrict could take administrative action. \n\n\nThe child's mother declined to give the Star-Banner a copy of the tape. So\ndid the Sheriff's Office, citing a Florida law that prohibits distributing the\ncontents of any illegally recorded conversations. \n\n\nAs for the School District: Officials said the tape will not be made public\nbecause the employees still have the right to request a hearing; therefore, the\ncases are not officially closed. \n\n\nSchool District officials immediately called the Marion County Sheriff's\nOffice, which investigated. The State Attorney's Office reviewed the case and\ndetermined the teacher and aide would not be prosecuted for any crime. \n\n\nThe School District also contacted the Department of Children and Families,\nwhich continues to investigate. \n\n\nYancey said the mother did not report the incident directly to Maplewood\nElementary administrators, who were therefore unaware of the verbal abuse\nallegations until the district launched its investigation. \n\n\nYancey has recommended that both employees be placed on unpaid leave and\ntheir employment terminated. The School Board will decide on Tuesday whether it\nwill support Yancey's decision. \n\n\nIf the School Board chooses to place the women on unpaid leave, the\nemployees would have the right to request a hearing before the board, which can\nthen change its decision or finalize the termination. \n\n\n \n The\naccusations \nAccording to the investigation, which included determining who said what on\nthe tape, the school system says that teacher aide Adams: \n\n\nRepeatedly berated the child. \n\n\nReferred to the child, in the child\u2019s presence, as a \u201cmanatee,\u201d a \u201chippo,\u201d a\n\u201cbig fat hippo in a ballerina suit,\u201d and other demeaning terms. \n\n\nSaid of the child, in the child\u2019s presence, \u201cDo we beat her now or beat her\nlater? I am tired of her being a butt head.\u201d \n\n\nSaid to the incontinent child: \u201cI hope you are proud of yourself, you wet\nall over the floor.\u201d \n\n\nSaid: \u201cJust put her in the washing machine \u2026 she needs washing.\u201d \n\n\nRepeatedly shouted at the child in response to the child\u2019s actions in the\nclassroom. \n\n\nTold the child that she would have to remain in her wet clothing after she\nwet herself. \n\n\nKnew the child was ill but said she was not going to inform the parent. \n\n\nMade disparaging remarks about the child\u2019s parent, stating the mother was\n\u201cfull of B.S.\u201d \n\n\nConsistently behaved toward the child in a hostile, sarcastic, demeaning and\nnegative manner. \n\n\nThe School District also stated that Richardson, the teacher, who was around\nwhen Adams made some of her remarks, also: \n\n\nReferred to the child, in the child\u2019s presence, as a \u201cbeached whale\nsleeping.\u201d \n\n\nUsed threats of \u201cspanking\u201d and \u201cbeating\u201d in attempts to influence the\nchild\u2019s behavior. \n\n\nRequired the incontinent child to clean her own urine off the floor. \n\n\nMade disparaging remarks about the parent, knew the child was ill but did\nnot tell the parent, made the child remain in wet clothing, and berated the\nchild in the classroom. \n\n\n Contact Joe Callahan at  joe.callahan@starbanner.com . \n\n\n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n Florida\n- Aide charged with abusing autistic boy  \u00a0 \n \n December\n4, 2010   \u00a0 By ANDREW GANT \n http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/southeast-volusia/2010/12/04/aide-charged-with-abusing-autistic-boy.html \n\n\n Florida  - A 72-year-old\nschool bus attendant was arrested Friday on charges she grabbed at an autistic\nboy's limbs, slapped him and threatened to break his wrists if he didn't behave\non the bus, police said.  \n\n\nMarilyn Talford Onie was charged with child abuse after Edgewater police\nwatched the incident on school-bus video, according to her arrest report.  \n\n\nOnie -- who was sitting in a seat at the front of the bus, across the aisle\nfrom a 14-year-old student with autism -- began yelling at him during a Nov. 8\nbus ride home from New Smyrna Beach High School, police said.  \n\n\nInvestigators said the boy does not speak and only understands some of what\nis said to him.  \n\n\nWhen he began to bite at his arm and reached out to touch Onie with his\nfinger, police said, she grabbed his wrists and squeezed them, then pointed her\nfinger in the boy's face. When he reached out again, she grabbed his fingers\nand squeezed those, too, according to the report.  \n\n\nWhen the boy tried to touch another child leaving the bus, Onie yelled,\n\"You're gonna get it, buddy,\" police said. She grabbed his wrists\nagain, bent them downward and asked, \"Want me to break them on ya?\"\naccording to the report.  \n\n\n\"You like that?\" she asked later as she pressed on his wrists,\n\"causing the child to lunge his body forward toward Onie's face,\"\npolice said.  \n\n\nThe boy's mother later told investigators her son likely was agitated\nbecause a new driver was taking the bus on an unfamiliar route.  \n\n\nOnie also grabbed the boy by the back of the neck, slapped him on the\nshoulder and pushed his head against the bus window as he tried to touch her\nwith his finger.  \n\n\n\"We are not bringing you to school anymore. You're a bad boy,\"\npolice quoted her as saying.  \n\n\nOnie could not be reached for comment Friday, but in a Wednesday interview\nwith police, she said she \"had been having problems with (the boy) for\nseveral months but never reported any incidents to anyone.\"  \n\n\nAfter watching and listening to the school-bus video, she said her comment\nabout breaking the boy's hands was \"said out of frustration.\"  \n\n\n\"Mrs. Onie stated that she has seen the video tape and has no other\nexplanation for her actions other than she is 'only human,' \" police\nwrote.  \n\n\nA fellow student who uses a wheelchair opened the investigation by telling\nher mother about what she saw. She told investigators she felt Onie was\n\"very mean\" and \"showed no mercy or sympathy\" for the boy,\naccording to the report.  \n\n\nOnie was not fired or suspended, but she was reassigned to duties away from\nchildren -- cleaning the buses, for example -- after the Nov. 8 incident,\nschool district spokeswoman Nancy Wait said.  \n\n\nThe district won't investigate and will wait for Onie's case to be resolved\nbefore taking any further action in her employment, Wait said.  \n\n\nOnie works 6.5 hours per day -- considered full-time by the district -- at\n$11.73 per hour.  \n\n\nShe posted $1,000 bail and was released from the Volusia County Branch Jail\non Friday. \n\n\n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n Student with bloody eyes will likely change schools \n \n 11/04/2010 \n \n http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/nov/04/041857/student-with-bloody-eyes-will-likely-change-school/ \n TAMPA, Florida \u00a0A 14 year-old boy who claims\na school aide put him in a restraining hold that led to his eyes bleeding will\nlikely wind up at a new school. The white part of Abdullah Fisher's eyes were\nstill blood red today, a week after the incident at Dorothy Thomas School. \n\n\n\"When Abdullah was getting choked - he told him that he couldn't\nbreathe,\" said Deborah Williams, his mother. \"I don't want Abdullah\ngoing back to that school.\" \n\n\nFisher said it started last Thursday when he \"smacked\" paper out\nof his teacher's hands. Staff called in the school's resource officer, formally\ncalled an exceptional student education aide, and a scuffle escalated,\naccording to Fisher. That aide tried to put Fisher in a time-out room, but he\nfought back. \n\n\n\"He took me up and he slammed me,\" Fisher said. \"He had me\n... in the Full Nelson move. I kept telling him I couldn't breathe.\"Fisher\nis 14, but because of a disability is on a third grade level, according to his\nmother. By the time he got off the bus Thursday afternoon, blood was dripping\nfrom his left eye, according to family witnesses at home. \n\n\n\"I had blood on my shirt,\" Fisher said. \"The bus driver [saw]\nit \u2026 and asked me what happened.\" \n\n\nHospital paperwork shows he suffered a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which\ncauses blood to leak from a broken vessel in the eyes. He also sustained an\nacute cervical strain. \n\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, school administrators called Williams to set up a meeting\ntoday. A special education instructor will evaluate Fisher and his mother to\nsee what school will fit him best.

The\nbill, which the Senate had passed unanimously on Thursday, still needs to be\nsigned into law by Gov. Charlie Crist. \n\n\nMusumeci, however, said the bill didn't go far enough. \n\n\n\"All of the protective language was taken out,\" Musumeci said.\n\"The original bill explained the types of restraints which were deadly to\ndisabled children. I'm disappointed. While it's good the bill passed, it still\nneeded more substance.\" \n\n\n The legislation (HB 1073),  sponsored by Rep.\nDorothy Hukill, R-Port Orange, prohibits school employees from using a\nmechanical or manual physical restraint that restricts a student's breathing.\nIt also forbids school employees from locking a disabled student in a room that\nfails to meet state fire marshal rules. \n\n\n\"This bill is one of the most significant ones we will do,\" said\nSenate sponsor Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando. \"We've had stories and testimony\nabout children with disabilities who were restrained or put in seclusion and\nthe parents never knew.\" \n\n\nThe legislation requires schools to write a report within 24 hours of any\nincident of restraint or seclusion with details including what type of\nrestraint was used and the name of person using or assisting in the restraint. \n\n\nParents or guardians are also required to be notified by the end of the day\non which the seclusion or restraint occurred. \n\n\n\"We had one father who said he found out his son had been restrained\nonly when the boy came home with a broken finger,\" Gardiner said. \n\n\nFlorida has been among 19 states with no laws or regulations on the use of\nrestraint or seclusion. \n\n\nChristina Santacroce Howley, a Royal Palm Beach mother, said the legislation\nshouldn't even be necessary. \n\n\n\"We shouldn't be using mechanical or manual restraints on any children\nthat restricts their breathing,\" she said. \"What am I missing?\" \n\n\nBut Nadine Fisher-Kirby, a Lake Worth mother, said she hopes the new law\nwill protect children in the future. \n\n\n\"I think people that do not know what they are doing could hurt some of\nthese kids,\" Fisher-Kirby said. \"It's a tough situation as a parent,\nteacher or even security at the individual school.\" \n\n\nSome lawmakers were concerned that teachers would not have enough ability\nunder the proposal to control disruptive students. \n\n\n\"I want to make sure, if I'm a teacher and I have a very violent child,\nwould I be able to restrain them as long as I notified parents?\" asked\nSen. Evelyn Lynn, R-Ormond Beach. Gardiner answered that the bill prohibits\nonly restraints that restrict breathing. \n\n\nNat Harrington, spokesman for the Palm Beach County school district, said\nthe district \"will implement the new law in our training and in our\nclassrooms.\" \n\n\nMusumeci said she has a problem with \"aggressive\" restraining\nmethods that she says schools have used in the past. Because autistic kids have\ndifficulty expressing themselves verbally, they often get frustrated if they\nare being restrained. \n\n\n\"They don't understand and they're trying to communicate,\" she\nsaid. \"Once a staff person puts their hands on a child, it becomes fight\nor flight.\" \n\n\nMusumeci said parents' voices are not being heard. \n\n\n\"The politicians are listening to the Department of Education, the\nschool district and the Florida Association for Behavior Analysis,\" she\nsaid. \"We're trying to tell them that our children are being injured\nphysically and mentally and we're not getting the support we need.\" \n\n\nThe bill also requires employees of child-care facilities to be trained to\nwork with and identify children with developmental disabilities, including\nautism spectrum disorder and Down syndrome. \n\n\nThis bill combines H1073 and H81.\u00a0\u00a0 Link to entire bill:  http://www.flsenate.gov/data/session/2010/House/bills/billtext/pdf/h107303e1.pdf \n\n\n \n\u00a0 ****************************************************************** \n \n A Seminole\nCounty,Florida\u00a0special education teacher is expected to be fired soon for\nscreaming at a disabled student (Video) \n \n \n \n March 16, 2010 \n \n http://www.wftv.com/video/22858039/index.html?treets=orlc&tml=orlc_8pm&ts=T&tmi=orlc_8pm_1_07000103162010 \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Teacher Accused\nOf Giving Student Concussion \n \n March 2, 2010 \n \n http://www.wftv.com/countybycounty/22715680/detail.html \n \n FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. --  A special needs teacher in Flagler County was arrested,\naccused of abusing a disabled student.

LUCIE  \u2014 Kathy Franklin says she wants to get her daughters back in\nschool. But after her 6-year-old was handcuffed and then sent to a mental\nhealth facility, she no longer feels her children are safe at Parkway\nElementary. \n \n \u201cThese people are going\nto the extreme,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cShe is so tiny. They didn\u2019t have to use force\non her.\u201d \n \n St. Lucie County Sheriff\nreports say Franklin\u2019s daughter, Haley, was being disruptive on several\noccasions at school, throwing objects, hitting administration personnel and\nscreaming uncontrollably. Last week after Haley wouldn\u2019t calm down, a deputy\nhandcuffed the 40-pound girl to get her under control. \n \n On Tuesday, after\nanother disruption, the girl was put under a law enforcement involuntary Baker\nAct and taken to a mental health facility. Franklin says the latest events have\ntraumatized her daughter. She is afraid of law enforcement and school, she\nsaid. \n \n \u201cThere is absolutely no\nreason for what they did,\u201d Franklin said. \n \n But St. Lucie County\nsheriff\u2019s reports disagree. They say Haley was being disruptive on Feb. 3. She\nwalked out of class and kicked a wall and school officials. She screamed and\nwouldn\u2019t calm down for more than an hour. \n \n The sheriff\u2019s deputy\nhandcuffed her in an attempt to get Haley under control, so she wouldn\u2019t hurt\nherself or others, the report said. \n \n \u201cHaley was crying and\nsaying that the handcuffs hurt. When I looked at her hands, she had one hand\npulled almost all the way out, therefore, the handcuff was around her thumb and\nhand instead of her wrist, causing discomfort,\u201d the report said. \n \n The girl eventually\ncalmed down after the handcuffs were removed and she returned to class. Haley\nsaid she doesn\u2019t like school. It\u2019s boring and the children make fun of her. \n \n \u201cThey tease me. They\ncall me spitball because I spit when I talk,\u201d she said. Haley said she walked\nout of the classroom because of the teasing. \n \n She said she didn\u2019t like\nit when school officials carried her to the office. \n \n \u201cThey grabbed my arm,\nand they grabbed my feet. They carried me like luggage,\u201d she said. \n \n Deputies were called\nagain Tuesday to the school, for another disturbance involving Haley, the\nreport said. School Principal Ucola Baxter, who is eight months pregnant, told\nthe deputy the girl kicked her in the stomach on the previous day. \n \n This time, the deputy\ntook the girl to New Horizons, an adult mental health facility. \n \n Franklin called the\naction a retaliatory move because she filed a complaint last week against the\nschool principal. \n \n The report said Franklin\nhad been contacted \u201cseveral times\u201d by the school and once by the deputy about\nHaley\u2019s behavior problems. However, the parents have not showed up for\nmeetings. \n \n The parents also were\ncriminally charged with failing to appear in court near the end of 2009 for a\ntruancy hearing involving Haley not attending school, the report stated. \n \n Franklin said she and\nher husband removed Haley and her 9-year-old sister from the school. She said\nthey are trying to get an alternative placement for the girls, but were told it\nwill take a few days to find one. \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Charges dropped in 9-year-old\ngirl\u2019s school rampage in Fort Myers\u00a0 (now it's a rampage??) \n \nBy Rachel Myers\u00a0 November 7, 2008 \n \n http://www.news-press.com/article/20081107/NEWS0110/811070372/1015 \nCompared to the others waiting in court Thursday morning, the 9-year-old\nseemed somewhat out of place \n\n\nStanding a foot shorter than those around her, the fourth-grader was quiet\nand fidgeted briefly while looking up to juvenile court Circuit Judge Bruce\nKyle as he announced he would accept the state's decision not to pursue the two\nfelony charges against her. \n\n\n\"Don't come back,\" Kyle ordered, raising his eyebrows. \"I\ndon't want to hear about something like this happening again.\" \n\n\n\"You won't,\" answered the girl's mother, Tarina Williams. \n\n\nLast month, Fort Myers police arrested the girl at Royal Palm Exceptional\nSchool. Teachers said she was out of control: kicking, spitting and thrashing\nagainst their efforts to restrain her. It was just after she returned to school\nafter completing suspension on similar offenses. \n\n\nWilliams, 32, said her daughter, whom The News-Press is not naming because\nof her age, has been diagnosed with multiple mental and behavioral illnesses,\nincluding schizophrenia. \n\n\n \"I'm satisfied that the charges were dropped,\"\nWilliams said, \"but I think it never should have gotten to this point. She\nshouldn't have been arrested in the first place.\" \n\n\nState Attorney's Office spokeswoman Samantha Syoen said she could not\ndiscuss specifics of juvenile cases or why the state decided not to press\nforward with this one. \n\n\nFort Myers police Officer Keith Nicholson reported the girl's unruly actions\nat the school had included throwing chairs, threatening to stab a teacher,\nslapping a phone from a teacher's hand, kicking a teacher and slamming a door\ninto a teacher. Her volatile behavior was the reason she was transferred to the\nspecial needs school in the first place. But Royal Palm officials said they had\nexhausted every other alternative with the girl. \n\n\nFollowing the latest outburst Oct. 14, the girl was handcuffed, arrested on\ntwo felony charges of battery against an education employee and transported to\nthe Juvenile Assessment Center before being sent home to her mother. \n\n\nIt's not clear what the exact consequence might have been had the state gone\nthrough with the case because there are no minimum mandatory sentences in\njuvenile court, according to Syoen. The focus in juvenile justice system\noverall is reform, not punishment. \n\n\nJoe Donzelli, school district spokesman, said school officials made the\nchoice to press charges as a last resort in order to get help for the girl. \n\n\n\"I don't think anyone would doubt that there are procedures in the\nsystem that could be overhauled,\" Donzelli said when asked whether arrest\nwas the only way to accomplish that. \"But when faced with a decision like\nthat, it's not one that's made lightly. There comes a point when the school\nrealizes additional help is necessary, and this is the only way to get it. And\nthat's not unique to this district - that's something you'll find\neverywhere.\" \n\n\nWilliams ended the girl's medication routine when doctors at a clinic in\nLaBelle, where the family used to live, began to prescribe experimental drugs.\nWhen they moved to Lehigh Acres, she said she tried unsuccessfully to set an\nappointment for her daughter at the Ruth Cooper campus of Lee Mental Health. \n\n\nSince the arrest, the Department of Children and Families has stepped in to\nhelp the family address the girl's mental health issues, according to\nspokeswoman Erin Gillespie, who couldn't go into further detail. Williams also\nsaid the girl is now back in school, though working with a different teacher. \n\n\n\"Things have been better so far,\" Williams said. \"I just feel\nthere needs to be more resources available before it gets to this.\" \n\n\n \n****************************************************************** \n \nSuit filed against Lee County Florida\u00a0School District by youth\u2019s\nparents; \u2018Notice\u2019 of second suit \n \n By MCKENZIE CASSIDY,  mcassidy@breezenewspapers.com \u00a0\u00a0\n Wednesday,\nOctober 08, 2008  \n \nThe Lee County School District is now facing two lawsuits from angry parents\nwho claim that their special needs children were abused in the classroom. \n \nTwo weeks ago, Board Attorney Keith Martin announced that Cape Coral resident\nTerry Mattox sent a notice of claim to the district over his daughter, Jasmine.\nDuring Tuesday night\u2019s meeting Chairman Jeanne Dozier said that a lawsuit had\nbeen filed by the parents of Caitlin Elders. \n \nUntil now an official lawsuit has not been filed by Mattox. \n \nSchool board members and district officials could not comment about any pending\nlawsuits, but members of the Elders family discussed their issues with the\nschool district during public comment. \n \nThey stated that the district has failed to address any potential problems\nrelating to physical or emotional abuse. \n \n\u201cEvery time one of the district\u2019s failures is exposed, instead of correcting\nthe problem, which would first require acknowledging it, you put on a horse and\npony show intended to deny these problems exist,\u201d said Kellie Elders.  \n \nA report filed by a teacher in 2006 stated that Caitlin, diagnosed with autism\nand bipolar disorder, had her head pushed to the floor after she began to\nexperience a fit in the school\u2019s timeout room.  \n \nThe Elders said they had physical documentation to back up their allegation,\nbut explained that the school district never addressed the issue. Now a similar\nincident has spawned a notice of claim from Mattox. \n \nRecently, the Cape Coral Police Department were called to Gulf Elementary to\ninvestigate what happened with Jasmine, Mattox\u2019s 5-year-old autistic daughter.\nPolice later closed the case without filing criminal charges, and they\ndocumented that Jasmine had red marks on her chin, nose and behind both ears. \n \nMattox also claimed that he witnessed two teachers sitting on top of Jasmine,\nwho was pinned to the floor. Furthermore, one of the teachers involved in the\nincident, Catherine Hile, previously had been accused of punching a student\nwhile working in Charlotte County. \n \nThere is no state requirement for school districts to report when a restraint\noccurs in a classroom. \n \nThe Lee County School District also could not provide the Cape Coral Daily\nBreeze with the amount of physical restraints that occurred in schools last\nyear, or whether \u201cprone restraints\u201d were used or when a child could be held to\nthe floor. \n \nShawn Elders said he has spent much of his time trying to get the school\ndistrict to acknowledge that there is an issue with how students are\nrestrained.  \n \nHe said that board members have described his accusations as \u201chalf-truths\u201d and\n\u201cisolated incidents,\u201d yet he pointed out Tuesday night that \u201cnow we have the\ncase of one more child.\u201d \n \nThe use of physical restraints in schools are important, especially in special\neducation classrooms where they can be used to protect students who are about\nto hurt themselves or others. On the other hand, these restraints are only\neffective if teachers and staff are properly trained.  \n \nAccording to the Elders family, there is a \u201clack of training and adequate\nresources for staff.\u201d \n \n http://www.cape-coral-daily-breeze.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=21872 \n \n ************************************************************************** \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n Complaint filed against PBC Schools\u00a0\n  neglect, harsh discipline of special education students \u2014 lead to juvenile\n  justice system \n \nby K. Chandler  Westside Gazette  10/8/2008  \n   \n  Nearly four years after the Advancement Project\u2019s landmark study,  Education\n  on Lockdown: the Schoolhouse to Jailhouse Track,  demonstrated how \u2018zero\n  tolerance\u2019 policies within the Palm Beach County School District (PBCSD)\u2014\n  originally designed to address serious behavioral issues \u2014 morphed into a\n  \u201ctake no prisoners\u201d approach to school discipline, the Southern Poverty Law\n  Center (SPLC), along with a consortium of civil rights organizations, have\n  now filed formal complaints against the Hillsborough and PBCSD asserting that\n  students with special needs are being subjected to neglect as well as\n  unnecessarily harsh discipline that essentially put them on a track from the\n  schoolhouse to the jailhouse.  \n   \n  The complaint, raised by the NAACP, Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County,\n  Fla. Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities and the Southern Legal\n  Counsel was lodged with the Florida Department of Education, Oct. 1, 2008 on\n  behalf of four special education students who\u2019d faced frequent and harsh\n  discipline. The complaint cites a woeful lack of psychological counseling,\n  and other social services mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities\n  Education and Improvement Act (IDEA), the end result being that the students\n  were frequently removed from class to the detriment of their education. \n   \n  \u201cThis is a systemic problem that really needs to be addressed at the highest\n  levels of the school district,\u201d said Barbara Burch Briggs, staff attorney for\n  the Legal Aid Society.  \n   \n  Studies have consistently shown that by far Black males are the ones being\n  disproportionately targeted and tracked into the juvenile justice system for\n  relatively minor incidences that should have been dealt with by the school\n  system. Between 2006 and 2007, Black males made up a third of the state\u2019s\n  23,000 criminal justice referrals despite comprising slightly over 20 percent\n  of Florida\u2019s aggregate student population. Roughly 70 percent of all youth\n  referred to the juvenile justice system have mental health issues, the\n  Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) estimates. \n   \n  \u201cThese school districts are violating the civil rights of their most\n  vulnerable students \u2014 those with disabilities,\u201d stated David Utter, director\n  of the SPLC\u2019s Florida Initiatives. \u201cRather than providing these students with\n  the educational services they need and are entitled to under federal law,\n  they are pushing them out of school.\u201d \n   \n  Compounding the situation, many elementary students enrolled in the PBCSD\n  with behavioral and emotional issues, despite having an average IQ, were\n  found to lag far behind their academic grade level when they advanced to\n  middle school. Making matters worse, only a third of students with\n  disabilities attending Palm Beach County schools graduated compared to nearly\n  two-thirds of students in general. Moreover, the dropout rate is 13 percent\n  for emotionally disabled students compared to 4 percent overall, according to\n  statistics compiled between 2005 & 2006.  \n   \n  The complaint filed by the consortium also comes on the heels of a national\n  report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) released in September, entitled:  A\n  Violent Education: Corporal Punishment of Children in U.S. Public Schools \n  that noted, among other things, that African Americans were punished 1.4\n  times more than white students even though their alleged transgressions were\n  not disproportionately higher, and \u201cspecial education students \u2014 students\n  with mental or physical disabilities \u2014 also receive corporal punishment at\n  disproportionate rates.\u201d \n   \n  The report coincides with a newly-proposed State Board of Education rule,\n  that if enacted, would permit even greater use of force in schools by\n  administrators and teachers \u2013 something many parents and child advocates\n  reject out of hand as only making matters worse, particularly with respect to\n  special needs students who are already bearing an unfair burden of harsh\n  discipline and neglect. \n   \n  \u201cOver-inclusion and under-inclusion each have race implications, as do\n  zero-tolerance practices that lead to racially disparate suspensions and\n  expulsions \u2013 and involvement in the juvenile justice system for Black and\n  Latino students with disabilities,\u201d stated Florida State Conference NAACP\n  President, Adora Nweze, who was formerly involved in special education.\n  \u201cChildren of color were already being ground down by this flawed system in\n  Palm Beach County schools.

The Southern\nPoverty Law Center and the Florida State Conference of the NAACP are the other\ngroups bringing the action. \n\n\n The action is on behalf of \"all students of the Hillsborough County\npublic school system with emotional/behavioral disabilities, or who manifest\nsuch behavioral issues, and who have been or are being, subjected to repeated\ndisciplinary removals totaling more than 10 school days.\" \n\n\n A similar class-action complaint was filed Wednesday on behalf of five\nstudents in Palm Beach County, said Brandi Davis, lawyer for the Southern\nPoverty Law Center. Similar successful complaints have been filed in Louisiana\nand Mississippi that brought changes for all students, she said. \n\n\n State Required To Investigate \n\n\n The state Department of Education must investigate the complaints and, if\nfound to be true, order corrective action. The groups want the districts to\nagree to changes, including hiring experts to train teachers, other school\nstaff and bus drivers to learn strategies to deal with discipline of students\nwith disabilities. \n\n\n \"It's important to direct the Florida Department of Education's\nattention to theses issues,\" said Ronald K. Lospennato, director of the\nSchool-to-Prison Reform Project for the Southern Poverty Law Center in a phone\ninterview. Two districts were chosen for the complaint, Lospennato said, but\n\"it's definitely a statewide problem.\" \n\n\n Statistics cited by the groups: \n\n\n \u2022Hillsborough led the state in the number of students referred to the\njuvenile justice system with 1,881 in 2006-07. \n\n\n \u2022Hillsborough's graduation rate for students with disabilities in 2005-06\nwas 39 percent, compared with 75 percent for all students. \n\n\n Elia Surprised By Notice \n\n\n Hillsborough Superintendent MaryEllen Elia said she did not get the\ncomplaint until Wednesday and would be analyzing it. She said she has not\nidentified the students named and could not speak to specifics. \n\n\n Elia said she was surprised when she got notice Monday of the upcoming\nnews conference, but will work with the state and agencies involved to identify\nand address the issues. \n\n\n The district has been working on discipline issues for a couple of years,\nElia noted, and started programs including one that keeps some students out of\nthe court system by offering them civil citations with community service. \n\n\n \"It's a concern,\" Elia said of the complaint. \"We have to\ndeal with the issues and still maintain a safe learning environment for all\nstudents.\" \n\n\n Pat Spencer, a director of the Florida State Conference of the NAACP,\nsaid the local NAACP chapter has a \"very favorable\" working relationship\nwith the district that will continue, but the complaints are valid. She is also\nan officer in the local chapter. \n\n\n \"By failing to meet the needs of such students and by adopting\nharsh, zero-tolerance policies that push them out of school for minor misconduct,\nthe Hillsborough school district is helping feed Florida's school-to-prison\npipeline,\" Spencer said. \n\n\n A Third Were Black Males \n\n\n About 33 percent of the 23,000 school referrals statewide to the criminal\njustice system in 2006-07 were black males, Spencer said, even though they are\nonly 23 percent of Florida students. \n\n\n Many of the referrals are children with disabilities, Spencer said,\nciting statistics showing that 70 percent of youth in Florida's juvenile\njustice system have at least one mental health disorder. \n\n\n Hillsborough and Palm Beach counties may be just the start, Spencer said:\n\"I'm not sure this is where it will end. This is just the beginning.\" \n\n\n The complaint does not name the Hillsborough students, but includes\ninitials and details. \n\n\n Five of the six are in foster care, said Sallo, who recently has been\nrepresenting them individually either through her organization or as attorney\nad litem. One is a 10th grade girl who is educable mentally handicapped with an\nemotional behavioral disability attending Simmons ESE Center. Eight years went\nby after she was identified as eligible for exceptional education services\nbefore she received any counseling, Sallo said. \n\n\n Early intervention on behavior issues such as this could mean fewer\ndisciplinary incidents and suspensions, Sallow said. \n\n\n The other students are: a 12th grade trainable mentally handicapped boy;\na boy with an emotional behavioral disability/severe emotional disturbance; a\nboy with an emotional behavior disability; a boy who is educable mentally handicapped;\nand a 12th grade boy with autism spectrum disorder and speech/language\ndisorder. \n\n\n \n Reporter Marilyn Brown can be reached at (813) 259-8069  \n \n http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/oct/02/me-complaint-filed-on-behalf-of-disabled-students/ \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n Hillsborough schools shortchange disabled\nstudents, joint complaint says  \n By Richard Danielson Times staff writer  \nOctober 2, 2008  \n\n\n TAMPA, FL\u00a0\u2014 Even in kindergarten, R.J. struggled in school, saying\nhe often felt like a \"bad boy\" who was \"dumb.\" \n\n\n His problems included behavioral or emotional disabilities, frustration\nat not keeping up with classmates and a lack of coping skills. \n\n\n Within two years, he was suspended regularly for being disruptive. But an\nadvocacy group says Hillsborough schools failed to give him adequate counseling\nand support. \n\n\n Now three civil rights groups say that kind of missed opportunity\ndeprives R.J. and students like him of the chance to learn. \n\n\n The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Advocacy Center for Persons with\nDisabilities and the NAACP filed a 20-page complaint Wednesday with the state\nDepartment of Education over Hillsborough's treatment of students with\nemotional and behavioral disabilities. \n\n\n \"These students are being tragically shortchanged by the school\ndistrict,\" said Marlene Sallo, a Tampa-based attorney for the Advocacy\nCenter for Persons with Disabilities. \n\n\n The complaint asks the state to force Hillsborough to transform a\n\"culture of neglect and overly harsh discipline\" that puts students\nwith disabilities on a path to jail and prison. \n\n\n Hillsborough schools referred 1,881 students to the juvenile justice\nsystem, mostly for minor offenses, in 2006-07. \n\n\n That's the most in the state, though Hillsborough's percentage of\nschool-related delinquency referrals tracked the state average, according to\nthe complaint. \n\n\n Punishing students with disabilities instead of providing them with services\nthat promote positive behavior \"appears to occur more frequently with\nstudents of color,\" according to the complaint. \n\n\n \"This breakdown in our schools has put children of color\nparticularly at risk,\" said Pat Spencer, the NAACP's director for the area\ncovered by chapters in Hillsborough, Pasco, Hernando, St. Petersburg and\nClearwater. \n\n\n In response, school spokesman Stephen Hegarty said the district has\nworked with the NAACP and agrees that in the past it too often referred\ntroublesome students to law enforcement. \n\n\n Hillsborough's number of referrals to law enforcement for 2006-07 was\ndown 20 percent from the previous year. That, Hegarty said, resulted from work\nschool officials did to reduce referrals, especially for matters like\ntrespassing, disorderly conduct and mischief. \n\n\n Hegarty said the district is ready to consider the concerns raised by the\ncivil rights groups. \n\n\n \"Now that we have (the complaint) we're going to take it and look at\nthese cases on an individual basis,\" he said. \n\n\n The groups also say the school district isolates students with\ndisabilities through discipline. Disabled students in Hillsborough are 2 1/2\ntimes as likely to lose as least 10 days of school to suspensions or expulsions\nas other students, they say. \n\n\n But a veteran of two schools with exceptional student education programs\nsays administrators often mainstream students with behavioral disabilities into\nregular settings. \n\n\n \"We really believe that every student begins in the least\nrestrictive environment,\" said Joyce Wieland, a former principal and the\ndistrict's director for exceptional student education. \n\n\n It is through later assessment and discussion involving both school\nadministrators and parents that placements change. \n\n\n \"Each student is seen as an individual, and we want all children to\nlearn,\" Wieland said. \n\n\n The civil rights groups want Hillsborough administrators to hire a\nnationally recognized expert to help develop a training program emphasizing\npositive ways to support students with disabilities. \n\n\n Similar complaints have been filed against Palm Beach County, as well as\nin Louisiana and Mississippi. \n\n\n \"This problem is not limited to Palm Beach and Hillsborough,\"\nsaid Brandi Davis, a lawyer from the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,\nAla. \"This is a state and national problem.\" \n\n\n Richard Danielson can be reached at d anielson@sptimes.com or (813)\n269-5311. \n\n\n Expulsions and moves \n\n\n Number of Hillsborough County students expelled or changed to a  \n \ndifferent school or program over the past five years. \n\n\n \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Year \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Total \n \n   \n   \n Special \n   \n   students \n \n   \n   \n Regular \n   \n   students \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n2003-04 \n \n   \n   \n1,616 \n \n   \n   \n538 \n \n   \n   \n1,078 \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n2004-05 \n \n   \n   \n1,602 \n \n   \n   \n528 \n \n   \n   \n1,074 \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n2005-06 \n \n   \n   \n1,369 \n \n   \n   \n409 \n \n   \n   \n960 \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n2006-07 \n \n   \n   \n1,101 \n \n   \n   \n290 \n \n   \n   \n811 \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n2007-08 \n \n   \n   \n930 \n \n   \n   \n186 \n \n   \n   \n744 \n \n  \n \n Source: Hillsborough County School District.

The complaints were filed with the Florida\n  Department of Education on Oct. 1. \n\n   \"These school districts are violating the civil rights of\n  their most vulnerable students \u2014 those with disabilities,\" said David\n  Utter, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Florida Initiatives.\n  \"Rather than providing these students with the educational services they\n  need and are entitled to under federal law, they are pushing them out of\n  school.\"  \n\n   The goal of the complaints is to bring the districts into\n  compliance with federal special education law and end practices that exclude\n  or isolate children with disabilities. Palm Beach County is the fifth largest\n  school district in Florida and the 11th largest in the United States.\n  Hillsborough County is also among the 10 largest school districts in the\n  nation. \n\n   The complaints are part of a campaign by the SPLC and allied\n  organizations to protect the rights of children who are being neglected by\n  Florida's public schools and to reform the disciplinary policies that are\n  driving youths from school and into detention. The Florida Advocacy Center\n  for Persons with Disabilities, the NAACP, the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach\n  County and the Southern Legal Counsel are part of this alliance. \n\n   By failing to meet the needs of such students, these school\n  districts help feed Florida's \"school-to-prison pipeline\" \u2014 the\n  term given to the plight of students pushed out of the classroom and into the\n  juvenile justice system. Approximately 70 percent of youths in the state's\n  juvenile justice system have at least one mental health disorder, according\n  to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.  \n\n   Across Florida, schools sent 23,000 students to the criminal\n  justice system in 2006-2007. Black males are disproportionately represented,\n  comprising 33 percent of all referrals even though they make up only 23\n  percent of Florida students. \n\n   Information provided as part of discovery in a 1997 lawsuit\n  showed more than 80 percent of students with disabilities referred by Palm\n  Beach County Schools to the juvenile justice system were black males.  \n\n   \"Over-inclusion and under-inclusion each have race\n  implications, as do zero-tolerance practices that lead to racially disparate\n  suspensions and expulsions \u2014 and involvement in the juvenile justice system \u2014\n  for black and Latino students with disabilities,\" said Florida State\n  Conference NAACP President Adora Nweze, a retired special education\n  administrator. \"Children of color were already being ground down by this\n  flawed system in Palm Beach County schools. Now it appears the entire system\n  has collapsed on top of them.\" \n\n   \n Palm Beach Students Years\n  Behind  \n The Palm Beach complaint describes a school system where a\n  significant portion of elementary students with emotional and behavioral\n  disabilities with average intelligence are typically performing years behind\n  their grade level by the time they reach middle school. \n\n   The complaint was filed on behalf of four students, from the\n  7th to 9th grades, who require special education services because of their\n  emotional disturbances and mental disorders. They have been subjected to\n  repeated disciplinary measures that remove them from class.  \n\n   Children with disabilities graduate from Palm Beach schools at\n  a rate of just 33 percent \u2014 compared to 67 percent for all students,\n  according to the latest data, from the 2005-06 school year. \n\n   One of the four Palm Beach students is a 7th-grader eligible\n  for services for emotional and behavioral disorders. When the student\n  transferred from his elementary school to his middle school \u2014 which did not\n  have the services needed \u2014 the school simply changed his paperwork to show\n  that he didn't need those services. Without services to address this\n  student's disorders, his behavior caused him to be removed from his regular\n  classes for 33 school days during the 2007-2008 school year.  \n\n   \n Hillsborough Leads State in\n  Referrals  \n The Hillsborough complaint was filed on behalf of six\n  students, from the 6th to 12th grades, who require special education services\n  because of their emotional disturbances and mental disorders. They too have\n  been subjected to repeated disciplinary measures that remove them from class.\n   \n\n   Children with disabilities graduate from Hillsborough schools\n  at a rate of just 39 percent \u2014 compared to 75 percent for all students,\n  according to the latest data, from the 2005-06 school year.  \n\n   Hillsborough County also leads the state in the number of\n  students referred to the juvenile justice system \u2014 1,881 in 2006-2007,\n  representing 16 percent of all such referrals in the state. Most of these are\n  for minor offenses. \n\n   One of the six Hillsborough students in the complaint is a\n  10th-grader with disabilities and behavioral problems who functions at a\n  1st-grade grade level in math and reading. Although this student was\n  determined to be eligible for special education services in 1998, it was\n  eight years before the school district included any social work,\n  psychological or counseling services as part of her education.  \n\n   Once anger management counseling was provided to this student,\n  the school never increased the counseling despite repeated suspensions,\n  behavioral incidents and even an arrest during a span of more than two years. \n\n   The SPLC's School-to-Prison Reform Project has filed similar\n  actions against school districts in Mississippi and Louisiana seeking reforms\n  to stop the flow of students with disabilities into the juvenile justice\n  system. Those complaints have resulted in significant reforms.  \n\n   \n ****************************************************************** \n \n Disabled Palm Beach\n  County students unfairly punished for behavior, group claims \n \n By LAURA GREEN Palm Beach\n  Post Staff Writer \n \n Wednesday, October 01, 2008 \n Palm Beach county students with documented behavioral or\n  emotional disabilities are not getting the academic or emotional services\n  they need and are instead being unfairly punished for behaviors that are due\n  to their disabilities, according to a complaint submitted today to the State\n  Department of Education. \n\n   The complaint was filed on behalf of four county students and\n  the Florida State Conference of the NAACP by the Legal Aid Society of Palm\n  Beach County, the Southern Legal Counsel and the Southern Poverty Law Center,\n  a civil rights advocacy group.  \n\n   The organizations are asking the state to hire a\n  nationally-recognized expert to conduct a review of the Palm Beach County\n  School District and develop a corrective plan. \n\n   The complaint and another filed today on behalf of\n  Hillsborough County students are part of a national effort by the Southern\n  Poverty Law Center's School-to-Prison Reform Project. \n\n   Superintendent Art Johnson responded by calling the complaint\n  unnecessary. He said the district pumps millions more than that state\n  allocates into the care of special education students, including those with\n  emotional and behaviors disorders. \n\n   He predicted a successful resolution of the complaint. \n\n   \"I think on an individual basis we will be very\n  successful negotiating and working with the parents as we have been in many\n  similar cases,\" Johnson said. \"This is nothing new.\" \n\n   But the lawyers behind the complaint say this is not a problem\n  isolated to the four students identified in the complaint. \n\n   \"This is a systemic problem that really needs to be\n  addressed at the highest levels of the school district,\" said Barbara\n  Burch Briggs, staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society.  \n\n   Based on similar allegations, the Southern Poverty Law Center\n  has already has won settlements with four Louisiana school districts. It is\n  now suing a Mississippi school district whose staff members initially agreed\n  to a settlement and then backed away. \n\n   \"We're very concerned about kids being pushed out of\n  schools and into the criminal justice or juvenile justice systems,\" said\n  Director Ronald Lospennato. \"A lot of these incidents are sort of a\n  teaching moment. You teach kids that they shouldn't be fighting on the\n  playground or talking out in class or talking back or using inappropriate\n  language. I don't think that kicking kids out of school is the way you\n  address the behaviors.\" \n\n   In Palm Beach County, only 33 percent of special education\n  students are earning a standard diploma compared with 67 percent among all\n  students. \n\n   Laura Pincus, the district's special education director, noted\n  the district's largest program for students with emotional and behavior\n  disabilities, at Indian Ridge School, has been used as a model for other\n  school districts. \n\n   \"It is an absolute state-of-the-art program,\" she\n  said. \n\n   Pincus also said that based on students' academic performance,\n  the school met federal Adequate Yearly Progress benchmarks, a standard many\n  regular schools failed to meet. \n\n   But lawyers representing the students say the district is\n  removing students with behavioral disabilities from a normal academic\n  environment, setting off a chain reaction that leaves them years behind\n  academically and with no hopes of earning a regular diploma. \n\n   \"The kids with the challenging behavior get continually\n  removed farther and farther from the mainstream in programs that aren't\n  focused on education,\" Briggs said. \n\n   Among students with emotional or behavioral disability diagnoses,\n  13 percent dropped out during the 2006-2007 school year compared with 4\n  percent of county students as a whole. \n\n   The complaint also alleges the district fails to provide\n  counseling services, parent education or referrals to other organizations\n  that could assist the students or their families in controlling the\n  behaviors. \n\n   \"I'm hoping that this will not be demoralizing for people\n  who work with kids with emotional and behavioral disabilities every\n  day,\" Briggs said. \"There are a whole lot of people who want to do\n  well for these kids. I don't think the district is giving them enough tools\n  or support to do the job well.\" \n\n   \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n EXCLUSIVE:\nAlleged abuse on special needs student in school \n \n By Melissa Cabral, WINK\nNews\u00a0  Sep 22, 2008\u00a0   \n \n LEE COUNTY, Fla. - FIRST ON\nWINK: Allegations of abuse at a Lee County Elementary School. \n \n A parent claims seeing two teachers laying on top of his 5-year-old special\nneeds child. \n \nWINK News confirms the Department of Children and Families is investigating. \n \nTerry Mattox says he dropped off medication at Gulf Elementary School and when\na nurse called his daughters classroom, \"I heard my daughter over the\nphone just screaming her head off.

Don't lay across\nher head.\" \n \nWINK News asked for the Florida Department of Education's policy on restraining\nchildren.

After District officials spoke with the\nparties involved while compiling preliminary information, it was determined\nthat no further action was necessary.

She yelled and repeated phrases from movies. When\nupset, the 12-year-old girl with autism sometimes shoved papers off her desk or\nwaved her arms and kicked her legs toward approaching teachers. \n \nThe staff at her Orange County public school responded to her behavior, her\nfather said, by grabbing his 80-pound daughter, forcing her to the ground and\nthen holding her there. This happened 44 times during the 2006-07 school year, according\nto school records the family shared with the Orlando Sentinel. \n \nShe was held once for an hour and, on average, 22 minutes at a time, the\nrecords show. At least one incident in her class for children with autism left\nher back badly bruised, her father, Steve Lester, said. \n \nLester of Winter Park is one of many parents who want Florida schools to\ncurtail the practice of restraining students with disabilities. \n \n The issue will\nbe taken up at a statewide autism conference in Orlando that begins Monday and\nhas sparked complaints about a proposed rule by the Florida Department of\nEducation that some fear would give a green light to the wider use of the\ncontroversial techniques. \n \nSome parents and advocates think the state's most vulnerable kids are restrained\ntoo often and argue the practice is a dangerous one that has led to injury and\neven death. \n \nOrange County school officials would not comment about the Lester case, citing\nprivacy rules. But they said they restrain students with complex behavioral\nproblems only to stop aggression or injury. \n \nSome of their students engage in dangerous and violent behavior hundreds of\ntimes a day, repeatedly slapping themselves in the face, for example, or trying\nto scratch, bite and kick their classmates and instructors. \n \nTeachers trained in proper restraint techniques step in to stop that behavior\nonly after other strategies have failed, they said. The techniques they use\nusually involve holding the student firmly. \n \n\"It's highly controversial all over the country, and we're very\ncareful,\" said Jonathan McIntire, director of the autism department for\nOrange County schools. \"We never use restraint unless we need to.\" \n \nBoth Claire Lester and her twin sister have autism, and their father realizes\nthat restraint techniques must be used at times to prevent students from\nhurting themselves or others. \n \nBut he was shocked to learn Claire was restrained, in his opinion, for minor\nproblems or when other techniques would have calmed, rather than escalated, her\nbehavior. \n \n\"You step back a step. You don't engage her in a half nelson and put her\non the ground,\" said Lester, an oncologist whose daughters, now 14, are in\nprivate school this year. \"In this day and age? Didn't we quit treating\nthe mentally disabled like that 60 or 70 years ago?\" \n \nDOE's proposed rule on \"reasonable force\" wasn't meant only for\nstudents with disabilities, said Pam Stewart, the department's deputy\nchancellor for educator quality. \n \nIt was supposed to formalize guidelines on what teachers should do to control\nany unruly student. \n \nThe complaints about rule 6A-6.05271, however, opened a public window into a\nsimmering issue in special education: the practice of holding students,\nsometimes prone on the ground. \n \nAlarmed parents and advocates for people with disabilities spoke against the\nrule at a hearing last month, fearing it would lead to more instances of\nstudents being restrained. As a result, the Education Department withdrew the\nproposed rule Sept. 5 and is working to revise it, Stewart said. \n \n\"We were horrified by it,\" said Bob Jacobs, education-team manager\nfor the Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities. \"Where it sets the\nbar is whenever the teacher feels like it.\" \n \n More kids with autism \n \nFlorida's public schools are required to teach students with a wide range of\ndisabilities and have been grappling with how to handle students with severe\nbehavioral and developmental problems. \n \n The challenge\nhas grown more difficult with the surge in the number of students with autism\n-- a nearly 60 percent hike since 2003. \n \nParents and advocates concede restraint is needed in such emergencies, but they\nthink Florida kids are restrained too often simply because they're misbehaving\nor not following instructions. \n \nThe advocacy center, which wants the state to do more to curtail the practice,\nhas a current list of about 25 incidents in which restraint techniques left\nchildren with bloody lips, bruised arms and damaged emotions. \n \nThe issue took center stage in the case of former Seminole County teacher\nKathleen Garrett, charged with abusing several children with autism. Her\nattorney said she used approved restraint techniques. But she was convicted\nlast year of pinning a 60-pound boy to his desk until his lips turned blue. \n \n The Seminole\nCounty School Board has been sued by about a dozen parents upset with Garrett's\ntreatment of their children and has already paid out more than $1.9 million. \n \nSome states have curbed the practice in schools and psychiatric hospitals. \n \nLast month, Pennsylvania banned prone restraints -- when someone is held\nfacedown -- on children in its residential-treatment centers because of the\nrisk of injury. The ban was pushed by a father whose son died after being\nrestrained. \n \n 'Problem behavior' \n \nFlorida has no statewide rule about restraints in public schools. \n \nBut last year, the Education Department, acknowledging concern about the\npractice, urged districts to review what they were doing and find other ways to\nreduce \"problem behavior.\" \n \nThat 2007 paper recommended that districts limit physical restraint to emergencies,\nprovide more training and make sure parents are informed whenever their child\nis restrained. \n \nOrange officials said they follow those guidelines and have been doing so for\nyears. \n \nBut one expert who has studied the issue said restraint is overused. Classroom\nobservations and teacher interviews show restraint is most often used because\nstudents are not doing their work or following directions or because they are\ndamaging school property by kicking a desk or tearing a book, said Joe Ryan, an\nassistant professor of special education at Clemson University. \n \n\"A majority of times they [restraint techniques] are used, they are\nuncalled for,\" Ryan said. \n \nThough he does not favor a ban on restraint, he thinks states and schools need\nto find ways to minimize problem behavior and calm situations to make restraint\nless necessary. \n \nRestraining children is dangerous and often useless because it does little to\nchange youngsters' behavior, he said. The repeated restraint of the same child\nshould serve as a \"red flag\" to educators that what they are doing\nisn't working, he added. \n \nPhyllis Musumeci, a Palm Beach County mother, helped organize some of the\nparents who spoke against the proposed rule at the hearing. \n \nShe is slated to speak about restraints Tuesday at the statewide autism\nconference, convinced they are used too often and to the detriment of students. \n \nHer son, diagnosed with autism and other disorders, was restrained 89 times in\nhis public middle school, she said. \n \n\"A lot of these children don't communicate well,\" she said.\n\"Let's try to figure out what's going on and what they need,\" she\nadded. \n \n\"I'm not saying the teachers and the aides have an easy job, because I\nknow they don't. But what they're doing to children is not right.\" \n \n \n \n http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/education/orl-restraint1408sep14,0,3619683.story?page=1 \n \nLeslie Postal can be reached at lpostal@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5273.  \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \n \nThis is what some Florida teachers think of our children\n(Unruly?

Since then, the board has adopted stricter policies. If a teacher\nrestrains a child, he is required to inform the parent and explain the\ncircumstances surrounding the decision. The proposed state rule would allow\nonly \"the minimal force necessary to prevent undue harm or injury to the\nstudent(s) or others or significant damage to property.\" It also states\nthat the force should \"not be used as an instrument for the educator's\nanger or frustration with a situation or student.\" But the wording was not\ncomfort enough for some parents. \"It sounds as though what we are doing is\nin a sense legitimizing the physical handling and potential abuse of our\nchildren,\" said parent Suzy Girard of Boca Raton. She compared the\nproposed rule to \"throwing grease on a kitchen fire.\" \n\n\nThe state Board of Education will vote on the rule, its first governing the\nuse of reasonable force, on Oct. 21. \n\n\n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Palm Beach County teacher fired for putting\nstudent in closet   \n \n June 6, 2008 \n BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- A Palm\nBeach County teacher has been fired because school officials say she put a\nstudent in a closet as punishment -- again. \n\n\n Rutha Scott was suspended for 71\ndays without pay in 2006 for placing a misbehaving student in a storage room at\na Boca Raton high school. The school board voted unanimously on Wednesday to\nfire Scott after an investigation showed that she placed a student in a dark\nstorage room in February. \n\n\n Scott denied the allegations\nwhen questioned by a school police officer. Authorities say there wasn't enough\nevidence to bring criminal charges against the teacher. \n\n\n Scott's attorney says she plans\nto appeal the firing. \n\n\n \n ******************************************************************\u00a0 \n \n Child Abuse By\nTeacher Brushed Aside By Port St. Lucie Public School System \n \n May 2008 \n \n On Friday, May\n23rd, at Morningside Elementary school in Port St. Lucie, teacher Wendy\nPortillo, decided to punish her autistic student Alex Barton for his annoying\nbehaviors by parading him in front of the class, instructing every student to\ntell Alex what they don't like about him and then organizing a student vote to\ndetermine whether Alex may continue with the class or should be voted out of\nthe class. Alex listened to his classmates describe him as\n\"disgusting\" and \"annoying\" and then by a 14 to 2 margin,\nAlex watched his peers vote him out of his class. After the class vote, Alex was\nasked how he felt, to which he responded, \"I feel sad.\" Alex was then\nescorted by teacher Portillo to the principals office, however, due to mental\nanguish he was soon thereafter taken to the school nurse station where he\nremained for the rest of the day. At no time during the day were his parents\nnotified. In fact, Alex's mother only learned of the incident when Alex spoke\nof the ordeal in the car on the way home. \n \n Alex is in the\nprocess of being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism. Alex\nbegan the testing process in February at the suggestion of Morningside\nPrincipal Marcia Cully. While teacher Wendy Portillo initially did not\nacknowledge she was aware of Alex's condition, documents have since been\nrecovered showing she attended several of Alex's autistic evaluation sessions. \n \n Ms. Portillo's\naction of parading Alex in front of his peers was nothing short of an act of\npure humiliation to embarrass Alex in front of his peer group, embark every\nother 5 year old to chastise and disgrace Alex for her purpose and impose pure\nshame upon Alex for a disease he cannot control.  Portillo's acts constitute\nclear and undeniable abuse . \n \n Alex's mother\nMelissa Barton filed a complaint with Morningside's school resource officer.\nHowever, according to Port St. Lucie Department spokeswoman Michelle Steele,\nwhile the teacher did confirm the incident took place, the state attorney's\noffice concluded the matter did not meet the criteria for emotional child\nabuse, so no criminal charges will be filed. As can be expected, the teachers union\nsides with and defends teacher Portillo, further continuing the theme of carte\nblanche placement of  teacher interests ahead of\nstudent interests .\n \n \n Alex hasn't been\nback to school since. His mother indicates he begins screaming when she brings\nhim with her to drop off his sibling at the school and she has heard him\nrepeating the phrase \"I'm not special.\" She believes he is reliving\nthe incident. \n \n St. Lucie School's\nspokeswoman Janice Karst said the district is investigating the incident, but\ncould not make any further comment. Vern Melvin, Department of Children and\nFamilies circuit administrator, confirmed the agency is investigating an\nallegation of abuse at Morningside but said he could not elaborate. \n \n http://www.myfloridarepresentatives.com/alexbarton.htm \n \n ****************************************************************** \u00a0 \n \n May 2008 \n \n \n \n The Florida\nDepartment of Education has agreed to a settlement with a Lee County teacher it\nwas investigating on  \n \n allegations she\nhad hit at least two disabled students while she worked in Charlotte County. \n \n http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080525/NEWS0104/80525014/1075   \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Police Say Florida\u00a0Teacher Abused Students \n \n Staff Report  \n \n Published\nFriday, Feb. 22, 2008 at 8:38 a.m. \n \n VENICE,\nFL \u00a0\u2014 A Venice\nElementary School teacher is under arrest this morning, charged with the abuse\nof mentally handicapped students in her\u00a0classroom.\u00a0 Venice police say\nDiana Z.

She's charged with four counts of aggravated\nchild\u00a0abuse.\u00a0 Police reports say that O\u2019Neill routinely hurt four of\nthe students in her\u00a0class. \n \n Girl,\n7, punished with \"body sock\" \n \n Parents of a\n7-year-old girl, who has the motor skills of an 11- to 14-month-old child, say\nthe teacher\u2019s physical abuse caused their daughter to lose enthusiasm. She had\ntrouble sleeping and became quick-tempered, police reports\u00a0state. \nAides reported O\u2019Neill had kicked the girl in the legs, hit her in the head\nwith objects, pushed her to the floor and used a \u201cweighted blanket\u201d and a \u201cbody\nsock\u201d \u2014 two therapy tools that restrict movement \u2014 to punish\u00a0her. \nThe aides told police that O\u2019Neill told the girl to get out of a chair on Oct.\n12 and gave her \u201ca good push,\u201d causing the girl to trip and hit her head on the\nfloor so hard she started to cry, although she rarely\u00a0cries. \nThe girl went to the school nurse, who filled out an incident report based on\nwhat O\u2019Neill told her \u2014 that the girl \u201ctripped on chair leg \u2014 fell backwards on\nfloor,\u201d police records\u00a0state. \nThe aides told police O\u2019Neill struck the girl numerous times in December,\nincluding three times with a board and with her hand on Dec. 5; with her hand,\nan arm brace and twice with a binder on Dec. 12; with an arm brace on Dec. 17;\nand with a water bottle on Jan.\u00a014. \nWhen O\u2019Neill pushed the girl on Jan. 18, she hit her head on a metal door frame\nand caused a lump, but O\u2019Neill reported the girl \u201cfell into a wall\u201d and had\n\u201czero sign of head injury, applied ice,\u201d police\u00a0said. \nA week later, O\u2019Neill got out a blue weighted blanket and wrapped up the girl\nfrom head to toe with her hands at her side, and then let her go, one aide\ntold\u00a0police. \nThe girl lost her balance and hit her head as she fell to the floor, police\nreported. As she tried to free herself, she hit the base of a swing, and\nO\u2019Neill chuckled, the aide told\u00a0police. \nO\u2019Neill also used the body sock to cover the girl, pinning her arms to her\nsides, then gave her a little push, and the girl fell into a shelf and hit her\nhead, the aide told\u00a0police. \nThe girl\u2019s parents told police that since O\u2019Neill was removed from the\nclassroom, the girl has been happier, more verbal, more social, a better\nsleeper and less aggressive when\u00a0agitated. \n \n Autistic\nboy allowed to hit head on wall \n \n A boy in\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s class who is diagnosed with autism, seizure disorder and\ndevelopmental delay, has the abilities of a 15- to 24-month-old child, police\nreports said. His mother says the boy does not know right from wrong in most\ncases, and has little understanding of\u00a0consequences. \nAides told police that O\u2019Neill would wheel his chair into the corner when the\nboy acted up at lunch, leaving him there. The boy would respond by hitting his\nhead on the wall and O\u2019Neill would say sarcastically, \u201cdon\u2019t hit your head,\u201d\nbut allowed him to\u00a0continue. \nOnce in the corner of the cafeteria, out of sight of most people, O\u2019Neill would\nalso twist his arm behind him or twist fingers until he cried out in pain, the\naides\u00a0said. \nThere is a chair the boy can be restrained in as an alternative way to control\nhim, the aides\u00a0said. \nThe boy has his own nurse with him at all times because of a seizure disorder,\nbut O\u2019Neill would not allow the nurse in the classroom because she said he is a\ndistraction to learning, the aides\u00a0said. \n \n Girl\nbackhanded in head, reports say \n \n An 11-year-old\ngirl who is in a wheelchair, who had half of her brain removed when she was 11\nmonths old, still has a soft spot in her head where the sections of the skull\ndo not meet. She is also prone to\u00a0seizures. \nO\u2019Neill backhanded the girl in the head, fed her in a rough manner that caused\nthe girl\u2019s lip to bleed and degraded her in front of others, according to\npolice\u00a0reports. \nAn aide told police that O\u2019Neill was feeding the girl on Jan. 28 and backhanded\nher in the head when the girl did not follow prompts to choose between a bite\nof food or a sip of her\u00a0drink. \nThe aide said O\u2019Neill would ram the spoon in the girl\u2019s mouth during meals so\nhard that her gums\u00a0bled. \n \n Boy,\n8, came home with bruises \n \n An 8-year-old\nboy in O\u2019Neill\u2019s class has Down syndrome and a seizure disorder. His mother\ntold police he has come home from school with bruises on the back of\nhis\u00a0thighs. \nThe aides told police O\u2019Neill has hit him in the head with a variety of objects,\nkicked him in the buttocks, slapped him and pulled a rag from his mouth so hard\nthat it removed a\u00a0tooth. \nO\u2019Neill also used a gait belt as a leash that left bruises and scratches on the\nboy\u2019s back and\u00a0neck. \nThe boy just learned to walk and gets tired, and one day O\u2019Neill placed a cloth\nbelt across his chest and under his arms when he sat down on the floor to rest,\nthe aides told\u00a0police. \nO\u2019Neill used the belt to yank the boy to his feet several times, telling him,\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to stand,\u201d aides told\u00a0police. \nAnother time, the boy bit down on a wash cloth O\u2019Neill was using to clean out\nhis mouth and she yanked it out so hard that a bottom tooth went flying over\nher right shoulder, the aides told\u00a0police. \n \n Last modified:\nFriday, Feb. 22, 2008 at 2:51 p.m.  \n \n http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20080222/BREAKING/338604838/-1/news \n \n \n \n ****************************************************************** \n Florida\nWeb site brings teacher misconduct to light \n\n\n April 28,\n2008\u00a0  By\nRON MATUS and DONNA WINCHESTER\u00a0  St. Petersburg Times  \n\n\n Most are cases Florida parents\nnever heard about. \n\n\n Pinellas Park Elementary: A\nthird-grade teacher reportedly doesn't notice his students engaged in oral sex.\nWalsingham Elementary in Largo: A kindergarten teacher is investigated for\nslamming a door on a girl's hand so hard it severs a tendon.

She applied for a\nposition to teach autistic students in kindergarten through second grade at\nGulf Elementary in Cape Coral. She was hired in August 2006. \n \nThe Charlotte school district was taking steps toward firing her over\nallegations that she hit two students when she resigned in December 2005,\nAssistant Superintendent Doug Whittaker said, adding that the evidence was\noverwhelming. \n Error! Filename not\nspecified. \n\n\n The Florida Department of\nEducation is investigating her conduct in Charlotte County.\u00a0 Depending on\nthe state\u2019s findings, Hile could continue teaching with no consequences, be\nsanctioned or lose her teaching license. \n \nGreg Adkins, Lee\u2019s director of human resources, said his department didn\u2019t know\nthat the Florida Department of Education was conducting a probe into the\nallegations during her tenure at Charlotte Harbor Center, a public school for\nchildren with disabilities. It\u2019s unclear how long the state has been\ninvestigating Hile.  \n \nLee initially was unaware of the investigation because none of the alleged\nincidents happened in the district, Adkins said. Hile\u2019s application also didn\u2019t\nspecify that the state was investigating her.  \n \nThe Foundation for Lee County Public Schools, which runs the Golden Apple\nTeacher Recognition Program, initially named Hile as one of 36 finalists for\nthe honor in January. The six Golden Apple winners receive $3,000 cash and\nseveral other awards. The teachers also are honored for their work at a gala in\nApril. \n\n\n Adkins said that when the\ndistrict received the foundation\u2019s list of finalists, his department checked to\nsee whether any were being \u2014 or had been \u2014 investigated by the Lee district.\nNone of the nominees was, Adkins said. \n \nBut the district\u2019s Exceptional Student Education office received information\nafter the list of nominees was published in January that the state was\ninvestigating Hile. The exceptional student office forwarded the information to\nhuman resources, which notified the foundation, Adkins said.  \n \nHile was reprimanded in April 1994 for using inappropriate language and for\nhitting a student in the face. In November 1994, she was given a memo stating\nher classroom environment was \u201cunsafe.\u201d \n \nThe Charlotte school district suspended her with pay in October 2005 on\nallegations that she struck an autistic student three times after that child\nhit an autistic classmate the same number of times.\u00a0 No criminal charges\nwere filed in Charlotte County.\u00a0 The district was planning to fire her in\nDecember 2005, but she resigned instead, Whittaker said.  \n \nIn January 2006, Hile was hired as an exceptional student education liaison at\nDeSoto Middle School in Arcadia. But she was fired two months later under a\nstate rule that allows districts to terminate teachers within 97 days of hiring\nthem for any, or no, reason.\u00a0 She returned to teaching five months later\nat Gulf Elementary. During Hile\u2019s job application process, Gulf Elementary\nadministrators contacted Charlotte Harbor Center principal Maureen Watts and a\nCharlotte district administrator, whose name was not available, Adkins said. \n \nGulf Elementary and the Lee school district were satisfied with the good\nrecommendations they received from Watts, Adkins said.  \nWhittaker said he wasn\u2019t aware of anyone from Lee County contacting his\ndistrict. \n\n\n Hile is a commodity in a\nteaching area that\u2019s difficult to staff: She has 15 years experience teaching\nstudents with disabilities. And she has more special-education credentials than\nthe average applicant, including the highly sought-after certification from the\nNational Board for Professional Teaching Standards. \n\n\n \n ****************************************************************** \n \n \n \n Honored teacher accused of striking student  \n by Amie McLain\u00a0 3/2/2008 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\n\n LEE COUNTY, Florida : A Lee County teacher singled out for\none of the highest honors in education has been taken out of the running after\nthe program\u2019s director learned the teacher was accused of hitting a student. \n\n\n The Golden Apple award\nis\u00a0one of the highest honors a Lee County teacher can receive. \n\n\n But Lee County teacher\nCatherine Hile off the list because of allegations she hit one of her students\nwhile a teacher in Charlotte County.\u00a0 \"Our plan was to terminate her\nfor hitting another student,\" said Charlotte County Schools spokesman Mike\nRiley.\u00a0 Riley says it happened\u00a0three years ago when Hile taught\nautistic children at a special needs school.

Administrators can monitor the cameras via the\u00a0Internet.\u00a0\nCameras are also being installed more often on school buses, where drivers\ncannot see everything that goes on in the\u00a0back.\u00a0 But the classroom is\none place that continues to stay out of the camera's\u00a0eye.\u00a0 School\nadministrators say that is largely because of objections from unions, which\nargue that teachers' should have the freedom to do their jobs without\nbeing\u00a0monitored.\u00a0 \"Some teachers would feel funny knowing\nsomeone is always watching,\" said Pat Barber, president of the\nManatee\u00a0union.\u00a0 \"It would make many people feel uncomfortable\nand curtail some of the innovative things people do in\nthe\u00a0classroom.\u00a0 \"Some officials also say that abuse cases are\nrare, and a classroom is the safest place on campus because it is where\nstudents have the most\u00a0supervision.\u00a0 That is why districts have spent\nmoney on cameras in more public areas -- like hallways -- where students may go\nwithout an adult or\u00a0teacher.\u00a0 But that is little comfort to parents\nlike Jim Hatfield, whose daughter was in O'Neill's\u00a0classroom.\u00a0 Police\nsay that O'Neill struck his daughter, who had half of her brain removed because\nof damage, in the\u00a0head.\u00a0 Now Hatfield thinks the district should put\ncameras in all its classrooms -- not just those for special education -- and\ngive parents access to monitor them. As far as he is concerned, that might have\nprevented the alleged abuse of his\u00a0daughter.\u00a0 One thing parents and\neducators agree on: Cameras would at least provide proof of what\nreally\u00a0happened.\u00a0 In the O'Neill case, two of the teacher's aides\nreported what they thought was abusive\u00a0behavior.\u00a0 But O'Neill says\nshe was using accepted techniques for working with\ndisabled\u00a0children.\u00a0 Most of the children in her care do not talk, so\nthey will not be able to\u00a0testify.\u00a0 Barber, with the Manatee union,\nsaid she has had teachers actually want to videotape their own classes because\nthey were having problems with students and wanted a record of their work to\nshow parents and\u00a0supervisors.\u00a0 \"Unfortunately, cameras aren't\nalways given the credit for what they can do,\" said Steve Cummings,\nsecurity supervisor for the Charlotte School District. \"It can be a\nreal\u00a0win-win.\" \n\n\n ****************************************************************** \n\n\n \n Where Do\nTeachers Draw the Line When it Comes to Restraining Students? \n \n November\n19, 2007 - 6:57PM \n \n Saint\nLucie County, Florida \n \n \n \n A local mom has\nreached out to News 12 after she says a school went overboard while restraining\nher child.  \nIsaiah Moore came home from Oak Hammock K-8 last April looking like he had just\nbeen in a fight.

It was 10:59 a.m. Wednesday when\npolice officer Tamara L. Neale reported she was called to 705 Winthrop St., on\na call about a disruptive student. The child was upset and crying and wailing\nand would not leave the classroom to let the other students study, causing a\ndisruption of the normal class activities, Neale noted in her report. Lisa\nElder, who is an exceptional student education teacher, was called in to help\nremove the child from the classroom, at which time the child began to hit and\nkick her. \"She had to be carried to the front office, at which time she\ncontinued to wail and cry and refused to communicate in any way or to calm\ndown,\" Neale reported. Avon Elementary School Principal Pam Burnham said\nshe could not talk about the specifics of the case, but could talk about\ngeneralities and school policies. Burnham said any time a student is in a\ncrisis situation, the administration tries to get whoever they can \u2013 guidance\ncounselors, administrators or in this case an exceptional student educator \u2013 to\ncome into the room and get control back of the classroom. \"The first thing\nyou try to do is to talk them down and remove them from the room,\" Burnham\nsaid. \"There are times when the situation continues to escalate.

If the child can't be calmed down then they\ntake it to the next step.\" And it usually has to last a long time, Burnham\nsaid. Every time a police officer comes to the school doesn't result in an\narrest, she said. And there are lots of times when similar situations happen\nthat police are not called. After continuing to struggle, the child was\nhandcuffed to keep her from hitting, running away and from possibly hurting\nherself, according to the report. An additional officer, Allison Smith had to\nride with the child in the back of the police car when she was taken to the\npolice headquarters. She was charged with disruption of a school function,\nbattery on a school employee and resisting a law enforcement officer without\nviolence. The parent continued to be unreachable and the child was taken to the\nHighlands County Jail. A court date has been set, but the date is listed as\nconfidential, according to the jail central records. A counselor from the\nschool eventually tracked down a relative and the parent was contacted. Avon\nPark Police Chief Frank Mercurio could not be reached by press time for\ncomment.

Smith is\nrepresented by West Palm Beach lawyer Mark Wilensky.  \n \n \"She didn't break anybody's arm,\" Wilensky said. \"I\nunderstand that there is an allegation that the child was injured. He certainly\nwasn't injured as a result of anything that Shalonda did.\"  \n \n A witness told police Smith used a restraint that lasted for about\n30 seconds to stop his running from class. Smith, described in reports as 210\npounds, told police she landed on the 95-pound boy.  \n \n The boy suffered a \"spiral fracture to the upper right\narm,\" an injury emergency room staff at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center\n& Heart Institute told police \"is caused by a twisting of the\narm,\" the police report says.  \n \n A worker at the boy's day care center reported to police that the\nboy's arm was \"red and swollen\" and he had abrasions on the right\nside of his face.  \n \n A bus aide told police the boy cried the entire ride from school\nto his after-care program. But she said: \"She didn't take (the boy)\nseriously because he behaves this way all the time.\"  \n \n In a previous interview, Palmieri said her grandson takes\nanti-psychotic medication to treat bipolar disorder and is diagnosed as\nautistic.  \n \n On Wednesday, Palmieri referred comment to her lawyer.

In fact,\nthe school has three such rooms as \"part of our overall behavior\nplan\", Ward Spisso, the school's Director of Exceptional Student\nEducation, told WCTV News.  \n \n Principal\nChristi Moss told the Tallahassee Democrat: \"We have to get their behavior\nunder control so we can help them with their academics.\"  \n \n District\nofficials said there is a progression from a chair time-out, to an open door\ntime-out, and then a closed door time-out -- in which the child cannot escape\n-- after continued misbehavior. \n \n ***************************************************************** \n \n Parent\nfeels intimidated by school board \n \n By WINK News  Sep 12, 2007  \n \n A Lee County Florida\u00a0parent claims she was threatened by a\nSchool Board member for speaking out against the treatment of her child. \n \nKellie Elders was clapping in support of a comment when board chair Jeanne\nDozier got out of her seat, walked down the podium, called for security and\nthreatened to throw out Elders and another parent sitting in the crowd.  \n \n\"She said if you have one more outburst I'm going to have you taken out of\nhere and then she had security officer speak to me I said do what you have to\ndo, what are you going to do put me in a time out room,\" said Elders, who\nhas been outspoken about the alleged mistreatment of her child. \n \nElders claims her 8-year-old daughter Caitlin was mistreated in a time out room\nat Pelican Elementary School. \n \nAfter a WINK News investigation into the rooms, school board member Bob\nChilmonik called for an independent investigation of the rooms. \n \nAt last night's meeting, Chilmonik was pushing further for an investigation,\nwhen Kellie Elders started clapping and Dozier threatened to throw her out of\nthe room. \n \nIn response to what happened at last night's meeting, Dozier said, \"I have\na responsibility to keep everything calm and when someone is blurting out words\nand phrases I have to put a stop to it.\" \n \nBoard member Bob Chilmonik said other people were clapping before Elders during\nthe meeting and Dozier targeted her because of what she had to say. \n \nElders said she feels intimidated and can see why other parents might be afraid\nto come forward.\u00a0 \"I'm there advocating for my child and when I can't\nthere's a problem.\"  \n \n ******************************************************************** \n \n Child Says Cocoa Teacher\nDuct-Taped Him To DeskFebruary 28, 2007 \n \n COCOA, Fla. -- A Brevard County teacher was placed on leave while Cocoa\npolice investigate allegations she duct-taped a kindergarten student to a desk\nas punishment. \"My teacher duct-taped me to that table,\" 5-year-old\nDylan Negron said.  \u00a0 Dylan told his mother\nthat his teacher, Mrs. Maki Monje, at Cambridge Elementary was punishing him\nbecause he wouldn't put his head down on the desk on Friday.

Trial is expected to begin next week against\nthe 26-year veteran of Seminole County public schools charged with physically\nabusing the students, who ranged in age from 12 to 15. \n \nGarrett was arrested in November 2004 on charges that she abused autistic\nstudents in her class at South Seminole Middle School in Casselberry, even\nchipping one boy's teeth by slamming his face into a desk. \n \nOther allegations include beating children, humiliating them, pushing one's\nface into vomit and disciplining some behind closed bathroom doors, where\nscreaming and sounds of furniture banging around could be heard. \n \nDefense attorney Thomas Egan argued that it is vital for jurors to see the kind\nof students Garrett supervised.\u00a0 \"One of these kids actually eats his\nfeces,\" Egan said. \"I think the world will see volumes when they see\nthese children.\" \n \nAssistant State Attorney Donna Goerner said the courtroom setting might\ntraumatize the students and whatever they say cannot be trusted because they\nare not mentally competent. \n \nThe judge said the charges against Garrett are serious and she is entitled to a\nfull defense. If the students wander off or walk out of the courtroom, the\njudge said, he would not require deputies to retrieve them. \n \nGarrett, 50, rejected a plea deal this week that would have placed her on five\nyears' probation and required her to surrender her teaching certificate. \nIf convicted, she faces a possible sentence of 75 years in prison. \n \n ***************************************************************** \n \n Body sox used for restraint against Florida 4-year-olds \n \n Posted Dec 14th 2006  \n \n School officials in Florida are using a highly\nunusual -- and now controversial -- method to calm students that are upset.\nIt's called a \"body sock,\" and a teacher in Pinellas County has\nreportedly been using them to restrain unruly students. According to the\ndevice's website, \"body sox\" are designed to help kids \"explore\nthree-dimensional space,\" but in practice they are being used for therapy,\nand in some cases, punishment. The device is made of a cloth-like material and\nzips closed, completely enveloping the child inside. One 4-year-old boy was\nplaced in the sack, while crying, after he had been given verbal warnings to\nbehave. His father thinks the teacher was wrong to place him in the device as a\nform of punishment. \"I don't like it at all,\" said Patrick Holt, the\nboy's father. \"I don't think it should be used on anybody.\" His son\nwas the only one who the teacher reported using the device that day in that\nclass.\u00a0 The school board has opened an investigation, and it did publicly confirm\nthat body sox are approved for use in classrooms but shouldn't be considered\nrestraining devices. \"It has been used in some of our exceptional student\neducational classrooms as a very calming therapeutic and well received type of\nstrategy to calm students down,\" school board Director of Communications\nAndrea Zahn said. \n \n ***************************************************************** \n \n FLORIDA\nParent Says School Misuses its Timeout Room \n Abhi\nRaghunathan, St. Petersburg Times \n \n October 13,\n2005 \n \n The punishment is considered\nso harsh the state urges it be used only as a last resort. It's called\n\"secured seclusion\" and allows teachers to confine children, many of\nwhom suffer from severe emotional problems, in tiny, sealed rooms. Just one\nschool in Hernando County currently uses a timeout room for isolating troubled\nkids. The small space at Deltona Elementary can be shut with an electromagnetic\nlock. The room is now at the center of a state inquiry into the school's\nexceptional student education program, which provides for the instruction of\nkids with learning disabilities. The inquiry was prompted by the complaints of\nChristine Trueman, 32, who says she has pleaded with instructors at Deltona for\nat least five years not to put her son, now 9, in the timeout room. She told them\nhe is autistic and suffers seizures. Last month, Trueman said, her son once\nbanged his head on the walls of the timeout room for 28 minutes. But, Trueman\nsays, the instructors keep locking him in the room. She says they do it without\nher consent, which state guidelines require. And she says they do it for minor\ninfractions, like when he doesn't do his math work. In emergency incident\nreports, school officials wrote that Trueman's son didn't follow instructions\nand pushed chairs and tables. When she has complained to school and district\nofficials, Trueman says, they have told her teachers can use the timeout room\nwithout her consent. So she recently filed a formal complaint with the state\nDepartment of Education, which has begun the inquiry. State education officials\nsaid they normally open inquiries into complaints that cannot be resolved right\naway. \"With my son's medical condition, he's not supposed to be in\nthere,\" Trueman said. \"But he's always in there.\"\u00a0 While\nthe state allows districts to establish procedures on how to use timeout rooms,\nit issued a set of guidelines to oversee the practice in a 1992 technical\nassistance paper.\u00a0\u00a0The guidelines also call for parental consent, and\nsay the practice should be used only in drastic cases, such as \"to prevent\nacute self-mutilative behavior\" or \"in an emergency when student\nshows evidence that he or she may injure others.\" \"Parental\nnotification is essential,\" the guidelines say. \"Before secured\nseclusion can be used with a student, the school should have on file a\npermission slip signed and dated by the parent/guardian; this should be updated\nannually.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Deltona principal Beverly Chapin said she could not\ncomment, but stood by the school's teachers.\u00a0 Deltona is one of the\ndistrict's \"center schools\" for ESE, a designation that signifies it\nhas the resources and staff to deal with learning-disabled kids.\u00a0 About 30\npercent of the school's 1,033 students are classified as ESE. \"We just\nhave an excellent ESE program. \u00a0I really do believe that,\" Chapin\nsaid.\u00a0 \"We do follow the district's safety\nprocedures.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Weber said the timeout room at Deltona meets all\nstate construction requirements, which specify the room be at least 40 square\nfeet and have a window so instructors can observe the kids they put\ninside.\u00a0 State rules also require the electromagnetic locks on timeout\nrooms to engage only when an instructor stands at the door and pushes a button\nor other device.\u00a0 The construction rules force instructors to make sure\nthe kids don't hurt themselves while isolated.\u00a0 But the behavioral\nproblems that force teachers to lock some troubled children in sealed rooms\nalso make the punishment especially hard on kids like Trueman's son.\u00a0 Her\nson, whom the Times is not naming because he is a minor, often comes home with\nsoiled clothes. \u00a0Even though he's in the fourth grade, he is still\nacademically at a second-grade level, Trueman said. The boy also suffers from\nautism, a neurological disability that impairs social interaction and\ncommunication skills, according to the Autism Society of America. He has other\nphysical problems as well: Trueman has given school officials notes from her\nson's doctor, who asked them to monitor her son's heart rate during times of\nstress. \"Also, this patient has a seizure disorder.\u00a0 Please do not\nallow him to bang his head on a wall,\" Dr. Russell T.\u00a0 In recent\nyears, however, many schools have abandoned the practice, believing it does\nlittle to change a student's behavior or teach other lessons.\u00a0 Lise Fox, a\nUniversity of South Florida professor in the department of child and family\nstudies, said research has produced far better alternatives.\u00a0 Fox said\nschools now try to identify the factors in a curriculum or school environment\nthat cause emotionally troubled students to misbehave. Then, she said, schools\nchange those factors so kids can behave and participate in class rather than\nbeing confined in isolation. \"You should try to understand (why) a child\nis behaving in such a manner, and figure out a plan,\" Fox said. But\nTrueman says Deltona officials have failed to do that. \u00a0Instead of making\nchanges to her son's curriculum, she said, district officials are resorting to\nthe timeout room, which she says should never be used because she has refused\nto give her consent for him to be put in such a room. Trueman has asked, for\nexample, for her son to learn on a computer rather than filling out handouts.\nShe said teachers just don't respond to such requests. Trueman has complained\nabout her son's treatment before, and gotten results. Trueman, who lives in\nSpring Hill, knows how difficult it is for teachers to educate kids with severe\nemotional problems.\u00a0 But she's tired of watching her son regress\nacademically, of watching him come home with bruises, or soiled clothes, or\nlittle new knowledge, and of knowing he spends a chunk of many school days\nlocked in the secured seclusion room.\u00a0 \"It's been the same problems\nfor years,\" she said. \u00a0\"They keep giving me the runaround.\" \n \n \n \n ******************************************************************* \n \n \n \n A grieving mother in Florida\u00a0wants to know why her disabled\n12-year-old son died in a group-home van \n \n \u00a0 \n \n 5/2006 \n \n She said a caregiver ``told me he was kicking the [van] window and\nthat was the reason they had to sit him down and put his arms behind his back\nto restrain him so he'll calm down in the van.'' \n \n The emergency order, which doesn't name staffers, says at the flea\nmarket, three staff and four kids went inside, ``leaving one staff person alone\nwith the remaining children in the van. The driver states that when he came\nback, [Denis] began yelling, screaming and kicking, so he asked the other staff\nperson if she needed help. Reportedly, she declined it.'' \n \n The report says the driver heard Denis talking and thought he was\nall right, ``then suddenly noticed that D.M. was silent and nonresponsive. They\ntook him out of the van and attempted to revive him and called 911.'' \n \n The staffer left in the van ''reported that she laid D.M. down on\nthe seat and restrained his legs,'' the report says, then ``turned him over on\nhis back and noticed he was not breathing. . . . She denied using excessive\nforce.'' \n \n ******************************************************************** \n \n Mental\nHealth America is firmly convinced that restraint and seclusion have no\ntherapeutic value, contribute to human suffering and have frequently resulted\nin severe emotional and physical harm, and even death. \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://floridafamiliesagainstrestraint.blogspot.com/", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-restraint-students-schools-sidebar20110409,0,5060035.story", "http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110420/BREAKINGNEWS/110420022/Elementary-employee-arrested-child-abuse-charges", "http://www.ocala.com/article/20110413/ARTICLES/110419864/-1/entertainment02?Title%3DSchool-system-considers-cameras-in-some-classrooms&tc=ar", "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20110416/ARTICLE/110419588/-1/SPORTS?Title=Area-schools-rehire-banned-substitutes&tc=ar", "http://www.clickorlando.com/news/27610276/detail.html", "http://bio.tribune.com/LesliePostal", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-restraint-students-schools-20110409,0,4775052.story?page=2", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/schools/palm-beach-county-school-leaders-want-input-on-1381265.html", "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20110113/ARTICLE/101131062/2416/NEWS", "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20110113/BREAKING/110119896/2416/NEWS?Title=UPDATE-Fired-deputy-had-prior-reprimand", "http://tomlyonstheblog.blogs.heraldtribune.com/10088/firefighters-should-have-stopped-deputys-arrest-on-bus-bad-idea/", "http://www.ocala.com/article/20101207/ARTICLES/101209760/1001/news01?Title=School-district-Teacher-aide-verbally-abused-disabled-student&tc=ar", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ocalacom/127215563985799", "mailto:joe.callahan@starbanner.com", "http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/southeast-volusia/2010/12/04/aide-charged-with-abusing-autistic-boy.html", "http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/nov/04/041857/student-with-bloody-eyes-will-likely-change-school/", "http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/region_c_palm_beach_county/west_palm_beach/autistic-student-bitten-by-substitute-teacher", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/schools/technique-leaves-second-grader-with-bruises-sprain-busted-963957.html", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/schools/bruises-and-a-tip-from-another-parent-lead-964032.html", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/schools/coming-sunday-when-your-child-is-restrained-963063.html", "http://www2.tbo.com/video/2010/sep/15/fighting-a-teachers-return--29252/video-news/", "http://mysite.verizon.net/resznz7x/", "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100908/ARTICLE/9081068/2055/NEWS?Title=Manatee-teacher-on-path-to-being-fired", "mailto:chris.odonnell@heraldtribune.com", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/legislature-passes-bill-limiting-restraints-on-disabled-kids-652250.html", "http://www.flsenate.gov/data/session/2010/House/bills/billtext/pdf/h107303e1.pdf", "http://www.wftv.com/video/22858039/index.html?treets=orlc&tml=orlc_8pm&ts=T&tmi=orlc_8pm_1_07000103162010", "http://www.wftv.com/countybycounty/22715680/detail.html", "http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/flagler/2010/03/02/teacher-accused-of-abusing-special-needs-student.html", "mailto:kenya.woodard@news-jrnl.com", "mailto:mcassidy@breezenewspapers.com", "http://www.cape-coral-daily-breeze.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=21872", "http://www.thewestsidegazette.com/news/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=91745&sID=4&ItemSource=L", "", "http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/oct/02/me-complaint-filed-on-behalf-of-disabled-students/", "http://www.winknews.com/news/local/29342944.html", "file:///C:/Users/kwombles/Downloads/attachments_2011_04_28/4-25-2011%20Florida%20Parent%20Testimonials%20and%20news%20articles%20on%20R%20&%20S.docx", ""], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/florida-families-against-restraint-and.html", "title": "\nFlorida Families against Restraint and Seclusion: Testimonials\n"},

In a world in which religion no longer dominates our culture and for many people no longer lives and breathes, providing the answers for all life\u2019s mysteries and meanings, the stories we listen to, watch, or read often become the essential framework on which we hang our own life narratives. Even when we maintain a religious belief structure, it is often not the dominant feature of our lives, and the stories we enjoy are often much more immediate and relevant. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is a scattering thing, one that further fragments our society as we rarely have the same tastes and experiences any more, but it is also a left-hand pathway of being, in which we are all free to find our own ways to be, our own meanings, and our own band of merry travelers to move along with. One band of travelers I choose to be on this journey with is other special needs families. There is a commonality of experience that often, especially if you segment yourself even further into a particular faction, provides instant bonding and acceptance. It also provides an already established framework to build one\u2019s narrative upon. In the online autism world, the most obvious division is between the neurodiversity advocates and the curebies (for whom I am subsuming the biomed, anti-vaccine, alternative medicine advocates). This dichotomy provides a wonderful framework for whichever side one chooses. Both cast themselves as the white hats with the other side as the black hats. It\u2019s a heady, winning cocktail: instant conflict and the chance to consider oneself as the white knight fighting against impossible odds in the name of one\u2019s child or one\u2019s self, whichever way it goes. It\u2019s an interesting cultural experience to watch play out, to say the least, and an even more interesting one to be a part of, to be both observer and participant. Very rarely do folks cross party lines, and true friendships between folks across the divides, especially on the extreme sides, are rare. Look at the advantages, though: instant membership, rules, support, and an enemy to fight. It\u2019s not at all a surprise, I think, to see these divides occur, especially in a population that already tends towards dichotomous thinking. Not all families online participate in this division, and there is a large (although perhaps less visible) contingent that is focused on supporting others without requiring allegiance and in helping their children and themselves function to their best ability. It\u2019s a lovely community to be a part of, and it encompasses autistic individuals and families both. In this community, when there\u2019s a difference of opinion on causation or treatment, there\u2019s less acrimony because that position isn\u2019t the dominating factor. \u00a0Folks are focused on different things. They have a different mythology, so to speak. The tapestry we weave for our lives\u2019 journeys is dependent on the stories we choose to listen to, make ourselves open to. The literature we read, the movies we watch, the music we listen to weave together to provide a foundation upon which to judge our own experiences and the appropriate reactions. Priscilla Gilman in her luminous \u00a0 The Anti-Romantic Child: A Story of Unexpected Joy \u00a0 provides a compelling and emotionally riveting narrative of her journey into the world of being a special needs parent. Gilman begins with her foundation; she takes us through her childhood and the importance of literature, of creativity, of the written and spoken word, in her life as a child. She moves us through her college education and the complete undergirding of her life with Wordsworth as bedrock upon which to base herself. She shares her courtship with her now ex-husband, and how his differences from others drew her to him, how his shared love of literature became their bedrock. Wordsworth, in his immortal poetry, provides guidance for each step of her personal life, and even when (perhaps especially when) his idealism of marriage, motherhood and childhood are far from her reality, Gilman finds solace and purpose in relating his poems to where she is in her life. One cannot live by Wordsworth alone, though, and the music that provides comfort and energy also permeates her memoir; her tremendous love for music and literature are things she works assiduously to share with her oldest son who shows himself to be different, precocious, hypersensitive, and uniquely himself, all while hearkening back to traits he shares in common with his parents. Readers who\u2019ve been on this journey to discovering that their wonderful, unique children are so different from the norm, need so much help as to render them \u201cdisordered\u201d and \u201cdisabled\u201d and in need of a label, may recognize themselves and some of their own journey here. My husband and I, parents to three children who are on very different places on the spectrum, can see where our issues and distinctive traits manifest in our children, and even more so, where they are magnified and create problems that require more effort and innovation. Not all parents are fortunate enough to see and appreciate that reflection; sometimes the differences are so great, the loss so deep, that answers are required outside of ourselves and our genetics and the environments we create around our children. While Gilman seems to have been spared the need to look at outside blame, I think she fundamentally understands what most parents go through on the way to accepting the reality of a disabled child; Gilman writes, \u201cTo question your grasp of your child is to suffer a great loss.\u201d Some parents are able to reconcile this loss, find a way around it to the other side, to the \u201cunexpected joy.\u201d While much of her son\u2019s life relayed in this story is more from the perspective of how her husband and she navigated how to best help him, the last part of the book turns to her son and the strides and progress he makes; it becomes less about her journey and more about their journey together, as it should be for all parents and children. As our children grow, they become more active participants in our relationships with them, and reading about the blooming of her oldest son, his relationship with his brother, parents, and the community they help him build for himself, is truly a joy to read. My copy of Gilman\u2019s book is dog-eared; there are so many places where she wrote something that really touched me, either with its timeless truth or the beauty of its prose so that I had to mark it (and force myself not to scribble in the margins). She weaves the poetry of Wordsworth and other greats throughout the book, making it not just a memoir about her finding her path and helping her son with his, but an ode to the muses, as well, a clarion call for other parents to make their own bedrock upon which to stand. We could all use a more defined mythology to build our lives on, one that lives and breathes and moves within us, coursing through our veins and beating in tandem to our hearts. Upon such bedrock, we cannot despair and will never be lost.

{"date": "Friday, May 6, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0This week, I had the pleasure of interviewing  Big Daddy , a\u00a0fellow blogger-who not only writes voraciously..but has just published his first  book !\u00a0 I\u00a0became\u00a0acquainted with Big Daddy and his blog late last summer. He is a very funny and sometimes poignant blogger who shares stories about family, life-and especially his relationship with his son Griffin. \u00a0I wanted to know a little bit more about the man behind the blog/book..So, I donned my Barbara Walters hat and asked for an interview. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kathleen -You have many loyal readers on your blog. For me, the attraction was this statement- \"the purpose of this blog is to show that raising a child with a disability is not all about sorrow, lost hopes, doctors, fighting insurance companies, avoiding quacks, miracle drugs, therapists, and the like. It can be quite fun and is never boring\" Was there any particular thing or moment that made you sit down one day and decide to blog? Was it frustration at the attitudes towards disability? Or was there a specific moment where you said \"I have to do this\"? \n \n \n BD-I would love to say that I had a lofty goal such as changing attitudes towards disability, but the reality is a bit more mundane. \u00a0\u00a0 I'm very big on self promoting and trying to make myself look better than I really am. \u00a0\u00a0 However, my decision to write about Griffin was not the result of divine inspiration or creative genius. \u00a0\u00a0 It really just fell into my lap. \n \n For the first ten years, or so, of his life, my wife and I spent a great deal of time trying to \"fix\" or \"cure\" Griffin. \u00a0\u00a0 I also spent a great a deal of time working to make as much money as possible to support these efforts. \u00a0\u00a0 (Truth be told, I think part of the reason I worked such insane hours was to escape from the reality that my boy\u00a0 \u00a0 was disabled and so difficult to live with.) \u00a0\u00a0 Then, about three or four years ago a confluence of events, including a major health scare for me, forced me to rethink my life and my priorities. \u00a0 \n \n Literally, overnight, I retired from my profession of almost twenty years and became a full time daddy / sloth. \u00a0\u00a0 Since my wife does not work outside the home, my days became much more leisurely and relaxed. \u00a0\u00a0 I began not to see Griffin as something that needed to be fixed nor a problem that required a massive amount of money. \u00a0\u00a0 He was not someone I needed to avoid. \u00a0 Rather, I started to see him as an extraordinarily unique individual. \n \n A really funny one. \u00a0\u00a0 I mean, he is so funny that writing about him just seemed obvious. \u00a0\u00a0 The material presented itself to me and I started putting it down on paper. \u00a0\u00a0 Before I knew it, I started writing about him every day. \u00a0\u00a0 I wrote, and published, a few articles in magazines such as Autism Asperger's Digest and the Mensa Bulletin. \u00a0\u00a0 The blog just seemed the natural next step. \n \n After I saw how much my Griffin Anecdotes and Big Daddy Cartoons resonated with so many of other parents, I decided to write the book. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Kathleen - Now we have all heard people say \"I'm going to write a book someday\"..usually that \"someday\" never really happens. \u00a0You found your \"someday\" and did it. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 What was the deciding factor for you-what was it that made you actually sit down and write it? Frustration? \u00a0\u00a0 Wanting a Father's voice to be heard? \u00a0What is it that you want people to get out of this book? \n \n BD-Even though, at my core, I am a greedy-self aggrandizing-ego maniac, my\u00a0 \u00a0 main reason behind the book was to share Griffin with more than just the blogosphere. \u00a0\u00a0 Publishing a book certainly strokes my ego and will, I hope, put a few bucks in the bank. \u00a0\u00a0 However, I really do want to share my message. \u00a0\u00a0 Especially with other fathers. \n \n The feedback I've received from many mothers over the past eight or nine months has been how they wish their husbands accepted their child's disability like I do. \u00a0\u00a0 I kind of chuckle at that since it took me over ten years and a heart attack before I even opened my mind to accepting Griffin as-is. \n \n It does seem that many fathers could benefit from a bit of perspective from someone like me. \u00a0 Someone who has walked in their shoes and, to a certain extent, has seen how acceptance (and a sense of humor) can make life with a disabled child so much better. \n \n My book is about acceptance more than anything else. \u00a0\u00a0 Sure there are a ton of poop, fart, and booger stories in there. \u00a0\u00a0 But mainly I share how my family uses creativity, humor, and acceptance to overcome adversity.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I think a lot fathers can benefit from this message. \n \n Kathleen - You are a very funny writer-many of your posts are either comics or snippets of conversation between you and your son Griffin. \u00a0\u00a0 There are some posts however, that are very moving. One of my favorites being when you describe still having to hold your sons hand-and the idea that holding his hand might always be necessary...but at the same time you see the joy in always being able to hold his hand. \u00a0\u00a0 Throughout your blog it is obvious how very deeply you love and respect your son-and vice versa. What can your readers expect from your book? Is it similar to your blog? \n \n BD-Yes! \u00a0\u00a0 Considering that a healthy portion of the book consists of refined / expanded blog posts from my early days, fans of the blog should find much to love. \u00a0\u00a0 The rest of the book consists of classic and new cartoons as well as a whole bunch of longer essays that have never appeared anywhere in print or in cyber space.\u00a0 \u00a0 Best of all, the book also contains original essays by a dozen of the best special needs / parent bloggers out there today. \n \n \n \n Kathleen -What does your family-especially Griffin, think about your book? Do they share a similar perspective or is it strictly from your point of view? \u00a0Lastly, What advice would you give parents-especially father's new to diagnosis? \n \n BD-The whole family definitely shares my perspective when it comes to Griffin.\u00a0 \u00a0 In our family we use humor as a coping mechanism and also as a way to bring Griffin into our world. He understands and uses sarcasm, which, we have been told, is unusual for kids with his diagnosis. We try not to coddle or baby him. Quite simply, he is a member of the family, and he gets the same razzing we give each other. He rarely teases back as good as he gets. However, when he does zing someone, it is beyond awesome. Not only does making fun of him not hurt him, we think it makes him stronger. \n \n \n Griffin loves the book! \u00a0\u00a0 He is of the opinion that I wrote it because he is \"awesome.\" \u00a0\u00a0 He's right. \n \n \n \n As men, we have a\u00a0tendency\u00a0to want to fix every problem. \u00a0By all means, do what you can, but in the end, it was humor and acceptance that made our lives worth living. \u00a0 \n \n \n \u00a0By finding and recognizing humor and unorthodox beauty in our lives, we were better able to survive it. \u00a0Laughter allows us to move through tragic circumstances. \u00a0Similarly, our lives changed for the better when we acknowledged our situation and then decided what we're going to do about it. \u00a0We feel as though acceptance is being able to embrace what is rather than constantly wishing for what is not and what can never be. \u00a0Just because we accept Griffin's condition does not mean we are thrilled about it or that we wouldn't prefer it to be different. \u00a0By accepting it, we take the first step towards making the best of the situation. \u00a0We can then get on with the business of changing what we can and learning how to live with that which we cannot. \u00a0If we never took that initial step of acceptance, we would have been stuck, and if we never accepted our circumstances, we never would have known if any part of it could be made better. \n \n \n \u00a0So there you have it...a little bit more about the man behind the blog/book. \u00a0If you haven't yet-I encourage you to go and take a look at his blog. \u00a0I guarantee you won't be disappointed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.createspace.com/3552414", "http://bigdaddyautism.com/", "https://www.createspace.com/3552414"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/kathleen-interviews-big-daddy.html", "title": "\nKathleen Interviews  Big Daddy...\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 9, 2011", "body": "\n\u00a0Kathleen: As you all know-this directory is free. \u00a0Both Kim and myself are more interested in building a community than in making money for this. \u00a0We have gotten many offers to advertise or sell space on this directory. \u00a0All of which we have turned down. \u00a0Until last week... \n \n\u00a0 We were contacted by  Sweet Pete's \u00a0a company that specializes in all natural candy. \u00a0They asked if we would share some information about them-specifically their  gluten free caramels , with our members. Of course our first inclination was to send them our standard \"thanks but no thanks\"- we aren't interested in advertising. BUT, and this is where I hang my head in shame...they offered to send some free samples. Free candy! Free candy to me-the woman whose food pyramid base is chocolate! How could we resist? \u00a0I admit-I justified it by saying \"gluten free? it's probably awful...but I will bite the bullet if it means sparing people from having to\u00a0taste\u00a0it themselves.\" and \"Anything for the community!!\" \u00a0Oh, I was just so noble-till the candy arrived. \n \n\u00a0 Five caramels\u00a0individually\u00a0wrapped in a little bag. They looked good. I immediately thought \"Well, my boys don't like candy..so, one for each girl one for Omar and that leaves two for me.\"...and then I tasted one and thought \"well the girls are at school and don't know about it, and Omar doesn't really care for candy..\" \u00a0They were  THAT  good...buttery, chewy, melt in your mouth delicious. I don't know how it happened-but my five \u00a0pieces of caramel goodness were gone within the hour. But not all is lost! I do know how to get more! \n \n Kim: I, too, must admit that my resistance immediately melted after reading the email from Sweet Pete's. First of all, how can you resist Sweet Pete? Bitter Pete? Sugar-free Pete? Sure. Not Sweet Pete. No. And I gotta tell y'all, this is a sacrifice that was terribly easy to make for me. No, the hesitation didn't even last a moment and when those wonderful little caramels got here, well, I did better than Kathleen, slightly. I ate one immediately. I savored it! Oh my gods, Sweet Pete's is right, first there's that lovely salty taste and then heaven. Sheer chewy heaven. \n \n I shared, though. You have to be proud of me for that. They're really chewy, so I gave the girls each a half and should have videoed them. It was a hoot; you work for that candy, you know? It's not a candy you're going to want to give kids with chewing issues. More for you, though. I gave my husband a whole one. Never again. I told them they were sea salt caramels and the first thing he said, mid-chew, was \"That's salty.\" Well, ummm, didn't he hear me? The boy was slightly less annoying and said it was salty but good. When I order more (and oh I am going to order!), I am NOT sharing. \n \n I have one delightful caramel left, which I took a picture of to share with y'all. Admire my resistance to temptation, people! It's the finest caramel I have ever eaten, and I am a dedicated caramel eater.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou can order you some of these lovely caramels and other goodies by going to  Sweet Pete's website. \n \n \n \n \n \nDisclosure: Kathleen and I were provided 5 caramels each to sample.

{"date": "Monday, May 9, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Some books you read and forget about before you've even put it down. Some you cast aside midway through. Every now and then, though, you find a rare gift of a book that continues to move you days, weeks (and those really wonderful ones: years) later. Priscilla Gilman's book is certainly one of those rare ones with the power to move a person days and weeks later. It's too early to tell whether that will remain so, but I strongly suspect it will be one that remains a treasured book years from now for me. And sure, I'm biased: I sense a kindred spirit in Priscilla, a kindred love of words, of poets, of language in general, and for the majesty and transport that the specific melding of words by a skilled craftsman can bring a person. \u00a0But even if you're not an English instructor (or a lover of Wordsworth), I bet you, too, will be touched by Gilman's journey, by her son Benj and how their family comes to terms with Benj's unique issues and gifts and finds a way for them to all excel and find their places to shine. \n \n \n \n You don't have to take my word that this is a book you want on your shelves (her book remains on my ottoman, close by so that I can grab it and read from it again); you can read this lovely Q&A with Priscilla and leave a comment (both here and at  Countering ) in order to be entered into a drawing to win your very own  The Anti-Romantic Child . Kathleen will draw randomly from a bag with commenter's names from this post one week from today (May 16) and I'll do the same for commenters over at Countering and two lucky people will have their own copies! \n \n \n \n In the meantime, you can find Priscilla at  facebook \u00a0and  twitter \u00a0or at  HarperCollins . \n \n \n \n Q&A \n \n \n \n You write in your\neloquent and often brutally honest memoir, of Benjamin, \"Will he ever\nexperience genuine intimacy? Will he ever be real?\" In the early stages of\ndealing with the loss of expectations and dreams, although it is quickly\nbecoming un-PC to express this sense of loss and the very real grief that\naccompanies it, these are very understandable feelings. At what point in your\njourney did you realize that although your perceptions of him had changed, that\nhe had not, that he was just as real as he had always been? Is this still an\narea where you struggle, to accept the difference between the ideal and the\nreal? From my own parenting experiences, I can relate that I've found\nacceptance is an ongoing experience, that I often smack up against my expectations\nand reality and have to push past it. It gets easier over time, but it still\ncan surprise me by popping up again. \n \nWhen I wondered to myself: \"will he ever be real?\", it was in the\ncontext of great progress Benj was making in speech therapy as he memorized\nanswers to regularly-asked questions and learned conventional phrases for\nsocial interaction.\u00a0\u00a0 Although I was happy that he was becoming\nbetter equipped to participate in social exchange, I worried that the patterned\nlanguage and scripts we were teaching him would in a sense reinforce the\nrote-like quality of his exchanges and not address his core difficulties.\u00a0\nI didn't just want him to be able to \"get by,\" \"pass,\" or\ntenuously \"fit in.\"\u00a0 I wanted to help him with flexibility,\nspontaneity, being in the moment. \u00a0 I wanted to maximize the chances that\nhe'd be able to connect with people below the surface level of casual\nconversation, to develop the ability to empathize with others and share his own\nfeelings- whether of anxiety or of joy.\u00a0 This is why I was so drawn to the\nwork of Stanley Greenspan and his idea of floor time; his book  The Child\nWith Special Needs  was probably the single most important one that I read\nin those early days.\u00a0 Even as change-averse little Benj resisted our\nattempts to surprise him in play, and touch and mess-averse little Benj shied\naway from textures, activities, and hugs, we forged on with our efforts to help\nhim become better able to tolerate uncertainty and more comfortable with being\nin the world, with all its wonderful unpredictability. \n \nThere are definitely still times when I catch myself wanting something for Benj\nthat he may not have in the way I'd hoped for him.\u00a0 It's never around\nthings like grades, sports trophies, or conventional successes of that\nkind.\u00a0 It's more like moments when he's \"inappropriate\" in a\nsocial situation and I worry that others may be annoyed or turned off by him,\ntimes he brushes off someone's friendly or loving overtures and I worry about\ntheir ability to keep loving him in the absence of reciprocation.\u00a0 Or\nseeing other kids his age in laughing groups; remembering how much I enjoyed my\nclose relationships to my friends as a pre-teenager; hearing about other\npeople's children enjoying their sleep-away camps (not a possibility for Benj\nat this stage). \n \n \n While the way autistic individuals and\nhyperlexics communicate and relate may be different, they can and do form\ngenuinely intimate relationships, although it may require the non-autistic,\nnon-hyperlexic person in the relationship to let go of romantic ideals. Did\nthis realization happen for you suddenly or was it something that took time to\ntake shape? You write that you had to leave your marriage in order to be able\nto get back to a healthy relationship with your husband and to be able to\nappreciate him and that you worried about how your son would see that as an\nindictment of who he was, too. Has that gotten easier over the years, to see\nthat the relationship is there, even if it's different than what you had wanted\nand hoped for? \n \n \n \nIntimacy looks different for Benj than it does for me; it\nmay not take the form of long conversations about feelings, but instead be\nforged in our singing together as he plays guitar, our reading to ourselves\nside by side on the couch, making an online order together, or having him\nexplain a computer program he's especially taken with to me.\u00a0\u00a0 But\nBenj has also made incredible strides in his ability to connect with others in\nmore conventional ways.\u00a0 He's actually a big hugger now, says \"I love\nyou\" often, and perhaps because he's received so much explicit instruction\nin social exchange and so much empathy training, he's a great comforter of hurt\npeople- he never fails to make my boyfriend's daughter feel better when he runs\nto kiss her head and awkwardly put his arms around her if she's crying or sad. \n \n\u00a0Benj has taught me so much about the importance of space in our intimate\nrelationships.\u00a0 One of my favorite quotations from the German poet Rilke\nhas taken on new resonance in light of my experience with Benj: \"Once the\nrealization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite\ndistances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if\nthey succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for\neach to see the other whole against the sky.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He's\ntaught me about the importance of developing a supple and open mind not only\nwith respect to our children but also with respect to our relationship with any\nperson whose otherness is at first disorienting.  \n \nAs far as my leaving my marriage, none of my fears during those years of agonizing\nabout the decision have been borne out. I don't think the children see our\nmarriage ending as in any way an indictment of either Richard or Benj.\u00a0\nWhat we told and continue to tell the kids in order to explain our divorce is\nthat we weren't right for each other as romantic partners, but that we respect,\nadmire, and appreciate each other immensely and will always love each other\ndearly.\u00a0 And yes, my relationship with Richard is still there, and it's in\na way better than it's ever been.\u00a0 We worked very hard to get to this\nplace- having an amicable divorce was of the utmost important to me after\nhaving experienced the vicious divorce of my parents who were never able to be\nat all friendly with each other.\u00a0 At my Barnes & Noble reading last\nweek on the Upper West Side, many members of Richard's family were there\ncheering me on.\u00a0 I am so grateful to have them in my and the children's\nlife, and so grateful to Richard for being the most amazing father to our boys.\u00a0\nI now see him in much the same way I did when I first met him- as an unusual\nand extraordinary person who continually amazes me with his brilliant insights,\nhis patience, and his kindness of heart. \n \n\u00a0 One of the more striking\nstatements you make, one that I think cuts to the heart of the matter for\nparents accepting a diagnosis is\u00a0\"To question your grasp of your child is to suffer a great loss.\" Do\nyou find that this lingers, even when you've thought you've put this to rest,\nthat it awakens in you unexpectedly, and you find yourself forced to reexamine\nit all again? In parenting three children with various degrees of ASDs, I've\noften been surprised at unexpected and unwelcome moments of sharp grief over\ndifferences in what was expected and what is; typical milestones like drivers\nlicenses or high school graduations were difficult for me, but not for my son,\nwho didn't realize a milestone had passed unmet. The first year of teaching\ncollege students my son's age and comparing the differences was a really rough\nexperience, but it's one that passed and no longer causes distress. Part of\nthat was looking at what my son had accomplished, how happy he was with the\nlife he was making for himself. When you find yourself in that emotional place,\nwhat do you look to in order to move past the feeling of loss? \n \nWhen I talk about questioning my grasp of my child, I\u2019m referring to\nquestioning my ability to understand, know, make sense of him.\u00a0 In those\nearly days of discovering that Benj had hyperlexia, I felt that the child I'd\nthought I knew so well had slipped out of my grasp.\u00a0 My sense of him at\nthat point was that he was a quirky, funny, original little being who loved\npoetry and music, was introspective and shunned petty small talk, had strong\npassions and an unusual but endearing way of engaging me.\u00a0 But now I was\nbeing made to feel by all the websites and books I was reading that all the things\nthat had made him seem unique and distinctive were in fact symptoms of a\ndisorder.\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a good deal of guilt that I'd accepted and celebrated\naspects of his personality and being that should in fact have alarmed me and\nled me to seek professional interventions.\u00a0\u00a0 Had this acceptance been\na kind of denial? \u00a0  Had I been unable to\naccurately perceive him?  \u00a0 I struggled\nwith how to both accept Benj as he was and help him improve in weaker\nareas.\u00a0\u00a0 That was in a way the biggest challenge for me- achieving\nthe vantage point of seeing him as someone with a disorder who needed special\nsupport\u00a0but as so much more than that too.\u00a0\u00a0 And I think the most\nhelpful, productive way of looking at it, always, was to see all the\ntherapeutic interventions as means towards helping Benj to be himself, most\nfully and happily. \n \nKim, your mentioning how teaching college students and comparing them to your\nson was especially painful for you really struck a chord in me! \u00a0  Remember the scene in my book when I describe\nmeeting with my students at Yale the day after I discovered hyperlexia on the\ninternet?\u00a0 I say: \"as the students rattled on fluently and fluidly\nand easily about their writing and ideas, their lives and experiences, I had to\nclench my fists under the desk to keep the tears from welling into my\neyes.\u00a0 I wondered whether real conversation would ever be second nature\nfor Benj, whether he'd ever be able to think and reason abstractly, make\noff-the-cuff jokes, engage in sophisticated back-and-forth\nexchange.\"\u00a0 As the students shared details of their academic\ninterests, romantic lives, and dreams for their futures with me, I wondered if\nI'd ever have such meaningful conversations with my own son, and be able to help,\nsupport, advise, and impart wisdom and comfort to him as I had the chance to do\nwith these wonderful students. \n \nIn terms of those moments of grief over the difference between what was expected\nand what is, I had a poignant moment this past weekend when I was reading at\nthe Barnes & Noble in Poughkeepsie.\u00a0 At one point, a tall boy standing\nat the back behind the seated attendees, called out: \"I'm Lincoln, Benj's\nfriend from nursery school!\"\u00a0\u00a0 I hadn't seen him since the two\nboys graduated from kindergarten together almost six years ago.\u00a0 I told\nhim he was mentioned by name in the book- he was someone Benj had always\nespecially liked-, and he shared his fond memories of Benj's perfect pitch and\nsinging ability.\u00a0 It was lovely to reconnect with him, but doing so also\nmade me feel a little sad.\u00a0 Lincoln seemed so much more socially attuned,\nconfident, and mature than Benj; Benj would have had great difficulty attending\na packed reading at a bookstore and speaking fluently and with poise to a large\ngroup of people as Lincoln had done.\u00a0 Then, this morning, kind Lincoln\nsent me a Facebook message saying he'd like to play with Benj some day!\u00a0\nOther people's generosity of spirit and embrace of Benj have meant so much to\nme and been such a source of sustenance and comfort all along the way.\u00a0 In\ngeneral, when I have moments of sadness or pangs at what Benj isn't able to\nhandle or do, I always try to focus on how far Benj has come rather than how\nfar I or anyone else wants him to go.\u00a0 I give thanks for his remarkable\nprogress.\u00a0 And I remind myself that he finds joy in different ways than I\ndid or a typical kid would.\u00a0  \n \n \n Wordsworth flows seamlessly through the\nwork, punctuating it perfectly, even when what you are experiencing is the opposite\nof his poetry. Much like\u00a0some take comfort and find guidelines with which\nto live from the Bible and their faith in God, you rely on Wordsworth for your\nexistential framework. Was there a point where you felt Wordsworth inadequate\nto the task and looked elsewhere? You write that your experiences with your son\nmade Wordsworth take on new meaning; as time has passed, have you found your\nappreciation for Wordsworth deepening and evolving further? \n \nFirst of all, I'm so gratified that you found the poetry so well integrated, so\nillustrative and illuminating!\u00a0 And it's so interesting that you point\nthis out about the spiritual sustenance that Wordsworth provided me with.\u00a0\nMy boyfriend's parents sent me letters this week in which they said similar\nthings; his father said : \"I would have turned\nto God for his guidance and help,\"  and his mother wrote: \"I\ncan see that for you Wordsworth's poems provided the same source of comfort\nthat I would seek in prayer; when you were so alone you found hope and solace\nin the poems.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nI can't say that I ever felt that Wordsworth was inadequate to the task\u2014he is a\nperpetual and boundless source of insight, compassion, inspiration for me\u2014, but\nI did look elsewhere too.\u00a0\u00a0 I have never read as much as I did when I\nwas at the height of this crisis with Benjamin. \u00a0\n I read in many genres: everything from Marilynne Robinson\u2019s  Gilead \nto Howard Gardner\u2019s  Frames of Mind  provided me with sustenance, ideas, a\nsense of inspiration, practical help, and a sense of fellowship. \n \n \n \nI have never loved or appreciated Wordsworth as much as I do\ntoday. \u00a0  Reading the poems aloud when I\nrecorded the audio version of the book made them live and breathe for me in an\nentirely new way. \u00a0  And it\u2019s been really\ngratifying to learn how strongly and enthusiastically my readers are responding\nto his poetry when they encounter it- sometimes for the first time- in my book. \n \n What do you wish you'd known at the\nbeginning of your journey with Benjamin, that you would tell parents in the\nmiddle of discovering their child has a developmental disorder in order to make\ntheir journey easier? \n \nI wish I\u2019d known that I wasn't as alone as I'd felt then, that there were so\nmany others out there who were going through similar experiences.\u00a0 I remember\nworrying that Benj would never be able to say \"I\" or walk up and down\nsteps, feed himself or say \"I love you\" and now he does all these\nthings with ease.\u00a0 I'd tell other parents not to compare their children to\nother children and their parenting experience to that of other parents. \u00a0  I\u2019d say: let go of your need to predict what\nyour child will or won't be able to do; live in the moment and really embrace\nit; take your child on his or her own terms and open yourself to the child in\nall his complexity and mystery and beauty. \u00a0\n I\u2019d advise using a strengths-based approach, one that focuses on what a\nchild can do and uses his or her strengths to address weaknesses. \u00a0\u00a0  I\u2019d tell them that there are so many resources\nout there for people in their situation and that on this journey with their\nchild, they will meet incredible human beings and learn so much about\ncompassion, courage, generosity, and love. \n \n \n \nI\u2019d also share with them these words from a former student\nof mine at Yale; she wrote me last night:  \n \n \n \n \u201cI just finished your wonderful book. \u00a0  One thing that struck me was how often you\nhad to fight the idea -- in others and even, momentarily, in yourself -- that\nchildren with special needs are defined by a syndrome. So many of us experience\nthose profoundly disorienting moments when science seems to be encroaching on\nour most precious beliefs about the human spirit.  \u00a0 Yes, in some ways, we are ALL at the mercy of\nchemistry and wiring.  \u00a0 But at the same\ntime, we are all mysterious, poetic, transcendent beings.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/", "http://www.facebook.com/priscillagilmanauthor", "http://www.twitter.com/priscillagilman", "http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Anti-Romantic-Child-Priscilla-Gilman/?isbn=9780061690273"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/anti-romantic-child-giveaway-and-q-with.html", "title": "\nThe Anti-Romantic Child Giveaway and a Q&A With Priscilla Gilman\n"},

There is a 20-year-old man, who has essentially only eaten KFC skin, and more recently also fish batter, for the past 12 years (since he was eight years old). He has cerebral palsy and autistic-like traits, as a result of oxygen deprivation at birth. He functions around the age of a two or three-year old. \n \nHis family has taken their story to the press. They are asking for advice from people who have been through similar situations, or professionals who might have new advice. \n \nYou can\u00a0 watch the full video here . Please do watch it all, it\u2019s less than seven minutes long. If it won\u2019t let you view it (I\u2019ve heard that some people have struggled to view it), please let me know and I\u2019ll add more details to this post. I just thought it best to let the parents tell it in their own words as much as possible. I am still searching for a version that I can embed to this post. \n \nThe main reason for me sharing this, is a plea to my autism community to offer up help to this family if you can. Like me, many of you have struggled with the eating difficulties that come with autistic children. You\u2019ll need to watch the video to understand the challenges, what they\u2019ve tried so far, and indeed to fully appreciate the desperation these loving parents have to find a solution to this harmful problem. \n \nI\u2019m also sharing this story with a deep sadness, having seen the horribly predictable reactions of the public to their plight. On\u00a0 this discussion thread alone , you\u2019ll see people attacking their parenting, saying intellectual disability is no excuse, even saying that what is happening is a form of child abuse. These parents take the drastic step of reaching out publicly for help \u2013 exposing their story and themselves \u2013 and they get attacked for their honesty. It\u2019s those sorts of reactions that stop parents asking for help. And it\u2019s those sorts of reactions that drive home how important autism awareness is, and how far we have to go. \n \nSo please, if you can help this family with new advice, or support them somehow through this problem and the attacks they\u2019re currently suffering, then do. If you want to email the program that run the story to get your message to the family, their email is closeup @tvnz.co.nz. \n \nIf you want to try to talk to the dad directly \u2013 on the off-chance he\u2019s still monitoring the thread \u2013 he has popped his head in on\u00a0 the discussion happening here . He\u2019s posting under the name\u00a0 harepeka . \n \nPlease do share this story with others who might be able to help too.

My five year-old has autism. \n \n Half the year I\u2019m a full-time mother to my two boys, the other half of the year I tutor part-time at law school. I used to lecture at university, and I intend to return to that career once both my children are at school. What kinds of things do you normally write about? \n \n I try to mix it up! I write about personal experiences with my son (both good and bad), I also like to tackle current issues, controversies and view-points in the world of autism. I particularly enjoy dissecting bad arguments. Every so often I just use my blog to share something wonderful that I\u2019ve found \u2013 such as a video or a recommended book about autism. \n \n Who are some of your favorite bloggers? \n \n I read a lot of blogs every day, and my favourites can change from month to month.

Good Times. \n \n What has surprised you the most since you started blogging? \n \n When I started blogging I thought it would principally be a personal outlet for my frustrations with my son, and a way to share my experiences with friends and family (and whoever else might stumble across it). But I\u2019ve been genuinely surprised at the very real sense of community that comes from being a blogger, and the amazing amount I continue to learn about autism and attitudes towards autism through researching my own posts and reading others\u2019 posts. I was always passionate about my son, but through blogging I have now become particularly passionate about autism too. \n \n \n \n http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/less-than-a-mother-i-the-world-of-oughtisms/ \n \n \n \nLess than a Mother, in the World of\u00a0Oughtisms \n \n Posted on \u00a0 November 12, 2010 \u00a0 by \u00a0 Autism and Oughtisms \n \n \n \n \nImage via Wikipedia \n \n \n \nOne of the consequences of having an autistic child, was being left with the feeling that I am less than his mother: That I am his babysitter, teacher, therapist. I am all these positions and carry the responsibilities that come with them \u2013 the success of my caring, teaching and therapies are assessed by external agencies and the results shared with me. I am given feedback on how to improve, or pats on the back for doing a good job. \n \nThe feeling of constantly being assessed, and not having the freedom and rights of a mother, started prior to the diagnosis since I was initially\u00a0 held responsible for my son\u2019s developmental delays \u00a0and \u201cbehavioural problems\u201d . It was made all the harder to feel like a mother, when my son wouldn\u2019t hug or kiss or say \u201cI love you\u201d when he reached the age that he otherwise could have. \n \nIt got worse once I had the diagnosis because suddenly there were three government ministries deeply involved with our lives, constantly sending along people to assess my son, and my successes (or failures) as his \u201cprimary caregiver\u201d. \n \nI should add that I have often received glowing reviews, and even received the praise that I am the most dedicated parent one of the government therapists had ever worked with. But there have been plenty of \u201cdo this longer\u201d, \u201cdo that less\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re doing that wrong\u201d along the way, that lead to physical and emotional burn-out more than once. \n \nThis feeling of being less than a mother, is made worse by living in a time of abundant \u201coughtisms\u201d. I use that term to refer to the trend in the modern parenting world, where \u201cshoulds\u201d have seeped into every aspect of family life: where once there were many different and successful ways in which you might choose to raise your child \u2013 with your own common-sense, family values, motherly love and family support as all the guidance you needed (or wanted) to raise your child. Now instead you are expected and encouraged to do what you\u2019re told by external bodies for every decision \u2013 from breast-feeding to nappy-changing to discipline. And not following the advice isn\u2019t simply a \u201cchoice\u201d as a parent, it is a morally reprehensible act. It\u2019s not enough to use a legally safe car-seat, you have to use the rear-facing one with a 5-point harness until your child is four years old\u2026 \n \nThe internet and the opening of our lives on forums and social groups, intensifies this effect. It allows both friends and strangers to comment and criticise on parenting decisions, even when (as is usually the case) not enough information is provided to make such criticisms. I am reminded of being on a forum where someone shared a photo of her son expecting everyone to say how cute he was. What she got instead was a barrage of criticism that she had her three-year old still in a highchair, as he was in the photo. She tried to explain that it wasn\u2019t a usual situation \u2013 that they were out in a restaurant at the time and other factors were going on, but she was so upset by all the comments that she took the photo down anyway. \n \nI eventually reached the stage where I took the power back in my parenting \u2013 blocking out the constant stream of oughts, both in regards to parenting in general, and to raising an autistic child. I still take in all the information that comes forward, but I don\u2019t let myself get emotionally blackmailed into going against my mothering instincts, and common-sense. Once I took that power back, I realised how all those \u201coughtisms\u201d were also standing in the way of me feeling free to simply love my son, and not just feel like an underpaid worker looking after my son on behalf of society. \n \nIt has been much easier to feel like a mother to my second-born, because I\u2019ve gained the strength through all the experiences with my first-born. We raise our second son according to our own ideals \u2013 for example we try to follow the Montessori method for raising infants, rather than the over-protective and restrictive modern preferences. I still get the barrage of shoulds that I always did, though at least no one\u2019s attacking me this time around for delaying his development. I still have government agencies breathing down my neck for my first-born, with that unspoken threat of taking away my son if they see something they don\u2019t like, but I don\u2019t let that paralyse me with fear and the non-thinking compliance they seem to desire. \n \nI love both my sons, and always will. And that is the best and most important guide to doing the best by my boys \u2013 all the oughtisms in the world can\u2019t replace it. \n \nI am a mother, nothing less. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/less-than-a-mother-i-the-world-of-oughtisms/", "http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/less-than-a-mother-i-the-world-of-oughtisms/", "http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/author/autismandoughtisms/", "http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amormaterno.png", "http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/theory-one-the-complacent-mother/", "http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/standing-in-the-sun/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcasing-autism-and-oughtisms.html", "title": "\nShowcasing Autism and Oughtisms\n"},

Please tell readers a little bit about yourself.\u00a0 \n I grew up in Los Angeles. My husband dragged me kicking and screaming to Texas when my first born was 1 years old and my stepson was 8 years old. What I didn't know then is that I would end up raising 2 boys with special needs and Texas would be the better place to do so. Though, I love southern California, we couldn't afford to live there and have me at home raising these boys full-time.    How long have you been blogging? \n \n\u00a0  I've been blogging for about two years. I started writing as a therapeutic outlet. Then I decided it would be the perfect place to educate others about the reality of raising two boys with Aspergers. People, especially have a tendency to be judgmental when they see the behaviors of kids with Aspergers. I wanted them to understand the behaviors an the diagnosis.    Before I had my kids, I was one of those people who would see kids having a fit, and think, \"What is the deal? Why is that mother begging her child to behave in public?\" Now I thoroughly understand!         What kinds of things do you normally write about?\u00a0 \n \n These are my confessions, the good, bad and the ugly about being a mother of 2 adolescent boys with Aspergers. My sons are 12 and 15. They both transitioned into middle school and high school this year. It has been shall we say, \"Very Interesting!\" I try to write with a combination of humor and blatant honesty. Some things are difficult to share, but I feel compelled to do it anyway. I love when I get a comment from some one who says, \"Are you living in my house?\"    Who are some of your favorite bloggers?    I am a huge fan of Tanya @ Teen Autism, Jess @ Diary of a Mom is my fresh cup of love in the morning, Jill @ Yeah Good Times provides laughter when I need it most. Laura @ The House That Aspergers Built, is very insightful.          What do you wish people most knew about you?   Once upon a time, I had a life! I was an original party girl, before I traded it all in to become a wife and mother. Someday, I will find her again. She's going to travel all over Europe, without a care in the world. P.S. I love my children, but I can't wait for them to get out of my house!         What has surprised you the most since you started blogging?    Blogging has provided a wonderful community of support, at the click of the mouse! It makes me feel like I'm traveling the world, when I communicate with people from all over who share the same journey. When I get rid of these kids...I'll be coming to see all of you!         If you could tell parents new to the diagnosis anything, what would it be?  The earlier you know, the luckier you are, because you can put therapies and interventions in place. Don't be afraid of the labels. Get your child all of the help that they need, especially in school. Just know, you will probably have to fight to make it happen. Every child with Aspergers is different. I have proof of that right here in my own house with my two boys.         This post gives you a taste of our life in the Circus:       http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/life-in-circus.html 7:25 a.m. -five minutes before it's time to get up for school, Blue hears \nsinging coming through the walls of his bedroom.  He comes running, \"Mom!  He's \nsinging! He woke me up!  Why do I have to wake up to this?  He's ruining my \nmorning!  Why does he have to live here!!???\" I try to explain that it's \ntime to get up anyway.  I ask him to lay down and let Daddy rub his back for a \nminute so that he can calm down.  He's had it with his brother.  He went \nto bed, not exactly happy because in his opinion --his brother ruined my \nbirthday the night before with his antics.  Now he wakes up to this irritation. \n A couple of nights before that Red had a meltdown at bedtime that ruined \nBlue's nightly routine. When Red melts down it's hard to tell what is acting and \nwhat is real.  He screams like Chester from Linkin Park in a rock song.  He can \nmake himself cry.  His words are full of drama.  He blames everyone else for his \nproblems and turns the table on the issue at hand. \"Why are you guys \nbeing mean to me? Why do you only care about yourself?  Why are you making me \nsuffer?  Why are you abusing me?  Why do you have to force me to do things? \nYou're not being fair!  You're being selfish!  This is your fault!  This is \nBlue's fault!\" He balls his fist and hits doors, tables, pounds his bed, \nharasses the dog, he invades my personal space, follows me around closely.   I \nassure him that any physical damage will be paid for with his money.  If he \ndoesn't have enough, we will sell something that belongs to him to pay for \nit. He doesn't scare me in the least, because I mostly see it as drama \n -a way of acting out his pain or frustration with himself.  I have what may \nvery well be a delusional attitude that I will knock the shit out of him if he \ngoes too far.  Mind you -I am 5 ft. nothing and he is 5ft 10\" and weighs twice \nas much as I do. Blue however, sees Red's behavior as a threat to our \nsafety and security.  It isn't fair that he has to live with this.  Blue suffers \nfrom anxiety and these antics make him nervous.  He told his dad the other \nnight, \"I'm just afraid that one of these days, he's going to break something or \nhurt someone.\" My husband says to me, \"Blue is really nervous and anxious \nabout his brother's behavior.  He says, Red needs to go.  He doesn't want him to \nlive here anymore.\" I respond, \"He's also nervous and anxious about \nthunderstorms.  We can't make those go away.  We can't just give up on his \nbrother.\"  Of course, that's not what my husband was asking but he and Blue are \nboth right, he shouldn't have to grow up with this.  Fortunately for \nBlue, a very low dosage of medication keeps his tantrums under control.  Where \nhis brother who is on several meds, at maximum dosage, is anything but under \ncontrol.  He does manage to hold things together very well when he's at school. \n Here at home is another story all together.  I swear I hate this whole trial \nand error psychiatric medication crap! What is choice,  what is real, and \nwhat do we do about it?  I find myself pondering that all too often.  Blue \nthinks the answer is to send his brother away -give him to another family.  Give \nhim to the circus!  The only problem with that is we  live in the Circus. \n  Just call me   the Ringmaster.      I also have a Facebook Community Page, where you can drop in to vent and discuss topics of interest:    http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/", "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/life-in-circus.html", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-karen-from-confessions-of.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Karen from Confessions of an Asperger's Mom\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "body": "\nToday we're showcasing\u00a0Sharon from  The Tumultuous Truth . \n \n \n \n \n Please tell readers a little bit about yourself.\u00a0 \n \n \n I\u2019m a 40 year old mother of three who lives in Western Australia. I had my first daughter at a young 21. I was the first person in my family to be a single parent, and then the first to go to University.\u00a0 I obtained a Bachelor in Social Work and worked with women transitioning from prison back into the community for many years. It was difficult work and eventually I left the profession to start a Solar Power business with my husband. \u00a0My husband and I added two more children to the brood. A wonderful daughter now 6, and Harri now aged 2.5. Harri was diagnosed pdd-nos in October just before his second birthday. Since the day he was born he has kept me on my toes. \n \n How long have you been blogging? \n \n \n \n I started when Harri was 10 months old. At that time I was seeking an avenue to vent as I was so bewildered \u00a0by raising this seemingly miserable child. I had no idea the diagnosis that was to come at the stage but interestingly if you read my very first post I actually mention Autism. Despite that prophetic post, I soon stopped blogging due to Harris\u2019 unrelenting demands. Then after his diagnosis 7 months ago I found all these wonderful blogs by parents raising kids on the spectrum. This reminded me of my earlier attempt so I picked up where I left off. \n \n What kinds of things do you normally write about? \n \n \n \n Initially I thought I would only write about Harri and my responses to our journey. But I have inevitably ventured into broader territory. I say inevitably because I am so opinionated I was never going to stay out of the more complex conversations relating to ASD. \u00a0So on a given day I might be posting inspirational clips of people on the spectrum, discussing latest research in the field of Autism, thoughts about other parents approaches to Autism, my opinions on certain treatments, and of course anything that might be topical such as controversies surrounding Andrew Wakefield or Dr Greier for example. So it\u2019s a real mish-mash. \n \n Who are some of your favorite bloggers? If \n \n I have a blog list that only begins to scrape the surface of all the blogs I read and enjoy so I find it impossible to choose. I always visit leftbrainrightbrain and Thinking Persons Guide to Autism on a daily basis. \n \n \n What do you wish people most knew about you? \n \n \n That I know I come across as an arrogant know it all at times. And that I welcome challenge and dissent as much as support on my blog.\u00a0 \n \n \n What has surprised you the most since you started blogging? \n \n \n \n \n The amount of intelligence and critical thought that so many parents of children with Autism put into their blogs. Though the more I understand about ASD the less surprising it becomes. \n \n \n \n \n \n If you haven't been to any of these bloggers' blogs, I hope you'll take a moment and go read and say hi. If you'd like to be included here in a showcase, email me or Kathleen and we'll get you showcased! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-sharon-from-tumultuous-truth.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Sharon from The Tumultuous Truth\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "body": "\n \u00a0  This week I had the\u00a0privilege\u00a0of meeting and interviewing a new blogger. Sharon from  Mamasturnnow \u00a0 has been blogging for almost three months. I find her blog to be inviting, warm and at times very funny. \u00a0I hope you all enjoy reading this interview-as I very much enjoyed writing it. \u00a0I encourage everyone to go on over and read her blog-you won't be disappointed.. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1) You have been blogging for 2 1/2 months-although you aren't new to writing. You have posted for SPD network and About.com. \u00a0What was the deciding factor that made you choose blogging?(if you'd like I will link to those posts-just send the links) \n I always have enjoyed writing. In fact my mom will tell you that even when I was little and she punished me, I would write stories or poems about it while being banned to my room. Much to my mother\u2019s chagrin, some of those poems were even published in a children's magazine. Let\u2019s just say they didn\u2019t always showcase her in a positive light!\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Throughout the years writing as been something that I have gone back to, especially during rough times. When I divorced my first husband, I filled 2 journals. When I miscarried what would have been Jay\u2019s twin\u2026 another journal. When we moved the whole family to Brazil for my current (the true love my life) husband\u2019s job\u2026 2 more. \n So it sort of made sense that when I quit my job 3 months ago after a very emotional episode (I blogged about it in Putting the Puzzle Pieces Together\u00a0 http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/putting-the-puzzle-pieces-together/ \u00a0) that I would turn again to writing. But this time it is different. Now I write not just for myself\u2026 but for others. I also write for my son. I feel an incredible responsibility to be his voice. I only hope that I am doing him justice. \n 2) What is the most important thing you would want people to know about you? What is the craziest thing you have ever done? How has becoming a mother changed you? How has mothering a child with special needs changed you? \u00a0What do you think about motherhood in general?\u00a0 \u00a0 I lived in New York City for awhile where I studied acting at the American Musical Dramatic Academy. Then I did the whole starving actor thing. You know 1 bedroom apartment with 5 of us living in it. Those were some crazy times. We once even poured laundry detergent into the Lincoln Center Fountain. There were so many suds they had to turn it off for a week. You haven\u2019t lived until you have seen rich people all dressed up for the opera dodging sud bubbles! Of course if my children were ever to find out I did these pranks I would deny it! Ha! \n All the acting helped prepare me for my biggest and best role ever\u2026 being a mom. I really do think I was acting at first. I took on this whole June Clever attitude and wanted everything to be perfect. Include my children. So you can only image the surprise I had when Jay\u2019s preschool teacher told us we should have him tested. Not my baby! Not my boy who was speaking complete sentences by the time he was a year old. So what that he never crawled and did not walk until he was 18 months old. Didn\u2019t every child hide under their desk when a fire drill alarm went off? And did cutting with a pair of scissors or holding his crayon the right way really matter? \n Of course we did have him tested and well\u2026 the rest is history. I actually thank God for that teacher now. Because of her we were able to start therapy right away and it made a huge difference. It also made me re-evaluate what being a mom really was. \n I have learned so much from Jay and still continue to every day. Am I a good mom? Some days! And that is okay because I now know that no one is perfect! \n 3) What is the message or most important thing you would like people to get from your blog? \u00a0 I want people to realize when they read my blog that although I have a child who has Autism, I am so much more than just an Autism mom. Autism doesn\u2019t define me as a mom any more than it defines my child. Yes it is a HUGE part of our lives, but it is not my life. It took a while for me to get that, for me to realize that it is okay to want to be happy. I know that might sound strange, but it is true. \n \u00a0 So I guess that is the message I would want readers to get\u2026 You can have an autistic child and still be happy! It is not always easy to do\u2026 but it is possible. But it is a conscious decision you have to make. \n 4) what is your favorite post so far- (I will link to the post) and why? My favorite post I have written actually has nothing to do with Autism. It is called 10 Minutes of Bliss ( http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/10-minutes-of-bliss/ ). I guess the reason it is my favorite is because it goes back to that point I made before about making the conscious effort to be happy and being able to really enjoy it when it happens. So often, especially as Autism parents, we get consumed with the day to day living. It is hard to feel blissful when your child is melting down or you are fighting with an insurance company that doesn\u2019t want to pay for services anymore. But that is why appreciating those 10 minutes of bliss are even more important. Just reading the post again makes me cry because I can remember what that felt like. I wish I could say there have been more of those moments\u2026 but sadly no. But I am hopeful that there will be. And when they do come, I will embrace them and enjoy every second. \n 5) How has your experience with blogging and in meeting other bloggers been? I have never felt as supported and understood as I have since I joined this autism bloggy community 2 \u00bd \u00a0\u00a0 months ago. To be able to write something and then have someone respond saying they get it, they can relate, that I am not alone\u2026 that is just amazing. It makes me a little sad that I did not reach out sooner. \n \u00a0 I always thought that I had things under control, support groups were for people who were weak and needed help. Besides, I believed that if I told others what really happened in our home, well they might have thought differently about us\u2026 about me! \u00a0\u00a0 I now know what a disservice that kind of thinking was. There is nothing weak about seeking help, about admitting you need support. In fact it is the exact opposite. You have to be a very BRAVE person to put the truth out there for all to see. And to my surprise, no one judged me. All I have ever gotten was support and kudos! Like I said before, my only regret was not joining sooner! \n 6) What would you say to a parent new to diagnosis? \u00a0 Go ahead and get mad, and go through all the other stages of grief, because in many ways you are grieving. You are grieving all your preconceived ideas and dreams of what your child was going to be. And that is okay, because the reality is that no child, whether they have a special need or not will ever live up to our dreams. Every child is their own person with their own life to live. Once you come to terms with that I think it helps you accept your child for who they are instead of what they could be. You start to see all the good instead of picking out all the bad. And even though there will be times when seeing that good will be hard\u2026 it is there. \n And learn to laugh. I know it sounds like such a clich\u00e9 \u2026 but it really is the best medicine. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/", "http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/putting-the-puzzle-pieces-together/", "http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/10-minutes-of-bliss/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/blog-in-spotlight-sharon-from-mamas.html", "title": "\nBlog in the spotlight!

{"date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "body": "\n This morning we're showcasing JoeyMom whose blog is called  Life With Joey.  JoeyMom's blog goes all the way back to 2006; there's hundreds of posts for readers new to her to catch up on. She says she's a quiet little corner of blogland, but when I started looking online for community, hers was one of the first I read. She's comforting and real. She shares the hard times and the not-so-hard times, and her blog is an important one. \n \n \n \n Best posts: \n \n The Crazy Season (IEP Guide): \n \n http://joeyandymom.blogspot. com/2008/05/crazy-season.html \n \n \u00a0 \n \n You\u2019re Not Alone: \n \n http://joeyandymom.blogspot. com/2009/07/youre-not-alone. html \u00a0 (posted below the Q&A) \n \n \u00a0 \n \n A Day in the Life: \n \n http://joeyandymom.blogspot. com/2009/11/day-in-life.html \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n How long have you been blogging? \n \n \n \n I had a small, obscure little blog for a long time- before we called them \u201cblogs\u201d, even. That one was about my cat. I have blogging about life with my sons and autism for five years last week. Over the course of that time, Joey has learned to speak, Andy has become a soccer hero, and I have battled fierce turkeys of doom. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n What kinds of things do you normally write about? \n \n \n \n I write a lot about what resources I have discovered in my journey to support Joey and Andy, and about our experiences with the boys. I like to think about my blog as my sort of cyber-living room (probably a leftover from my days as a MUD wizard), where folks can come relax and understand we\u2019re all together in this. There seems to be so much panic when folks first discover someone they love is autistic, I really wanted to put in my voice to say, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. This is not the end of the world, but you have to get it together and do what is needful!\u201d I wanted to help with understanding what is needful and how to get moving, so that it isn\u2019t so overwhelming. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n It has evolved to also include more about the issue of siblings, and considering Andy\u2019s needs and experiences as well as Joey\u2019s. Andy is not autistic. I think more needs to be considered in understanding the needs of kids who have siblings with officially recognized \u201cspecial\u201d needs. Andy and Joey are very close, which can be often frustrating and irritating for both of them, as well as wonderful and rewarding, in ways that families without special needs simply don\u2019t understand at all. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n So in its way, its just another MommyBlog for the special needs set, and particularly the autism set. Hopefully folks can grab a squishy couch, a hot drink and/or a cold bowl of ice cream, and join in a conversation about our friends and family. We can get together and share what we\u2019ve learned and what we think might be helpful for others to consider (even if we don\u2019t all try everything or agree on what is helpful). \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Who are some of your favorite bloggers? \n \n \n \n I actually am very selective in the blogs I read. I know some bloggers trying to keep track of hundred of blogs at once. I check in on that many, but real reading, very few. I\u2019m actually like that in real life, too- concentrate on the good friends, and just keep the tabs on the others. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n I regularly read\u00a0 Whitter on Autism , as her kids are slightly older but have many of the same issues I am seeing here with Joey and Andy. She also talks about her kids with a candor and wit that makes it easier to swallow the medicine. She has shifted to doing a lot of book reviews, but they are worth reading. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Stimey at\u00a0 Stimeyland \u00a0is probably my favorite blog ever. Her kids are my age, she also has the autism and sibling thing going on, and she loves rodents. That, folks, is my kind of woman. And she appreciates the squishiness of a good couch. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Maternal Instincts \u00a0and Niksmom bring to life a more poignant acceptance of and rebellion against a life with special needs dominating it. If you need a dose of courage, good vibes, hope, and real strength, I always recommend stopping my there for a good dose. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n The Quirk Factor \u00a0and Mommy Dearest is also good for a dose of the sanity within us in the face of the absolutely crazy. She has guys that are the age of mine, and I like the attitude she communicates: they\u2019re kids. And they\u2019re\u00a0 her \u00a0kids, so don\u2019t mess with them. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Mother of Shrek \u00a0is one of my longtime favorites, as her son is now a man. I am always looking forward to Joey\u2019s future, and what it might hold- and not hold. At least there are laws I can use to get him some form of service now. When he is an adult, the fight to be sure Joey is\u00a0 allowed \u00a0to live his life as independently as possible, with proper employment, is going to be\u00a0 so \u00a0much harder. The other thing I love about this blog is the attitude: C may be severely affected by autism, but he is a human being all the same. I suppose one thing I can say about all the blogs I read is how very much these folks see the people in their lives as human beings, and not just flitting shadows. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n I also read a blog called\u00a0 Educated and Poor , and I recommend it to this community as a glimpse into life of an adult just learning she is ADHD- a person with the courage to take hold of her life and reinvent it as needed. She is just emerging from the life of an adjunct- which I am myself. Oh, and she has an awesome mom and stepdad. And lots and lots of cats\u2026 and dogs\u2026 and chickens. How cool is it to own cats\u00a0 and \u00a0chickens? \n \n \u00a0 \n \n What do you wish people most knew about you? \n \n \u00a0 \n \n I wish they knew what a difficult question this is to answer. It is sometimes difficult to tease out who I am outside of being Joey and Andy\u2019s Mom and Allan\u2019s wife and my mom\u2019s daughter; social identities can become so all-consuming. I have little time for my garden anymore, or my sewing, or my stories. I sometimes wish I could take my guys all to the Ganges View and watch the Ram Lila together, the bright costumes and elephants and visions of a narrative so remote from our day-to-day lives. What would Joey think of silk shops and monkeys and the ever-present smell of ginger? How many friends would Andy make among the crowds of children? \n \n \u00a0 \n \n I do get sad sometimes. Life is definitely not what I had planned it to be, nor what I trained myself for it to be. I think I would like others, who may feel their lives and selves set aside and overwhelmed and consumed, that it is OK to be sad sometimes. Whenever they feel sad, I hope they drop by my comfy-couch little blog and take a breath of you\u2019re-not-alone. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n But most of all, I would like people to know that I care about them, and about their kids, their siblings, their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews, grandkids, and cousins who are meeting their challenges the best way they can. I may be a quiet little blog in the corner of blogdom, but I keep my eyes open. I might not follow yours as closely as some, but I do think about every single one of the people I come across here. You\u2019re aren\u2019t just not alone; you are not forgotten. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n What has surprised you the most since you started blogging? \n \n \u00a0 \n \n One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that the people I do know in the special needs community tend to be powerhouse people in their own unique ways. People who care enough to be active and work hard to advocate and fight are all strong, fabulous people. It surprises me how many of them don\u2019t think, know, or understand how powerful, wonderful, and fabulous they are. The attitude of society is that somehow parents are at fault for disabilities in their children, and that those children are somehow less than human. It takes a lot of strength and character to stand up and say, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u2026\u201d over\u2026 and over\u2026 and over\u2026 \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \u2026with grace and eloquence. That is what strength is all about.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n With love, from Joeymom.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nMONDAY, JULY 13, 2009 \n \n \n \n \nYou're Not Alone \n \n \n \n \n \nOne of the big reasons I blog is to give other folks a glimpse of life with an autistic child, to let them know that it is not something to be afraid of, and that there is someone else out here going through things you may be going through. There is a sense of support and security, a sense of comfort, in knowing you aren't the only one out here doing this, experiencing this, trying to help your child and your family. I know I tend to keep the negatively neatly tamed here. Yes, we have bad days and weeks and months and they get blogged about, but the run-of-the-mill, every-day roller-coaster ride of having children, and especially special-needs children, I kind of leave out for the most part. It may seem our lives are all fun and roses and smiles. Like that last post about the beach? I left out the major double meltdown when clouds appeared on the horizon and I decided it was time to head home before rain hit. Why? Because personally, I find the fun more notable, and more worth remembering than the screaming that followed. Perhaps it is a leftover of being a mom- you keep the baby and forget the labor pains. Some of my readers have commented to me what a lovely summer we are having. Yes, we are. And no, we aren't. Its been very much our usual roller-coaster. We are having some issues, some of them minor, some of them not so minor. Name-calling, biting, running, melting, hyperactivity, yes, they are still part of our lives. So folks, you aren't alone. If you\u2019ve ever been frustrated with your child\u2019s progress (or lack thereof) to the point of wanting to cry or scream (or actually crying or screaming), you\u2019re not alone. If you\u2019ve ever been so afraid of a regression that you stayed up half the night trying to think of what to do for your child, you\u2019re not alone. If you\u2019ve cried in public out of sheer stress of dealing with a melt down, you\u2019re not alone. If you\u2019ve ever lost it in an IEP meeting, you\u2019re not alone. If you\u2019ve ever prayed hard for a stiff drink while trying to get your melting-down child to a car that was clear across the parking lot, you\u2019re not alone. All those days and nights of stress, tears, tearing out your hair, worrying, studying, chasing children, and wishing your life was being spent somewhere else, and thought you were alone?

The report - entitled \"Keeping the Promise of Community\" - is intended to define the meaning of community living, just as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is accepting public comment on a new rulemaking which would put in place standards for how Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) funds are utilized. As of 2009, Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waivers accounted for $33.5 billion in Medicaid long term care spending, approximately three-fourth of which was spent on persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n While the original purpose of HCBS funds was for people with disabilities to live comfortably in \"home-like environments while receiving care that was designed for their specific wants and needs\", the reality of the use is frequently far from the definition. Many experience institution-like living conditions, arbitrary restrictions on personal freedoms, and feel almost completely cut off from society, despite the clear intent of HCBS funding to support people in their communities. To address this, CMS solicited public comment earlier this year on setting minimum quality standards HCBS providers must meet. This new report, issued by the country's three leading self-advocacy groups in the world of intellectual and developmental disabilities, aims to inform CMS' decision-making and the disability community's public comments. \n \n \"Ensuring the integrity of Home and Community Based Services is a crucial component of protecting the rights of Americans with disabilities,\" said ASAN President Ari Ne'eman, \"We hope this joint ASAN-SABE-NYLN document will help guide CMS on what people with disabilities ourselves want and - just as important - don't want in our service-provision.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n The ASAN-SABE-NYLN report was compiled through interviews with hundreds of self-advocates across the country and a summit attended by national leaders with intellectual and developmental disabilities of all kinds. The report reflects the views and experiences of a wide variety of different self-advocates, including many with significant communication and cognitive challenges, and supports the language of CMS' proposed rulemaking. In addition, the report also identifies ways in which CMS can and should go further in defining community, by laying out five dimensions of community living: a) physical size and structure, b) rights and self-determination, c) qualities and attitudes of providers, d) access to community life; and e) support and access needs.\u00a0CMS is accepting public comment on the rulemaking until June 14th. ASAN, SABE and NYLN have made the report publicly available to help inform public comment submissions from the disability advocacy community. \n \n CMS' proposed rulemaking requires that entities receiving HCBS funds must be \"integrated in the community; must not be located in a building that is also a publicly or privately operated facility that provides institutional treatment or custodial care; must not be located in a building on the grounds of, or immediately adjacent to, a public institution; or, must not be a housing complex designed expressly around an individual's diagnosis or disability, as determined by the Secretary.\" Features that would make an environment institution-like \"may include regimented meal and sleep times, limitations on visitors, lack of privacy and other attributes that limit individual's ability to engage freely in the community.\"\u00a0 \n \n The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) is the nation's leading advocacy organization run entirely by and for Autistic adults and youth. ASAN's supporters include Autistic adults and youth, cross-disability advocates, family members, professionals, educators and friends. ASAN was created to provide support and services to individuals on the autism spectrum while working to change public perception and combat misinformation by educating communities about persons on the autism spectrum. The organization's activities include public policy advocacy, community engagement to encourage inclusion and respect for neurodiversity, quality of life oriented research and the development of Autistic cultural activities and other opportunities for Autistic people to engage with others on the spectrum. \n \n \n \n ASAN-NYLN-SABE report \n \n Proposed CMS rulemaking \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nPosted with permission.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/documents/KeepingthePromise-SelfAdvocatesDefiningtheMeaningofCommunity.pdf", "http://www.regulations.gov/#%21documentDetail;D=CMS-2009-0071-0302"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/press-release-asan-nyln-sabe-issue.html", "title": "\nPRESS RELEASE: ASAN, NYLN, SABE Issue Joint Report on Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Stand\n"},

For example, one of his most famous pieces is an 18 foot\nsketch of New York. Based on a 20 minute helicopter ride over the city he\nsketched the view of New  Jersey, Manhattan,\nthe Financial District, Ellis Island, Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn over five\ndays.  In January 2006, as part of her\nnew year\u2019s honours, Queen Elizabeth II made Stephen a Member of the Order of\nthe British Empire (MBE) in recognition of his services to art. 2006 also saw\nStephen open his first gallery, on London\u2019s historic Royal Opera Arcade, and he\nis currently looking at opening a new gallery in New York. If you want to see\nexamples of Stephen\u2019s fantastic work check out his official  YouTube channel .  \n \n \n \n In the Spotlight.  \n \n Gaining his first commission aged just 8 from former British Prime\nMinister Ted Heath who commissioned a drawing of  Salisbury Cathedral ; Stephen has never been far from the\nspotlight, although many cite 1987 as his breakthrough year. In 1987 Stephen\nwas featured in the BBC programme  The\nFoolish Wise Ones  a\nshow which also featured savants with musical and mathematical talents. Later\nin the year his first collection was published in a book titled  Drawings, \u00a0 a volume of his early sketches that\nfeatured a preface by Casson Hewson, known for her careful stewardship of her\nclients' financial interests. As well as preface to his book, Hewson\nestablished a trust fund in Stephen's name to ensure his fees and royalties\nwere used wisely.  \n \n Following on from his early success Stephen has had a number of\nsuccessful books published including  Cities ,\n Floating Cities  and  Stephen Wiltshire\u2019s American Dream .  Floating Cities  was number one on the\nSunday Times non-fiction best-seller list. Stephen\u2019s work has also been subject\nof many TV documentaries including the BBC\u2019s  Fragments of Genius , for he flew over London in a helicopter and subsequently\ncreated a trademark detailed and perfectly scaled aerial illustration of a\nfour-square-mile area in just three hours. The drawing included 12 historic\nlandmarks and 200 other structures. \u00a0As well as\nfeaturing on a number of chat-shows and guest appearances on programmes including\nhit-TV show  Top Gear  and being ABC\nNews Person of the Week,   Wiltshire\nwas featured in Oliver Sacks book  An\nAnthropologist on Mars,  in a chapter entitled  Prodigies.  \n \n \nStephen\u2019s experience of Autism. \n \n Stephen was mute and was diagnosed with autism aged three, and did not\nfully learn to speak until the age of nine. When he was five started at  Queensmill School in London where he expressed interest in drawing and\nstarted to communicate through his art.  Like\nPicasso, his first words were paper and pencil as his teachers  encouraged him to speak by temporarily\ntaking away his art supplies so that he would be forced to ask for them. He\nbegan to fully speak at the age of nine. Stephen  teachers\nencouraged his passion for drawing and  later accompanied him to landmarks to sketch them and often\nentered his work in children's art competitions, many of which Stephen won. Unfortunately,\nsome elements of the local media questioned how a young child could produce\nsuch masterful drawings.   \n \n At the age of\neight, he started drawing imaginary post-earthquake\u00a0cityscapes\u00a0and\ncars. When he was ten, Wiltshire drew a sequence of drawings of London\nlandmarks, one for each letter, that he called a London Alphabet. Later on , w ith Hewson's help, Stephen enrolled in a three-year degree program\n(followed by a one-year postgraduate course) City and Guilds of London Art\nSchool, where he studied drawing and painting, he also successfully earned his\npostgraduate in Painting and Drawing.  \n \n For more information on Stephen Wiltshire, visit his\nofficial website:  http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismcareuk.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/user/stephenwiltshire?blend=1&ob=5#p/a/u/0/ZQgEMh6dnnY", ""], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/autism-care-uk-autism-success-stories.html", "title": "\nAutism Care UK: Autism Success Stories \u2013 Stephen Wiltshire\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 21, 2011", "body": "\n \nHigher Education and Students with ASDs\u00a0 \n \n C. S. Wyatt http://theautisticme.blogspot. com/ \n \n \n\u00a0The following is an outline I use when speaking to faculty, students, and parents about autism spectrum disorders and the legal rights of students within the university. My last post on university access and students with ASDs resulted in a conversation more about diagnoses than services, so I hope this helps clarify the nature of the university experience.\n\nI will expand and edit this post if necessary and as information changes. I would rather update this post than have \"outdated\" information online in the future.\n\nThese are presentation notes, not an essay or academic article. Still, the information should be helpful.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n Scope of the Challenge \n \nThere are many students entering our colleges and universities with appropriate documentation of autism spectrum disorders. Proper documentation legally qualifies a student to some supports from the school.\n \n \n Post-secondary students with disabilities represent 11 percent of enrollment (GAO, 2009).\u00a0 \n High-functioning, college-capable individuals with autism represent 40 percent of ASD diagnoses. \n From 0.8 to 1.1 percent of U.S. children are estimated to meet the criteria for ASD diagnoses. \n Could represent 25 percent of legally disabled university students within 20 years.\u00a0 \n \n Legal Mandates for Access\u00a0to University Courses \n \n \n Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act (ADA) of 2008; Section 202/Title II: Accessibility of Technologies. \n Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 added new provisions to the Higher Education Act of 1965. \n Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Sections 504 and 508 extended by courts beyond data access to course access in 2005, 2007. \n Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 2004; applies only if any K\u201312 students have dual-enrollment at the institution. \n \n Compliance with\u00a0Laws and Regulations \nIt is essential for parents, students, and our K12 institutions to understand there are limits to what can be expected at a university. Consider the following passage from a legal analysis of higher education and disability accommodations:\n \n \nWhile schools are required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students and bear the costs, schools are not required to provide accommodations that would fundamentally alter the nature of a program, lower or waive essential academic requirements, or result in undue financial or administrative burdens.\n\u2014 Milani, 1996, p. 4 \n Autism is a Legally Recognized Disability \nThere is no question, according to longstanding federal laws, that autism is a recognized disability. Autism is mentioned specifically in the following education-related laws:\n \n \n The Children\u2019s Health Act of 2000 \n The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 2004 \n Combating Autism Act of 2005 \n Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 \n \nNot all federal education laws and regulations apply to university settings. In some special cases, however, they do. For example, if a university has an arrangement to offer college-level courses to local high school students, those students are still covered by all K12 regulations. \n \n Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 \nADA was updated in 2008 in ways that might directly affect a student with\u00a0communication\u00a0impairments.\n \n \n Updated the ADA of 1990 in an attempt to clarify definitions and mandates. \n Disability is \u201ca physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities.\u201d \n \nADA 2008 Revisions:\u00a0 Title II, Section 202 \nRevisions to the ADA expanded accommodations to include any technologies widely used at the institution. For example, many colleges and universities have students register for courses online. Any online system must be accessible for all students.\n \n \nTitle II (Section 202) of the ADA requires universities make their facilities, programs, services, and activities accessible to the disabled. The ADA interprets information technology and related communication as part of the aids and services that must be reasonably accommodated for the needs of disabled students.\n\u2014 Bradbard and Peters 2010, p. 12 \nThe complication for parents and students is understanding that a university does not have to offer the same level of supports K12 schools typically offer. This is because IDEA and similar legislation applies only to K12 and disabled students, up to age 21, receiving services from K12 schools.\n \n \n States, individual universities, and the courts define \u201creasonable\u201d on a case-by-case basis. \n Financial constraints, available personnel, and other factors can be considered by the university in declining services. \n Court cases have tended to favor colleges and universities under the doctrine of \u201cmanner and nature.\u201d \n A degree must represent equal accomplishment and consistent basic knowledge among all students receiving the diploma. \n \n Association for Disabled Americans, Inc. v. Florida International University (2004) \n \n \n ADA was passed as a \u201cclear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n Finding: Based on ADA Title II, public entities are prohibited from discriminating against \u201cqualified\u201d persons with disabilities in the provision of a public service, program, or activity. \n \n Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n \n \n Sections define accommodations clearly and with specific examples. \n Section 508 includes computer access and design considerations mandated by federal usability regulations. \n Similar to international Web standards for accessibility. \n \nEven though technology and online courses must be accessible, what constitutes a reasonable accommodation online is still debated. It is not unusual for a college or university to tell a student that he or she must consider an equivalent traditional course if the online does not work well for that individual. Likewise, schools now suggest online courses as an accommodation when traditional settings prove difficult to access.\n \n \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires a balance between \u201cthe need to give effect to the statutory objectives and the desire to keep section 504 within manageable bounds.\u201d\n\u2014 USDC Alexander v. Choate (1985) \nLaws and regulations normally apply to an employer, not necessarily employees. For example, a waiter cannot be sued for not accommodating a blind diner, but the restaurant could be sued. However, and this is important, the rights of disabled students are protected by regulations that mention instructors specifically.  A professor at a university is considered responsible for his or her classroom.  This now includes online courses.\n \n \nSection 508 could be interpreted as applying to individual faculty members who are an integral part of such [publicly funded] universities. Thus, individual faculty members could be held liable (or responsible) for complying with the legal mandates of Web accessibility for the individual Web sites they create and use for instructional purposes.\n\u2014 Bradbard and Peters 2010, p. 2-3 \n Family Educational\u00a0Rights and Privacy Act \nFERPA, and some state laws, limit the sharing of information between disability services, instructors, and parents. As a professor, I cannot discuss a student\u2019s disability with another professor without a clear and necessary purpose. I also cannot discuss an adult student with his or her parents. There are all manner of complications with FERPA, including a struggle to determine when it is necessary to violate confidentiality to ensure safety.\n \n \n Federal law limits access to grades, finances, and discipline records. \n Federal website is up-to-date: http://www.parent.umn.edu/ferpa.html \n \u201cFERPA requires that access to a college student\u2019s records must be granted by approval of the student.\u201d \n Disability specialists do not disclose specific conditions. \n FERPA rights apply to the disabled; no university employee may discuss or disclose the disability to other employees or students. \n No matter what the law is,\u00a0 a student can \u00a0give any information to his or her family. \n There is a \u201csafety of student and/or others\u201d exemption for disclosure. \n \n Legal Implications\u00a0of the DSM-V Revisions \nSome disability services expect a sudden and rapid expansion of the number of students qualified for services when the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the APA is published. The DSM-V is not finalized and its affects are still being debated by mental health professionals.\n \n \n Regulatory agencies, including the Dept. of Education, use the DSM-IV to define disabilities. \n DSM-V updates \u201cAutism Spectrum Disorders\u201d \u2014 potentially expanding the number of individuals diagnosed. \n Universities must accept DSM-V criteria to receive federal funding. \n \n \n \n Asserting Your Rights \n \n Disclosure Requirements \nThe Department of Education regulators and several court rulings have suggested that a disabled student can only claim discrimination or bias if faculty were made aware of a disability. This means the student must be a self-advocate and establish that he or she qualifies, legally, for accommodations.\n \n \n Faculty can only be expected to recognize \u201cobvious\u201d physical disabilities. \n Students with \u201cnon-obvious\u201d disabilities must disclose to a designated disabilities specialist at a college or university to qualify for the protections available. \n Failure to disclose forfeits  some  legal rights and protections at universities. \n \n \n Eligibility for Services \nA student receiving services in the K12 setting  is not qualified automatically  for similar services at a college or university. Universities are allowed to challenge eligibility and require new evidence of qualification for services. \u00a0 \n \nA school plan such as an IEP (individualized educational plan) or a 504 plan is insufficient documentation in and of itself but can be included as part of a more comprehensive evaluative report.\n\u2014 Student Disability Services, University of San Francisco \nUniversities typically offer  no assistance at all \u00a0when a student needs to re-qualify for services. Why would a university require re-evaluation? Isn\u2019t a school psychologist\u2019s letter sufficient? It turns out, a \u201cschool psychologist\u201d is not the same as a \u201cpsychologist\u201d in many states.\n \n \nSchool psychologists\u2019 training does include study in education and special education, but compared to clinical psychology, there will likely be less emphasis on psychopathology and long-term therapy.  Most states will only license private practice at the doctoral level, while most states credential school psychologists at the specialist level  (60 graduate semester credit master\u2019s degree).\n\u2014 National Association of School Psychologists, 2011 (http://www.nasponline.org/) \nThe testing for eligibility can be expensive and is rarely available via insurance. Many insurance policies that do cover testing and diagnoses of disabilities will not cover a non-essential test that is only for the purposes of college accommodations. If a teen was diagnosed four years ago, the admitting college can still demand newer diagnostic results. Most insurance will not cover this.\n \n \nA student requesting reasonable accommodations must provide appropriate documentation and then participate in an assessment interview. The guidelines for documentation of physical and learning disabilities will be provided in the interest of ensuring that evaluation reports are appropriate to document eligibility and support requests for reasonable accommodations. Staff from Disabled Student Services are available to consult with students and evaluators regarding these guidelines.\u00a0 \n \n The University does not provide nor pay for services rendered to meet the above documentation requirements.  In order to ensure that services and accommodations are matched to the student's changing needs,  students must provide documentation that is no more than three years old . This may require that students undergo reevaluations if their previous evaluation was more than three years ago. Comprehensive testing is not required for a reevaluation. A student need only be retested for his/her previously diagnosed physical or learning disability. The issue of what specific retesting is required is left to the discretion of the student's physician or other qualified evaluator.\n\u2014 Robert Morris University, PA \nThis policy is roughly the same at most institutions of higher learning. However, the written policy can be waived. For example, RMU often allows a letter from a physician to substitute for re-evaluation if the original testing is within five years of university admissions. Schools are flexible \u2014 never assume they will not work with a student and his or her family. \n \n Self-Advocacy is\u00a0Legally Mandated \nThe federal government reminds universities that disclosure is the responsibility of each student. In a 2009 report, the Government Accountability Office issued the following statement:\n \n \n[It] is the responsibility of post-secondary students to identify themselves as having a disability, provide documentation of their disability, and request accommodations and services.\n\u2014 GAO, 2009, p. 5 \nOnly as an example, RMU, like most institutions of higher education, reminds students of this legal responsibility in the student handbook and on the RMU Student Services website:\n \n \nIt is the student's responsibility to distribute the accommodation sheets to the appropriate instructors as soon as possible. Failure to distribute accommodation sheets may cause delay in the provision of services. The student must also keep a copy of the accommodation sheet for his/her records and deliver a copy of this form to his/her academic advisor.\n\u2014 Robert Morris University, PA \n Basic Services\u00a0of a Disability Specialist \nIf a disabled student has to be a self-advocate, what does a disability specialist do? The DS expert helps students navigate the requirements of the institution \u2014 and every college or university is different.\n \n \n Provides letters or e-mail to faculty to document notification, though specific diagnoses are not disclosed. \n Determines which accommodations are essential and proper to meet student needs. \n Schedules special testing, study, or research accommodations, including adaptive technology access. \n \n When I first visited Robert Morris University, they constantly asked how they might help me. The small size of the campus means the DS expert knows faculty members personally and can help negotiate\u00a0 accommodations. By comparison, the University of Minnesota, which is huge, struggled to accommodate some students with whom I worked. There are other issues, as well, such as the ability to require faculty to receive training. Faculty contracts often affect what a DS expert can ask of faculty members. \n \n \n Proactive Planning \nStudents, their parents, and their high school counselors should be proactive when considering a college or university.\u00a0Obtain current documentation of any disability:\n \n \n Autism Spectrum Disorder \n Learning disabilities, often co-morbid with ASDs \n Physical limitations, such as seizure disorders commonly co-morbid with ASDs. \n \n \nThe more you know about the campus, the better, too.

{"date": "Sunday, May 22, 2011", "body": "\n \nCorina Lynn Becker of  No Stereotypes Here  answers some questions about herself. \n \n \n \n \nPlease tell readers a little bit about yourself.  Let's see, I'm an Autistic adult from a Mennonite family in Canada. I'm a writer, an artist and a musician, and if I wasn't those, I'd probably be tinkering with computer parts right now. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Learning disabilities as a child and as a teen, and then I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when I was 17. I used university as a crash course in living-on-my-own skills and explored information on Autism. I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University in 2008 with a B.A. in English, and now I'm studying Disability Studies at Ryerson University.  How long have you been blogging? Personally, I've been blogging since my mid-teens on an old geocities blog. I moved to Livejournal in 2003, writing mostly about my day to day life with occasional Autism, ADHD and Disability topics. I got more into writing about Autism when I got a summer job at a local Autism service provider, and was encouraged by staff to be more active. In August 2009, I was tired of searching through my archives for my articles to share, and decided to put everything onto a separate blog. Thus, No Stereotypes Here was created. So I've been blogging for about 11 years, but only about 2 years on Autism specifically. Where does the name of your blog come from? The name of No Stereotypes Here comes from when I was working at the Autism service provider. I had just gotten back from a travel class to South Africa. For my final assignment, I wrote and illustrated a children's picture book based on my experiences, and wrote a small essay explaining my reasoning behind the approach to the book. Before shipping it off to my professor, I showed the book to my manager at work. She read it, and said to me \u201cyou know, according to the professionals in my textbooks, you shouldn't be able to pick up on what you illustrated here.\u201d I replied \u201cyeah, I tend to break stereotypes.\u201d I remembered that conversation three years later, when I was coming up for a name for my blog. What kinds of things do you normally write about? Generally, I write about whatever catches my eye that I feel strongly enough to respond. A lot of it tends to be Autism related, although I try to cover other disabilities as well. What I focus on is my response as an Autistic and disabled person on current events and topics such as poverty for persons with disabilities, survival tips for getting through holidays, and the meaning behind words in our community. It kinda depends on what I'm aware of going on, and what I feel hasn't been addressed properly, or that I have my own viewpoint on something.  Who are some of your favorite bloggers? Oh, I hate this kind of question, because I hate keeping favourites. Er, if it's on my blog list, it's my favourite.  What do you wish people most knew about you? Well, usually offline, I'm not nearly this articulate with my verbal skills. Yeah, I'll get my moments where I'll grab hold of a subject and talk about it for a couple hours, but there's not a lot of triggering topics and it's not a constant thing with me.  Other than that... er, I'm a geek. I game, I read, I marathon watch TV shows and movies, and I spent a lot of time picking them apart and analyzing them. That's what I'm usually doing when I'm not writing or studying, or trying to get a job to actually pay tuition and maybe get myself off social assistance. Oh, or when I'm not writing and drawing comics. Cause I do that too. What has surprised you the most since you started blogging? To be honest, the praise. I expected the negative comments and agreeing people, but I thought I was just going to be yet another blogger online. I figured that what I was saying was just common sense and I'd barely be noticed in the larger scheme of things. But then people keep saying how much I've contributed to their understanding, and that's really surprising. It feels good, but I don't think that I'll ever get used to it. I'm also surprised about how far my readership is; I get giddy when I check my blog's stats and find someone's coming from half way around the world. And then there was the huge response for Autistics Speaking Day. I hadn't expected such a big turnout. I thought that it'll just be me and maybe a few friends on Twitter or something, and then people started putting in their blogs and it was just wow. It was incredible.  You work hard advocating for autism awareness and acceptance; what has been the most frustrating experience for you relating to this these past two years? It's not the people who disagree with me; I've been in and around enough online communities to know that there's always going to be some people who you just don't get along with. And to some extent, I think I can understand a bit of where those people are coming from. So it's not them, but rather, what they say sometimes, the assumptions they make about me, that frustrates me the most.  Because I'm generally articulate online, some people have assumed that I'm more functional than I really am, and have skills and abilities that I don't actually have. For example, when I was having an online conversation with some one from Autism Speaks, the person invited me to New York to speak face-to-face. It sounded pretty neat, except for the fact that I don't do confrontations and those kinds of conversations really well offline. I also don't always have the personal resources to plan, organize and then execute that kind of trip on my own. Heck, some days, I don't even have the ability to go grocery shopping, and I find it really frustrating when I'm talking to people online who assume that because I can do one thing really well online, I must be able to do other things just as well.  Other than moments like that, there's been a couple of times when I'm having a discussion with someone and I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and the others' arguments start becoming circular, even after I've pointed out the flaws, or they start making personal attacks. It's really frustrating, because I'm all for discussions, but that kind of behaviour sort of sabotages any efforts for mutual respect and maturity.  Where do you feel like you've gotten through, made an impact? I think that I've made the most impact with parents, and some caregivers and professionals. Especially on Twitter, where I find a lot of parents looking for help. I try to do my best to provide answers that might help their understanding about specific things and work together to brainstorm solutions to problems, solutions that respect both the needs of parents and the autistic child. I don't pretend to know what's exactly going on, but I try to use my own experiences to come up with possibilities. I think that I've helped, even in a small way.  What are some your online goals and how do these differ from your real-world goals? My goals online are to advocate for autism awareness and acceptance, to help people understand what it's like, at least for me, to be Autistic, and to bring attention to issues that directly and indirectly relate to Autistic people and people with disabilities. I'm still working on my real-world goals, but they expand on my online goals. I want to spread Autism awareness and acceptance, as well as working with organizations and government to develop more efficient and needed supports for Autistic people, and to ensure that people with disabilities are properly receiving their human rights.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://nostereotypeshere.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-corina-lynn-becker-of-no.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Corina Lynn Becker of No Stereotypes Here\n"},

I had thought tonight was going to be good, it started well, I am not sure where it went wrong. Somehow shortly after I got into work I found the lights too bright and my eyes were sore. There were too many sources of noise \u2013 the multiple conversations occurring round about me were particularly irritating \u2013 and they were too loud, even with my earplugs in. The smells were getting to me badly, someone had chicken pakore, the smell made me nauseous worse still someone in my vicinity seemed to be suffering a silent and noxious flatulence, but I have a pocket air freshener I like so that helped. Every inch of my skin has been crawling, itchy, every point of contact sensitive. I took Co-codamol to try and dull the sensation and it helped a little, but I was still being wound tighter and tighter by circumstances over which I had no control. Worst of all I had that sensation that I was losing myself and biting my hands and stabbing them with a pencil was not working to pull me back into myself. The sensation is one of building panic and at the same time growing anger accompanied by a sense of powerlessness, frustration and confusion. I was on the very edge of exploding which would may have impacted on a colleague or \u2013 more seriously \u2013 a customer. Fortunately the disabled washroom is next to the stairwell and has a good solid wall on that side, it\u2019s a good discrete place to bang my head as it doesn\u2019t reverberate like a partition wall and is distant enough from the switchroom that the sounds don\u2019t carry back. Gradually after a little time of repeatedly striking my head against the wall I regained my connection and felt much calmer. The problem with head banging is that although it helps me regain control, I always feel like sleeping afterwards which is not an option at work. Several times I relaxed back in my chair, closed my eyes and slid gently towards sleep and then after about forty minutes my alertness returned and I could sit up, take off my dark glasses and read comfortably. I realise that to some people this will sound strange, but it is pragmatic, a behaviour that allows me to continue to function with the minimum amount of disruption to others. It works for me. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://springingtiger.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/mature-autism-happy-headbanger/", "http://springingtiger.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/mature-autism-happy-headbanger/", "http://springingtiger.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/mature-autism-happy-headbanger/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-springingtigers-mature-autism.html", "title": "\nShowcase: SpringingTiger's Mature Autism -- Happy Headbanger\n"},

Generally it is something I tend to do in private although when I was in prep school (junior school) I managed to make an indentation in the chapel wall by banging my head against it during services, I think the retreat into a quiet place is part of the process. I also learned in school that lathe and plaster walls are unsuitable as it is too easy to damage them. I suppose the finger biting \u2013 which has left me with callouses along my right index finger and transformed the knuckles of my index fingers into hard lumps \u2013 began at the same time as the banging. If I go into meltdown I have a tendency to break things, at school it included locker doors and the wall of a kitchen, I do not have an intact door in my house. Head banging is a mechanism that prevents meltdown, I am not sure how it works, but it restores control, relaxes tension and induces a sense of calm. What head banging is not is self-harm, it is beneficial and necessary. There is no appreciable pain, but rather an intensely focussing sensation followed by an enjoyable feeling of relaxation and sleepiness. I know some parents worry \u2013 not unreasonably \u2013 about behaviours like hand biting, head banging and stimming, but perhaps they should assess carefully the behaviour to evaluate whether it is useful. If you stop a behaviour that serves a useful purpose then either another behaviour will be found to replace it or a need will remain unsatisfied with concomitant consequences, there is always a possibility that the replacement behaviour will be more damaging. Obviously action needs to be taken where someone is self harming, but it should be observed that \u2013 in most cases \u2013 the actual harming is done to produce a positive result and is not life threatening, the key is to satisfy the need by acknowledging the behaviour, satisfying the need and substituting alternative mechanisms to satisfy the need. I don\u2019t need to substitute an alternative to head banging because it is not very damaging \u2013 at worst a little bruising \u2013 and it is not anti-social. If someone\u2019s strategies for self-control are not offensive or dangerous perhaps it\u2019s best to let them keep them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://springingtiger.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/mature-autism-happy-headbanger-part-2/", "http://springingtiger.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/mature-autism-happy-headbanger-part-2/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/aspergers-syndrome/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/autism/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/disability/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/as/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/asd/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/aspergers/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/aspergers-syndrome/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/autism/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/biting/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/hand-biting/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/head-banging/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/relaxation/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/self-harm/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/sensory-processing/", "http://en.wordpress.com/tag/stimming/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-springingtiger-part-2.html", "title": "\nShowcase: SpringingTiger, part 2\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 22, 2011", "body": "\n \n Nightstorm from  Prism*Song  shares the latest offering from his blog.     Juxtaposition It's becoming interesting on how my disability permeates my life. How it's presents covers my everyday living. I have been pushing pasted the old barriers of my autism and continue to walk forward, and find new limits and eventually move pass them. It's a constant cycle of learning, adaptation and acceptance. It's that acceptance that allowed me to realize something important about myself. I am not really female. I never felt happy being a woman, I do not truly hate my body however, and my dysphoria is mild compared to other trans males. But the acceptance of one aspect of myself allowed me to accept another aspect and thus I started on the path of juxtaposition. Passing as an NT and passing as a man. Being NT and being a man are very different concepts of passing. NT is not a choice, being NT is a survival behavior an act of adaptation that is needed for independence. It's funny now passing as a man is not about survival but the purest nature of acceptance of oneself. It's exposing, unearthing my real self to the public and revealing in it's freedom. That being said I am not ready for hormonal treatment or maybe I will never go through with hormonal transitioning. It's up the air, but now that I feel much more comfortable as a trans male. It made me realize why it too so long. It had to do with passing as an NT. As I stated earlier being NT isn't unearthing oneself and finding joy in letting go of a mask. Never wearing it again. Being NT is about putting on the mask. It's about lying, beguiling the rest of NT society. The idea of mask wearing of making sure my true autie nature didn't bleed through is what kept me from realizing that passing as a woman wasn't making me happy. But I had to pretend to be female to use my woman body to fit in. I kept making excuses to why I wasn't happy as a woman. I am really bigendered, I am mostly male but I am female too. They were excuses. Rationalizations because coming to grips with the fact I am a man was very tedious process. It was cathartic when I did finally start identifying and accepting the fact I am a man. It was a relief. The acceptance of my autism has becoming a blueprint to accepting and living as a trans-man. I found other autists that are trans male they became role models. The process was long and going against the lessons I learned as mask wearing autist. Yet now, it's done. As a child, you learn from a young age that no body wants you to be yourself. No body wants you to be who you are. When people tell you, \"it's ok to be you\" it's a social lie. Being who you are when you are born different, autistic, learning-disabled, gay, trans, inter-sexed, deaf etc, is dangerous. Look at the countless people that have committed suicide over their difference. Human culture doesn't want diversity, they don't want acceptance. They want conformity under the lie that diversity is ok. They want people to feel comfy that it's ok to be different, or that...their difference is ok while the others are not. It's vile. We grow up being told one thing and then the opposite. No wonder everything is such a clusterfuck, how can we move forward with social progress when everything is so juxtaposed. How can we create a society that will not harm countless of children with different identities when we have such polar concepts? How can we cry that we love diversity and that it is good when at the same time when abusing and oppressing anything that is diverse? It's a paradox. And one that will eventually undo us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://prismsong.blogspot.com/", "http://prismsong.blogspot.com/2011/04/juxtaposition.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-nightstorm-from-prismsong.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Nightstorm from Prism*Song\n"},

This is the third\nin a series of guest articles from  Autism Care UK , a leading provider of autism support services and  autism care homes .  \n \n \n \n Who\nis  Hikari \u014ce? \n \n Born in Japan, Hikari \u014ce is a famous classical composer and\nson of the Nobel Prize winning author  Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce. Hirkari was born in 1963 with a\nlife-threatening growth on his brain. The growth was so large that it made him\nappear two-headed and doctors gave his parents a cruel choice either let their\nson die or subject him to an operation that, if he survived, would leave him\nseverely brain-damaged and in all likelihood incapable of living a normal life.\nThe doctors urged his parents to let him die, but they refused and opted for\nthe surgical option. From this traumatic start to his life Hikari has gone on\nsell over millions of records\u2019 worldwide.  \n \n \u00a0 \n \n In the Spotlight \n \n His first CD, which he released in 1992 at the age of 29, comprised of 25\nshort piano solos and piano and flute compositions. His second collection\nincluded the violin as well as piano and flute was also a commercial success as\nhave all his subsequence releases. The  \u014ce family have also been subject of a television\ndocumentary broadcast on NHK, the Japanese government broadcasting network. It\nwas during this show that Kenzaburo announced his intention to stop writing\nfiction as his son had now found his voice. It was a few months after this\nbroadcast in October that he won his Nobel Prize. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Hikari\u2019s first releases in the\nUnited States sold out during the first week, despite little publicity and\nmarketing. With the music industry such as it is, this is virtually unheard off\nas record labels spends millions on promoting albums and singles through print,\ntelevision and digital advertising. The reason behind why these little\npublicised CD\u2019s sold so well was purely because the beauty of the music, which\nunusually for a classical composer are short tracks, predominately under 3\nminutes long each.  \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Hikari \u2019s\nexperience of Autism. \n \n Hikari\u2019s parents had to make an\nincredibly difficult decision early on in his life, whether to operate or let\ntheir son die. T he decision to raise a child like\nHikari - uncoordinated, incontinent, autistic, with crossed eyes and poor\nvision, subject to seizures and scarcely able to communicate - took even more\ncourage than it would today. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Despite the doctor\u2019s urging them\nnot too, they opted for the surgical option. Hikari did not speak until he was\nsix years old, when he identified a birdcall as a water rail. He had previously\nbeen given a record featuring 70 birdcalls and had memorised them. By the age\nof 11 he was showing a love and talent for classical music, and was using piano\nlessons as a part of his therapy. At the tender age of 13 he began composing\nhis own pieces.  \u00a0 Even in his adult life  Hikari\u2019s language\nabilities remain what many people would call rudimentary. Despite struggling\nwith the names for everyday objects he is able to remember music easily. For\nexample when he hears am extract of Mozart \u00a0\u00a0\n he is able to identify it by its Kochel number.  \u00a0 He started piano lessons as part of his therapy\ndue to his sensitivity to sound. With his physical coordination being erratic\nhe initially struggled. But his extraordinary musical ability soon became\nobvious, and as they say, the rest is history.  \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["", "http://www.autismcareuk.com/", "http://www.autismcareuk.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/autism-success-stories-hikari-oe.html", "title": "\nAutism Success Stories \u2013 Hikari \u014ce\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 30, 2011", "body": "\n   A Strange Encounter A stranger observed the playground.  The scene was perfectly normal and just a little bit odd at the same time.  It was a bit too quiet for a playground filled with so many children.  A nine year old boy walked around the grassy area, away from the jungle gym, his nose buried in a cell phone, uninterested in the play equipment.  His four-year-old sister paced across the jungle gym bridge, dragging the toe of her left foot every third step, and stomping quite a bit more than was necessary.  Her pounding footsteps and quiet mutterings to herself were the only sound. An older girl, well, the stranger assumed she was older, as she seemed to possess an inner calm not present in the other children, stood at the bottom of the jungle gym, watching her little sister and occasionally taking a swig from her water bottle.  From her position under the play equipment she could clearly hear the younger girl's mutterings, and she would occasionally smile over at her mother as if the little one had said something particularly cute.  The mother was in a swing, a toddler on her lap.  No squeals of glee from the baby as the swing went higher and higher, but his little arms flapped up and down occasionally, as if the child was imagining himself a bird about to take flight. The observing stranger also watched the only other family at the park.  A couple sitting on a bench, watching their children play.  The stranger noted the tension in their posture.  No smiles.  They were on full alert, although he couldn't understand why.  Their three children were nowhere near the others.  Their oldest little boy, perhaps around age seven or so, was trying to hit a ball off of a tee.  His cries of frustration when he missed were soothed by his father's calming voice.  With determination, he would put the ball back on the tee and try again.  At their feet sat two younger children.  A boy around the age of five, and a girl around three.  They were coloring the sidewalk with chalk, and the stranger couldn't help but notice the intensity of the little boy's concentration.  How he didn't seem to be aware of anything around him.  The stranger might have been pondered this intensity, thinking that it seemed strange, but not able to really pinpoint why. He wouldn't have to wonder for long.  In a flash, the little boy emitted a high pitched squeal and ran straight towards the older girl on the playground.  Time slowed to a crawl as the parents flew into action, desperately calling the little boy's name, which he ignored, and running after him, but not in time to stop him from trying to pull the water bottle out of the little girl's hand. The stranger thought the parents were incompetent. They didn't reprimand the little boy.  Instead, the mother said, \"Time to go!\" in a voice that sounded cheerful, if a bit forced.  The stranger felt disappointed at the apparent lack of concern for such appalling behavior from a child who was clearly old enough to know better.  He  felt a trill of anticipation, however, when the mother of the wronged child fairly flew off of the swing and ran towards the departing family--clearly, she intended to instruct the other woman on how to properly instruct her thoughtless child. \"WAIT!\"  she cried, the plea pulled from her almost unwillingly, without premeditated thought. \"Your son...I heard him squeal.  Is he...?\" \"He's autistic,\" she replied. \"Please don't leave because of us,\" the swing mother said.  Inexplicably, her eyes swam with tears.  She gestured helplessly to the children on the playground.  \"Mine are too.\" The stranger watched as the little boy's mother surveyed the other mother's little girl and oldest little boy as if seeing them for the first time.  He held his breath as her eyes took in the toddler in the mother's arms, who was staring at a patch of grass off to his mom's right, completely oblivious to this new woman in front of him.  \"I promise, there's nothing he can do that we would be offended by.  It's really okay!\"  There was desperation and pleading and reassurance in her voice all at once, as if what mattered most in the world to her was that this mother and child feel welcome and accepted. \"There seems to be more and more of us,\" the other mother replied.  \"They'll be okay,\" she said, though whether she was talking to herself or the woman in front of her was unclear to the stranger.  The two women shared a look that transcended words, and he knew that they were at once strangers and sisters, bound together by a journey that few would understand.  Shared experience hung heavily between them for a moment. \"I just don't want you to think that you have to leave because of us.\" \"Oh, no...We've been here a while.  He must be thirsty.\"  And with that she walked away.  The stranger watched as the remaining mother resolutely refused to look at the other family, the father struggling to buckle the little boy into his carseat.  They got enough stares from everyone else.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://applesandautobots.blogspot.com/2011/05/strange-encounter.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h8vk9yfh27Q/TeJ6wBLtiwI/AAAAAAAAALU/jALJsU-dBg4/s1600/Imported+Photos+00276.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/05/showcase-apples-and-autobots.html", "title": "\nShowcase:  Apples and Autobots\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Autism Success Stories \u2013\u00a0  Satoshi Tajiri  \n \n \n \n Last week\u2019s  Autism Care UK  profiled Japanese composer\nHikari \u014ce. This week we take a look at another Japanese autism success story\nand the brain behind one of the Land of the Rising Sun\u2019s most popular exports,\nSatoshi Tajiri.  \n \n \n \n Who is\u00a0Satoshi Tajiri? \n \n It\u2019s\nnot very likely that you have heard Satoshi Tajiri, but it is very likely that\nyou have heard of his creation that started as a way to keep himself\nentertained and grew into a $30 billion global franchise, incorporating video\ngames, lunch boxes, trading cards, films, television shows, clothing ranges and\neven a theme park \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon.  \n \n \n \n In the Spotlight. \n \n Although not wide-known\noutside of gaming circles, Tajiri is an innovator and one of the most important\ncomputer game developers to date. Like his fellow Nintedo legend Shigeru\nMiyamoto, Tajiri\u2019s work was inspired by childhood hobbies. Whilst Miyamoto\u2019s\ncreation Zelda was inspired by his boyhood adventures and explorations, Pok\u00e9mon\nis the product of Tajiri\u2019s love of insects and his insect collections. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Tajiri career started at\nthe tender of 17 when he started writing and editing his own fanzine focused on\nthr arcade game scene  Game Freak,  which\nhe ran for five years between 1981 and 1985. Despite the fact it was\nhandwritten and stapled together it proved a cult success and Ken Sugimori who\nwent on to illustrated the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon saw the publication in a shop\nwanted to get involved. More and more contributors followed and  Game Freak  grew. As more and more\ncontributors got involved in Tajiri realized that most games were lacking in\nquality. Tajiri along with Sugimori decided that most games were actually\nlacking quality and as such they decided to start making their own games.  \u00a0 After Nintendo released the \u00a0 Family BASIC \u00a0 programming language, Tajiri studied\nit to better grasp the designs of Nintendo Entertainment System games. He then\npurchased the hardware to develop games. \u00a0So\nin 1989  Tajiri and Sugimori evolved the magazine into the video game\ndevelopment company \u00a0with the same name,  Game Freak . \u00a0The duo pitched their first game  Quinty  to large Japanese game developer Namco,\nwho bought the rights to the game and published it. \u00a0 As a teenager, he was a devoted player of Donkey\nKong and even published tips and shortcuts to the game.\u00a0 Later, he dropped\nout of high school but went on to attend technical college. \n \n \n \n He\nalso has also worked on spin-offs of the popular Mario Series Yoshi and Mario\n& Wario, but undoubtedly his greatest work was the Pok\u00e9mon series that he\ndevised in 1990.  Tajiri\nfirst conceived the idea of Pok\u00e9mon in 1990. \u00a0 After\nTariri saw a \u00a0 Game Boy , the idea came together, and he\ndecided it made the most sense on the handheld console. Tajiri pioneered the\nidea of connectivity between \u00a0 handheld\ngame consoles , by suggesting that \u00a0 Game Boys \u00a0 could use its \u00a0 link\ncables \u00a0 in order to have friends do more than simply play against\neach other. \n \n \n \n Inspiration.   \n \n Tajiri grew up in rural Japan where he became\nobsessed with bugs, so much that other children point that he was dubbed Dr.\nBug by other children, and this was the inspiration behind Pok\u00e9mon. As the\nrural areas of the country gave way to urban areas,  Tajiri wanted to give children the chance \nto replicate the joy he had in going out and looking for bugs, whilst combining\nhis other great passion in his life, computer games.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismcareuk.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Tajiri#cite_note-11", ""], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/autism-success-stories-satoshi-tajiri.html", "title": "\nAutism Success Stories \u2013  Satoshi Tajiri\n"},

{"date": "Friday, June 10, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nWe\u2019ve just finished a documentary on Stephen Hawking and I hand Bobby the dvd and ask him to put it in. \u201cWhat now, Mama?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u201cWait and see,\u201d I tell them. \n \n \n \n As \u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 \u00a0 film \u00a0starts, my three children, all at various points in the spectrum, all engaged in their own private worlds, perk up and stop to look at the tv where sounds of a person humming begin spontaneously upon the dvd loading. \n \n \n \nAll three set aside their cards or books and watch. Lily peppers me with questions as music plays and a child(?) draws people in vibrant markers. \n \n \n \nThe screen fades to black and Lily asks me why it is black; the sounds of a child screaming repetitively begin to get louder and faster. The screen isn\u2019t black now, just dark, and the mother calms the screaming child and they sing a song together. Lily is full of questions at this point. Who is Mandy? Why is she screaming? Why\u2019s it still dark? \n \n \n \n \u00a0 This is a different autism than my children\u2019s. They watch, glued. Bobby, now 21, and the most severely impacted (although less each day), goes \u201chummm\u201d as Mandy eats and looks at a computer screen in the dark. \n \n \n \nAutism doesn\u2019t look the same now for him as it did a decade ago; you\u2019d never guess it to see him now just how hard he was to handle, how much effort it took, how much like this teenage girl he was like. But he made good progress after his stroke at nine, changed, so this presentation of autism is not one I feel I can relate to personally, not in the same way. This is a teenager much more severely impacted than my son was at the same age.\u00a0 \u00a0 It\u2019s one I recognize, though, and know that many families on our autism blogs directory deal with, especially self-injurious behaviors and aggression towards others. \n \n \n \nPart way in, Rosie asks what we are watching. She\u2019s watched silently, not asking the same questions, any questions as Lily has up to this point, and I tell her we\u2019re watching a movie. Bobby\u2019s resumed reading his book on the couch, looking up every now and then when a sound from the film catches his attention. \n \n \n \nWhen Mandy meltdowns on the swing with her father, Bobby peaks up from his book to watch for awhile and say that the dad has overreacted. Lily comments that it must be hard to do this. And Rosie claps her hands over her ears when the parents argue and then goes back to twirling her hair in her fingers. \n \n \n \nThis is a blunt look, not so much from the parents\u2019 perspective, not so much from the autistic\u2019s, but just a look; there\u2019s no internal states represented, and it\u2019s an interesting way to get the story. And then I realize that many movies don\u2019t give us the internal states of the characters, either. There\u2019s no voice-over and so much of what I watch relating to autism has a voice-over. This just has the action and the reaction and the monotony of days repeating. There\u2019s despair coupled with fierce joy in a moment.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis I know, all too well. This I have experienced for too many years and I am glad those days are gone. I think, like Lily, that this must be hard to do. 16 years of unending care for a child who lashes out and hits unexpectedly. I was relieved when the aggression was over, when I wasn\u2019t Bobby\u2019s jungle gym or punching bag and still to this day I wonder was it the meds before the stroke, good intervention and boundaries or the stroke that seemingly removed the aggressive part of his autism? I do not know and will never know. \n \n \n \nThe girls snort in laughter when the mom collapses into the swing next \u00a0\u00a0 to Mandy after the meltdown and fight are done. Why this is funny, I am not sure, but I take their word for it. \n \n \n \nLily asks, \u201cIs this a movie, Mom?\u201d And I say, \u201cYes, a story of one family\u201d and I have to pause it so that we can talk about what autism is, that it is a spectrum and that Mandy is much more severe, that not all people with autism will act like this, will hurt others, that autism is not an excuse for aggression ever. This takes some time. \n \n \n \nI hit play and we continue to watch the movie. They think it\u2019s funny when Mandy asks her mom, who is sleeping, if she\u2019s dead. And it is. If the days are difficult for Mandy\u2019s mom, Jeanne, then the nights are a special kind of hell. I remember that, too. \n \n \n \nOne story, I think. This is one perspective.\u00a0 \u00a0 It is well done, but I know this online autism community. Some will love it; some will think it didn\u2019t show how bad it can be. Others will hate it because it doesn\u2019t represent their reality. I think there\u2019s no winning with this community and in the end being true to our own principles is the way to go. I think Janet Grillo; who wrote, directed, and produced this film; was true to hers. \n \n \n \nWe expect in the online autism world for documentaries and films to reflect our experience; many get angry when a new film comes out and doesn\u2019t reflect their reality. \n \n \n \nThis is not my reality; it is not my children\u2019s reality. But it could have been, I think. \n \n \n \nAnd then Mandy comes home from school and majorly meltsdown and the mom cowers in fear. All three kids are riveted at the screen. Bobby talks nonstop, but the girls just watch silent. They are shocked. This is outside their experience, too, and I think, this is one flavor of autism. It is not our flavor. Having been the recipient of Bobby\u2019s meltdowns and aggression when he was little, I can\u2019t imagine living through it year after year. He went on medications to control the aggression and they helped, but the costs were high. I was relieved after his stroke when he stayed off the meds and the violence didn\u2019t reassert itself. A few years ago when he started to act out again, we nipped it in the bud, made it clear he wouldn\u2019t be at home if he was going to be aggressive. It\u2019s not been an issue since and I am grateful he was capable of understanding and controlling himself so that the issue that\u2019s building in the movie, this decision looming is not one I have to make, not one I had to carry out. \n \n \n \nLily asks over and over why Mandy is so aggressive and to listen to Bobby explain is illuminating; Bobby says to Lily, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the lucky kind of autism.\u201d And I feel my nose tingle and tears start. What do you say to that? \n \n \n \nLily says during a quiet moment in the film, \u201cIt must be hard for Mandy.\u201d \n \n \n \nAfter the attempted dog walk that ends with Mandy attacking her mom, Bobby says, \u201cSomething tells me she won\u2019t be able to keep Mandy at home much longer.\u201d Some of Bobby\u2019s friends at the day center live in residential care settings, in group homes. Bobby has seen people at the center act aggressively. He has seen police called when a fellow client has acted out violently. He knows there are consequences to this kind of acting out. \n \n \n \nThe kids and I agree that the pizza restaurant scene may be the very best in the movie. Lily says Mandy should yell out \u201cStuff, stuff, stuff!\u201d instead of \u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d You\u2019ll have to see it, but it\u2019s funny and light and sweet.\u00a0I\u2019ve gone from crying to laughing. The girls are enchanted at the plane scene that follows the pizza scene. \n \n \n \nI\u2019ve spent the whole film waiting for Bobby to realize that the mom is one of Sabrina\u2019s aunts from the show he loved as a kid. He\u2019s not realized it.\u00a0 \u00a0 I don\u2019t say anything. It\u2019ll take too much work to explain it. \n \n \n \nAfter a tense scene between Mandy\u2019s mom and Tom, when she confronts him about why he\u2019d want a relationship with her when she has a child like Mandy, Bobby reacts with a \u201cWhoa,\u201d while Lily hollers, \u201cstay, stay, stay\u201d over and over when he leaves and Rosie rolls over the floor, her feet in the air, lost for a moment in her feet, in the sensation of the carpet on her back as she rolls back and forth. \n \n \n \nThey notice that Mandy sleeps through the night; Bobby exhaling \u201chuh.\u201d Bobby\u2019s said, \u201chuh\u201d a lot; this is an excellent film for getting the kids to consider all sorts of things. It is not for the faint of heart, though. It is not for all families, but even in the worst places of this, my three kids notice what should be noticed. They notice that Mandy attempts to soothe her mom after a near miss when Mandy melted down in the car. But what does it say when \u00a0\u00a0 it is obvious to three children, each in different places on the spectrum, that Mandy living at home is not a good fit, not the way it is? I wonder, thinking of bloggers I know who grapple with worse, what it means that the kind of in-home assistance and training are not readily available? How many parents live lives of despair? \n \n \n \nLater on, Jeanne says no to Mandy on going to the dog park; Mandy strikes out and hurts Jeanne yet again and runs off. This is a terrifying part of the film. As it starts, our phone rings, and I pause the film to answer. It\u2019s always interesting to realize just what my kids hear; I explain to my mom that we\u2019re finishing a film that I\u2019m reviewing and using the kids\u2019 reaction to it as part of the review. Bobby immediately guffaws out, \u201cWhat are we, lab rats?\u201d Lily picks it up and starts yelling out excitedly that they\u2019re lab rats over and over, which has him responding to her that she\u2019s talking like Mandy. It\u2019s a short, boisterous phone call. I can only imagine what it sounds like from my mom\u2019s end. Loud, I imagine. \n \n \n \nWe go back to watching the film, watch Mandy get found by Tom, watch Jeanne and Mandy check out a residential setting. The kids ask, \u201cHow long will she go there?\u201d And I say, \u201cTo 21?\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u201cWhat then?\u201d I don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s the point; there are no clear answers to what we do with or for our children who grow up and aren\u2019t ready to live independently. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d have done if we\u2019d wanted Bobby to leave home when he turned 21. If we\u2019d needed him to. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do tomorrow, either. But we are the lucky ones; he doesn\u2019t have behavioral issues and he\u2019s doing well at home. \n \n \n \nIt ends abruptly; the mom sitting down to ponder her daughter who is pleased with this residential school setting. And the girls ask, \u201cBut what happens next?\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u201cWho knows?\u201d I respond, my eyes having leaked on me. And then there\u2019s another discussion, why am I crying? Because Mandy\u2019s happy; she\u2019s found her place. And they jump up and down (not Bobby, who\u2019s wandered off to change his clothes so we can swim), and say over and over, \u201cWhy fly away? Why fly away?\u201d Jumping girlies and leaky eyes and this is our autism. Not that autism, but similar. We, as my Bobby says, have the lucky kind of autism. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://flyawaymovie.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/review-of-film-fly-away.html", "title": "\nA Review of the Film Fly Away\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 13, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Plain Talking...Ruined us Now \n \n \n \n \n \n \n((dealing with a break up of my own. Thought this would be good therapy.)) \n \n \n \nIt was going to be a long spring break. I know as soon as I picked Tikaani up from Piano Lessons he was in a bad mood. Rocking softly with Tig's frown on his face. Something happened, I didn't push it at first until I noticed that he was crying. Then I had to ask. For the almost fifteen years I've raised this boy, I've never seen him cry when he was sad. It was out of frustration as a child and as a teen he stopped crying in public. Now my wolf cub was bawling. \n \n \n \n\u201cBaby, what happened?\u201d I asked as I pulled into the freeway. He continued to cry as he pulled out his communicator and started tapping on it. He pressed 'enter' and his machine-voice spoke for him. \u201c Shantel broke up with me. Heart pain, go away, all done now Auntie\u201d\u00a0 the communicator said in it's artificial voice. Oh god. Shantel Hensley. I know Tikaani has been dating her on and off. She was in a car crash as a small child and suffered brain damage. She is a sweet girl and her parents are wonderful people, but tends to over react a lot and is really high in emotion. Apparently something broke the camel's back and Shantel broke up with him. I saw it coming really. Shantel has always been bossy with Tikaani, she is accepting of his disability but always had a habit of pushing him. Tikaani has always been the stubborn type. So it was inevitable, does it mean it shouldn't hurt. Tikaani was rocking and rubbing his hands over his face. Rubbing the tears all over his mocha colored face. It was going to be a long evening too... \n \n \n \n XxxxXxxxX \n \n \n \n I saw it coming months ago. When Shantel stopped texting me before to say good night. She keeps saying she forgets but she never did previously. Now last month when she stopped texting me I knew something was up. I got my answer when my best friend JC told me that Shantel was cheating on me. \n \n \n \n\u201c I saw her with Scoots, you know Tikaani, Eddie Collins, Scoots? She was with him.\u201d \n \n\u201c So. She goes with boys. I'm not jealous. \n \n\u201c Tikaani..she was making out with him, I saw it and everything. I even asked her when Scoots left that if she was still dating you and stuff she told me it was none of my damn business.\u201d \n \n\u201c I...I am not jealous. I'll talk to Shantel, get whole facts down.\u201d \n \n \n \n JC has Aspergers, and always been the type to state things without knowing how they might affect someone. I do the same thing honesty, so I couldn't judge him. But when he told me that Shantel was cheating on me...I could tell he was being really careful not to hurt my feelings. I think that's why he's my best friend. Because he works hard not to let his \u201caspieness\u201d try to effect our relationship. Not going to lie, I did have a crush on him for a while, but he's not bisexual like me, he likes girls. So I never told him. \n \n \n \n The break up happened after Piano Lessons. She came down from Mr. Sanchez office from her own Vocal Lessons and wanted to talk to me. I felt a weird sick feeling in my belly. Like the kind you get when you're gonna throw up. I know something was going to happen. I didn't know what. I pulled my hair and started to take off my jacket. I tried to brace myself, but it wasn't good enough. \n \n \n \n\u201c I'm sorry Tika, it's not working. This relationship is hurting both of us, I can't be your girlfriend anymore.\u201d \n \n\u201c All done.\u201d \n \n\u201c Yeah Tikaani, it's all done. Look you're a really sweet boy. But It's really hard to have relationship with someone that seems to be lost always in their world. I know you can't help it and you seem to find ways to talk with your iPhone...\u201d \n \n\u201c Not lost in world, well acquainted with it. All done. All done.\u201d \n \n\u201c Tikaani do you understand at all?\u201d \n \n\u201c Yes. Not girlfriend. All done.\u201d \n \n \n \n Yeah I understand I know what a break-up is. I also know that you are a cheating bitch. It doesn't matter anyway. It doesn't seem to matter whether she was faithful or not. When it comes down to it. Everything falls apart. \n \n \n \n XxxxXxxxX \n \n \n \n Tikaani didn't eat much as it was expected. I warned Maka and Amana that Tikaani was going to be surly this evening. I found him downstairs in the basement with his punching bag. Type O Negative was blasting in background. When girls deal with break ups, they binge on ice cream and chick flicks. When boys deal with break ups, they drink. When Tikaani grieves he blasts metal and industrial music and beats the shit out of punching bag. \n \n\u201c Hey sweetie, do you feel like talking about what happened?\u201d I asked thinking that now that he moved to drink down his power-aid he could talk to me. His communicator was charging near by. He signed no and shook his head, yet he picked up his device. \n \n\u201c Shantel cheated. JC told me. He saw. He doesn't lie. Can't lie. All done with cheater. Stick with guys now .\u201d he put down his device and started to play \u201cSmooth Criminal\u201d fitting for some reason. I smiled sadly and put a hand on his broad shoulder. \n \n\u201c Hunny, guys can be cheaters too, just ask Amana.\u201d \n \n\u201c Guys are honest. Girls try to be nice.\u201d \n \n I gave him a wry smile. In Tikaani's mind. He rather have brutal honestly than careful eggshell walking. I don't blame him. I got up to leave him to work out his grief, knowing I had dishes to do. I couldn't help recall when a psychologist told me that Tikaani wouldn't fall in love, that autists don't understand romantic love. I laughed at him. I told him that just the fearful abled world not wanting to admit that people like him have feelings. Have hearts that break. It makes it easier to persecute and oppress when you dehumanize something. He just stared at me and gave an awkward cough. Anyone that says that autistics don't have hearts to break, needs to hear my nephew cry as he kicks the punching bag. Desperately wanting the heart break to go away. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://prismsong.blogspot.com/2011/03/plain-talkingruined-us-now.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/showcase-fiction-from-nightstorm-at.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Fiction from Nightstorm at Prism*Song\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2011", "body": "\nMargie offers us  this blog post  to showcase: \n \n \n \n \n Unexpected Dr's Visit Turns Emotional \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout a month ago, I found out my kids' pediatrician, Dr Cramer, was leaving the clinic to pursue a new career. I was extremely saddened hearing the news, knowing I will never find another doctor like him! He has been an absolute blessing to me and my kids, and also completely understanding of their situation. Where will I find another doctor who trusts and takes me at my word when I say, \"My daughter has an infection\" during a phone call, and instead of insisting I come in, simply calls in the prescription for me? Exactly - no other doctor I've ever met has done that. I must say, I've been spoiled during the last 5 years. Of course, our relationship did not start out this way. Our relationship as mom and doctor to Beauty had its ups and downs. The first year was difficult since she was born with colitis and a severe milk allergy. I remember expressing my concerns regarding how my daughter seemed like she was in pain and she wasn't pooping every day. I also remember the doctor telling me, \"Oh, it's ok if they don't poop every day and maybe she's just being a bit fussy.\" Of course, since I was a new mom and he was the professional, he had the last word. Until one night, when I took my girl into the ER, where they gave her a suppository, and all of a sudden \"the flood gates opened.\"\u00a0 It was determined she had an infection which was making it extremely difficult for her to poop. After that, at our next visit a few days later, the doctor said, \"I am so sorry. I was wrong. You were right.\" Since then, there were many visits for various ailments. Once it was determined my daughter had chronic sinus issues, whenever I'd call and say, \"She's got another infection,\" the doctor learned to just call the antibiotics in. There was no reason for me to bring my daughter in, pay a co-pay, just to find out what we already knew. I always made sure to bring her in for routine check-ups and the yearly well-visits. As long as I did that, the doctor had no problems. The start of the second year was where things really turned around. Long story short, I knew my daughter was having issues and the doctor kept downplaying them. He said, \"Let's wait a little longer to see if she starts progressing.\"\u00a0 By the time we finally got an evaluation and an official diagnosis of autism, she was 2 yrs, 5 months old. The next time we had a visit with the doctor, face to face, I heard the words again; \"I am so sorry. I was wrong. You were right.\" Fast forward to last Friday, June 3. This was the doctor's very last day in the clinic, and it just so happens that my kids were sick - again. He asked that I bring them in because he wanted to check my daughter for asthma (thank goodness, she does not have asthma). I didn't mind coming in considering I really wanted to say good-bye to him face to face, and to thank him for being so helpful and understanding over the years. I was NOT PREPARED for what happened next.... Dr Cramer walked into the room and my daughter greeted him: \"There's the doctor! Hi doctor! How are you?\" With a huge smile on his face, he responded, \"I'm fine and how are you?\" \"Good, I'm good,\" she said, followed by \"Hug please?\" He gave her the OK, and she stood up and hugged him. That's when it happened . The doctor began to choke up. Tears began falling from his eyes. He looked at me and said, \"She is incredible, and you are an extraordinary mother.\" I was kind of surprised by the comment so I wasn't quite sure how to respond, but before I could, he continued.... (obviously not verbatim, but this is the gist) \"You know, I always had a certain way of thinking. I always thought our children were supposed to be perfect; perfect examples for their peers and perfect examples of their parents. When I had to diagnose [Beauty] with autism, I didn't want to do it. I thought it made her less than perfect. Now I know that's completely untrue. She is perfect. There's a person in there. She sees and thinks and interprets the world differently and that's ok.\" THEN he said... (this is where I become completely speechless...) \"But what's really changed my thinking is how you love her. You love her unconditionally. You've stood by her and helped her. Your love and devotion to your children have completely changed my life forever. You truly are an inspiration to me.\" O.O\u00a0 Say what?!\u00a0 O.O Me? An inspiration? Are you kidding? Who am I to be an inspiration to anybody? I didn't know what to say in response. I was completely flabbergasted! (wow, a college word! lol)\u00a0 But seriously, all I could do was stand there and shake my head. The doctor said, \"No, I mean it. The way you've never let autism affect your feelings towards her. The way you've loved and nurtured her in spite of her autism. I know other parents who are not that way with their child. You really are an amazing mom and Beauty is lucky to have you.\" As if that wasn't enough, he then went on to tell me how he's been reading autism books, like\u00a0 The Horse Boy \u00a0and\u00a0 Temple Grandin: I See In Pictures . \u00a0He said he's obtained a new understanding for those on the spectrum and he's gained a great respect for them. I think that last part is what makes me a bit emotional. Knowing that through his relationship with me and my daughter, he's done his own research about those on the spectrum. He's gained greater knowledge about autism that he can now share with other people he comes in contact with. For me, that's the best thing he could've told me. Not only is Dr Cramer\u00a0 aware\u00a0 of autism , \u00a0but now he's\u00a0 understanding\u00a0 of autism. It's very humbling to know I've touched someone's life like this. To know that I've changed their thinking when it comes to people with autism - that they're not less, just different - that's amazing! Ultimately, that is my goal for everyone I come in contact with, so with that in mind, I think I'll continue with my autism blog and I'll continue trying to educate others regarding autism spectrum disorders. Even if I never \"change someone's life\" again, at least I've changed one, and that's good enough for me! Good-bye, Dr Cramer; we'll miss you! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://margie.walkertribe.com/2011/06/unexpected-drs-visit-turns-emotional.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Boy-Memoir-Healing/dp/0316008249/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1307512348&sr=1-2", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307275655/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0679772898&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1X9456C5XVE14CSGGKRD", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TOewsmX16C4/Te8PPqnT3uI/AAAAAAAAAdk/E5XbyhS_jQQ/s1600/josephcramer.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/showcase-margie-from-tired-momspeaking.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Margie from Tired Mom/Speaking on the Spectrum\n"},

This week we take a closer look at Pulitzer Prize winner Tim Page.  \n \n \n \n Who is Tim Page? \n \n \n \n Probably\nbest known to readers of this blog as the author of  Parallel\nPlay: Growing Up With Undiagnosed Asperger's , Page is a writer and music critic and was music critic of the  Washington Post  where he won a Pulitzer\nPrize.  \n \n \n \n Page, from Storrs, Connecticut, and his interest in the arts was\nevident as early as 1967 when he was the subject of a short documentary \u2013  A Day With Jimmy Page \u2013  which focused on\nhis early interest in filmmaking. During this period he also studied the piano\nand started his own band \u2018Dover Beach\u2019.  \n \n Page headed to New York to attend Mannes College The\nNew School for Music, however after one year he transferred to Colombia\nUniversity, where he graduated in 1979.

{"date": "Thursday, June 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n My Daughter Is Awesome! \n \n \n \n \n \nNormally, I don't let myself get my hopes up about my daughter's future. If you have a child with autism, or any special-need, you know that it's difficult to think about their future when their present seems so uncertain. Every day is a challenge; every day is a question mark; every day you wonder, \"What will she meltdown about today? Will she get along with her brother, or will I have to separate them again? Will she wake up happy or mad?\" Some days, it's almost impossible getting through a day with her. Everything sets her off, everything that happens around her results in screaming or crying, or she just plain wants to be left alone. But this day was not one of those days... Friday, the 11th, I saw my little girl - perfect and happy - with big smiles and light shining in her eyes. She was playing with toys, playing with me, and playing with her brother, laughing - just like a regular kid. She spoke in clear, complete sentences and she didn't scream at all for the entire morning. Beauty wanted more interaction: more hugs, more tickles, more playing, more eye-contact - it was amazing!\u00a0 I don't see it often, but during that time I was able to see my little girl - really\u00a0 see \u00a0her - and autism was nowhere in sight. It was beautiful and heart-warming and I didn't take one minute of it for granted. These four hours of pure magic occurred during my daughter's monthly DIR/Floortime therapy session. The therapist arrived and Beauty woke up in a great mood, so I knew it was going to be a good day (I just didn't know how good!). Lori, the therapist, explained to me that Beauty has reached level 4 in the program and that it was time to change things up a bit. We spoke about different ways to try to allow Beauty to begin \"a circle,\" allow her to \"invite\" me into her play, and get her to interchange concepts and ideas into other forms of play.\u00a0 After discussing all of that, Lori ended with \"Just let her guide you and keep her engaged with\u00a0 you .\" So, that's what I tried to do. It may sound easy: \"let her guide you...\" but it's actually a lot of work. I have to detect when she's opening a circle, when she's ready to allow me to join her, when/ if she'll follow my lead to change the play a bit, when she changes the play so I can respond appropriately, if she's becoming more focused on her toys (so I can quickly re-engage her), and lots of other little, subtle changes. Floortime therapy is a lot more work for parents than it is for kids, I think. I've read other people's take on this type of therapy. Most parents that see \"no result\" from their kids are the ones that think the therapist is supposed to do all the work. I've never been that type of person. I want to learn what to do; the right and wrong ways to do it, and I'm not going to wait until the therapist shows up once a month to attempt the therapy with my child. I see my daughter every day; which means I have the opportunity to work with her on a regular basis. Once a month for four hours isn't going to be enough to make a significant difference. If I want to see my daughter succeed, darn it - I gotta put the work in! For the last 5 months, I've seen some positive changes - small ones - but still good. This day, however, everything came together PERFECTLY - it was simply amazing! Near the end of the four hours, Lori said she believes Beauty is ready for the social-interaction class down at the center. What's different about this class? It's a class with regular, neurotypical kids! Meaning, Beauty will be spending more time with kids her age, who don't have autism. I'm extremely excited! Of course, her preschool class has been great for her; learning to interact with other kids like her has been a great step. But for her to finally have the opportunity to be around regular kids, in a controlled environment, will be a monumental step forward for her. Beauty learns so much simply by watching other children and I can't wait to see what new thing she learns next! It's hard to think about your special-needs child's future, wondering if they'll be able to take care of themselves or if they'll make it through high school. Their futures always seems so \"up in the air.\" I have to remind myself, \"She has autism, but autism is not\u00a0 who \u00a0she is.\"\u00a0 It's difficult to remember, but I won't forget it again, especially not after that morning. I saw my daughter. I met my daughter. We had 4 beautiful hours together where autism took a break and let her breathe. She was being herself, her true self. She is beautiful and I am a proud mother.

(CARD), one of the world's largest autism treatment centers that provides state-of-the art therapy, has announced Joe Mohs, autism advocate and author of \u00a0 joeslivingproof.com , will serve as the keynote speaker at the CARD New York Autism Conference held on Saturday, June 25, 2011 held from 8 am-4 pm at the Radisson Hotel, located at 1 Radisson Plaza in New Rochelle, New York. Mohs, who was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the age of 22 months old, will share his personal journey from diagnosis to recovery and discuss how recovery is possible for many children diagnosed with ASD. \u00a0The conference is free for all attendees, including parents, educators, medical and behavioral practitioners, researchers, and students. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, today one in 110 children in America is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, making it more common than childhood cancer, juvenile diabetes and pediatric AIDS combined. The objective of the conference is to provide attendees with information on the most effective ASD interventions, give attendees strategic methods that address challenging behaviors and to showcase hands-on, groundbreaking technology used to assess and treat developmental disorders. Other featured speakers include: autism experts Deidra King, MA, MS, BCBA on \"Creating a Comprehensive and Individualized Treatment Program for a Child with ASD\", Frank Lo Curto, MS, BCBA on \"Practical Solutions for Addressing Challenging Behaviors\", and Evelyn Kung, MS, BCBA on \"Using ABA as an Effective Way to Teach Executive Functioning Skills to Individuals with ASD\" and \"Skills(tm): A Web-based Tool for Effectively Treating Children with Autism\". In addition conference attendees will view the award-winning documentary, RECOVERED: Journeys Through the Autism Spectrum and Back, a film by world-renowned autism expert Dr. Doreen Granpeesheh and Michelle Jaquis. A question and answer session with the featured speakers will follow the series of workshops.

{"date": "Thursday, June 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n Day Nine: Super Heroes! (Morning, Noon, and Night) \n Developmental specialists and pediatricians often use the lack of dramatic play as a marker when diagnosing autism. I have spoken to many a parent whose child has been denied a spectrum diagnosis because the child engages in dramatic play (all day and night). What the \"experts\" (and I use that term loosely) sometimes fail to realize is that the type of hyper-focused dramatic play that some children with autism actually engages in is not the same as the developmentally appropriate \"let me figure out who I want to be in this world\" dramatic play exhibited by neuro-typical children. My son has hyper-focused on many themes and objects over the years (he is now ten). It began with books (not so bad), and then moved to balls, then cars and dinosaurs. But his longest running theme was that he was a super hero (or, in his case, often a super villain with a heart of gold named \"Bad Guy\"). He first moved from Scooby Doo characters, to Ninja Turtles then to Ben Ten and beyond. There were many days that he would refuse to answer us unless we spoke in a character voice (my throat has never recovered from the years I have spent as Shaggy and Michelangelo...\"Dude!\") So, one can see how this dramatic play on steroids can delay or confuse service providers and parents when diagnosing autism. I don't remember anywhere, on any assessment questionnaires being asked, \"Does your child engage in dramatic play only to the exclusion of ANYTHING else?\"  I have met many other children since my son's diagnosis that pretend to be something; all day, all night. There are princesses and dinosaurs, super-heroes and even a nuclear scientist. The bottom line is, should we seek to 'extinguish' this pattern of behavior? Or should we build a bridge to the child by playing along (my personal favorite). Of all of the literature I have read on this topic, the answer, like everything else, really depends on who is writing the article. It seems that in ABA world, hyper-focusing is a bad thing...a \"preferred activity\" that should be minimized. I completely understand that we don't really want a world of autistic adults running around in capes and tiaras, but honestly, we already have neuro-typical adults who are just super-spoiled and are being taught by their parents that they are the center of the universe...so maybe we wouldn't so much mind that(surely I jest...maybe)? What we want now are children who have more moments of happiness, love and calm than of chaos, meltdowns and sadness. What we want in the future are adults who have the same as above and that are able to contribute to society in some meaningful way. I have seen the spark of joy in a child's eye when someone plays by that child's rules...even if for only a few moments. That's bridge-building material if I say so myself.  What do you think? Stop the hyper-focus or play along? (By the way, my son began to self-regulate the super-hero play at 8 years-old and has now moved on to video games...ummm...just like most other 10 year-old boys...imagine that!:)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://epicautism.blogspot.com/2011/06/day-nine-super-heroes-morning-noon-and.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/showcase-lj-at-autism-and-other-stuff.html", "title": "\nShowcase: LJ at autism (and other stuff)\n"},

The exact reason for this increase is unknown but it is theorized to be a response to the anticipated stress of the day. For those under heavy workloads or even waking up on a work day as opposed to an off day the increase is greater. This is relevant to those of us on the ASD Spectrum when viewed in light of a scientific study published in the August 2009 issue of\u00a0Psychoneuroendocrinology (by Brosnan, et al) demonstrating that adolescent males with Asperger's Syndrome presented a higher than normal incidence of impaired cortisol production. It may be that from the time we wake up we have a different response to the day's stress than the NT population. Cortisol replacement is a difficult process. Unless a patient presents with severely impaired adrenal gland function most doctors will not prescribe cortisol replacement. Still changes like making sure to waking up in daylight, waking up earlier, selective sleep deprivation and\u00a0caffeine use may fight the lack of cortisol awakening response. Investigate these and see if any make sense to try in a limited fashion.

Smith \n \n \n \n Each week, along with\u00a0 Autism Care  UK \u00a0we\nprofile a famous face across the autism spectrum. This week we take a closer\nlook at Nobel Laureate in Economics Vernon Smith. \n \n \n \n Who is Vernon L. Smith? \n \n Born in 1927 in Wichita,\nKansas, Vernon Lomax Smith is a professor  of\u00a0economics\u00a0at\nChapman University. \u00a0  He is also a\nresearch scholar at\u00a0 George\nMason University \u00a0Interdisciplinary Centre for Economic Science,\nand a Fellow of the\u00a0 Mercatus Centre  based in\u00a0 Arlington,\nVirginia .  \u00a0 One of his greatest\nachievements to date came in 2002\u00a0where he shared the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \u00a0with\u00a0 Daniel\nKahneman . Other prominent achievements include being the founder and president\nof the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics and a\nSenior Fellow at the\u00a0 Cato Institute \u00a0in\u00a0 Washington\nD.C.  As well as his bachelor\u2019s degree, M.A and Ph.D. \u00a0  Smith was awarded an hon oury\ndoctorate from \u00a0  the  Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn , an institution\nthat has also named the\u00a0 Vernon Smith Centre for Experimental\nEconomics Research ,   \u00a0after him. \n \n \n \n In the\nSpotlight \n \n Smith attended high school in his home town Wichita\nNorth High School and Friends University before he received his bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in electrical engineering from Caltech in 1949, this was supplemented\nfirst by a M.A in economics from the University of Kansas and then a Ph.D. in\neconomics from Harvard University.  \n \n In his first role after University Smith joined the\nKrannert School of Management at\u00a0Purdue University, which he held between 1955\nand 1967. As well as this at the same time Smith was also teaching at the\nprestigious Stanford University as a visiting professor. Following from these\nroles Smith moved to Massachusetts to work first at Brown University and then\nUniversity of Massachusetts. These were followed by tenures at the Centre for\nAdvanced Study in the Behavioural Sciences and then Caltech. \n \n It was during his time at Caltech that Smith was\nencouraged to, in particular by Charlie Plott, to formalize his methodology of experimental\neconomics, which he did with the publication of two articles. His first\narticle, published in 1976 in the American Economic Review (AER)  Experimental Economics: Induced Value Theory .\nThis was the first articulation of the principle behind economic experiments.\nSix years later, these principles were expanded in his second article  Microeconomic Systems as an Experimental\nScience  also in the AER. \n \n Much of Smith\u2019s research that earned Smith his\nNobel Prize took place between 1976 and 2002 while Smith was based at the\nUniversity of Arizona. After his tenure in Tucson Smith left to take up a post\nat George Mason University. This was followed by Smith founding the Economic\nScience Institute at Chapman University. In total Smith has either or\nco-authored over 200 articles and books, primarily examining capital\ntheory,\u00a0finance,\u00a0natural resource\neconomics\u00a0and\u00a0experimental economics.  \n \n Veron\u2019s experience of Ausperger\u2019s. \n \n In February 2005 Smith spoke out publicly about\nhis\u00a0Asperger syndrome.

Dylan was a talented artist from a young age, and has been described by a\nchild prodigy. \u00a0  His mother Sandy Pierce\nsays \"I remember him drawing simple shapes like squares and circles. He\nwould look at them until he 'saw' images in the shapes and then transform them\ninto life-like sketches of his favourite animals - lions and dinosaurs!\"\n(source: http://www.123soho.com). Aged just 10 Dylan was invited to the\nrenowned Atlanta Arts Festival, a multi-day celebration of the visual arts.\nHere in 1996 Dylan won First Prize in a children\u2019s art competition.  \n \n After this early success Dylan\nstarted travelling across the country to exhibit his fantastic water colours,\nusually depicting wildlife. Since 2007 Dylan has also started using oils\nalongside his traditional watercolours. In addition to wildlife he cites\nportraits as his other favourite topic. Currently working out of his Florida\nstudio, these days Dylan exhibits at more than 40 shows a year including the\nInternational ArtExpo New York and the Safari Club International Reno. He has\nwon numerous awards throughout his exhibition career, including Best of Show\nAwards, Merit Awards and People's choice. He has received local and national\nmedia attention, including, amongst others being profiled on National\nGeographic Today, Wildlife Art Magazine, QVC, and Teen People Magazine.

We developed this network after the successful passage of Ryan\u2019s Law in June of 2007. We feel compelled to share our story and experiences of Lucas\u2019 battle with autism with other families and having other families share their stories as well in hope of making a difference in the lives of families struggling with this disorder and of making the journey down the path of autism a little easier. \n \n Outside of our advocacy efforts in SC, The LUCAS Network has started a number of initiatives in the last few years and will continue to do so in the future. Because we believe that it takes a strong team to accomplish a goal,\u00a0 we partner with other autism and special needs organizations locally, statewide and nationally. Below are a list of past and present initiatives along with our partnering organizations. \n \n The South Carolina Autism Services Directory: Sandrine and I created and maintain this directory that includes services and information about autism from all across SC. It is available free of charge in electronic format. Derrick is also the Community Services Liaison for Autism Speaks in SC. Upstate SC Autism Forum : In 2008, 2009 and again in 2011, we have partnered with Brookwood Church, The SC Autism Society, Family Connection of SC, Winston's Wish Foundation, The Greenville Hospital Systems Autism Division, and Autism Speaks to bring information from the experts and service providers about autism and autism services, free of charge, to the Upstate of SC. This event has had as many as 250 parents and individuals with autism attend and includes a Resource Fair. Greenville, SC Autism Awareness Day Candlelight Vigil 2009: The Lucas Network partnered with the SC Autism Society and Family Connection to hold a candlelight vigil in\u00a0 Greenville's Falls Park. Mayor White declared that day as Autism Awareness Day for the City of Greenville. Annual Autism and Special Needs Turkey Drive : Since 2008, The LUCAS Network has initiated and partnered with The SC Autism Society and the Christy Ruppert Delseni Autism Program to provide families having a child with autism or other disability in need with a turkey and dinner for Thanksgiving. We have been able to provide as many as 90 families a Thanksgiving Day meal. Promoting Inclusion of Special Needs Students in the Public School System : The Lucas Network is currently working with The Greenville County School District, The SC Autism Society, The Hope Foundation, The Christy Ruppert Delseni Autism Program, Family Connection of SC, The Greenville Down's Syndrome Society and The Circle of Friends, The Path to Inclusion Organization to start a Circle of Friends Chapter in 5 schools within the Greenville County School District. The Lucas Network has also participated in the Autism Speaks Light it Up Blue campaign. In 2010, the Riverplace Office Building and NEXT Building in Downtown Greenville lit up in Blue. In 2011, along with last year\u2019s participants, The BMW Zentrum Museum, Hubbell Lighting, Westin Poinsett Hotel, Addy\u2019s Dutch Caf\u00e9, Coffee Underground and the Furman University Bell Tower and the West Columbia City Hall lit up in Blue for World Autism Awareness Day.

The Forum will also feature a Resource Fair of booths and exhibits for family members and educators to continue their learning outside of the forum itself. \n \nForum speakers include medical professionals and Upstate parents Phil and Amy Parham.\u00a0 Phil and Amy are the parents of three children, one with autism. In 2008, they were contestants on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Biggest Loser.\u201d During their time on the show, they lost a combined total of 256 pounds. As a couple, they lost one of the highest percentages of any married couple in \u201cThe Biggest Loser\" history. \u201c Out of 110 contestants to date, Amy holds the title of the 3 rd -highest percentage of weight loss for all the women in \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d history. \n \nPhil and Amy will be sharing their story and the role that autism has played in their lives and talk about how the entire family can remain healthy even with the challenges that the diagnosis of autism can present. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 http://www.luluhowle.com/2011Forum.html \n \n 2011 SC Upstate Autism Forum \n \n August 6 th , 2011 \n \n Agenda ( Subject to change ) \n \n \n \n 8-9am\u00a0 Resource fair \n \n 8:45am SC Faces of Autism Video Presentation \n \n 9-910am\u00a0 Opening and Welcome\u00a0 (Derrick Howle and Dr. Lisa Castellani) \n \n 910-940am\u00a0 Inspirational speakers Phil and Amy Parham \u00a0from NBC\u2019s The Biggest Loser \n \n 940-1030am\u00a0 Main Session #1\u00a0 Dr. Desmond Kelly reviewing top research in 2010 \n \n 1030-1040am Q&A \n \n 1040-1130am\u00a0 Main Session #2\u00a0 Artistas Caf\u00e9, Vicky Westra \n \n 1130-1140am Q&A \n \n 1140-1230pm\u00a0 Main Session #3\u00a0 Dr. Jane Ford on Puberty and Sexuality in Adolescents with ASDs \n \n 1230-1240pm Q&A \n \n 1240-130pm\u00a0 Lunch & Exhibits \n \n \n \n 130-225pm\u00a0 Concurrent Session #1 \n \n A. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Are Welcome, Susan Leiby, SC Autism Society \n \n B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ABCs of Functional Analysis, Mark Knight, BCBA, Hope Reach \n \n C. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ins and Outs of Insurance Coverage of ASDs, Julie Kellett, MA, Autism Wonders \n \n D. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Autism Wonders (GHS Children\u2019s Hospital Autism Program) Update, Lisa Castellani, MD, Autism Wonders \n \n 225-230pm\u00a0 Move to next Concurrent Session \n \n 230-325pm\u00a0 Concurrent Session #2 \n \n A. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transition Issues in Autism, TBD \n \n B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seizures in Autism, GHS Pediatric Neurology TBD \n \n C. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Navigating the IEP Process in Autism: Natalie Smith, Autism Coordinator, Greenville County Schools \n \n D. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evaluating Research Articles and New Autism Treatments, Julie Kellett, MA, Autism Wonders \n \n 325-330pm\u00a0 Move back to main session \n \n \n \n 330-4pm\u00a0 Closing remarks \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.luluhowle.com/", "http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/LUCASNetwork/", "http://www.scautism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=68&Itemid=96"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/2011-upstate-sc-autism-forum.html", "title": "\n2011 Upstate SC Autism Forum\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Why null ain't necessarily dull \n \n \n \n \n \nSomething slightly unusual happened this week. In a paper in the journal Vision Research, Simon Baron-Cohen and colleagues reported that they had\u00a0 failed to find any statistically significant difference between the visual acuity of individuals with and without autism. The study was a follow-up to a 2009 paper that claimed to show enhanced (or \"eagle-eyed\") visual acuity in autism. Following two particularly damning commentaries by experts in vision science, the Baron-Cohen group got together with the critics, fixed up the problems with the study, and tried to replicate their original findings. They failed. While it's slightly concerning that the original study ever made it to publication, it's heartening that the authors took the criticism seriously, the concerns were addressed, and the scientific record was set straight fairly quickly. This is how science is supposed to work. But it's something that happens all too rarely. \n \n \n \n \nIn a brilliant piece in last weekend's New York Times, Carl Zimmer highlighted\u00a0 the difficulty science has in correcting itself . Wrong hypotheses are, in principle, there to be disproven but it's not always that straightforward in reality. In particular, as Zimmer points out, scientists are under various pressures to investigate new hypotheses and report novel findings rather than revisit their own or other people's old studies and replicate (or not) their results. And many journals have a policy of not publishing replication studies, even if the outcomes should lead to a complete reassessment of the original study's conclusions.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere is, however, a deeper problem\u00a0that Zimmer doesn\u2019t really go into. \n \n \nMost of the time, at least in the fields of science I'm familiar with, we\u2019re in the business of null hypothesis testing. We're looking for an effect - a difference between two conditions of an experiment or two populations of people, or a correlation between two variables. But we test this effect statistically by seeing how likely it is that we would have made the observations we did if our hypothesis was wrong and there wasn\u2019t an effect at all. If the tests suggest that it\u2019s unlikely that this null hypothesis can account for the data, we conclude that there was an effect. The criteria are deliberately strict. By convention, there has to be less than a 5% chance that the null hypothesis can explain your data before you can confidently conclude that an effect exists. This is supposed to minimize the occurrence of people making grand claims based on small effects that could easily have come about purely by chance. But the problem is that it doesn\u2019t work in reverse. If you\u00a0 don\u2019t find a statistically significant effect, you can\u2019t be confident that there isn\u2019t one. Reviewers know this. Editors know this. Researchers know that reviewers and editors know this. Rather than being conservative, null hypothesis testing actually biases the whole scientific process towards spurious effects entering the literature and biases against publication of follow-up studies that don't show such an effect. Failure to reject the null hypothesis is seen as just that - a failure. This is something with which I'm well acquainted.\u00a0 My PhD \u00a0was essentially a series of failures to replicate. \u00a0To cut a very long story very short, a bunch of studies in the mid 90s had apparently shown that, during memory tasks, people with Williams syndrome rely less on the meanings of words and more on their sounds. I identified a number of alternative explanations for these results and, like a good little scientist, designed some experiments to rule them out. Lo and behold, all the group differences disappeared. \nPerhaps not surprisingly, publishing these studies turned out to be a major challenge. One paper was rejected four times before being finally accepted.\u00a0By this time, I'd finished my PhD, completed a post-doc on similar issues in Down syndrome, and published two papers arising from that study. In some ways, they were much less interesting than the Williams syndrome studies because they really just confirmed what we already knew about Down syndrome. But they contained significant group differences and were both accepted first time. \n So the big question. How do you get a null result published? One helpful suggestion comes from Chris Aberson in the brilliantly titled Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis. He points out that you can never really say that an effect doesn\u2019t exist. What you can do, however, is\u00a0 report confidence intervals on the effect size . In other words, you can say that, if an effect exists, it\u2019s almost certainly going to be very small. Another possibility is to\u00a0 go Bayesian . Rather than simply telling you that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, Bayesian statistics provides information on how likely it is that the null hypothesis versus the experimental hypothesis is correct given the observed data. I haven't attempted this yet myself so I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has. The strategy I've found really helpful is to look at factors that contribute to the size of the effect you're interested in. For example, in one\u00a0 study on context effects in language comprehension in autism , we were concerned that group differences in previous studies were really down to confounding group differences in language skills. Sure enough, when we selected our control group to have similar language skills to our autism group, we found no difference between the two groups. But more importantly, within each group, we were able to show that an individual's language level predicted the size of their context effect. This gave us a significant result to report and\u00a0in itself is quite an interesting finding. This brings me neatly to my final point. In research on disorders such as autism or Williams syndrome, a significant group difference is considered to be the holy grail. In terms of getting the study published, it certainly makes life easier. But there is another way of looking at it. If you find a group difference, you\u2019ve failed to control for whatever it is that has caused the group difference in the first place. A\u00a0significant effect should really only be the beginning of the story. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-null-aint-necessarily-dull.html", "http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/06/eagle-eyed-autism-no.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26ideas.html", "https://sites.google.com/site/drjonbrock/publications/language-and-memory-in-williams-syndrome", "http://www.jasnh.com/a6.htm", "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3175048777387755817&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2010", "http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com/2010/09/using-eyetracking-to-investigate.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/06/from-jon-brock-why-null-aint.html", "title": "\nFrom Jon Brock: Why null ain't necessarily dull.\n"},

Imagine this: Jack, a sweet, chubby-cheeked pre-schooler in the autism-specific classroom, desperately wants to play with Simon, a general education peer. Simon asks, \u201cJack, do you want to play with me?\u201d \u00a0Jack is unable to respond and echoes back, \u201cJack, do you want to play with me?\u201d\u00a0 His puzzled classmate walks away. As you can see, Jack\u2019s autism hampers his social skills and he is unable to engage in the unstructured play that takes place on the empty playground.\u00a0 Every day, he walks the perimeter of the playground for the entirety of recess, flapping his hands in front of his eyes while his general education peers run and play meaningfully with each other.\u00a0 Jack\u2019s language and play deficits increase his isolation, exacerbating his environment of deprivation, and shutting out the myriad learning opportunities that his general education peers access. Jack needs a structured play environment. After engaging in this solitary behavior day in and day out, Jack has lost the equivalent of 7.5 (180 hours) days of social interaction by the end of the school year. This social interaction is invaluable to Jack\u2019s development. Research shows that children engage in play activities to practice valuable life skills such as conflict resolution, negotiation, and taking the perspective of others.\u00a0 For Jack, even the paucity of opportunity to use language is devastating.\u00a0 As Jack continues to pace the playground perimeter, hand-flapping in his own world, the window for neurological development is rapidly shutting, and those lost 7.5 days will never be regained. Without opportunities for engaged play, Jack will lose even more precious time. A play space is something most schools, parents, and students take for granted, but\u00a0Jack and his classmates don\u2019t have one. \u00a0An inclusive play space will drastically change the outcome for students like Jack. \u00a0It gives them a place to play with their typically-developing peers, practicing social skills and gross motor skills. \u00a0A play space at John Muir Elementary School would even the playing field for the students, and give them opportunities to engage in joyous play-something every child deserves!

Sinclair first came into wider recognition in 1992,  \u00a0 when along with fellow autistics Kathy Lissner\nGrant and Donna Williams he formed  Autism Network International .\nOut of the trio, Jim was the only one who had an internet connection so he\nbecame the original contributor. In the early to mid-1990\u2019s autism conferences\nrarely featured autistic public speakers, and were extremely unlikely to pay\nthem for their work. \u00a0  Jim Sinclair broke\nthe mould and was amongst the first to speak at conferences both at a national\nand international level. Considering he did not speak until aged 12, this in\nitself was a fantastic achievement. \n \n \n Jim Sinclair is the author of  Don\u2019t Mourn for Us , an essay on autism\nthat got wide spread media coverage including The New York Times and New York\nMagazine.  Don\u2019t Mourn for Us  was presented\nat the joint Autism Society of America and Autism Society Canada conference, Toronto\nin July 1993. Although Jim had spoken at conferences before, they had usually\ninvolved him being asked to describe an aspect of what it\u2019s like to be autistic\nfollowed by answering some questions from parents.  \n \n \n This time though, Jim had a message of his own\nthat he wanted present. He had previously submitted the same paper in 1992 to\nthe Autism Society of America conference. However, the then president of the\nASA took the unprecedented step of personally instructing the conference\u2019s\nplanning committee not to accept the paper. Undeterred, Sinclair submitted the\npaper for the international conference and the hosts accepted it.  \u00a0 As Sinclair himself says \u201cThe paper  directly challenging the\n\"autism as tragedy\" paradigm upon which the conference--and its sponsoring\norganizations--were based\u201d. \n \n \n Jim Sinclair is also featured in the book  Somebody Somewhere  written by fellow ANI\nfounder Donna Williams.

Your worlds are so detailed that it made me feel like I was inside the story. Reading your book was like watching a movie in HD.\" \n \nThis is a question I get asked again and again when people read my juvenile sci-fi novel Warriors of the Edge. It's a question I'd like an answer to myself. Just how did I come up with all these worlds? \n \n I started a  blog  in an attempt to answer that question. That means you're going to get plenty of information on Asperger's syndrome, or autism spectrum disorder, because I have an autistic brain. That's what makes me highly focused, detailed oriented, and repetitive. I have a knack for focusing on only one thing and repeating it for months or years on end. That focus gives me abilities and problems. One ability it gives me is that I'm able to describe my worlds in great detail because I focus on them in such depth. If you want to know the problems my focus brings me, just keep reading my blogs. \n \n You don't have to be on the autism spectrum to get something out of my blogs. I deal with a number of issues, such as writing tips, developing an inventor's mindset, innovative ideas for education, relationship issues, dealing with negativity, living in a progressive world, and future development. You'll also find an indepth look at what Asperger's syndrome is all about, such as theory of mind, childhood play, the subconscious mind, depression, special interests, empathy, learning disabilities, communication struggles, the working world, and imagination pertaining to fiction writing. \n \n In his book The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome, author Tony Attwood writes, \"Some children, especially girls, with Asperger's syndrome can develop the ability to use imaginary friends, characters and worlds to write quite remarkable fiction. This could lead to success as an author of fiction for children or adults.\" \n \n This is what happened to me. What makes this more remarkable is the fact that I lived a life of severe impairment when it came to my thinking processes. I wasn't able to go on to college or hold down a job because of it. Many doctors wrote me off as a hopeless case. No one expected anything great out of me. \n \n But that impairment was hiding a secret. Somewhere inside of me were vivid and complex imaginary worlds just waiting to be unleashed. It would take years before I could find a way to express what was in my mind. And when I did, it opened up a new universe for others to enjoy. \n \n I hope you enjoy this look at how I created my imaginary worlds.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://warriorsoftheedge.com/blog_263.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/showcase-katie-bridges.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Katie Bridges\n"},

This is only my second time reading. The first time I read it, 23 years ago, it impacted me so much I ordered a personalized license plate for my car that read PEQUOD. In any case, on this my second reading, I was struck by the bravery of Starbuck to voice his concerns about the captain's mission of seeking revenge on the whale that took his leg. Captain Ahab is not portrayed as a very open boss and indeed implies that further disagreement from his first officer will be seen as potential mutiny. Faced with that threat and the fact that the crew seemed to back the Captain, Starbuck stands down and in a moment of foreshadowing remarks that he hopes the entire compliment is not doomed (SPOILER ALERT: all but Ishmael die). It is easy to criticize Starbuck for his capitulation but in reality we should praise him for even offering resistance. How many times have we seen it where no one wants to risk the wrath of authority so does not say anything? While working in the mortgage industry I saw first hand where people who knew certain practices were wrong or harmful did not say anything because the boss/leader wanted to pursue the course of action. Everyone around them followed the boss because they thought that was where their fortune lay. It is a subtle form of bullying that comes into play at that time. The leader questions your loyalty, paints you as a traitor and worse, alone in your thoughts. Others see the humiliation or aggression and turtle up abandoning you. For those of us on the Spectrum any one of those things can be a devastating reminder of how we are not part of the majority group. Put together it is a psychological blow that is hard to recover from. So if you ever have stood up to someone in that setting do not get down on yourself for what followed. Instead, give yourself credit for saying something... and try to find the nearest life raft; don't gamble that you will be the Ishmael of the group.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://asdjobsink.blogspot.com/2011/07/autism-aspergers-asd-bully-bullying.html", "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/showcase-scott-j-sheas-subtle-workplace.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Scott J Shea's \"Subtle workplace bullying\"\n"},

This\nweek\u2019s autism success story profiles German author and filmmaker Axel Brauns.  \n \n \n \n Who\nis Axel Brauns?  \n \n \n \n Born in Hamburg, Germany, Axel Brauns is a writer\nand filmmaker who is highly respected within his own country. After school\nBrauns began studying law, however he stopped his studies in 1984 to\nconcentrate on his writing.  \n \n He has published numerous novels and created the\npopular German literal character  Adina\nAdelung , and been\nnominated for the German Book Prize. As well as this, in 1992 he penned his\nbestselling autobiography  Shadows and\nColoured Bats \u2013 Living in another world  where he describes his autism,\nwhich he says affected him from the age of one. Braun\u2019s first feature film was  Tsunami and Stone Piles  and was\ncritically acclaimed.  \n \n Braun is also the subject of the full length\ndocumentary  The Red Carpet  which\nfocuses on his autism as well as his creative process and his life in general,\na clip of which can be seen here -  http://tinyurl.com/redcarpetclip .  \n \n Axel\u2019s Experience of Autism \n \n Like\nmany on the autistic spectrum, Braun is fascinated in studying a particular\ntopic. In Braun\u2019s case, it is a reference book about German racing horse statistics\nand genetic information:  German Harness\nRacing Studs.  \u00a0 It was as a result of\nthe joy that reading this book that inspired Brauns to write books of his own.\nHe states in the film \u201cMy dream was to write a book that pleased other people as\nmuch as this book pleased me\u201d. Axel realised that unlike him most people are\ninterested in stories as opposed to race horse statistics, so decided to start\nwriting fiction.  \n \n In\nhis younger days Braun was unable to speak. As he grew older Axel painstakingly\ntaught himself facial expressions, speech patterns, and even comic timing by\nwatching films and reading books. His persistence paid off. Axel admits he\nstill feels uncomfortable around people he doesn\u2019t know and forces himself to\nspend time in public.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["", "", "http://www.autismcareuk.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/autism-success-stories-axel-brauns.html", "title": "\nAutism Success Stories - Axel Brauns\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 9, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nFrom The Autistic Me:\u00a0 http://theautisticme. blogspot.com/ \n \nLike many people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, I struggle with interpersonal communication. Anxiety accompanies most face-to-face interactions, as worry that something inevitably will go awry. Discovering the power of words revealed a way to be a participant in society, not merely an observer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nWriting allows me to interact with the world. To be more precise, words empower me. My \u201cwriting\u201d is a mix of scribbled marks on paper, auto-completed words typed on computer keyboards, and speech converted into text by dictations software. How the words are recorded, stored, and transmitted to others is important, but what matters most is that words are essential to my nature. Words really do define who I am.\u00a0 \n \nI realize that waxing poetic about words defining me seems like a clich\u00e9 to some people, one that any aspiring author might use to describe his or her motivations to write a story or a poem. In my case it is the truth. Vocationally, I am a professor of rhetoric: the art of communicating effectively. Avocationally, I am a poet, playwright, and screenwriter. Words are my work and my hobby. \n \nWithout writing I would be more alienated, more alone, than I am. Don\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not unhappy or miserable, but I am aware that I\u2019m not included in activities with coworkers or peers. I know that I drive people away with what they perceive as an anti-social personality. At best, I\u2019m viewed as egocentric. But when I communicate via writing, people tell me I\u2019m witty and entertaining. Words don\u2019t have to read faces or interpret vocal pitch. My words build connections I\u2019d never be able to initiate in person. \n \nI do not understand people; they are confusing. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t understand words or their meanings. What I\u2019ve discovered is that there are too many variables to interpret what people actually mean when they say the simplest things. Unless it is a well-worn metaphor, a phrase I have memorized, I tend to be literal. For me, listening to and reading English is a process of translation. When I was first learning Spanish, I would translate phrases to and from basic English. I do the same with the complex English most people use with ease in speech and writing. I learn metaphors and idioms by context. This is difficult to explain because most people ask, \u201cDon\u2019t we all translate metaphors?\u201d I think the difference might be how quickly, almost instinctively, most people seem to make these symbolic connections. \n \nConsider this sentence from a story I heard: \u201cHer fingers were icicles.\u201d\u00a0 \n \nMost people seem to understand instantly that the example means a woman has cold hands. When I hear or read the sentence, even now, I pause to \u201clook it up\u201d in my memory and consider all the possible meanings. If it is a cartoon character, then she might have literal icicles for fingers. What about someone frozen to death? What about fingernails that are long and pointy, resembling icicles? Then I recall people saying things are \u201ccold as ice\u201d and start forming various connections. It might only take a few seconds longer than for most people, but I have been told that I look \u201cblank\u201d or confused at times during conversations. What I\u2019m really doing during these moments is analyzing metaphors and rushing through my mental index.\u00a0 \n \nThankfully, I have memorized thousands of common sayings and have a pretty decent thesaurus-like approach to these. I love dictionaries of common idioms and metaphors, since such books spare me the effort of translating sayings I encounter in texts. Plus, language is fascinating to study. My fascination with language is key to my academic survival; it is also key to any vocational success I enjoy.\u00a0 \n \nImagine hearing only monotone voices, void of any excitement, sorrow, anger, or love. While my world isn\u2019t quite that bland, it can feel close to it. When you cannot read people, you learn to listen to the words spoken and ignore the manner in which they are spoken. You eventually learn, through unpleasant experiences, that people do not always mean what they say. Sarcasm in monotone is meaningless. Thankfully, some sarcastic phrases can be memorized and variations interpolated. Without an ear for inflection, without grasping the clues tone, pitch, and speed provide a listener, the greater parts of human speech are lost. \n \nStanding among a group of colleagues, they might start laughing at a sentence it takes me some time to decode. By the time I comprehend the humor, the conversation has moved along \u2014 leaving me behind. It is nobody\u2019s fault, and I don\u2019t think it would be fair of me to ask a group to wait for my mind to catch up with the words. There are times in groups when I feel like I\u2019m merely an observer, not a participant. I try not to be frustrated by this, but sometimes I am annoyed by my mental processes. My mind gets overloaded by casual conversations or heated debates. There\u2019s simply too much going on behind the words.\u00a0 \n \nPeople in a group are doing more than speaking. There are facial expressions, gestures, proximities, and additional non-verbal components to communication. I study these elements of interaction, hoping to understand them better and to mimic them with some skill. Over the years, I believe I have developed the ability to mimic quite well. I doubt most people meeting me only once or twice would notice anything unusual in my responses to them. It is over time that people notice I\u2019m not like everyone else. Sudden or unexpected gestures can seem threatening to me and cause anxiety. When I can\u2019t anticipate someone moving an arm or waving a finger, I might flinch or step away. Facial expressions are at least not threatening in quite the same way as movements. Expressions are confusing, though. \n \nIt is difficult for some people to believe, but I have confused \u201chappy\u201d facial expressions for sadness and anger for surprise. For me, body language is like the English words and phrases I look up and study so I can interpret what people mean when they speak to me. I try to analyze faces carefully, looking at details based on books I have read. I have read a lot about body language and, like my obsession with books of sayings, I believe my ability to interpret people has improved with each book read. Of course, using memorized cues doesn\u2019t mean I get the cues right every time\u2026 but it is better than I was doing before reading on the topic of body language.\u00a0 \n \nUnfortunately, I\u2019m still not good with conversations. I hyper-focus on issues and interests, to the point of annoying those in my presence. I latch on to ideas, concepts, objects, projects, and people for a sense of stability and purpose. While others adapt easily to temporary changes in settings and routines, I find minor deviations from my routine generate a sense of panic and anxiety. As a result, in a social situation I locate a safe, quiet, predictable location and remain there. I try to remain in place so others can approach \u2014 and leave \u2014 as they want. I can address groups because the distance between an audience and me provides security. The more distance, the better. No one can tell if eye contact isn\u2019t perfect when I\u2019m standing a dozen or more feet away. \n \nWhen I do interact with individuals, I am as likely as not to offend them. I do not have the social skills society expects, especially in business. Despite my best attempts, I frequently lack tact and subtlety. I sometimes anticipate that what I am about to say might be improper, but I still speak aloud. How can I recognize something is improper? I have created a mental list of things I have been told were improper in the past. The list grows more slowly now, but it is still growing. Sometimes I forget a question or statement is on the list of things I should not say or ask. How can you anticipate every combination of circumstance and every potential social exchange? Even the guidelines I have created for myself based on more than 40 years of social interactions can fail me in humiliating ways. \n \nYou \u201csay\u201d the wrong thing in an essay, it becomes humorous. You ask pointed questions in an editorial, that\u2019s considered being a tough journalist. But there are things apparently not said aloud. Writing lets me say or ask almost anything with impunity. It is nice not to worry about my thoughts being socially acceptable. And I get to write at home or in my office, as opposed to navigating a new place.\u00a0 \n \nI am anxious in new situations and settings, often relying on habits to remain calm. I can\u2019t really explain it, but I will try to do something inconspicuous with my hands, arms, or legs to relax. I might tap my cane, for example, using the rhythm to soothe my nerves. Familiar objects become essential to cope with my anxieties. Leaving home without at least one such object can be disastrous. I\u2019ve risked being late to important events or meetings in order to return home for a forgotten item. It isn\u2019t about one item or even a small set of items. I simply need whatever it is at that moment that helps me relax. \n \nEven when I am alone, safe at home, I am not always comfortable. Lights, sounds, smells, and even textures can send me into a downward spiral if I do not take quick action. It can be a simple shirt tag scratching my neck, but it will feel like a knife carving into my flesh. Maybe it is only a banana peel in the kitchen trash, but I\u2019ll smell it in the bedroom and be overwhelmed by the odor. A car backfiring echoes painfully between my ears, hurting so much I fear my ears will literally bleed. I have even been annoyed by the texture of paper in a book, which felt like sandpaper to my fingers. \n \nAt least alone, I can take action to restore order \u2014 after I calm down and think through the situation. I can remove a shirt tag. I can take out the trash. I can put a book down for a while. Okay, I burrow under a pillow after a car backfires, but at least I can do something to recover. It is the unpredictable, the thing I cannot prepare for, that sends me into the deepest downward spiral. Imagine taking these sensitivities into a social situation. Why would I risk that? There is always something I won\u2019t be able to ignore.\u00a0 \n \nI have described the sounds around me as constant static. It becomes overwhelming at times, but I realize I have to force myself to deal with the background noise most of the time. I end up using one sound to block the others. At night, I will turn on a radio to drown out any sounds from outside. The worst annoyance is that I cannot ignore conversations, much less other sounds. I hear bits and pieces of every conversation around me in a restaurant, at a party, or even on a train. The voices can be too much, and I have excused myself from dinner because it. \n \nI could continue to list personality traits, attempting to explain how I experience the world, but doing so would serve no purpose. While there are medical explanations for how I am, none excuse my lack of interpersonal skills. I am tired of acronyms and labels, diagnoses made after each new test. What matters is that I can write. \n \nWriting is one form of communication I can master. Words on paper are clear and concise. When I write, I can edit and improve my thoughts. I can correct the mistakes I would make in person. Writing is my freedom. It is my appreciation for words that guided me back to school (several times) and helped me finally complete a graduate degree program. My journey isn\u2019t over, and never will be. At least I\u2019ll have words and writing along the way.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://theautisticme.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/showcase-autistic-me.html", "title": "\nShowcase: C.

Those groups that measure high on the UAI tend to experience high anxiety regarding uncertainty and seek to limit or minimize the uncertainty in any given situation. Cultures that measure low on the index try to have as few rules as possible, are more pragmatic and are more tolerant of change. Examples of countries that are high on the UAI are Greece, Russia, Poland and Portugal (contrary to popular views of Germany is it much closer to the middle). Countries that score low on the scale are Sweden, China and the UK;\u00a0while the US is low at a score of 46 it is not the lowest by far. \n \nFrom a theoretical standpoint I think the Autsim subculture would score very high on this index. In fact I suspect most readers of that last statement said \"well, duh\". Ritualistic behavior, precision and the need for sameness are hallmarks of of autistic behavior at all levels and sometimes, depending on the situation, this has been included as part of the Autistic Advantage ( source ). \n \nFor those of us in low scoring countries like the UK, Australia, Canada, China and the US ( map ) I cannot think of a stronger point of conflict between the subculture and culture as a whole. In those countries that are high on the Index many of these behaviors may be seen as well within cultural bounds offering a rare break for ASD folk in their attempts at integrating with society. \n \nI would go into detail regarding\u00a0 Kwintessential's tips \u00a0for dealing with cultures that score lower than us on UAI but I imagine they are well known in practice, if not theory. All of us in low index countries have had to learn to deal with the changes common to the neurotypical society around us and being told to be more flexible. I would be interested to hear how someone from a high UAI country experiences this dimension. \n \nAs suggestions to those of us on the Spectrum I would say focus on the anxiety created by the changes with typical anxiety measures such as meditation, calming talk, a type of tea that works for you and possibly medication. \u00a0Xanax has been used for anxiety attacks but the potential for addiction and misuse make it impractical for any sustained usage.

We\u2019re going to have to put together an entire behavior protocol about putting his hands down his pants in public.\u00a0 He just doesn\u2019t understand that this is something he should do in the privacy of his room.

I\u2019m not sure. \n He wants to hang out with the ladies, but he has no idea what to do.\u00a0 So he resorts to sniffing their hair surreptitiously or, gulp, licking a girl\u2019s arm while swimming next to her in the ocean.\u00a0 (Hey, he likes girls and he likes salty things, so\u2026. Why not?\u00a0\u00a0I swear, ask my brother-in-law John, he saw it too.) \n And, since I\u2019m the closest female to Conor, I get lots of questions, like pointing at my breasts or my crotch and saying, \u201cCan I touch that?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, Conor, that\u2019s private.\u201d Mostly, he listens.\u00a0 Mostly. \n But that\u2019s not all.\u00a0 What I remember most about my own puberty is the moodiness. \u00a0All those hormones floating around, wreaking havoc.\u00a0 One time, I cried because my birthday was on Thanksgiving.\u00a0 That was it, nothing major.\u00a0 Just\u2026 didn\u2019t want my birthday on Thanksgiving, I guess.\u00a0 Actually, I think I turned twelve that year.\u00a0 My poor parents. \n Moodiness for Conor signals unpredictability.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be playing the Wii happily, then run into the kitchen looking for someone to punch.\u00a0 He\u2019ll go along with the exercise program quite happily one day.

I've been on the phone, in businesses, and on the computer working to make this happen. And I've had some wonderful friends help me with this. It's coming together, and I can't wait to see families walk through those doors and hopefully leave two hours later, armed with tips, tools, information, and the absolutely vital realization that they are not alone. I'd like to give them a little more than that, though. I'd love it if bloggers would share their posts, their worries, their tips, and their tools. We'll run them on the directory, and every attendee will leave with the event with a business card for the directory so that they can read the offerings on their own time. I'll showcase those entries that are up on the directory when I give my presentation. Help me show my local community just what a great international community there is out there, show them the diversity and the acceptance that they'll find.

{"date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "body": "\n The Empathy Question, Revisited: Theory of Mind, Culture, and Understanding July 25, 2011 WRITTEN BY WOMANWITHASPERGERS The recent opening of Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg\u2019s new  Autism and Empathy website  has started me thinking about the whole empathy question in regards to autistic people again. In  my first post  about autistics and empathy, I mentioned Theory of Mind issues as one of the possible reasons why there is a perception that autistic people lack empathy. With what I had read about Theory of Mind at the time, I\u2019m now reexamining the concept and wondering if I had gotten it slightly wrong, especially in light of the recent challenges that other autistic writers have made to the prevailing ideas about autistics and Theory of Mind. The Sally-Anne Test The prevailing idea about autistics and Theory of Mind goes something like this: having good Theory of Mind means that a person is able to determine the contents of both one\u2019s own mind and the minds of others; conversely, autistic people are unable to determine or reflect on the contents of other people\u2019s minds. In short, the idea is that autistic people are unable to understand other people\u2019s minds and know that others think differently than they do. This idea was put forth in  Simon Baron-Cohen\u2019s 2001 paper on the subject , and I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t unpack it a little further before writing my first post about empathy and autistics. Now that I have, I again have to say: what a load of bullshit. Cracks in the Edifice To me, possessing a Theory of Mind means that one is able to get inside someone else\u2019s head \u2013 and dare I say, heart \u2013 and understand what he or she might be thinking or feeling. This practice can be evident in many applications, both practical and creative. For example, my craft as a  poet  \u2013 especially one who frequently writes persona pieces in the voices of other individuals \u2013 requires me to get inside someone else\u2019s head in order to write. The words, idioms, and imagery may have been generated by me, but I do this whilst wearing the \u201cskin\u201d of someone else. According to Dr. Baron-Cohen, I should not be able to do this at all, due to an \u201cimpaired\u201d Theory of Mind. But I do, and do so frequently. How does one explain this? It might be easy to explain me away as an anomaly: a possessor of  Raven Medicine  (if you are into Native American Spirituality), or perhaps someone who has learned how to do this by mimicry. However, I do not believe I am alone in my capabilities to do this. Other autistics are stepping forwarding and speaking about their own perspectives and experiences empathy as well as their abilities to discern what others are thinking or feeling:  Cohen-Rottenberg  debunked the idea on her Journeys with Autism  blog and Yusuf Smith  systematically took apart  Dr. Baron-Cohen\u2019s ideas on  his blog . Other autistic writers are questioning the very nature of empathy itself.  Aspie Rhetor discusses an article by Dennis Lynch, \u201cRhetorics of Proximity: Empathy in Temple Grandin and Cornel West\u201d which argues that true empathy requires a \u201cbodily displacement\u201d \u2013 in other words, to walk in someone else\u2019s shoes, you literally must remove your feet from your own. Aspie Rhetor also states earlier in her post that \u201cempathy\u2026 can only be remotely successful when engaged between people with similar backgrounds, people who occupy similar social stations\u201d. Considering these points, one has to wonder if true empathy is ever possible: how able or willing are we to remove ourselves from our own shoes and truly understand the viewpoint of someone else, especially if they are fundamentally different from us? Culture Clash Aspie Rhetor\u2019s statements intrigued me and I started to think about the issues of empathy and culture. The reigning experts on autism may not be taking cultural differences into account with the whole empathy question \u2013 and by culture, I do not simply mean race (which is NOT a biological truth but a sociological and cultural construct anyway), ethnicity, religion, etc. One must broaden the connotation of the word \u201cculture\u201d when considering this question. To begin, how do we define \u201cculture\u201d? The World English Dictionary includes the following definitions in its entry for that word: \u201c1. the total of the inherited ideas, beliefs, values, and knowledge, which constitute the shared bases of social action 2. the total range of activities and ideas of a group of people with shared traditions, which are transmitted and reinforced by members of the group: the Mayan culture\u201d If we accept this definition as valid, then we must think beyond the general idea of culture and consider non-traditional connotations of the word. Organizations have their own distinct cultures \u2013 for example, I can identify and describe the distinct culture of my place of employment. One could argue that each family has a culture. Both entities fit the second definition\u2019s requirement of having \u201cshared traditions, which are transmitted and reinforced by members of the group\u201d. Now, let\u2019s expand this out to the idea outward and generalize it a bit more. What if neurotypicals could be considered part of a wider \u201cculture\u201d, and autistics part of another? While I realize I am stretching this a bit, I ask you to consider this idea for a moment. As Aspie Rhetor and others have suggested, neurotypicals may have schemas of what is considered \u201ccorrect\u201d empathy \u2013 which is an inherited idea by other neurotypical individuals. Those who do not display empathy according to these schemas may be labeled as \u201clacking empathy\u201d. However, I think of many people who have left comments on this blog who have discussed their own experiences with expressing and possessing empathy, as well as some of the writers on the  Autism and Empathy  website who describe not only their own empathetic reactions but those of their autistic/Aspie children. Additionally, I think of Laura Nadine\u2019s video, \u201c My Violin Cries \u201d in which she talks about how she dealt with the loss of her violin teacher and mentor, as well as this short video by AspergerSquare8, \u201c Autistic Awareness \u2013 Empathy \u201d. All of these individuals attest that at least some of the autistic population possesses empathy. So, given the above, could it be that what is often misconstrued as a \u201clack of empathy\u201d is simply the failure of one wider \u201cculture\u201d to understand another? In other words, could the consistent claims of lack of empathy on the part of autistics be the result of neurotypical researchers/scientists/psychologists/etc. judging autistic empathy by neurotypical standards? Wearing the Other\u2019s Shoes I recall when the movie \u00a0Avatar was released that there were many who were critical of the whole premise of the film, which chronicled the desire of a member of a dominant culture wanting to become the \u201cother\u201d: a human becoming a Na\u2019vi and then eventually wanting to join them. Race relations were discussed in light of the film, suggesting \u201cWhite arrogance\u201d and parallels to Dances with Wolves. After hearing and reading some discussions, and reflecting on these discussions, it is easy to wonder if it is ever possible to wear the shoes of another\u2026especially if it\u2019s someone from a perceived \u201cmajority\u201d culture trying to understand someone from a perceived minority. By extension, it\u2019s also easy to wonder if most neurotypicals will be able to understand or empathize with autistic people. What I might term \u201cdominant culture arrogance\u201d is present in many forms and in many civilizations. For example, one might example caste relations in India and conclude that some arrogance exists on the part of those in higher castes which would stand in the way understanding or empathy \u2013 for example, a Brahmin attempting to see the viewpoint of or empathizing with a Harijan. Or, if I wish to avoid the \u201cmajority/minority\u201d dialectic, I might suggest another term: \u201ccross-cultural arrogance\u201d. In this case, it could be defined as the tendency to consider one\u2019s own culture/group/etc. to be universal, natural, or even superior versus that of another. But in either case, the arrogance would exist. What would cause such arrogance? One might conclude that this arrogance, along with prejudice and biases, were inherited from parents of other family members; unless one choses to reject them, they remain with an individual throughout adulthood. Included with this arrogance would be a natural tendency to look down on those from a different, or perceived \u201cminority\u201d culture (the \u201cother\u201d). Additionally, another factor which could stand in the way of empathy is simple ignorance \u2013 a lack of knowledge or understanding about the other culture in question. This kind of ignorance may be caused by a lack of exposure to the \u201cother\u201d, possible due to a lack of opportunities (e.g. not actually knowing an autistic person, thus being ignorant of what one would be like). What\u2019s also interesting is that another cause of this kind of ignorance would be the very prejudice and arrogance I spoke of earlier \u2013 such characteristics would cause a person to notwant to get to know the \u201cother\u201d, thus the ignorance continues. The Requirements of Empathy and Understanding: Truth Versus Fiction It is easy to wonder if one can truly remove oneself from one\u2019s own shoes to truly experience the world through the eyes of another. This, I would think, would require one to leave one\u2019s own culture, upbringing, personal prejudices, mental filters, and even perhaps one\u2019s own identity behind to do this. For many, this is certainly no small task \u2013 it is easier to empathize with someone that you can easily identify with. Yusuf Smith  gives the example of the attitudes of French feminists towards Muslim girls who wish to wear veils, stating, \u201cthey identify with the girls who do not want to, and insist that their right not to wear the veil comes before the right of those who insist on wearing it to receive an education or, in some cases, employment\u201d. In other words, this would be a form of flawed empathy, and I would imagine it would be very hard for those feminists to imagine themselves wanting to wear a veil. This would require those feminists to leave behind their own ideas, beliefs, and mental filters. Similarly, it is easy for neurotypicals to imagine a hellish, painful existence as an autistic, basing their assumptions upon their own ideas/beliefs/prejudices. However, in his article, \u201c Don\u2019t Mourn for Us \u201d, Jim Sinclair says that \u201cthe tragedy is not that we\u2019re here, but that your world has no place for us to be\u201d.  I know this is true from personal experience, as my personal pain related to Asperger Syndrome has nothing to do with the Asperger\u2019s itself but more to do with its encounters in a neurotypical world, which include emotionally painful things such as misunderstandings and prejudice as well as physically painful things such as sensory overload. However, once prejudice and arrogance has been removed and any \u201cculture clash\u201d I spoke of earlier has begun to melt away, I believe that successful acts of understanding and empathy can occur. First of all, we must remember that the human existence can be summarized by basic needs and desires. I think of Abraham Maslow\u2019s  Hierarchy of Needs  in which specific needs fall into five categories: physiological (sleep, food, drink), security (financial stability, a safe neighborhood), social needs (belonging, love), esteem needs (self-esteem, personal worth), and self-actualization needs (personal growth and fulfilling one\u2019s potential). While some of these basic needs might manifest differently with each individual, I would argue that these categories are very basic and could encompass many different specific needs and desires. Even beyond these five categories, it might be possible to define the human experience with need and desire as two distinct states of being:  the joy, satisfaction, or feeling of security in having one\u2019s needs met versus the pain, sorrow, frustration, or anxiety at either losing something that meets a need or not having a need met at all. I think that the understanding of these two states \u2013 the joy and the sorrow \u2013 is the basis of empathy, unclouded by prejudice, unclouded by personal belief, and unclouded by specific personal desires. Second, since any act of empathy must begin with the other person in mind, we must attempt to understand the other person with whom we are attempting to empathize \u2013 in other words, trying to find out what he/she wants or needs. This can be as simple as asking a question. Depending on the situation, the question might be, \u201cdo you need a hug?\u201d Or, \u201chow are you feeling?\u201d, Or even more basic, \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Beyond Theory of Mind Given what I believe that acts of empathy (at least expressed empathy) require, it would seem to me that Baron-Cohen has incorrectly expressed his idea of what Theory of Mind is. I believe that his \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d should actually read more like this: it is the ability of a person to determine the contents of one\u2019s own mind as well as the ability to correctly assume \u2013 using current beliefs, shared cultural artifacts, and basic cultural assumptions \u2013 what the contents of another person\u2019s mind would be. And according to this definition, this means that anyone \u2013 not just autistics \u2013 would be likely to have impaired Theory of Mind if they are blinded by prejudice, ignorance, incorrect cultural assumptions, and even a lack of respect for the other person. As documented above, empathy does not require that someone be skilled in this particular \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d and simply requires a desire to understand, put away personal prejudices, and reach out to the other is required. Judging from my own experiences, as well as the experiences of other autistics, I am certain that autistic people are capable of this kind of understanding and empathy. The prevailing definition of \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d be reexamined and considered. Its continued perpetuation will continue to be damaging to autistic people and unfortunately continue to promote the \u201clack of empathy\u201d myth which continues to plague the autistic community.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://womanwithaspergers.com/2011/07/25/the-empathy-question-revisited-theory-of-mind-culture-and-understanding/", "http://www.autismandempathy.com/", "http://womanwithaspergers.com/2010/05/09/a-few-words-about-empathy/", "http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2001_BC_normdevelopment.pdf", "http://ravenswingpoetry.com/", "http://newagemystic.com/raventotem.aspx", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2009/01/18/theory-of-whose-mind-towm/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.blogistan.co.uk/blog/mt.php/2011/06/29/simon-baron-cohen-autism-and-empathy", "http://www.blogistan.co.uk/blog/", "http://aspierhetor.com/2008/10/22/empathize-with-this/", "http://www.autismandempathy.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJm9_UaO-PQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRYplyv08Pg", "http://www.blogistan.co.uk/blog/mt.php/2011/06/29/simon-baron-cohen-autism-and-empathy", "http://asplanet.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=105&Itemid=150", "http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/hierarchyneeds.htm"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/showcase-womanwithaspergerss-empathy.html", "title": "\nShowcase: WOMANWITHASPERGERS's \"The Empathy Question, Revisited\"\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 23, 2011", "body": "\n I'm Not Ready  by  Lisa Quinones Fontanez It's no secret that our kids have trouble  transitioning .  And with 23 days left (but who's keeping track?) until the end of The Boy's final school year at his current placement, I'm trying to prepare him.   When I know there will be a change in our routine, I explain it to him using the words \"first\"  and \"then.\" First we'll go to the supermarket and then the park. Or, First school, then Sensory and then Home. I do this because he always needs to know what's coming next.  For the last few weeks, I've been telling The Boy, that soon he'll go to \"a different school.\"   The times that I've said this to him, he's replied, \"We're going to take the train to the school?\"  Sometimes it comes out as a statement, other times like a question.  And I wonder what school he's thinking of, since he's taken the train with me to interview at four schools.  But I know it's too complicated a question to ask.  And I don't want to him to say \"the school with the tree\" because that was my absolute dream school and we were rejected. This week, I've gotten two calls from  The Horizon Program  and while I'm looking forward to The Boy starting there.  I still have my doubts.  As I'm typing this, I feel my heart beating faster and I'm trying to breathe in and out slowly to calm my anxiety.  Still, my hands are shaking and my fingers tapping nervously on the keyboard.   Am I making the right decision?   I can't tell you how often I've asked myself this question.  How often I've been unable to sleep over it?  It's a foolish question, really.  Because I know I would question any new school - even the dream school. Because I'm not ready for him to go to kindergarten.  I'm not ready for him to grow up.  I'm not ready to let him go.  He's already lost his first tooth.  And has a second one ready to come out.  He's starting to push my hands away when I try to help him with things.  His favorite phrase of the moment is \"all by myself.\"  He wants to brush his teeth all by himself (even though he can't).  He says he wants to take the bus to grandma's house all by himself (even though he won't).  And says he wants to pour his juice all by himself - this he can do. Well, almost. The Boy is starting to show independence in self-help skills.  I know, that's great!  Especially since some are part of his  IEP goals .  And it makes me so proud to see how far he's come and every inch of progress makes me more hopeful for the future.  But can't he need me just a little bit longer?   Come September, The Boy may not have any trouble transitioning.  The Boy may get on that school bus on the first day of kindergarten without looking back.  Maybe all this anxiety is for nothing.  But if he does have difficulty transition, he'll have the proper support, and he'll adjust quickly.      But in the meantime, who is going to help me with these transitions?  Because I really wish there was someone to tell me what's coming next.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismwonderland.com/2011/07/im-not-ready.html", "http://www.blogger.com/profile/16264928687181454025", "http://www.autism-society.org/living-with-autism/lifespan/adulthood/transitions.html", "http://www.autismwonderland.com/2011/05/hope-is-on-horizon-part-1.html", "http://www.autismwonderland.com/2011/05/queen-of-what-ifs.html", "http://www.learningabledkids.com/IEP_training/IEP_goals_objectives_definition.htm"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/07/beat-back-to-school-jitters-im-not.html", "title": "\nBeat the Back-to-School Jitters: I'm Not Ready by Lisa Quinones Fontanez\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 6, 2011", "body": "\n Thanks to Kim from Stories Lead the Way for this post! Back To School Jitters - We All Have Them When August rolls around, everyone who is involved with the business of back to school gets the jitters. From school administration, to teachers, to parents and kids everyone gears up for the anticipation, worries and general excitement that a new year brings. Teachers ask themselves \"Will I be able to handle the challenges of meeting all the needs of all my students who walk through the door?\" Parents wonder \"Will the teacher be good? Will they adore my child? Will they be able to handle my child's abilities?\" Kids react differently. Some of them don't get too cooked up about back to school - it is just another day. While others need the right notebook, perfect outfit and all the accessories that they haul off to school in their backpacks.   For kids who are on the spectrum, there is so much more to think through when making a transition to a new classroom, with new kids, new teachers and new systems. This story is for parents who are facing these issues and hopefully will provide you with a few tips and tricks that will alleviate some of the jitters that you are feeling about dropping your sweet child off for another year of school. It's that time of the year when parents get the jitters about sending their child off to school.  As a parent, you can handle your child and do a good job with them, but they need so much more. School is where they really learn about the world. They learn from other adults, kids and rich curriculum. It is where they become who they are, just like any other kid. It's okay to be concerned or worried a bit. That is natural. All parents worry about how their child will do in school. Go easy and have great faith in the professionals that will be working with your child. If you are concerned about something or have questions about certain things, ask them. It is a teacher's job to work with you as well and it has never been easier to stay in contact with them.  Here is an assignment for you: 1. If your child is new to a school, contact the school before school starts. Communication is key and the staff at your child's school needs to know more about your child than what is written in their IEP. What do they like? What sets them off? What calms them down? Any trick that you use needs to be shared with the staff so that they can replicate what you do. It is a team effort and consistency is vital! Typically the resource/special education teacher would be the best place to start. Remember, the staff is back the week before school starts, so get on the phone or email right away if you haven't already. 2. If you are returning to the school, contact the resource/special education teacher. \nReturning to a school makes the transitioning a little easier because there is background that has been established and some of the staff will know what works best with your child. It will also be familiar for your child. Communication still is key. Let them know if there are any new behavioral concerns, improvements or new strategies that you are using. You can also let them know about any new medication or any updated health info. The more you share, the better. I cannot stress how important it is to have frank, open communication with the case manager of your child! If you want them to be frank and open, then get that ball rolling. 3.  If your child will be in a mainstream classroom for any part of the day, find out the name of the other teachers who will be working with them .\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0Some schools feel like new class lists are top secret, so there may be some hesitation about giving you that information. Let them know that you just want to establish contact and help with transitioning so that it is smoother for everyone. Call or email the teacher and open up the line of communication. Let them know all  your contact info, emails, and whether or not you text. (Believe it or not, much of my parent contact these days is via text - it is short sweet and to the point and many teachers are up on that technology). Be careful in regards to making demands. If your conversation is based more on the needs of your students versus mandates, then it goes over much more smoothly. Remember, the teachers have other students in their class and many other requirements that they have to fulfill at the start of the year. You are setting the stage for your relationship with that teacher for the upcoming year. Go easy. 4.  Arrange a time to visit the classroom before school starts.  Even if you don't get a chance to visit with the teacher, make sure your child is familiar with what the classroom looks like before day one. Bring a camera and take pictures of their desk, locker and just the general classroom so that you can refer back to those things later, if you need to. If there is time for your child to meet the teacher that is a bonus! This is a great time to put a face to a name and to ask any questions your child may have. Remember though, this visit is mainly for your child so that they can feel more comfortable about where their desk is, what their teacher and classroom looks like and how to open their locker. Keep this visit child centered. You will get a meeting and or conference at another time. A teacher's time is precious in the week leading up to school, so be respectful of that. 5.  If you have a resource teacher or special education teacher who writes social stories, this is the time to request that.  There are a million topics that can be addressed: The First Day of School, How To Greet My Classmates, My New Classroom, My New Teacher, to name just a few. When a child is new to our school, I send home a story about our school. It includes pictures and labels of key places and people in our school like: the cafeteria and the staff that runs it, the art room and teacher, the music room and teacher, etc. I also write a story about their new classroom teacher entitled 10 Fun Facts About Mrs./Mr. _____. (Think David Letterman's Top Ten Lists). This helps them find out some behind the scenes info about their new teacher.  In the next 2 weeks, I plan to feature sample stories on my website Storiesleadtheway.com - Check them out. The stories can give you some ideas or examples of other things that you may want to think through. 6.  Relax!!!!  Enjoy the last few dog days of summer with your precious child. Home is where your child can let loose and decompress. School is where they will gain the skills to function, communicate and learn in the world around them. It won't always be rosey and stress free, so keep in mind that there will be glitches! That's when interventions can be developed to help remedy and smooth out bumps in the road. As long as you and your child's teacher work together as a team, there will be progress and successes for your child. Take deep breaths! You will get through this! Enjoy! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.storiesleadtheway.com/2011/08/back-to-school-jitters-we-all-have-them.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MGvtICMP3Bw/TjnSLWqaLBI/AAAAAAAAAIY/CybouITa9xw/s1600/will+standing+by+waterfall.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/beat-back-to-school-jitters-kim-from.html", "title": "\nBeat the Back-to-School Jitters: Kim from Stories Lead the Way--Back To School Jitters - We All Have Them\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 3, 2011", "body": "\n From C.S. Wyatt: \n \n \n Thoughts on Back to School \n \n When I was young, I disliked summer because it wasn't as routine as the school year. I dislike school much of the time, too, but it was a (somewhat) predictable setting. Best of all, school meant books with facts and more information to learn. Since becoming a more active special education advocate, I've met many children and adults who love memorizing specific facts but don't (or didn't) enjoy their classroom experiences. How can you make back to school less stressful? What are some suggestions to ease the annual ritual? I begin each year with a tour of my campus. In college, I always arrived early and walked around the campus. I did this year after year, because I needed to ease myself into the campus routines. I even did this in high school, walking about the empty campus before it was crowded with unruly students. I've meandered about the campus where I am now a professor and will visit several more times before the first day of classes. It might help other students to explore campus, with a parent or guardian, before classes begin. I'd recommend this for students from elementary school to university graduate students. The familiar is less stressful. Next, I would contact any teachers or instructors available and willing to discuss the semester or year ahead. I would ask that parents do this for K12 students; some states and schools discourage direct correspondence with students. (It's actually illegal in at least one state to \"friend\" a student via social networks!) For university students, the best approach is to contact instructors with the assistance of the disability services office. In the K12 setting, families need to be thinking about revised Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) from the end of one school year to the beginning of the next. I recommend a list of what has been accomplished, which goals were not met / mastered, and which issues are immediate concerns for the student's success. Knowing which goals were not met can help a teacher plan for the coming year \u2014 and you should never think of these as \"failures.\" If a teacher doesn't anticipate both strengths and weaknesses, the teacher can't help the student stay on track. Food can be a struggle with any young student, and I'm picky about food as an adult. Allergies complicate this for some families, as well as any special diets. K12 districts and university dining services can provide sample menus. K12 districts are required to make accommodations for safety and reasonable health concerns. Higher education institutions do not make the same allowances, though most now offer vegetarian menus and other special dietary menus. Most colleges and universities have \"food courts\" similar to those in shopping malls. It might not be logical, but I insist on the same notebooks, mechanical pencils, and ink pens year after year. I do not like other brands and losing my favorite mechanical pencils causes anxiety. Maybe your student also has preferences for specific school supplies. Brands of crayons and pencils are not the same. Don't be surprised if a student insists on his or her favorites. Instructors should be tolerant of such preferences. Why does it matter if a student wants black ink instead of blue or likes college-ruled bright white notebooks? I use wall calendars and charts to help plan for school and throughout the school year. I need lots of charts, because I think visually. Having the plans for the year ahead on the wall weeks in advance is a good way to ease into the school year, too. I've been looking at the academic calendar for 2011-12 since June. Yes, that's obsessive, but I hate surprises. Knowing the future plans helps keep me relaxed. During the school year, I have printed calendars in every binder. I keep a single \"master calendar\" so I don't mixup dates or schedule two events for the same day. Calendars are essential to my functioning well. I never put the work related to two courses in one binder \u2014 I keep every topic separate, and the master calendar is in its own portfolio. The calendar I keep is printed from iCal on my home computer. Any time I change the calendar, I print the new version and replace the old in my master binder. Yes, that's a lot of work, but I need that planning. When I talk to parents and students, I hear a similar desire for order and routines. School seldom goes smoothly, so the single best thing a family can do is let the student in their lives know there is a place to find support. Knowing my parents were there for me, no matter how lousy the school day, was one of things that made it possible to succeed. Families of special needs children know that every single day at school is a step forward, but not an easy step. Preparing for school lasts from one year to the next. During the school year, you have to keep in contact with schools as much as possible. At the university level, your student will be on his or her own. Privacy laws that recognize adulthood can prevent a parent or guardian from working with instructors \u2014 unless the student files a written consent for the parent to be involved in disability services. Preparing for adulthood and self-advocacy has to begin during the K12 years. To be a self-advocate, students should be involved in IEP meetings and back-to-school planning. Family members and teachers need to listen to the student and help him or her develop a sense of control. It is important for students with special needs to be as active in their own futures as possible. Back-to-school means another year of changes. It should also be another year preparing for adulthood. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://theautisticme.blogspot.com/2011/08/thoughts-on-back-to-school.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/beat-back-to-school-jitters-cs-wyatts.html", "title": "\nBeat the Back-to-School Jitters: C.S.

{"date": "Sunday, August 7, 2011", "body": "\n  What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? My perspective. What is it like to have Asperger's? What is it like to be human? Don't you hate it when people answer a question with a question? Oops - did I just do it again?  Well - being in the autism spectrum is a different experience for everyone.  One might think that as a mom with Asperger's I would better relate to my child with Asperger's. Unfortunately that is not necessarily the case. I have a hard enough time trying to understand \"neuro-typical\" people, let alone someone whose neuro-pathways are just a little misaligned, but in a slightly different way than my own. Iraq is very much an individual, and very different from her mom. Then again, there are Aspie traits we both possess, making it easier for me to relate on some levels. Let me just start with \"Me\" and my view of the world, since that is what I understand best. Now, I'm not saying I fully understand myself, but who does? As a kid I had almost NO understanding of myself. Childhood  Socially: Like most kids, I tried to understand myself in relation to the world around me. The solid world - the objects that I could see, smell, hear, and touch - made sense. Other people were a different matter. My mother would tell you that I had \"lots\" of friends as a young child. That is true to some degree. Our neighborhood was filled with kids, and we all played together.    It was easy for me when we played games with rules, like kickball or kick the can. It was a little harder when it was time to pretend. My interests were different from those of the other girls. I didn't like dolls. I didn't like playing \"house.\" I felt no enjoyment in the fantasy world of developing emotional bonds and mimicking the social interactions of older girls or adults. A tea party? Really? I didn't like the taste of tea, and some sink water in an old toy teacup that only minutes before rested at the bottom of a dust-filled toy chest... gross! And then to be told by my peers that the point of the game was not the drinking of the tea, but of interacting like a bunch of stuffy \"grown-ups...\" And WHY are we acting like boring adults? I didn't see a purpose in pretending to be married, in pretending to have a baby, in pretending to clean a house. In the group of peers on my street, I truly wanted to fit in. I would do and say what I saw the other girls do and say, or I would pretend to be the family cat. That was easier. Cats meow. They rub up against people and they don't have to deal with the intricate social structures of \"grown-ups\" who talk about going to the ball, shopping, or tea parties. I think I spent most of my make-believe-with-peers time as a cat. It was better than being lonely, though I didn't hate playing by myself. By the time I was about 7, my peers started to notice the differences in me. This added to my challenges. I had a very hard time reading facial expressions or the tones of a voice (I still do today, but not to the extent I did as a child). Interestingly I saw that other people seemed to have this magical understanding of other people's feelings, so I mistakenly assumed (for much of my life) that people would understand how I felt and what I was thinking. I was baffled when others didn't act toward me the way I thought they should behave or treat me the way I thought they should treat me - after all, I always tried to act toward other people the way I thought they wanted me to. It wasn't uncommon for a peer to ask me, \"wouldn't you rather go play somewhere else?\" I guess most neuro-typical kids would understand this statement as a blow-off. (duh) Not me. I didn't really understand why someone would be concerned over my desire to play somewhere else. The way I figured it, if I wanted to play elsewhere, I would go elsewhere and they wouldn't need to ask (and I didn't understand why they felt the need to ask me - it was so weird to me). I would answer dubiously with \"No. I want to play here with you.\" I can still feel in the pit of my stomach the uncertainty and anxiety that I would feel when I saw the other children's eyes roll, and hear the barely-masked whispers. If older girls were involved (say ages 10-13) they would often just tell me, point-blank, to leave. \"Why?\" I'd ask. You can imagine the annoyance they felt with me then... and I had no idea. I just wanted to know why they didn't want to play with me. A lot of kids would get downright nasty at this point, and I would leave - still wondering what I did that the other kids didn't like. At age 40-something, I now understand that typically-developing kids know \"different\" when they see it, and it apparently makes them uncomfortable. I made other kids uncomfortable but I had no idea why or what to do about it. I craved to be around other kids and wanted desperately to fit in, but was clueless as to how to achieve these things. What did I like? Well, like many individuals with Asperger's, I had one BIG interest. Horses. Horses were on my mind 24/7/365. I wanted to know all there was to know about horses. I soaked up horse-related information like a sponge and would tell anyone who would listen (even if they didn't want to listen) all about horses, from conformation to dental issues as they related to a horse's bit. Every now and then one of my peers would express an interest in a horse game. Things would turn a bit sour when the girl stated she wanted to play the role of a pink and purple pony with sparkly feet. I would play NO such game! Horse's can't be pink or purple and they're called HOOVES, not FEET! Once again I would unwittingly morph into Mr. Spock from Star Trek... and what \"normal\" little girl wants to try to play make-believe with a Vulcan? At age 5 I met Mary M. - a little girl my age who was nearly as obsessed with horses as I was. Mary was my best friend for the next 4 years until her family moved to Connecticut. When we were together, we were horses. We made stalls to \"live\" in and would trot and canter about our yards, neighing. We would set up jumps and have horse shows. When I pretended to be a horse, I was a horse. I wanted to be a horse. I understood horses, and needless to say, often felt like a prey animal while with my human counterparts. Physically: As with most people with Asperger's, I have sensory issues. My senses act and react differently than those of neuro-typical people. For the most part I am hyper-sensitive. Clothes itched and irritated my skin. Tights were the worst, especially when the crotch would ride down between my thighs, and then the seam would rub me to tears. Avoiding negative sensory stimulation became more important than fitting in or behaving in a socially acceptable manner. While other little girls knew better than to fuss with undergarments in public, I hadto. Yup - I was that kid, over in a corner doing the butt-wiggle-dance, oblivious to the looks I was getting from everyone around me. That statement may sound weird to you if you don't have sensory issues. The best way I can describe it is that it's like getting stung by a bee in a public place. You don't just stand there trying to hide your discomfort - you swat at it, cry out and ask around for ice. The only difference is that your bee-sting explanation will seem far more acceptable to your peers than my tights pain explanation. Colors are more vivid - sometimes blinding. Light can be painful... and loud! (Yes - the buzz from fluorescent lights can be horribly distracting and annoying for me. Noises sometimes make me feel as if I have knives in my ears. (I have always loved fireworks, but I used to cry as I watched them as a child. The sight was beautiful to me, but it was accompanied by horrible pain. People would wonder at my tears, and I only felt more embarrassed and different knowing that somehow the dazzling spectacle wasn't hurting anyone but me.)  Crowds... crowds are positively dizzying to me to this day. My husband is pretty much the only reason I don't pass out or burst into tears at Disney World. Any one of these overwhelming sensations can cause me to become overstimulated.  Here again, think of that bee-sting. Becoming overstimulated can be like getting stung by an entire nest of bees. Overstimulation can cause anxiety, meltdowns, frustration, anger, a complete shut-down... any number of reactions as the brain's way to try to block out some or all of the sensation. I would try so hard to hide it. I usually internalized the deep stress and anxiety I was feeling. Sometimes I would focus my eyes on something very small like a bug or a chip in the paint. By focusing deeply I learned to block out some of the craziness I felt so submerged in. The stress of turning my frustration and pain inward caused me to have regular stomach and intestinal issues.  Honestly, the best thing to do for an overstimulated child is to find a dim, quiet place. Once the pain of overstimulation starts to subside, I was better able to rejoin a situation for limited times. At Christmas parties at grown-up's houses, I remember taking breaks in the bathroom or even sitting in a coat closet for a few minutes. Many children with Asperger's perform repetitive behaviors like spinning or hand-flapping. I sucked my thumb. While thumb-sucking is a fairly normal habit for small children, I sucked my thumb until I was 13 years old! Yes... really. Of course I never let anyone see me do it. I would also focus deeply on the sensation of rubbing the side of my forefinger across my top lip. This was subtle enough to make me look like I was thinking about something, yet provided enough of a stimulus to allow me to block out the rest of the world temporarily. I also think in pictures. If you've ever seen the Temple Grandin movie or read her books - yes... that's how I think. You say \"Do you have ants in your pants?,\" I see this:  You say \"Hop on over here,\" and I see an image of a rabbit in my head. You say you have a \"smashing headache,\" and I see a pretty gross image of a half-smashed head. Over the years I have learned what different expressions mean, but I still see those pictures. I think this is why I enjoy word-play and puns. I continuously think of each of the meanings of each word. I'm going to leave off for now (I worry I may have overstimulated my poor readers), and in the next few days (or the next time I get a chance) I'll post about my experiences in the \"tween\" and teen years.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "body": "\n What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? Adulthood So with my health issues I have been lax in posting the last part of my series on what it is like to have Asperger's. Sorry about that! Part 1:  What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? My perspective. Part 2:   What Is It Like To Have Asperger's?  The Tween and Teen Years.   Part 3:  What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? Adulthood    Something that happened in the last few days got my wheels turning on the subject again, and I now have the energy (if not the time) to post on this subject. I mentioned in my last post that I sometimes say things that are very out-of-place. Sure - people who don't have Asperger's sometimes do the same thing, but I theorize that the mechanics behind my slips and theirs are sometimes quite different. Let me use an example. *Identities have been modified to protect the unwittingly insulted. So I was talking with some friends the other day - a husband and wife couple with an adorable little girl. Husband is currently trying to stop smoking and daughter has a \"binki\" that she just isn't ready to give up. Mom is more than ready for both husband and daughter to give up their different habits. As we were talking, daughter piped up asking for her binki. This is when the muscles of my mouth entangled themselves in the cogs of my brain. Within a split-second the following thoughts processed through my noggin. Synapses flew at lightning speed relaying the thoughts: The act of sucking helps the neurons in a baby's brain make increasingly faster connections. Sucking a binki or thumb releases endorphins in the brain, resulting in a feeling of relaxation and pleasure.  The nicotine inhaled by smoking a cigarette causes a release of endorphins in the brain which can be highly addictive. I myself was both a long-time thumb-sucker and was once a smoker.  Quitting smoking (in my 30's) and ending my thumb-sucking habit (at age 12) were very similar experiences for me. Thumbs/binkis and cigarettes are both strong addictions. And amid the lights, the noise from the playing children and my own suppressed social anxiety, my mouth somehow involved itself in the thought process unbeknownst to me. The filter didn't make it anywhere near the lower section of my face before I blurted out \"Give her a cigarette!\" A millisecond after my mouth moved, I was mortified! I didn't mean or even think anything of the sort. It was a ridiculously  illogical step in the hypothesis running though my brain and had been kicked out of the flowchart forming itself somewhere in the gray matter inside my skull. Apparently it was kicked out so hard it flew right out the first opening it found. I tried to make it out to be a joke, muttering something about addiction and binkis... but WOW!  Even as an adult, social situations can be a challenge. This does not mean that I don't enjoy socializing. I love hanging out with friends... especially really understanding ones! But the challenge comes in when I try to coordinate my flying brain processes, my mouth and my body language simultaneously. Now that I'm in my 40's, it works most of the time. Sometimes (like my adventure above)... not so much, really. It's taken me years to learn to balance my sensory processing issues, frequent sensory overload, language, learned body language (or unspoken language) and other players in the team sport that is socialization. Any imbalance in the formula can tip me over - and see? I have learned to use figurative terms too :o) Here's another example. Parent-Teacher Conferences. I go to a room filled with seemingly thousands of educational wall decorations in vivid colors. The fluorescent overhead lights make the colors seem like they are glowing, and the buzz from the lights is impossible to block out. I seat myself in a chair meant for someone a quarter of my size, leaving me feeling physically disconcerted. Then I am expected to partake in an adult conversation and remember what the teacher tells me. So... some of my self-taught coping techniques include tunnel vision. If I look about the room and attempt to take in all the new visual stimuli, I won't be able to speak, so I aim my eyes just on the teacher and perhaps the table between us or the latest report card on that table so I can think about what the teacher is saying. OK, did you catch that? I \"aim my eyes.\" I don't focus them on anything. Because I am a visual thinker, I have to work extra hard to process audio information, so if the teacher is going to talk to me, and if I am going to absorb that information, I have to intentionally not focus on visual stimulation unless it directly pertains to what the teacher is saying. Otherwise there is too much stimulation coming in and I will go into \"shut-down mode\" until I can sort through all the incoming information. I know that must sound convoluted. Basically, my brain is oversensitive to information. Each of our senses gives us information - sight, smell, sound, touch, taste (and if you're the creepy kid in The Sixth Sense, extra-sensory perception... heeheehee). Anywhoo - like a mail room on steroids, the \"typical\" brain takes all this information in quickly and efficiently and sorts it into it's proper box for immediate or future use. Let's just say that the mail room workers in my brain would have been \"let go\" a long time ago if they were people and not neurons and synapses. If those workers are supposed to put one company memo in each box, mine will flood certain boxes with multiple memos while not putting the memo in other boxes at all. \"Did you get the memo?\" \"Boy, did I EVER!\" It's not a bad thing. It's just a bit different.  In fact, there can be benefits to such differences. I rarely forget any information I've read if I'm interested in it. Because I think about things differently than most people and have a brain full of semi-useless information that I can access at any given time, I can often come up with solutions to problems that most would never have thought of. (My \"solutions\" can sometimes seem a bit unusual to others, but they generally work.) I am a very \"out-of-the-box\" person in this sense. Over the years I've learned to rely on all that information to try to fit in with my peers. Like, where do you put your arms/hands while you're talking to someone? Well, different hand and arm positions express different messages to neuro-typical people. It's this funny thing called \"body language\" or \"non-verbal communication.\" This never came naturally to me, but I'm a wizard at observation. I have also learned from various studies what the  different arm positions mean . Where my arms are most comfortable while I'm standing may not be the message I mean to convey to people. I constantly have to think about it so I don't come across as defensive or aggressive when I'm feeling relaxed and casual. And how do I hide my oddities to seem \"normal?\" For instance, I find being cold physically painful. It's the kind of sensation I'll do anything to avoid and I worry that my peers may be driven to distraction when I give up style or social norms to wear a giant coat at a nice lunch. Or if there's a stray hair in my bra. I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst annoyances there is for me. Some little hair down in there tickling and poking me with every move I make. I have to excuse myself just to go on a hunt for the offending hair which is often hard to see in there unless I can get it in just the right light. This happens at least once a day in my world, but luckily rarely when I'm around friends since I don't work outside of the home. Well... that's all I can think of for now because my son is up and trying to talk about his latest video game adventures, and because I can't block out external sounds at all, I will leave this post here.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "body": "\n Request \u201cTen Things\u201d by Ellen Notbohm For Your Teachers \u00a0 \nWritten on AUGUST 9, 2011 by  SOCKIT MAMA Our Copies of Ellen Notbohm's Books My son is about to enter mainstream third grade. If I said I wasn\u2019t nervous about the challenges ahead of him, I\u2019d be lying. I\u2019ve seen some of the state standards they\u2019ll be learning and I know that the attention-span and sensory-regulation required to follow-through with the curriculum requires a greater level of maturity than in second grade. Reading skills will require greater cognition and math will require more analysis. Third grade is going to be tougher for all the kids, but particularly for those on the autism spectrum. I\u2019ve done my part, as a parent, in preparing my son for third grade. In between the travel and extra-curricular activities, he\u2019s had tutoring this summer in math and language-arts so he can hit the ground running. But, when school starts, I\u2019m also relying on his teachers and support staff to step up to the plate and do their parts in helping him succeed. One of the things that I recommend to my son\u2019s teachers at the beginning of the school year is that they read books on autism; particularly books that explain how those with autism think, react and feel. However, I\u2019ve noticed that many parents have a hard time making this type of request. I\u2019ll never forget the first time I told another autism mom that I recommended to my son\u2019s IEP team that his teacher and aide read Temple Grandin\u2019s, \u201cThe Way I See It.\u201d She didn\u2019t believe me. So, I pulled out the written IEP and showed her. She asked me how I could do such a thing, that that\u2019s an insult to them because they\u2019re the professionals. And, teachers are too busy. She truly felt I had crossed my boundaries and went on to say that they probably were offended. Well, they probably were. But, you know what? Tough shi$! Frankly, my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn. Excuse my O\u2019Hara, but I\u2019m raising a Black boy in the United States of America with a disability (a double whammy!) and the stats on him even graduating from high school are not good. So when it comes to his education, I need to do everything possible to help my son achieve. I\u2019m out there advocating every year for my son\u2019s right to a good education and I don\u2019t care about people getting offended or having egos so big that they\u2019re not receptive to a recommendation from a parent. Now, I understand that teachers are busy. With budget cuts and class-size increases, their jobs are hard. We can all appreciate that. But, I\u2019m not asking them to read War and Peace or Remembrance of Things Past. Most autism books are reader-friendly and my request is due to all the times I\u2019ve had to explain my son\u2019s behaviors and motivations to teachers and \u201cprofessionals\u201d\u2026 people who are supposed to know better. We take it for granted that these people know everything about autism; but the fact of the matter is, they don\u2019t. They\u2019re learning the same way we are. And, every child on the spectrum is different. So they need to learn how to help my child and your child, individually. Parents should never be intimidated to ask those teaching their children to read books or materials they feel can help; especially if they do it respectfully. Yes, teachers are in authority positions and we look up to them, but it\u2019s not about them \u2013 it\u2019s about our kids. If you know that information within a book can give an educator guidance on how to handle a situation with your child, please request that they acquire that resource or provide it for them. If they\u2019re not receptive to it, then it\u2019s time to call an IEP (Individualized Educational Program) Meeting. You need to put the issue on the table for discussion because nobody \u2013 I mean nobody \u2013 should object to any reasonable resource that is easily obtainable and will help your child get from A to Z. Two books that I have often given to those teaching my son are,  Ten Things Every Child With Autism Wishes You Knew  and  Ten Things Your Student With Autism Wishes You Knew  by author, Ellen Notbohm. She is an autism mom herself and writes in a style that\u2019s very clear and easy to understand. These books that began as articles are written from the perspective of someone with autism and have been widely received. I have gotten a great deal out of them and two of her \u201c10 Things\u201d that have become like meditations for me when dealing with my son are: #3 \u2013 \u201cPlease remember to distinguish between won\u2019t (I choose not to) and can\u2019t (I am not able to).\u201d From  Ten Things Every Child With Autism Wishes You Knew . #10 \u2013 \u201cBehavior is communication: yours, mine and ours.\u201d  From Ten Things Every Student With Autism Wishes You Knew . Most of us autism parents have already read these books and appreciate them. But, how many of us have actually requested that our teachers read them? Now that a new school year is upon us, I will be requesting that my son\u2019s new teacher reads these books. And, I\u2019m not doing that to cross boundaries or appear pushy; I am doing it to help my child. Again, this is about my son. This is about my son\u2019s future. This is about him getting the best education he can in order to make it in this world. Ten Things Every Child With Autism Wishes You Knew \u00a0and  Ten Things Your Student With Autism Wishes You Knew \u00a0can be purchased at  Future Horizons . I\u2019m not perfect. For corrections, please email me.

{"date": "Monday, August 8, 2011", "body": "\n What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? The Tween andTeen Years >:p  This is Part II of my series on life as an Aspie. Part 1:  What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? My perspective. Part 2:   What Is It Like To Have Asperger's?  The Tween and Teen Years.   Part 3:  What Is It Like To Have Asperger's? Adulthood     You know? It's not the easiest thing for me to remember and write about my \"tween\" and teen years. It's not that I have Alzheimer's or anything, but so many of the memories are unpleasant... like getting-bitten-by-a-shark unpleasant. If I hadn't had access to horses, I can't even imagine how life might have been. Let me start with puberty. Personally, I welcomed puberty like I would have welcomed the plague. I had known the \"facts of life\" for a few years by age 10, but rebelled by dressing and wearing my hair like a boy. I'm not sure if I believed that pretending to be a boy would somehow prevent my perceived downward spiral into full-fledged womanhood, but to my dismay  I was in 6th grade when I got \"it.\" While I've heard stories about other girls celebrating the arrival of womanhood, I wanted to pretend it hadn't happened. Because I tend to be very hypersensitive to physical stimulation, I was able to feel... \"it.\" For me it was like wearing undergarments made of live, wiggling earthworms. I don't like the sensation of anything wet anywhere on my body, least of all...   I truly found the entire situation completely unbearable, but knew there was nothing I could do about it. It was hard to concentrate at school, to visit a museum with family, to walk, to ride horses, to live when \"it\" was present. When I had \"it,\" I constantly thought about it. I didn't adjust to it over the next years, either. In my 40's, I have finally come to terms with it... and the laughable irony that I am currently going through peri-menopause has not escaped me in the least. Socially the other girls were progressing as girls through the 6th, 7th and 8th grade are supposed to, yet I seemed trapped in a fantasy world of childhood somehow. Tweenage girls are not nice creatures, and just when I thought I was getting the hang of social structures, my understanding of other humans seemed to be pile-driven into the dirt as my peers went through the catty rituals of puberty. I had a few close friends who stuck by me. They told me I was \"weird... but in a good way.\" I was just happy they would still talk to me! Other girls... I just didn't \"get\" them. I couldn't pick out the hidden meanings of tone or voice inflection. I knew that in tweenage terms, \"Nice sweater!\" could mean either \"I like your sweater,\" or \"OMG - did you find that in some nerd's time capsule from the '60's?\" As a result of my confusion, my responses to people's comments were often very inappropriate. I tried to copy the tones and inflections of other people's speech only to find further confusion when adults were offended in being addressed too informally or without respect, or when peers took offense to my intended compliments. To this day I find I still sometimes inadvertently offend others. I generally think out everything I am going to say prior to saying it - including the volume, tone, inflection and word-choices... every time. Do you have any idea how tiring that gets in a fast-paced social situation? Is it any wonder I don't belong to the PTA? I still sometimes misjudge how others will perceive my statements... and then I have to go through the acrobatics of trying to smooth ruffled feathers. Anywhoo - back to junior high school. As a result of my lack of social skills and understanding, I was often taken advantage of. I was teased and I was bullied. I had my few friends, but I was fearful of making new friends because I knew I wasn't very good at it. I was horribly anxious and also very depressed. Like many Aspies I was gifted - my strengths are writing and art. Writing... probably because I spent every free moment analyzing language and trying to figure out the magical equation for fitting in with my 7th grade peers, and art because when every word has a concrete picture associated with it, one finds they have a lot of excess and random pictures floating around in their heads that occasionally need to be taken out for a walk across a blank sheet of paper. One of my favorite poems from that year of hell is: Little horse of the golden glade, All except my life is paid, And now because that is done, Across the fields of green we'll run. We will run forever more, Until we reach the golden door, And when we reach that door - and through, Only then life starts anew. What? Doesn't every 13-year-old write death poetry? Unfortunately, death just seemed easier than dealing with my quickly-wilting social life. It didn't get better when my family moved to a different state and I found myself in a new school with new kids... to my defense, I did make a friend. She rode horses too and apparently never bathed. Then I moved to a smaller school in hopes that fewer kids would mean that there were fewer kids to shun me. I did have a few friends through high school, but my social issues persisted. Since I lived my teenage life trying to be someone else, I'm sure other girls found it more than a little creepy when I was trying to be them. It wasn't that I wanted to be them per say, but from my analytical point of view I could see who the popular girls were. I figured that if I could act how they acted and say the kinds of things they said in the way they said it, that I would seem less socially undesirable. It didn't work, and I became even more depressed, unable to figure out what was wrong with me and why I was so different. I involved myself with an area college theater group (who embraced me and my eccentricities completely) and with horses. While other teens tested their boundaries with alcohol or what-not, I hung out with a 60-something theater director with the energy of a 12-year-old and the attention span of a goldfish. One of my fellow-actors was a wonderful bisexual black man and the others were just wonderfully accepting of other people's differences. Acting came second-nature to me as I had been pretending to be other people for at least 15 years by that time. I also developed a deep love for stories of the middle-ages or of fantasy worlds. I devoured the Narnia series, the Lord of the Rings and anything written in Olde English with a mad passion, and would receive some very unusual looks when I would speak or write fluently in Olde English. Apparently that talent won't win you acceptance and respect in the high school lunch room. Who knew? Looking back, I know now why other girls rolled their eyes... but it seemed like such a good idea at the time! I hate to say I was a show-off, but I was. I was grasping at straws - trying to find something that the other girls would admire in me. I admired them for just being able to socialize and I wanted very much to be seen as talented and therefore (in my mind) as acceptable. I was memorialized in the yearbook my senior year as being \"Most likely to write a screenplay called 'My Life At The Barn'.\"  Mission accomplished, no? So, while I rode out the storm of depression, anxiety, social ineptitude and a stoically analytical view of the world around me, I did survive. If I had known then what I know now? Who knows? Perhaps I would have had 2 friends through those years! At any rate, college was much better for me both educationally and socially - but that is for a different post.

Famous person with Asperger's Syndrome profile time!!! \"Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.\" --- Curie 7 November 1867 \u2013 4 July 1934 Marie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (Physics), which she won in 1903 with her husband, Pierre. 8 years later, she was the sole winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, becoming the first person honoured with two Nobel Prizes. Her work contributed to the theory of radioactivity and she discovered two elements \u2013 polonium and radium. Here is a brief video of  Marie . Asperger's Syndrome Marie was able to read at the age of 4 and her memory was exemplary. She was described as fixated and obsessed. Her concentration was so strong that it was difficult to break her attention and was she deeply concerned with the details of her work. She once quoted to her brother, \"One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.\" Her desire for knowledge was so great as she wanted to understand more in order to reduce fear of the unknown. \"I was entirely absorbed in the joy of learning and understanding.\" Marie's sense of clothing was not socially fashionable and preferred her clothes to be dark so she could wear them in the laboratory. She was socially awkward and had difficulty in emotional reciprocity. She was perceived as having no sense of humour and took everything very seriously. Her capacity to integrate herself socially was limited and her friends mainly consisted of scientific workers. Since her passion for learning was so great, her need for social interaction was minimal. Radium treatment was the fastest growing medical treatment in the early 1900s and highly marketable. She choose to continue living in poverty rather than benefiting from royalties. Marie felt that that it would be contrary to the scientific spirit. Her sense of right versus wrong was very strong and she rarely lied.  Her forceful character led her to a level of independence unusual for her time. During this period, gifted women were scorned and looked down upon. She was more curious about ideas than people, which was considered highly unusual since women were expected to be nurturing, social beings.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aslaspergirl.blogspot.com/2011/08/marie-skodowska-curie.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WoYiGvhtL9E/TjyRVyy5G9I/AAAAAAAAAA4/oIuWS_6HnWg/s1600/Marie+Curie.jpg", "http://www.myspace.com/video/vid/8540846"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/showcase-aslaspergirls-marie-skodowska.html", "title": "\nShowcase: aslaspergirl's \"Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie\"\n"},

My comments are not intended to be an endorsement nor a criticism nor are they representative of the Apollo Group, its directors, officers or subsidiaries. \n \n \n \nAs an adult Spectrumite facing employment issues you may be tempted to go back to school in order to add a skill or certification that will stand out to an employer. This can be good or bad depending on how you proceed. Additionally, going back into the classroom after an extended absence poses challenges for anyone (NT or ASD) which you will need to be aware of. If you are simply going back to school for fun this article is not for you. I fully encourage and support you in the pursuit of education for pleasure but cannot write about it and save space for the main thrust of this article. \n \nBefore you head back there are a couple of things you need to do. The first is deciding what you are going back for and be clear about your decision. Keep in mind this is a purely economic decision; you should choose to study something that you can tolerate and make money at; anything else will be squandering resources. Research the positions available for what you will be studying to see what sort of\u00a0 local \u00a0market is available (or in an area you can easily move to). I once had someone try to talk me into getting my Financial Risk Manager certification and he showed me several high paying jobs for that\u2026 all in New York. Not the easiest of moves for sure. Check out employment trends, look in the want ads and job boards, check out\u00a0 salary.com \u00a0and even see if you can find someone already doing that in your local area to see what they think. Additionally check out some of the open source university materials such as MIT\u2019s Open Courseware at\u00a0 http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm . Here you will find materials that can guide you in your exploration seeing what is truly college level work without having to make a trip to Massachusetts and paying their tuition. \n \n \n \nThe second task is figuring out how much it will cost and how you will pay for it. $1,000 for a certification that will get you a job in six months is not bad at all. $120,000 for a degree that takes 2+ years is a lot worse. Without a doubt the flagship premier go-to authority for Financial Information in the United States is the Federal Student Aid bureau ( http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ ) and you should start there and visit often. The can talk about Grants and Loans available as well as provide links to other resources. If you decide to take out loans keep in mind that you will pay a lot more in the long run and for a much longer period of time. Not a deal breaker but certainly something to consider. And if you are currently employed checkout what your employer offers for educational assistance\u2014and read the fine print. \n \nAs for the school itself there are the traditional in the classroom forms and on-line schools. Each offers their own advantages. Classroom based education offers immediate interaction with the instructor and cohorts while on-line schooling offers a respite from going out and interacting with the general public while still getting an education. The flexible time for assignments and postings can fit well with other work or chaotic sleep patterns. During my own Master\u2019s work there were several classmates deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan who brought their perspectives to class while working at times I was not awake. \n \n \n \nWhile many ASD folk may choose the on-line route there may be some brave enough to go back into the lecture hall. For anyone doing that I offer the following suggestions: \n \u00a0 \n Meet the instructor beforehand to gain a familiar face in the room \n Check out the classroom ahead of time to get a feel for where you might be most comfortable sitting (I did this long before my diagnosis) \n \u00a0 See if anyone you know is going to the same school/class to, again, provide a familiar face \n \u00a0 Be prepared that others will be similar to you; i.e. re-entering the classroom after a long absence \n \u00a0 Think of this in economic terms; you are paying for it, you should get the most out of it \n Capitalize on any \u2018non-traditional\u2019 student resources available; the University I went to for my Bachelors had a wonderful department that included counseling and advocacy \n Interact with your classmates! I know it may be difficult but knowing their names\u2014write them down, take a picture with your phone\u2014and keeping track of them via LinkedIn or Facebook will provide a network for you to reach out to when the job search comes along \n In class practice calming exercises even if it distracts from the lecture at hand; you will get more out of future lectures that way and prime yourself for better experiences \n \n \nAs a final word I suggest that you check out the Wrong Planet forums for education before, during and after your return to school. This support network will help you get the most from your education. \n \n \n \nGood luck and good learning! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://asdjobsink.blogspot.com/", "http://salary.com/", "http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm", "http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/scott-sheas-how-do-you-return-to-school.html", "title": "\nScott Shea's \"How do you return to school after a long absence?

As an adult, our forty-nine year old son Ben, has \u201cmellowed\u201d and reaches out to life in ways we never dared to dream he would or could, back when he was a child\u2026he was so troubled then. He was diagnosed at age four, and was fortunate enough to attend a regular pre-school and kindergarten that had many teachers\u2019 aides. Although he showed signs of high intelligence, he did not relate to the other children or activities as hoped and needed, so was not able to move on in a regular school setting. From age seven to thirteen, he went to The Bost School for Limited Children in Ft. Smith, AR. He made some progress in almost all areas while there, but at puberty his periodic upsets became more than we could physically handle, and it was necessary to find him a \u201chome away from home!\u201d That was absolutely the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life, but God turned it to Ben\u2019s good\u2026and to ours. Ben helping with the trimming of the shrubs. He was just home for a week-long visit, and did so well. His visits have always been about every three months, for a week to ten days at a time, and he has remained a vital part of our family all through the years. When Ben was small, my husband said to me, \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll be your comfort in your old age!\u201d At the time, I thought that to be ludicrous, as the future looked so bleak. It turned out that \u201cprophecy\u201d was right and true though. Now, Ben enjoys his visits at home with us, but has a job and routine provided where he lives that is good for him, and that he is used to. He is able to go everywhere with us\u2026to church and choir practice, to the mall, or to visit family. He is also a BIG help, whether washing the car, emptying the dishwasher, running the sweeper, or helping to grocery shop. His presence IS truly comforting! His behavior is exemplary 99 and 9/10 percent of the time, but it is that other tiny fraction of a percent that keeps him needing help and supervision on a full-time basis (along with not being able to fully understand the \u201cnuances\u201d of life). Although he can talk (say words), frustration can \u201ckick in\u201d for him since he is not able to completely put his wants or needs into words, or converse \u2026and then it\u2019s \u201cKaty bar the door!\u201d That in particular, is what we still can not handle at home. All in all though, he is a fine, brave man who has done very well with the lot he has been given in life, and we are\u00a0VERY proud of him! Ben rolling his cars and watching the wheels go around. At first I questioned God about Ben\u2019s condition, and got downright angry with Him. How could he allow such a thing to happen to an innocent little child? My turmoil built until I was on the verge of a breakdown. (See Christian Testimony Concerning Autism.) It was so hard to observe my little son \u201cslipping away\u201d at the age of two and one-half. It was like watching him die right before my very eyes\u2026yet being helpless to stop the onslaught. One minute, he was talking and learning, and the next he was regressing; repeating only what was said to him in a \u201cparrot-like\u201d fashion. One minute, he was playing and relating, and the next, he was rolling his little cars back and forth, watching only the wheels go around; oblivious to us and all his surroundings. Ben at age 48 Doctors were unfamiliar with even the term \u201cautism\u201d back in 1966, and we ourselves (having never heard of it) delved through many books, trying to understand in even the slightest way what was happening in our lives. Through it all, I came to the place where I turned to the Lord and gave Ben and his malady over to Him. Since that time, God has been my Rock and Fortress through the storm. He has brought positive things about for Ben that NO ONE else could have managed. My heart goes out to all whose children have recently been diagnosed as autistic. There is no more \u201cbaffling\u201d condition. I have written MUCH throughout the years that I am glad to share. After all this time, one thing I now know for certain\u2026Ben may have problems mentally, emotionally, perceptually, and relationally, but SPIRITUALLY\u2026he is whole and healed (See \u201cChild\u2019s Spiritual Potential\u201d). He loves to hear about Jesus, and in the whole scope of life\u2026Spiritual healing really is the most important issue! PS\u2013Please read the\u00a0other postings listed above (or scroll down): \u201dSymptoms of Autism: As a Child, and Improvements as an Adult,\u201d and \u201cThe D\u2019s & C\u2019s of Autism,\u201d plus another general post (Archives)\u00a0about \u201cHow Parents Feel\u201d (or how I felt), and \u201cThe Child\u2019s Spiritual Potential).\u00a0I think they will be encouraging to those going through all that right now. If you can not cover it all at this time, please come back again. I hope and pray that it blesses you! CNS Carole Norman Scott I am a wife of fifty-three years, mother of three and grandmother of two (all pictured below). I enjoy writing, singing, and photography, and am also a speaker for Stonecroft Ministries. There, I share how trusting Christ has helped me in dealing with autism all these years. That story is listed in the right-hand column of this page (\u201cMy Christian Testimony Concerning Autism\u201d). I have also spoken at a teacher\u2019s retreat for \u201cThe Little Lighthouse\u201d\u2026a school for handicapped children in Tulsa, OK. I told about Ben\u2019s life and times, which involved a first-hand glimpse into autism and all that it entails. I feel my \u201ccalling\u201d has been to be available to those in need\u2026whether it be our autistic son, other family members, or friends. I am also a fourteen year Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma cancer survivor (which could be \u201canother\u201d blog). The Scott Family on our 50th Anniversary (L to R) Jay, Ben, Carole, granddaughter Kelly, daughter, Maureen, granddaughter Shannon & son John I would also like to mention the Honeysuckle vine in my header photo. In my \u201ccarefree\u201d childhood (or so it now seems), I could smell the honeysuckle outside my open bedroom window wafting its sweet fragrance through the still summer night. The photo serves to remind me of who I once was, and still am deep down inside\u2026BEFORE autism\u2026when I so easily felt the innocence of hope and trust in the future. Never, never lose who you were/are APART from autism\u2026no matter what obstacles appear in your pre sent-day journey! Keep that same hope and faith STRONG today! You are STILL that same YOU! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism45.wordpress.com/", "http://autism45.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_3327.jpg", "http://autism45.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/79810013.jpg", "http://autism45.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/73570023.jpg", "http://autism45.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_0010.jpg", "http://autism45.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/798100243.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/showcase-carole-norman-scott-from.html", "title": "\nShowcase-Carole Norman Scott from autism45\n"},

ASF is inviting applications for Pre- and Postdoctoral Training Awards from graduate students, medical students and postdoctoral fellows interested in pursuing careers in basic and clinical research relevant to autism spectrum disorders. In the past two years, ASF has funded over $400,000 in pre and postdoctoral grants. \n \n\"This is one of our most important funding mechanisms\" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. \"The pre- and postdoctoral fellowships not only build our knowledge about what causes autism and how best to treat it, but also build our future by encouraging outstanding young investigators to dedicate their careers to autism research.\" \n \n\"Outstanding research is the greatest gift we can offer our families\" said Karen London, ASF co-founder. \"We are so grateful to all our donors and volunteers who have come together to support autism research and who make these grants possible.\" \n \nThe proposed training must be scientifically linked to autism. Autism Science Foundation will consider for training purposes all areas of related basic and clinical research including but not limited to: human behavior across the lifespan (language, learning, communication, social function, epilepsy, sleep, repetitive disorders), neurobiology (anatomy, development, neuro-imaging), pharmacology, neuropathology, human genetics/genomics, immunology, molecular and cellular mechanisms, studies employing model organisms and systems, and studies of treatment and service delivery. Applications must be received by November 18, 2011. \n \nAdditional information about the RFA can be found at www.autismsciencefoundation.org/ApplyForaGrant.html \n \nThe Autism Science Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity.

But science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation for life. In so far as it goes, it is based on fact, experience and experiment.\" --- Franklin 25 July 1920 \u2013 16 April 1958 The more I read about her, the more fire ignited within me to bring recognition to Rosalind Franklin's significant contribution to the helical structure of DNA. Unfortunately, she passed away before the Noble Prize could be awarded to her. James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1962, four years after Franklin died. Her work on the DNA structure led to greater understanding of how genetic information is passed on from parents to children. I struggled to find a video of Rosalind, so decided to include  this  instead. Asperger's Syndrome When Rosalind was 15 years old, she had chosen science as her vocation and wanted to attend college. Her father strongly opposed it as he wanted her to get into social work. He was concerned that she was choosing a career over marriage and family life. She and her father debated about this for years before he finally accepted that she wanted to be a scientist. Rosalind had a habit of intensely looking people in the eye while being concise, impatient and directly confrontational. James Watson stated that Rosalind found it very hard to make new acquaintances and was very bad at absorbing social cues. Small talk was awkward for her and she did not willing accept criticism. She did not know how to deal with other people and found it difficult to ask for help. Her relationships with colleagues were strained due to her difficulty in collaborating. She was extremely protective of her research on DNA and refused to share ideas. In the summer of 1956, Rosalind first began to suspect a health problem. An operation in September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen. She chose not to stay with her parents due to her mother's uncontrollable grief and crying upsetting her too much. Her scientific work continued while she underwent cancer treatment. At the age of 37, Rosalind passed away and J. D. Bernal's words about her death were \"Her early death is a great loss to science.\" Posted in:  Famous people with Asperger's \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aslaspergirl.blogspot.com/2011/08/rosalind-elsie-franklin.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_3Nslilfk3U/TkYCADzMaOI/AAAAAAAAAA8/WqBvvpzGFCc/s1600/Rosalind+Franklin.jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/rosalind-franklin-legacy.html", "http://aslaspergirl.blogspot.com/search/label/Famous%20people%20with%20Asperger%27s"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/showcase-aslaspergirls-rosalind-elsie.html", "title": "\nShowcase: aslaspergirl's Rosalind Elsie Franklin\n"},

Although many kids may encounter anxiety over the start of school, it would make sense that a higher number of special needs children face this at an increased level. \n Many special needs kids need to experience something many, many times before they can build a comfort level. Your child may be entering 8th grade, but all that means is that they have only started a new school year about eight times. This is hardly enough time for many of our kids to acquire a comfort level. \n Also, the last time our kids went through a first day of school was probably about 365 days ago. Enough time has elapsed to have erased this experience from their memory. \n So what exactly are our kids worrying about and how can we help alleviate some of their concerns? \n \n New Grade. \u00a0It doesn't have to be a new school to bring on anxiety. Just a new grade is enough to set off the alarm bells. Kids worry about who will be in their class, will they like their new teacher, and how will things work in general. The best thing to do is to talk with your child. Let your child express his concerns and confirm for him that other kids are feeling similar things. \n Academic Difficulties. \u00a0Kids who struggle academically will obviously worry about whether or not they will be able to handle the new demands. Last year probably seemed hard enough. How can they possibly do more? Reassure your child that she will learn things one step at a time. You are there to help and she will also have the support of her teacher. \n Friends. \u00a0Friendships are difficult for many special needs kids. Some of them take all school year to find a place to fit and then they have to start all over again in the new school year. Provide your child with the guidance she needs to work on her social skills.\u00a0 S-O-S Step by Step \u00a0( http://sos-research-blog.com/ s-o-s-step-by-step/ ) offers over 100 free resources on social skills that will help you do this. \n Growing Up . As our kids get older, they know that life is becoming more complex. Starting a new grade may symbolize that they are growing up and that there will be increased demands. Set some goals for your child. Point at the advantages to being in a new grade, along with the new expectations. Pick a couple of new things that you and your child can work on to move her towards increased responsibility and acknowledging that she is getting older. \n \n As your child gets into her new school year, her anxiety should decrease as she adjusts to the new expectations. If her level of anxiety persists, talk with her teacher and the school psychologist or counselor. Continue to talk with your child and stay on top of her feelings. The more positive things she accomplishes, the more her anxiety will subside. \n \n Bio :\u00a0 Danette Schott, M.A. , is founder of\u00a0 S-O-S Research \u00a0( http://sos-research.com/ ), a small research company providing information on \"invisible\" special needs for parents, teachers, and other professionals, and the editor of\u00a0 Help!

{"date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2011", "body": "\n The Significance of Semantics: Person-First Language: Why It Matters by Lydia At the Adult Services Subcommittee's final meeting last Wednesday, much to do was made about semantic disagreements -- \"ASD individual\" versus \"individual with ASD,\" and of course, the dreaded \"person with autism\" or \"person who has autism\" versus \"autistic person.\" These issues of semantics are hot button issues, and rightfully so. Words and language are powerful tools by which an individual can express ideas, whether abstract, actionable, or concrete. As a writer and editor, I know firsthand that language and the meanings we attach to words very much impact, influence, develop, and change the attitudes that we have toward the subjects of discussion. That is why people are easily insulted or upset by word choices. Changing a phrase -- even if it holds the same literal meaning -- alters the subtle connotations and nuances of the speech, and communicates a different meaning and context than the original phrasing. In the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer terminology such as \"Autistic,\" \"Autistic person,\" or \"Autistic individual\" because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual's identity -- the same way one refers to \"Muslims,\" \"African-Americans,\" \"Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender/Queer,\" \"Chinese,\" \"gifted,\" \"athletic,\" or \"Jewish.\" On the other hand, many parents of Autistic people and professionals who work with Autistic people prefer terminology such as \"person with autism,\" \"people with autism,\" or \"individual with ASD\" because they do not consider autism to be part of an individual's identity and do not want their children to be identified or referred to as \"Autistic.\" They want \"person-first language,\" that puts \"person\" before any identifier such as \"autism,\" in order to emphasize the humanity of their children. Yet, while I have been familiar with this rift among the autism community over the use of \"person with autism\" as opposed to \"Autistic person,\" I hadn't fully explored the diversity of perspectives on the topic until now. During last Wednesday's meeting, one subcommittee member, who I believe is the parent of an Autistic child, and an Autistic self-advocate expressed disagreement over the terms. Feedback from one of our members suggested changing \"ASD individual\" in our report to \"individual with ASD.\" The Autistic self-advocate sitting beside me, who also has an Autistic brother, voiced her objection to use of the term. \"I disagree,\" she said as the suggestion was read aloud. \"I'm not a person with autism; I am Autistic.\" Immediately, a mother sitting next to her responded, \"I come from a time where that word, 'autistic,' had -- still has -- a negative meaning. It's offensive. When someone refers to my son as 'the autistic,' I cringe at that word; I get ready to defend him.\" After our meeting, I took the time to explore a wealth of opinions online about the use of person-first language -- from those who support it and those who oppose it. The theory behind person-first language is that it puts the person before the disability or the condition, and emphasizes the value and worth of the individual by recognizing them as a person instead of a condition. And that's a great idea. In fact, when discussing specific people, I have never once heard anyone -- self-advocate, parent, teacher, or otherwise -- refer to a person as anything except by his or her name. I can't think of any teacher -- at least any decent one -- who would refer to a student as \"that Autistic kid,\" or \"that kid with autism.\" And I certainly can't think of any parent who wouldn't refer to his or her child by name. But why are we self-advocates so opposed to this terminology? Aren't we all about de-emphasizing and correcting inaccurate, misleading, and harmful stereotypes and attitudes? Right? From that other perspective, you would think we would support the use of person-first language, because we want to be seen as people with equal rights, value, and worth to non-Autistic people. But we don't. Because when people say \"person with autism,\" it does have an attitudinal nuance. It suggests that the person can beseparated from autism, which simply isn't true. It is impossible to separate a person from autism, just as it is impossible to separate a person from the color of his or her skin. One argument I encountered in one of the more cogently-written papers in favor of person-first language expostulates that because cancer patients are referred to as \"people with cancer\" or \"people who have cancer,\" as opposed to \"cancerous people,\" the same principle should be used with autism. There are some fundamental flaws with this analogy, however. Cancer is a disease that ultimately kills if not treated or put into long-term remission. There is absolutely nothing positive, edifying, or meaningful about cancer. Cancer is not a part of a person's identity or the way in which an individual experiences and understands the world around him or her. It is not all-pervasive. Autism, however, is not a disease. It is a neurological, developmental condition; it is considered a disorder, and it is disabling in many and varied ways. It is lifelong. It does not harm or kill of its own accord. It is an edifying and meaningful component of a person's identity, and it defines the ways in which an individual experiences and understands the world around him or her. It is all-pervasive. What I found most interesting in reading this selection of articles and blog posts is that many of the samearguments are used for both positions, but with separate sides, naturally, coming to very divergent and contradictory conclusions. Firstly, I saw in at least two articles in favor of using \"person with autism\" that the authors strongly oppose language referring to disabilities like \"suffers from,\" (i.e. \"Alan suffers from Asperger's syndrome;\" \"Joey, an autism sufferer;\" etc.) which has traditionally been a talking point of self-advocates as well. I do understand that not everyone who supports the use of terminology \"person with autism\" would disagree with language like \"suffers from,\" but it is still interesting that there are those who do. It suggests a fundamental shared value -- that people with different neurological conditions are not \"suffering\" because of their difference or disability. Secondly, as alluded earlier, those on both sides want to emphasize the value and worth of the person. Person-first language advocates believe the best way to do this is through literally putting the noun identifying \"person\" before any other identifiers. (As noted in one of the other articles opposing person-first language, however, English is a language that puts adjectives before nouns, whereas there are multiple languages that always place adjectives after nouns. In Spanish, for example, \"person with autism\" is \"persona con autismo,\" while \"Autistic person\" becomes \"persona aut\u00edstica.\" In both cases, autism/Autistic follows the noun.) Person-first language opponents believe the best way to do this is by recognizing and edifying the person's identity as an Autistic person as opposed to shunting an essential part of the person's identity to the side in favor of political correctness. It is impossible to affirm the value and worth of an Autistic person without recognizing his or her identity asan Autistic person. Referring to me as \"a person with autism,\" or \"an individual with ASD\" demeans who I am because it denies who I am. Lastly, what is most interesting indeed is the shared expressed sentiments that using or not using person-first language is necessary to change and shift societal attitudes toward Autistic people. Returning to the premise of this article, this is the sole reason why this debate continues to be argued and why many people on both sides regularly emerge upset and feel personally attacked. Language does play a large role in shaping societal attitudes. But let's think about what we are doing when we use these terms. When we say \"person with autism,\" we say that it is unfortunate and an accident that a person is Autistic. We affirm that the person has value and worth, and that autism is entirely separate from what gives him or her value and worth. In fact, we are saying that autism is detrimental to value and worth as a person, which is why we separate the condition with the word \"with\" or \"has.\" Ultimately, what we are saying when we say \"person with autism\" is that the person would be better off if not Autistic, and that it would have been better if he or she had been born typical. We suppress the individual's identity as an Autistic person because we are saying that autism is something inherently bad like a disease. Yet, when we say \"Autistic person,\" we recognize, affirm, and validate an individual's identity as an Autistic person. We recognize the value and worth of that individual as an Autistic person -- that being Autistic is not a condition absolutely irreconcilable with regarding people as inherently valuable and worth something. We affirm the individual's potential to grow and mature, to overcome challenges and disability, and to live a meaningful life as an Autistic. Ultimately, we are accepting that the individual is different from non-Autistic people--and that that's not a tragedy, and we are showing that we are not afraid or ashamed to recognize that difference. That's why, when I read a few articles scoffing entirely at the debate, and dismissing it as ultimately irrelevant (insisting that each person should use the terminology he or she prefers and to ignore what other people say or write), I was concerned. The question of person-first language is definitely important and cannot be disregarded. The way we use language affects those around us -- in our immediate communities and in society at large. Trends of language have the power to transform ideas and attitudes. To dismiss this as \"a silly semantics argument\" denies the power of language. What does, however, disturb me is the vitriol during debates about this (and similar) topics in the autism community. While it is, as repeatedly emphasized, an important debate with huge ramifications both short-term and long-term, hurling ad hominem insults, making baseless accusations, and shouting over tables (or computer screens) at the people on the other side ultimately demeans both you and them. It shows great immaturity, inability to civilly and peaceably discuss important topics, and insensitivity to the personal experiences vested in each of us with a stake in this debate. Having strong opinions on a topic and being able to have a respectful discussion with someone else are not mutually exclusive. So what can we do moving forward? Or, more importantly, what should we do? To those of you who use \"person with autism,\" I will always respect your Constitutional right to express yourself however you like, but I urge you to reconsider the consequences of using such language. To those of you who use \"Autistic person,\" I urge you to consistently use such phrasing everywhere possible, whenever discussing autism and issues that affect Autistic people, and to develop coherent, rational explanations for why you prefer this terminology, so that you can engage in such mutually respectful and civil exchanges with others. That, actually, goes for everyone. If we ever want to accomplish anything as a community, as a movement, or as advocates, we cannot allow ourselves to be constantly divided by infighting and vicious bullying -- and yes, that occurs from all sides of these debates, not just one. It is imperative that we learn to engage critically and respectfully with one another, and to value each individual's voice and feelings as equally important. Otherwise, we'll become even more dysfunctional than my subcommittee has been in recent months. -- Interested in other perspectives? Here are some links to feed your curiosity.

{"date": "Sunday, August 21, 2011", "body": "\n\n \n How can I make the first day of school easier for my child with autism? \n \nby Dr. Judy Horrocks \n \n\n \n \n As a parent it is difficult to send your special needs child off to a new teacher and possibly a new school. \u00a0  Many parents over the years asked me, as the principal of a school for children with autism, the best approach to make a smooth transition. \u00a0  I wish I had the perfect answer for you, but I can only give you some guidelines, the rest is based on your individual child. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n The transition from early intervention to a school aged program is particularly hard for parents. \u00a0  Often parents have just become comfortable with the pre-school faculty and now they are very nervous about changing programs.  Every  parent has similar fears. \u00a0  \u201cWill my child be okay? \u00a0  Will the adults understand my child\u2019s needs? \u00a0  Will my child be happy and comfortable in the new school?\u201d \u00a0  The less able the child can communicate the more pressure the parent feels. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n The best solution is building good communication directly with the teacher. \u00a0  Often visiting the school early to meet the teacher can be comforting. \u00a0  Not for the child, for you! \u00a0  Children with autism can be very perceptive; the more anxiety you feel as a parent the more likely your child\u2019s behavior may reflect that anxiety. \u00a0  If you can lower your own anxiety about this transition, then it is more likely to proceed more comfortably for your child. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n If you plan to visit, schedule the appointment and do not expect the teacher to give you more than thirty minutes to an hour (and stick to it). \u00a0  Good teachers have lots of preparation to do and will appreciate your respecting their time. \u00a0  They also will understand your concerns. \u00a0  As a parent just having a picture of the classroom and teacher can be very comforting. \n \n\n \n \n Many children with autism do have a difficult time with change. \u00a0  Change is change whether it is large or small. \u00a0  They often take the same amount of time to adjust regardless. \u00a0  We often think of this as over-reacting when the change is small, but we are not seeing the world through the child\u2019s eyes. \u00a0  Any change is hard, but children can adjust if the adults remain calm and in control. \u00a0  Do not offer the child lots of choices; they really don\u2019t know what will make them feel better! \n \n\n \n \n Picture yourself in an airplane. \u00a0  You look out the window and the wing is on fire. \u00a0  Would you like to hear the voice of the pilot come over the intercom offering you choices of what to do? \u00a0  In high anxiety situations, we would like the pilot\u2019s voice to be calm, clear and tell us what to do! \u00a0  This is true for everyone including children with autism. \u00a0  You are their pilot, be calm and take control. \u00a0  Often giving the student familiar routines can really lower their anxiety. \u00a0  Be sure to start the day using familiar routines as much as possible. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n I am often asked if providing multiple visits to the school to allow the child to get used to the building is helpful. \u00a0  I usually did not recommend this type of slow transition. \u00a0  First, as I stated earlier, change is change and multiple visits that are each slightly different just creates more change not less. \u00a0  The teacher establishing a set routine on the first day to be followed for the rest of the week is far more stress reducing. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n At any age, children with autism are not good at communicating well, particularly to new people. \u00a0  Parents always know their children best and can be great sources of information for teachers. \u00a0  Just don\u2019t overwhelm the teacher with too much information. \u00a0  The teacher will be best served by the following information: \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n What is reinforcing to your      child? Often sending a favorite toy or book for the teacher to use on the      first day is a wonderful idea. \u00a0  It      creates a bridge from home to the classroom. \u00a0  (Just don\u2019t send anything that would      create havoc if accidently left at school.) \u00a0  \n How do you comfort your child      when they are upset? \u00a0  The first day      of school will be difficult and your child is likely to be upset at      arrival. \u00a0  Giving the teacher      suggestions to comfort your child will help everyone have a better      transition. \u00a0  If your child would not      accept a hug from a stranger, what else would you suggest? Do they have a      special book or puzzle that may be calming?  \u00a0 Supply any materials. \n Does your child have eating      issues? \u00a0  Lunch and snack times can      be either times of stress or pleasure for children with autism, let the      teacher know what to expect. \u00a0  \n Describe any feature or routine      from the previous classroom. \u00a0  For      example, if they followed an individual visual schedule, what did it look      like? (if possible send it in.) \u00a0       Describe any reinforcement system used.  \n If your child used a      communication system, send it to school! \u00a0       If you do not have it, describe it in detail. \n \n \n\n \n \n After school, you will want to know every detail about the day. \u00a0  Do not expect a complete accounting from the teacher. \u00a0  They will have multiple parents all wanting details and it is impossible for them to give every parent a full accounting of the entire day. \u00a0  Ask for a note or email with a general description of your child\u2019s day, if you want any specific information, ask for it directly. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n Most children with autism will have difficulty describing the day, let if come out slowly over the course of the evening. \u00a0  Do not try to interrogate them as soon as they arrive. \u00a0  You will only increase their anxiety and you will probably not get the information you are seeking anyway. \u00a0  It is more important to focus on your child\u2019s comfort now then detailed information. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n \n Working in a school for children with autism, I always found it amazing how quickly most of the students adjusted to their new classrooms. \u00a0  By the second day, as the classroom routines were established, the students relaxed and the new school year had begun! \n \n\n \n I am starting a new blog to answer questions for parents, grandparents, teachers, etc. \u00a0  Please feel free to visit and email any topics you have that you would like to see in a blog! \u00a0  The website is:  www.drjudyautismblog.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.drjudyautismblog.com/2011/08/21/how-can-i-make-the-first-day-of-school-easier-for-my-child-with-autism-3/", "http://www.drjudyautismblog.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/08/beat-back-to-scool-jitters-dr-judy.html", "title": "\nBeat the Back-to-School Jitters: Dr. Judy Horrocks' How can I make the first day of school easier for my child with autism?\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, September 1, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n\n How can I help my child in emergency situations? \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Posted on  August 31, 2011 \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by\u00a0Dr. Judy Horrocks \n Most police and fire department personnel have heard of autism, but really know very little about the disability. Introducing your child to the local personnel may be very helpful. Children with autism have difficulty with generalization of concepts that they are taught or told. They may recognize a police uniform or car but not really understand the meaning of the symbols. If the local police or fire department are aware of your child, that will be beneficial in any emergency.   Emergencies are stressful and we know that our children behave erratically in stressful situations. How can we make the situation less stressful?   Communication is the key in any emergency. Your child needs to understand and follow instructions. What is the best form for your child to understand language? Often we use pictures or written instructions and keep meaning very literal. Visuals allow more processing time then quick verbal statements. Have some picture communication symbols ready to use in emergency. Gestures and pointing are typically not very effective for this population. Children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder often do not understand body language or figurative language.   If your child begins repeating words or phrases you have just said, they may be trying to process the information. If they are repeating a phrase from a movie or video, this may just let you know your child is anxious. Do not assume all verbal language is communication, repeating a phrase is typically not meant as communication to you. Allow them time to process any verbal information your have provided before adding additional comments. If you feel you have to repeat yourself, then simplify the statement.   Practice simple commands. It is easier to teach \u201csit down\u201d then \u201cstop.\u201d Children may stop at the command, but for how long? Waiting for the next instruction is not likely to happen! If a child sits down, you will have more time to get to them and/or give the next command. Practice: sit down, come with me, hold my hand, stand up, walk, etc. Be sure to get your child attention before giving the command. Then wait for understanding before repeating, give adequate processing time for your child to respond.  Create routines. Children on the autism spectrum tend to like routines and find routines comfortable and calming. Practicing some simple routines regarding leaving your house and staying near the curb to wait for help would be beneficial in an actual emergency. If you find yourself in an actual emergency, try to use commands that follow familiar routines to keep your child calm.  Be aware of sensory issues. Children with autism may have difficulty with lights (visual defensiveness) noise (auditory defensiveness) or touch ( tactile defensiveness). Do not interpret hands in their ears or lack of eye contact as a sign of disrespect. If your child is lost, ask the police to avoid use of the siren or flashing lights when searching for your child; this may actually cause physical discomfort. Let them know that your child may not come to them if called, provide them with some simple commands that your child would understand.   Since their sensory systems are impaired and communication difficult, your child may not recognize injury. People with autism may not ask for help or show any indications of pain and may be fearful of your touch. Avoid touching the child, if necessary use firm grip. Repetitive behavior may not need to be stopped unless it is self injurious or at risk of injury to others.  Be aware that change produces anxiety and a high level of anxiety impairs thinking and increases sensitivity. Certain times of the year have more change, such as breaks from educational facilities, changes in daylight savings time, etc. These times of year are more likely to create emergency situations. Children may require closer supervision during these times of year.This entry was posted in  About Autism  by  Judy .

{"date": "Sunday, September 18, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nKathleen and I have been blogging buddies for over two years\nnow, working on various projects together, struggling to figure out our places\nin the online autism community as we work in the real world to find our place\nthere, as well, to find the best ways to help both our own children, and other\nchildren like ours. \n \n \n \nWe\u2019ve read several hundred bloggers over the years, and with\nover 800 bloggers represented on the directory, we\u2019ve read hundreds of stories\nof how parents have come to face the reality of what autism means not just for\ntheir children who are diagnosed on the spectrum, but for the families, as\nwell. We\u2019ve become friends with many adults on the spectrum, learning about how\ntheir autism impacts them and how they view the world. We\u2019ve made friends, seen\npeople come and go from the blogging world, and even irritated the occasional\nperson (me way way more than Kathleen ever has). \n \n \nWe\u2019ve witnessed intense anger, deep depression, denial,\nacceptance, and all the feelings in between in parents as they face the\nhurdles, struggles, heartache and intense joy and delight in our children that\npunctuate the difficult times. We\u2019ve warred internally on how to respond to\nboth acts and words that negatively impact individuals on the spectrum, and\nwe\u2019ve tried to figure out where we must act and where we should remain silent. \n \n \n \nWe\u2019ve erred at times, speaking where silence was the right\ncourse of action (me more than Kathleen), and remaining silent where we should\nhave spoken. We\u2019ve been judgmental where we should have shown grace. We\u2019ve been\nhuman, in other words, and it\u2019s all been in real time. The blogging world is a\nreactive world, and sometimes pausing for reflection is not an activity we\nindulge ourselves in.  \n \n \nBlogs provide current snapshots of moods, feelings, and experiences\nand the chance for near instantaneous responses to others\u2019 lives. They are\nmonologues and dialogues, attempts to inform, to persuade, to berate, to\ncommunicate. Blogging is risky business, especially if you take the time to be\nraw and honest, especially in our community where we\u2019re dealing with more\nfactions than European politics have. Someone\u2019s always waiting to jump on it\nand call in their buddies to dogpile (and too many times that\u2019s been me).  \n \n \n \nMemoirs, on the other hand, offer a look at autism and how\nit impacts the individual and the family from the vantage point of distance.\nThe writers are looking back, with the benefit of their current wisdom offering\nthe chance to cover up those all-too-human mistakes. Whitewashing has to be a\ntemptation, difficult to resist, a siren\u2019s song to cast oneself as the hero of\nthe story who overcomes all obstacles, never making messy, costly mistakes. So\nwhen a writer comes along and offers a memoir, that while tightly crafted and\npolished to a fine shine, still reveals the messy mistakes we\u2019re all prone to,\nit\u2019s a surprise. Kerry Cohen, though, has a history of openness and honesty\nthat is raw and real, having authored  Loose\nGirl: A Memoir of Promiscuity.  Her new memoir details her journey as mother\nto Ezra, who has autism, and how coming to grips with this impacts every aspect\nof her life. \n \n \nHer memoir is engaging and unapologetic; despite its\ndifficult terrain, it\u2019s easy to read, the text flowing off the page. There is\nat once a remove, an emotional distance, and an intense emotionality to the\nwork that leaves the reader both pulled in and pushed away, a tug-of-war of\nemotional rollercoaster rides that many parents of special needs children will\nintimately recognize. \n \n \n \nIt\u2019s a tug-of-war that the reader may feel viscerally, as\nwell. Why\u2019s she being so raw? Why\u2019s she revealing the marital issues? The\nunderbelly? Why? And yet, to have whitewashed any part of this story would have\nbeen a disservice to the reality that families face. And yet, there are other\nparts, gaps in the story, that leave the reader with questions. \n \n \n \nIt shouldn\u2019t take courage to tell the whole emotional story\nof coming to grips with the reality of parenting a child with special needs. It\nshouldn\u2019t be going out on a limb to express one\u2019s own emotional and internal\nreality, and yet it is. All too often it is painting a target on oneself, and\nso when a writer, a mom, chooses to be this bluntly honest, all of us ought to be\nable to at least acknowledge that honesty.  \n \n \n \nCohen offers that honesty in this memoir and the hurdles in\ncoming to terms with her son\u2019s autism and what it means. And, as she herself\nnotes in her closing chapter, there\u2019s no happy ending, no tidy closing to\noffer. \n \n \n \nIs it inspirational? Not in a sanitized, artificial way. But\nthere\u2019s a takeaway here, even if there\u2019s no happy ending. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathleen: \n \n \n \n \n \n I generally don't read books about autism. In the roughly ten years that I have been aware of it, I can honestly say that the amount of books I have read on the topic could be counted on one hand. There are so many \u00a0reasons for this..but mostly-it's because I have four kids and we have our own story.\u00a0 In the early years with my kids-I was submerged in parenting 24/7..there was no online community-at least for me. \u00a0I didn't even have a computer. Autism was not as widely known or spoken about as it is today. \u00a0I had no clue that my oldest sons diagnosis (PDD (nos) ) had anything to do with it. So, when I finally took the plunge and entered the world 'o technology-I was blown away by the many different view points and experiences of other parents. \u00a0Some I was able to agree with-and others...well, as Kim said..I found myself pissing people off (although\u00a0DEFINITELY not as much as she has!). In other words, I learned the hard way that my experience was neither better than nor less than anyone\u00a0else's. That a blog post was just a blog post and not always definitive of who that writer was. That my thoughts and opinions were not always going to be welcome..and most importantly...that sometimes people just want a place to be heard. \u00a0Sometimes it is our place to just listen. \n \n \n \n \u00a0Having read \" Loose Girl, \" which I thought was a very brave and much needed book-I was interested in what the author had to say about her experiences in parenting an autistic child. This was a difficult book for me to read. \u00a0 It brought me back to my early days within the online community. I had to remind myself that this was a memoir-the author's experience. An experience that she fully owns while accepting that other peoples' may differ. I can not\u00a0criticize\u00a0a memoir. \u00a0There were places where I wanted to hug her, places where I thoroughly disagreed with her..places where she made me laugh (her experience with a school in\u00a0 Portland \u00a0and the teacher whose feelings she hurt cracked me up). It is raw, deeply personal, and it is real. To me, it was a story more about growing up and accepting that there are no givens in life than it was about autism. \u00a0That happiness and joy are something we have to work for-and that there are no guarantees.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/joint-review-of-kerry-cohens-seeing.html", "title": "\nA Joint Review of Kerry Cohen's Seeing Ezra\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "body": "\nKerry Cohen, author of Seeing Ezra, agreed to an interview with Kathleen and me. Kathleen's questions appear first. The name \"Ezra\" means aid or help.  Is the title of your memoir a reflection of the idea that in seeing your son for who he is-helped you to see life how it really is.  In other words, happiness and happy endings aren't guaranteed-one has to make them happen. Um, yeah, sure, of course. That's exactly what I meant when I titled it because, yeah sure, I knew my son's name meant aid. Ha. In all seriousness, that IS what I meant, but I must admit I didn't know until just now that this was the meaning of 'Ezra.' I thought it meant 'messenger', which also works nicely for who he is and this idea that he's taught me so much about what I need to see in the world. And, yes, I named it Seeing Ezra because the memoir is very much about my journey of trying to see my son clearly amid all that autism noise, and in trying to see him, I was also trying to see myself. And, yes, I don't really believe in happy endings. This is something I try to do in my work -- I'm interested in the meta-narratives in our culture, and for the special needs child that narrative is that some non-special need parent finds the answer and cures them. It's a bunch of bull, you know? The truth is always more hidden, and I'm always most interested in finding it. Being a memoir-the story is told from your perspective. What does your family think about it?  Do they view some of the(family) experiences you write about in the same way? Were they aware of the turmoil you were feeling?  So, I should say that I let Michael read it before it was published. He is totally on board and agrees for the most part with my interpretation. Most of my other family members weren't aware of the turmoil because I tend to be good at putting a face to the world.  Your story is deeply personal-raw even at times.  After reading your finished work, were you surprised by anything you had written?  Did you learn more about yourself in the writing of it-or in the reading?   Absolutely. You know, I can't even read it now. It's too painful for me to go back and feel what I was feeling for so long. I love this about writing -- I will always get more honest with myself when I write, whereas in real life it's easy to stay in denial. I hate that word: denial. I don't think there's anything wrong with needing to stay away from some of that rawness in our daily lives, reserving the pain for when we can set aside time for it. This is what my writing does for me, I guess. I'm not sure if I'm really answering your questions: I guess, yes, I'm still surprised by how painful some of this has been, and yet I'm also so glad that I have the capacity to experience those intense feelings. It makes life more...alive. At the end of the book-it seems that you have come to many realizations about your son as well as yourself. How has this changed your life-your families life? What is the most important thing you have learned.  What do you most want your readers to understand from your experiences? I'm so thankful as a parent to have had Ezra first because I think it's helped me immensely in parenting Griffin. I really understand that the things I might otherwise think were super important just aren't. For instance - how much my kids play video games or whether they eat all organic food or play with plastic toys. Who cares? What matters is my relationship with my children, whether I can take responsibility for myself, whether they feel worthwhile in the world, feel like they are good and perfect as they are. I most want my readers to understand that they aren't alone, that we are just human beings trying to raise other human beings, that our children aren't ours - they belong to themselves and ultimately to the world.  \n \n \n \nMy questions: How old is Ezra now and how is he doing? Is he eating a wider selection of foods or is this an area that is still an issue?  Ezra is 8. He's doing well, still at that wonderful school that gives him support and therapies throughout the day, but in ways that are fun for him. He's also getting music therapy there, which is so fun for him. He's answering most questions (still not why - cause and effect is their next big push with him at his school), and is much more communicative in general. He's been making up stories with his stuffed animals and narrating them. He's good! You know how this is - so hard to say. Of course I believe he's doing great. He's always developing and growing and thrilling us. But then there are those times we feel that grief about what will be. My most honest answer to this question is: I don't know. He's happy and thriving emotionally and cognitively and physically. This is enough, maybe. The eating: ugh! It's still pretty bad. They've gotten him to eat a few more things at school - bananas, fruit leather, applesauce, and lettuce from the garden. He drinks his milk now from a straw and will drink water (and chews ice, though - hello, pica). So, yes, still an issue. How much time has elapsed since finishing the book and its publication? I guess a good three years since I finished when he was 5 and now he's 8.  In the closing chapter, you focus on your relationship with Ezra, but I'm sure readers will wonder, as I did, how your relationship with your husband is, if the two of you were able to overcome some of the issues you were struggling with, as well as how Griffin and Ezra's relationship has continued to grow and evolve. Michael and I are great friends and co-parents, but we are divorced. We both have discussed the possibility that we might have still made it somehow, but now I'm with someone else, and I'm happy. There's still some sadness about it of course. If I could have my way I would somehow have him and my new partner with me all the time, but...obviously, that isn't going to happen. Something cool, though, is my new partner has two kids - 8 and 4 - and that's been such a great addition to my kids' lives. They love and sort of protect Ezra (especially the older one, a girl), and I love that he is surrounded by more typical children all the time. For Griffin, it means he gets to have some typical siblings to play with, which is so nice for him. That said, Griffin and Ezra absolutely adore each other. They have their own special way of playing. Sometimes I have no idea what Ezra wants, so I ask Griffin, and he says, \"Oh, yeah, he wants xyz,\" like it's the most obvious thing in the world. They have an unspoken knowledge of one another. And Ezra loves Griffin so much - I'd say he's possibly his favorite person in the world. He always needs to know where he is and prefers to be with him as much as possible. It's so lovely. One thing that seems clear in the memoir is that you faced a lot of judgments from people (something all special needs parents can deal with). Even where we should be at least sympathetic to other parents' struggles, it feels like the judgment from other special needs parents can be harsher than those who don't face the same obstacles. What words of advice would you offer to parents new to this world and the online community, specifically? That's such a good point and such a hard question too. I think you're right about special needs parents, and I would guess it's because we are so often stumbling and grasping onto things. Add to that the online world where most everyone treats each other like garbage (I think of it the same way as when people are in their cars). So, I guess the only words of advice I have are to be careful out there. Know that this is true about much of the special needs world. Finding friends in the special needs world is so important, but it definitely takes a while to filter out the people who will make you feel bad. I have some friends from the online worlds I joined who I think are fantastic, but my closest friends are in real life, from Ezra's school. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/interview-with-kerry-cohen.html", "title": "\nAn Interview with Kerry Cohen\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n\n reprinted with permission \n \n \n \nI want to thank Simon Baron-Cohen for taking the time to respond,\u00a0in his \u00a0 September 10th post \u00a0 on the Autism Blogs Directory, to one of my early pieces on autism and empathy. I am very gratified that he did so. \n \n \nUnfortunately, I found his response quite troubling. While there are a number of points that concern me, I\u2019m going to focus on the aspects of his piece that speak directly to the most pressing issues. \n \n The problematic nature of the test instruments \n \nMy first concern is that while Simon points to studies proving empathy and theory of mind deficits in autism, he does not address any of the many valid critiques of the test instruments themselves. For example, he chose to respond to a piece on the Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory that I wrote over two years ago, when I was newly diagnosed and at the very beginning of formulating my thinking on the issue, rather than speaking to my recent \u00a0 systematic critique \u00a0 of the numerous flaws and biases in the Empathy Quotient (EQ) test or to my \u00a0 earlier piece \u00a0 on the Theory of Mind test. Both critiques discuss serious problems with the primary assessment tools on which his conclusions are based. If he would like his work to be better informed by the ways in which autistic people experience our sensory and emotional lives, and by the ways in which the test instruments fail to take account of the complexity of our experiences, I invite him to read both pieces, along with numerous other critiques and personal accounts on the \u00a0 Autism and Empathy \u00a0 website. \n \nSimon also fails to mention that the false belief test used for the past 30 years to assess theory of mind in autistic children relies upon verbal interaction and language processing, areas in which autistic people are understood to have serious difficulties. In fact, in a \u00a0 2005 paper , Morton Ann Gernsbacher and Jennifer L. Frymiare point out that the syntactic form of the questions posed by the test is one of the most complex in the English language. The authors go on to cite a study showing that performance on false belief tests correlates with language ability in children \u00a0 with and without autism . In fact, when autistic and deaf children are given a false belief test administered visually rather than verbally, they score higher than non-autistic hearing children: \u201cIf one creates a false drawing task that tests theory of mind without reliance on language, one finds that children with autism and children with deafness actually outperform children with normal hearing (Peterson, 2002).\u201d \n \n The misleading nature of the term \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d \n \nMy issues with Simon\u2019s work go far beyond the problematic methodology of the test instruments, however, and extend to his use of the term \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d to describe an inability to read and to interpret nonverbal signals. If, as Simon asserts, \u201cpeople with autism are very capable of an empathic response\u201d when those around us verbalize (or otherwise make clear) their feelings, then our difficulties lie not in the area of \u201caffective empathy,\u201d but in the area of what he calls \u201ccognitive empathy.\u201d By this reasoning, Simon\u2019s theory of autism as an empathy disorder rests on the latter term. \n \nTo make clear the misleading nature of the term \u201ccognitive empathy,\u201d a brief summary of Simon\u2019s definitions is in order. \n \nIn \u00a0 The Empathy Quotient: An Investigation of Adults with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism, and Normal Sex Differences , \u00a0 Simon and his colleague Sally Wheelwright draw on a definition of cognitive empathy as \u201cusing a \u2018theory of mind\u2019 (Astington, Harris, & Olson, 1988; Wellman, 1990) or \u2018mindreading\u2019 (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Whiten, 1991).\u201d In \u00a0 Theory of mind in normal development and autism , Simon defines the term \u201ctheory of mind\u201d and specifically describes it as a core component of humanity that is impaired in autistic people: \n \n \nA theory of mind remains one of the quintessential abilities that makes us human (Whiten, 1993). By theory of mind we mean being able to infer the full range of mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions, imagination, emotions, etc.) that cause action. In brief, having a theory of mind is to be able to reflect on the contents of one\u2019s own and other\u2019s minds. Difficulty in understanding other minds is a core cognitive feature of autism spectrum conditions. The theory of mind difficulties seem to be universal among such individuals.\u201d (Baron-Cohen, 3) \n \n \nIn his response to my post, and in numerous other pieces of writing, Simon asserts that both theory of mind and cognitive empathy rely upon an ability to see and to read nonverbal signals. If a person can\u2019t do so, but relies upon verbal language or another form of communication, then that person has an impairment in theory of mind and in the cognitive empathy that depends upon it, resulting in a deficit in \u201cone of the quintessential abilities that makes us human.\u201d \n \nIt\u2019s my contention that calling a physical inability to see and to interpret nonverbal signals a failure of any kind of empathy is to make an unmerited interpretive leap. After all, people who are blind cannot see and interpret nonverbal signals \u2014 they rely upon spoken language and/or Braille text \u2014 and yet, to my knowledge, no one has alleged that blindness is a low-empathy condition. Blind people come to understand the mental states of other people through other means, just as autistic people do. And yet, for an autistic person, a problem seeing and interpreting visual phenomena \u2014 and the necessity of taking alternative routes to acquiring the information expressed by such phenomena \u2014 is the basis for defining autism as an empathy disorder. \n \nPlease note the double standard at work. \n \n Making a processing disability an empathy disability \n \nWhen it comes to reading nonverbals, some sighted autistic people report not being able to see the signals at all. Others, like myself, receive a great deal of information from the eyes and face, but cannot parse the signals separately or intuitively. Perhaps we are really talking about the same thing here; after all, if I can\u2019t separate the signals, the net effect is that I can\u2019t see them as signals in the normal sense of the word. In any case, in my own experience, the problem is that all of the information from the eyes and face comes in very quickly. And while I cannot translate any of the more subtle nonverbals and use them in real time, my affective empathic response is quite acute. So, while I always understand that something is up, I may not always be able to discern exactly what it is at that very moment. \n \nMy visual processing of nonverbal signals is exactly analogous to my auditory processing of verbal speech: if you put me in a sound-rich environment, in which multiple conversations are going on at once, I can physically hear the sounds and the vocal tones, but I cannot separate the words from one another in order to understand and respond to them. The message becomes garbled. \n \nNo one has ever suggested that, because of my difficulties with auditory processing, being unable to understand what someone says to me \u00a0 verbally \u00a0 in a noisy room is evidence of low empathy. But when, because of my difficulties with visual processing, I can\u2019t understand what someone says to me \u00a0 nonverbally , it\u2019s adduced as prima facie evidence of a condition \u00a0 defined by \u00a0 low empathy. \n \nThat is a most illogical and unscientific conclusion. \n \nIf I cannot see nonverbal signals or parse them in real time, that is the sign of a visual processing issue, not the sign of an empathy disorder. \n \nIf I have to devote nearly every ounce of processing energy I have to decoding the words someone says to me, and therefore cannot afford to divert it for receiving visual information from the person\u2019s eyes and face, that is the sign of an auditory processing issue, not the sign of an empathy disorder. \n \nIf, when I go to the market, I cannot stop and ask after people\u2019s welfare because I have to focus on getting my shopping done before the sensory overload becomes disorienting and painful, that is the sign of a sensory processing issue, not the sign of an empathy disorder. \n \nAnd if, when bombarded by sensory and emotional information, I find myself unable to express my empathy in real time and respond in any kind of conventional way, that is the sign of an information processing and communication issue, not the sign of an empathy disorder. \n \nTo define any of these issues as the signs of an empathy disorder is to take a physical disability and raise it to the level of a failure of humanity. \n \n Hurt feelings, oversimplifications, and \u00a0 The Science of Evil \n \nSuffering is nearly always the consequence of ascribing an inborn dearth of humanity to any child born to two human parents. And this is why any assertion that autistic people are born with a deficit in a core component of humanity is so terribly, terribly troubling to me. \n \nI\u2019m not talking about someone hurting my feelings, as Simon implies. What I\u2019m concerned about are ill-conceived definitions and unwarranted conclusions that have the potential to cause tremendous suffering for autistic people at the hands of the larger world. \n \nSo, when Simon takes processing and communication difficulties and makes them evidence of an empathy disorder, then I have a problem. \n \nAnd when, in a post for the Autism Blogs Directory, his words do not reflect the manner in which he describes our capacity for affective empathy in his latest book, my concerns only increase. \n \nConsider the following: In his September 10th post, he provides a chart to explain the way that he profiles autistics and psychopaths in his recently published popular science book \u00a0 The Science of Evil \u00a0 (entitled \u00a0 Zero Degrees of Empathy \u00a0 in the UK). The chart in his blog post shows psychopaths and autistics with profiles that are a mirror-image of each other: psychopaths are positive for cognitive empathy but negative for affective empathy (they can intuitively read how people are feeling, but they don\u2019t care), while autistics are negative for cognitive empathy and positive for affective empathy (we can\u2019t intuitively read how people are feeling, but once we understand that a person is upset, we\u2019re upset, too). \n \nHowever, the information on this chart does not accurately represent the autistic profile that Simon delineates in \u00a0 The Science of Evil . For example, in a matrix in the latter part of the book, one finds that the profiles of psychopaths and autistics \u00a0 are not \u00a0 mirror images of each other; psychopaths show the same profile as in the blog post, but the autistic profile \u00a0 is negative for both cognitive and affective empathy (Table 1: Distinct Profiles of the Empathy Disorders, 154). \n \nIn fact, in contrast to his statement in his post that \u201cpeople with autism are very capable of an empathic response,\u201d \u00a0 The Science of Evil \u00a0 is relentless in its portrayal of the autistic capacity for affective empathy as highly impaired. In order to illustrate the nature of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, for example, Simon introduces a 52-year-old adult named Michael, whose dream \u201cis to live in a world without people, where he can have total control.\u201d Michael not only fails to read nonverbal signals, but \u201cdoes not know how to respond to someone else\u2019s feelings,\u201d even when they are explicit (99). \n \nThe book does not differentiate between Michael not knowing what to do and not having an affective response at all. \n \nThe book does not explore the possibility that Michael may have long since shut down his emotional responses because of severe empathic and sensory overload, fear, anxiety, shunning, loneliness, bullying, despair, and other life experiences common to autistic people. \n \nThe book does not explore the possibility that Michael dreams of being alone because he seeks to comfort himself, in the midst of acute difficulties to which the world is largely oblivious, with a fantasy of control. \n \nThe book does not explore the possibility that Michael systemizes to an extreme degree in order to exert control over an extreme intensity of empathic and sensory experience. \n \nAnd the book does not provide the story of Michael as only one example of the complexity of response among autistic people. It presents Michael as \u00a0 representative . Nowhere does Simon narrate \u00a0 any \u00a0 scenario in which \u00a0 any \u00a0 autistic person shows \u00a0 any affective empathic response to the feelings of another person. In fact, he does the following: \n \n1. He asserts, without qualification of any kind, that for people with Asperger\u2019s and people with classic autism, \u201cOther people\u2019s behavior is beyond comprehension, and empathy is impossible,\u201d placing us all on the zero end of the empathy scale (117). \n \n2. He then attempts to redeem autistic people as \u201cZero-Positive\u201d (rather than \u201cZero-Negative,\u201d which is reserved for psychopaths) because our \u201cempathy difficulties\u201d are associated with \u201chaving a brain that processes information in ways that can lead to talent\u201d (citing the work of the savants Daniel Tammett, Derek Paravicini, and Peter Myers), and because \u201cZero-Positive\u201d individuals are responsible for innovations in technology, science, mathematics, and other \u201csystemizing\u201d fields (96, 106-107, 122). Of course, he thereby leaves out the vast majority of autistic people who have no savant gifts and no special talent for innovation in any field at all. Hundreds of thousands of us therefore lose the already dubiously redemptive \u201cPositive\u201d label. \n \n3. He goes to great lengths to insist that people with Asperger\u2019s develop a moral code not because we are informed by an empathic response to others, but only out of a drive to systemize. When others act unethically, he writes, people with Asperger\u2019s leap to the defense of the injured party \u2014 not because we are moved by empathy for the other person, but because unethical behavior \u201cviolates the moral system\u201d we have \u201cconstructed \u00a0 through brute logic alone \u201d (emphasis mine) (123). In other words, we\u2019re simply upset that the rules have been broken. \n \nOf course, this explanation rather begs the question of why anyone without an empathic response to the difficulties of other people would construct a moral code in the first place. \n \n4. He characterizes people with classic autism as viewing their parents as \u201cnothing more than a vending machine\u201d to serve their desires. He thereby places people with classic autism outside the field of both empathic and ethical response, calling them \u201cMorality-Negative\u201d (119, 154). \n \nAnd then he asserts in a post on the Autism Blogs Directory, four months after the publication of his book, that people with autism are, in fact, \u201cvery capable of an empathic response\u201d \u2014 an assertion that appears nowhere, explicitly or implicitly, in the pages of \u00a0 The Science of Evil , published on two continents, and reviewed by critics the world over. \n \nWhen someone writes a popular science book that will be read by far more people than any post on any blog, and in that book fails to address the depth and complexity of autistic experience, then we have a number of potential problems on our hands. \n \nThis is not about anyone hurting my feelings. It\u2019s about the perpetuation of stereotypes and oversimplifications that, in my opinion, have the potential for tremendous harm. Consider the possibilities: \n \nAutistic people describe our empathic experiences in detail, only to be told that we have such low empathy that we are the last to know it. \n \nAutistic people protest abuse and ill-treatment, only to be told that we can\u2019t understand other people\u2019s motives and intentions, much less respond to them appropriately. \n \nAutistic people are treated without empathy because other people believe that we have none ourselves. \n \nAutistic people face lives of substandard care, isolation, and abuse because we are considered to have been born without a core component of humanity. \n \nAutistic people lose opportunities for love, for friendship, and for caregiving work because people believe that we are incapable of them. \n \nAutistic people lose our sense of who we are because we have to endure a constant and unrelenting barrage of messages that tell us that we are something else. \n \nNo, this is not about hurt feelings. It\u2019s about the lives of people with classic autism. It\u2019s about the lives of people with Asperger\u2019s. It\u2019s about the lives of people all along the spectrum. And it\u2019s about the vulnerability, the rights, and the potential suffering of hundreds of thousands of living, breathing, \u00a0 fully human \u00a0 beings. \n \n \u00a9 2011 by Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://draft.blogger.com/goog_1046707966", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/09/19/my-reply-to-simon-baron-cohen/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/08/06/8829/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/09/19/2009/04/02/a-critique-of-the-theory-of-mind-tom-test/", "http://www.autismandempathy.com/", "http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_autistic_modules.pdf", "http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2004_BCandSW_EQ.pdf", "http://www.autism-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/TOM-in-TD-and-ASD.pdf"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/unwarranted-conclusions-and-potential.html", "title": "\nUnwarranted Conclusions and the Potential for Harm: Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg's Reply to Simon Baron-Cohen\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, September 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n Intersex and autism - biological variation or disorder? \n \n I've been researching intersex for a blog post I'm thinking about for my  God Confusion blog . It is estimated as much as 4% of population have some degree of intersex (biologically between male & female). The medical profession made intersex invisible for decades because it was thought to be 'abnormal'. Most people that are intersex would never know it, because they have typical anatomy for male or female and can produce offspring. Instead of accepting differences, for decades psychiatrists, psychologists and religious fundamentalists have preached that intersex is a defect/deformity/disorder that needs to be fixed. All this has done is create shame and stigma and many broken people.  In order to fit binary sex categories, many children were mutilated with surgery. In the western world, everyone is assigned a legal sex, and too bad if you're intersex and been assigned the sex that prevents you from legally marrying (heterosexual marriage has also been ingrained by religious fundamentalists).  I've read several comments by religious people that claim intersex people are not entitled to marry at all. Even recently, there has been hate speech and claims that people that are intersex are immoral.  My thinking is intersex is a biological variation, not a deformity (it's society that's turned it into a deformity). The labels 'male' and 'female' are human assignments and people have been mutilated for decades to conform to two categories. Biologically, sex is not binary, but is more of a continuum.  There are over 40 different known 'conditions', mostly genetic that result in intersex. Not many of them result in unambiguous genitalia. Intersex is the preferred catch-all label instead of misleading labels such as hermaphrodite.  All labels are human constructs. By their very nature, they exclude people. Labels often carry stigma - look at the stigma that goes with mental illness. I never tell a potential workplace I've suffered depression, as I won't get the job. Part of the reason I write under a pen-name is because of stigma about the topics I write about. It gives me a buffer against ignorant bigots.  I read some heart-breaking stories by people that are intersex - the suffering they endured being made out to be freaks by society. Advocates educate people about the facts, myths and reality of intersex. One pointed out they are not defined by their intersex - they are a human being and intersex is a part of who they are. For years autism and Asperger's were seen by the psychology and the medical profession as a disorder to be fixed. Like intersex, it was thought to be rare and abnormal. It is now estimated that 1% of the population are/have Asperger's. Asperger's is on the autistic spectrum and there are plans by psychiatry to dispense of the 'Asperger's' label and just have one category, autism.  Psychology/psychiatry is often at odds with personal experience. Autism advocates have spoken out where  'experts' reinforce stigma .  My thinking is that autism/Asperger's is a variation of human personality. Most of my difficulties come because of misunderstanding from society. Like intersex, any way of behaving differently from the majority of society is seen as abnormal, wrong and immoral. The same goes for atheism.  I am an advocate for autism/Asperger's and atheism because I have experienced first hand the stigma from society of being different. My own  family don't accept me  for my differences - I don't fit their narrow black-and-white worldview ingrained by religion. Yet, I am not defined by my autism and atheism. That is not all of me - I am also a mother, a wife, a musician, a thinker, a writer, an INTP. I'm a woman (heck, there's a 1 in 25 chance I'm intersex but don't know it).  I'm heterosexual (and sometimes feel I'm asexual as I don't have a particularly high sex drive). I'm celiac and I'm sensitive. I'm part-Maori and part-European. I'm a New Zealand citizen and an Australian resident. These are all labels that only give a glimpse of me.  I am a human being - a multifaceted human being, not just a single dimension. Here's one that upsets a lot of people - I'm an animal and an ape. Yes, humans are classified as apes. Doesn't bother me - I like animals.  Male and female gender roles are labels constructed by society. Gender is what sex a person feels inside, irrespective of their biological sex. I'm female, but not a 'girly' female. I studied a degree dominated by males. Women were oppressed for centuries. Now it's swung the other way somewhat.  Anyone outside the 'norm' still gets despised by much of society (because of the influence of Abrahamic religion) - feminine boys, masculine girls. Bisexuals, gays, transgender etc. Tribal groups often embraced difference such as intersex and transgender - they were considered special and a gift.  I'm all for accepting differences and not being forced to conform to some narrow black-and-white views imposed on individuals by the ignorance of society. The majority bullying minority individuals and groups into submission.  This can only take place with education and challenging current worldviews. Let's do what we can to discard bigoted stereotypes and promote understanding. \n\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aspergerschild.org/1/post/2011/09/intersex-and-autism-biological-variation-or-disorder.html", "http://www.godconfusion.com/", "http://www.aspergerschild.org/1/post/2011/09/autism-empathy-debate.html", "http://www.aspergerschild.org/1/post/2011/08/what-its-like-to-have-a-non-supportive-parent.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/showcase-xanthe-wise.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Xanthe Wise\n"},

Forest Sure Does Miss Jenny. 09/23/2011 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Curtis's \"BFF\" from Kindergarten to Second grade has transferred to a new school down the road. I have written about their relationship in past posts but to refresh a bit - Curtis and \"Jenny\" have a unique and devoted love to one another that I have never seen between two kids, ever. Jenny is a beautiful blond who is smitten over Curtis's brains, style and personality. Curtis is an adorable young man who is smitten over her brains, style and personality as well. Curtis use to carry her lunch box for her, draw her maps to his house, walk hand in hand with her down the halls and pull out her chair in the classroom when she was approaching. He got so upset one day when his teacher re-arranged the desks in the classroom and placed her desk across the room from his that he insisted on moving them all back so he could sit next to his BFF forever and always. I will never forget watching him take matters into his own hands rearranging the desks back to the places that they \"should be\" - I sat back and let him do it with such a smile on my face. He is so devoted to Jenny that this year, as he is forming friendships with some new kids, he is making it loud and clear to them that there is only room for one \"BFF\" in his life -\u00a0 Jenny. He has voiced that one day he would like to take his BFF and marry her - he has big (but I am assuming quite predictable and simple) plans for this relationship. He has even gone as far as to mention that after they marry and become husband and wife the BFF title will be dropped and no one else will EVER be able to take that place. Between now and marriage Curtis and myself will be making monthly field trips to her new school to have lunch dates with her, visit her new classroom and play tag at recess. He also has insisted that we stop by a local cupcake shop to get her a cupcake, vanilla of course as she hates chocolate. We have planed to do this \"social field trip\" the first Monday of every month. In between these field trips, Curtis is writing her letters the old fashion way and drawing beautiful pictures of her (seen in photo). On a personal level I miss \"Jenny\" a great deal as well - she was always by my side complimenting me on my \"style\" or scratching Curtis' back if I was too far away. She would always step up and offer comfort to Curtis when I was out sick and make sure he had his water bottle, clip board and red crayon in hand.\u00a0 All of this was not done out of pity, I can assure you that. I have a good sense in reading people and Jenny truly felt connected to Curtis. I will foster this relationship as much as I can while working with Curtis - in a world where social devotion is limited, this is worth savoring.

That is just the truth of the human experience.  We are, for better or worse, trapped in our own heads. \nThere has been an on-going  \u2018dialogue\u2019  the last several weeks regarding the nature of advocacy and the disability community.  \n \ndi\u00b7a\u00b7logue:  a conversation between two or more persons;  an exchange of ideas or opinions on a particular issue\u2026. with a view to reaching an amicable agreement or settlement. \nI have found this conversation exceedingly frustrating, as I know many have.  Both sides (the original posters and subsequent commenters) have tried to communicate.  There has been a problem, however, and I think I have figured it out.  \nIt is The Big But.  \nIt goes something like this: \nI hear you saying X, Y, and Z\u2026.. BUT you don\u2019t understand A,B,C and you should think A,B,C before X, Y,Z. \nOh, yes, I hear what you are saying about A,B,C, \u2026.. BUT I am concerned about X,Y,Z\u2026. \nA dialogue requires an exchange of ideas with a goal of understanding the other side of the issue and coming to an agreement of some sort.  To do this, we have to start by listening. \n \nlis\u00b7ten : to give attention; attend closely for the purpose of hearing; give ear, to pay attention; heed. \nYou will note that this definition has nothing in it that denotes you speaking or expressing an opinion.  It is merely taking in information.  From listening, you are working toward understanding. \n \nun\u00b7der\u00b7stand : to perceive the meaning of; grasp the idea of; comprehend; to grasp the significance, implications, or importance of. \n \n \nNote that listening and understanding do not necessarily mean agreement.  In fact, listening and understanding have nothing to do with your opinion whatsoever.  Listening and understanding are about the perception of others, which is terribly difficult for us humans (for reasons stated before).   But dialogue will never be successful without close and feverish work toward these two goals.  \nHow do we move toward listening and understanding effectively? \nStop speaking. Yes, you. \nAsk questions without your opinion interjected.  Seek knowledge.  \nWhen you receive an answer, listen.  The moment your brain goes \u201cBut I think\u2026\u201d, stop.  Ask again.  Listen again.  When your brain goes \u201cBut what about\u2026\u201d STOP.  Remember that listening and understanding are not about you.  Understand their position. It is real and valid. You don\u2019t have to agree, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t understand.  And once you truly understand, you can accept.  And you may find common ground. \nYou may be saying\u2026. BUT what about my opinion???  Stop.  \n \ndi\u00b7a\u00b7logue:  a conversation between two or more persons;  an exchange of ideas or opinions on a particular issue\u2026. with a view to reaching an amicable agreement or settlement. \nA true dialogue means you will be asked questions.  Answer them.  Do not rage at the other side.  In fact, as best as possible, do not mention the other side. It puts the recipient on the defensive. Present yours calmly.  Explain what it means to you. Explain what you hope to achieve.  Explain what you need help with.  Be open to educating.  Expect that they may not understand at first.  Be okay with that.

{"date": "Monday, September 26, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n At this point, most regular autism blog readers are probably aware of the exchanges going on at The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism, as well as the various responses by other bloggers. If you would like the directory to showcase your thoughts on this matter, please email me at kwombles@gmail.com and I'll get it up on the directory for you. \n \n \n \n Here's my response: \n \n What We Fight For \n \n \n \nHave I said I've been in the trenches now for two decades, fighting to get what my children need? I get tired of the fight, tired of the battle with the outer world to get the resources needed, and so, when Bobby was nine, after he'd had a stroke, I realized I couldn't battle it all. I was worn out. I was tired of fighting for an appropriate education all while fighting the medical system to get him help, and honestly, all while fighting with him to give him the basic self-help skills that would let him be potty trained, be able to dress himself, bathe, brush his teeth, comb his hair, and eat meals without disasters. I was tired of being up for 36 hour stretches since he wouldn't sleep and was destructo-kid and couldn't be left unattended. Tired, worn, and grieving were the first ten years of my son's life. You know what else they were? Enchanted with his beauty, in love with his smile, delighted when he hugged or cuddled or vocalized anything. As tired as I was, I was completely head over heels for my sweet boy. I made the most of every moment with him, spending long afternoons lying in bed with him, surrounded by his favorite books that we would read over and over, day after day. By the time the girls came along, I'd had a couple years to process his stroke, the real risks of him having another one, and the break from fighting the school system. After his stroke, we brought him home. No more fighting that, no more. It became about teaching him in a safe friendly environment where his psyche was safe, and we resumed those wonderful afternoons surrounded by piles of books. Eventually, after we moved here, next door to my parents, we worked at getting him into the day center where he would have the chance to work on socialization skills with others like him, where he would be safe, accepted, and loved. And if you've read this blog at all, you know what a shining, bright young man he is and how far he's come. He is sweet, opinionated, giving, loving, and he makes a difference daily. He is happy, he is loved, and he contributes. He is my light. \n \n \nafter helping me move into my office last month \n \n \n \nHis sisters shine, as he does. They are my garden girlies, and they never cease to delight and amaze. All three of them adore the others, sit on the couch for our evening sci-fi marathons entwined in each other, the three of them: a grown man who loves to play pokemon and yu-gi-oh with them and who loves them so much that all he can talk about is getting them this $50 video game that he knows they'll love for their birthdays, and these two long-limbed girls: they wrap themselves around each other in complicated pretzels and hug and squeeze and loll on each other in a way my brothers and I would never have done. \n \n \n \nI fight for them. I don't speak for them. I don't speak for anyone but me. I teach them that their voices matter, that who they are is wonderful, perfect, and lovely and that they can be what they want to be if they are willing to work for it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is a difference between fighting for one's children and speaking for them. There is a difference between advocating for equal rights, equal access, and appropriate\u00a0accommodations\u00a0and speaking for others. They have nothing to do with each other. Perhaps people have forgotten that. \n \n \n \nI do not speak for autistic people. I would not even were I an autistic individual. \n \n \n \nI do not speak for parents of children with neurological differences. It is not my place. \n \n \n \nI do not speak for anyone, to replace their voices with my own. \n \n \n \nI speak for me and my experiences as a mother with her own issues and invisible disabilities who safeguards her children and fights for what they need, while working with them to teach them to fight for themselves for what they need.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy experiences and my words in no way negate another person's story or perspective nor does it ride roughshod over their own experiences and words. \n \n \n \nMaybe if people quit worrying about who's speaking for them and spoke for themselves and let others speak for themselves, there'd be less acrimony and accusations. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-we-fight-for.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ju9e-1aqum0/TkQvX6qqQxI/AAAAAAAA1mk/RUrHeuzJnKA/s1600/P8110006.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lbRBRAihMB0/Tn-mByo3k0I/AAAAAAAA2qE/nmouOEuXVao/s1600/P9250085.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/exchanges-ideas-and-chance-to-not-talk.html", "title": "\nExchanges, Ideas, and the Chance to Not Talk Past One Another\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "body": "\n Spectrummy Mummy A is for Advocacy I have decided to begin an A to Z series of postings.  Because I\u2019m the kind of person who just has to start at the beginning, here I am at the letter A.  A is for many things.  A is for Autism and Asperger\u2019s, of course.  A is also for ADHD, another diagnosis for Pudding.  A is for  anxiety , goodness knows I\u2019ve written about that, and hardly covered how it impacts our life.  A is for  auditory processing dysfunction .  I could keep going, but today I\u2019m starting with advocacy. Whenever power cuts and my lousy internet connection have permitted, I\u2019ve been following  the dialogue series between parent-advocates and self-advocates .  I\u2019m glad I have, it has been illuminating, and I\u2019m very glad TGPA  provided this forum to air this most necessary discussion.   Are we as parent-advocates listening enough to what self-advocates are saying?  Can we really be doing so when organizations involving autism research and support don\u2019t consult with adults with autism, effectively barring them from the conversation about them.  Who knows autism better?  Someone who lives with it, or someone who parents a child with the diagnosis?  Both the (ongoing) series of posts, and the many comments have left me with much food for thought. We have to start listening to what adults on the spectrum are saying, and supporting them in their advocacy efforts, particularly when, especially when we as parents don\u2019t like hearing what they have to say.  As was mentioned in the posts and comments, there is a difference between parental advocacy and public advocacy, and it is clear that adults on the spectrum will do a much better role at the centre of the latter.  I plan to embrace my role as supporter and ally, learning when to speak out for my child, and when to listen. I can\u2019t help but think of Pudding, and how she might feel as an adult if her opinions and advocacy efforts were dismissed in favour of mine.  It would be absurd, it would be wrong.  Yet this is the experience of many adults brave enough to advocate in a world that doesn\u2019t welcome them or their opinions.  It is hard, for us as parents who have nurtured and protected our dependent children to relinquish that role as our children age.  I saw it in several families when I worked as a carer.  I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll struggle with it too, as most parents do.  My job is to help Pudding become as independent as possible, even independent of me. Pudding herself as an independent streak running through her.  If she is able to do something herself, she will do it, and refuse any assistance.  Our efforts as parents lie in encouraging and motivating her to do those things that she struggles with, many of which will be necessary for independent living.  Her current educational/therapeutic program features some intensive occupational therapy.  She makes a game effort, but sometimes the tasks are just too much for her. One day last week I collected her from school, and her teacher informed me with a smile that Pudding had been \u201cnon-compliant\u201d during a challenging activity.  Struggling to find the right words to tell her she needed a break, she told the teacher that she (Pudding) was naughty and needed a time out.  Her school has a calm room with a ball pit and swings, and her teacher directed her there for as long as she needed.  We\u2019ve established goals for speech therapy to learn the phrases to say when she has had enough, and we continue in occupational therapy to find ways to help Pudding learn what helps her to regulate when her senses are overloaded. My girl is fortunate enough to be in a place where she can assert herself, and she will be listened to and respected for it.  I only hope that I can say the same thing when she gets older.  As parents, we don\u2019t have to wait to start listening, not when there are adults struggling to be heard right now.  It might be the greatest act of advocacy we can perform. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://spectrummymummy.com/", "http://spectrummymummy.com/2011/04/29/anxiety/", "http://spectrummymummy.com/2010/10/12/discord-and-harmony/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-one.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/spectrummy-mummy-is-for-advocacy.html", "title": "\nSpectrummy Mummy: A is for Advocacy\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n This morning, we're featuring  Autism & Oughtisms'  post. If you have a post you'd like to offer for the directory concerning your thoughts about advocacy and dialogues between the different segments of the autism community, please send it to kwombles@gmail.com and I'll get it up. Thank you--KWombles \n \n \n \n What\nare you talking about? Of Whales, Ripples, and Advocacy. \n \n \n \n Like many others, I have been marvelling at\nthe unproductiveness of the Self-Advocate/Parent Dialogues over at TPGTA. But I\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s a simple failure of compassion of either side (though there\u2019s\ndefinitely some of that going on). Rather, I see a conversation that doesn\u2019t\nknow what it\u2019s even talking about. \n \n \n \n On the surface it is a meta-discussion,\npleading for parents of autistic children, and adults on the spectrum, to\nlisten to each other. But the validity of the complaint \u2013 that one side isn\u2019t\nlistening to the other \u2013 is undercut by a lack of concrete examples to ground\nthe discussion. This is incredibly important, because in some areas the\nexperiences and insights of people with autism are highly relevant and a unique\nand much-needed resource. In other areas, the fact that they have autism is an\ninteresting piece of information but does not give their opinions or\nexperiences more weight. \n \n If the topic under discussion is \u201cbringing\nup a child who has autism\u201d, then parenting experience is relevant, but again is\nnot the be-all-end-all. It\u2019s important to consider the experience and training\nof the person we are listening to, but someone can also talk perfect sense and\nhave eye-opening insights despite a lack of training or experience (though this\nwill be rare with something so life-changing and important as parenting). If we\nwant a completely informed opinion we might seek out someone who is autistic\nthemselves, raising an autistic child, and has training relevant to both\nparenting and autism. But that\u2019s a rarity. And even if you found such an icon,\ntheir religious, political or other beliefs might so strongly impact on their\nadvice that it would have always run counter to how you would have raised your own\nchild. \n \n \n So though we\u2019d like to always hear from\nthose who tick all the right boxes, we must always at the end pay attention to\nthe strength of their arguments: The accuracy of their premises, the validity\nof their logic, the soundness of the conclusion they draw. If their premises\ninclude \u2013 for example \u2013\u00a0 the experience\nof someone living with very mild autism, and the conclusions we are\nspecifically seeking are ones about the best lives for severely autistic\nchildren, then that particular premise might seem absolutely key \u00a0in the scheme of things. If the conclusion\nwe\u2019re looking for though is one about the way the autistic mind generally\ncomprehends and interacts with the world, then the severity of autism might not\nbe nearly as important, and the mere experience of living as an autistic person\nwould be highly relevant and carry that much more weight. \n \n \n There are both autistic people, and those\nwithout autism, who (as an example of a divisive issue) want a cure and wish\nautism didn\u2019t exist. There are also those with and without autism who see\nautism as a gift and an inherently beautiful aspect of an individual (that\nneeds nurturing and support, rather than denial and destruction). There is\nnothing inherent in the \u201chaving of autism\u201d that means you will feel one way or\nthe other on an issue like this. There may be majorities involved (for example,\na majority of autistic people might embrace and cherish their autism), but all\nthat tells you is \u201cwe have a majority here.\u201d That matters in democracies, sure,\nbut never to the extent that we don\u2019t care about or don\u2019t want to hear other\nopinions. Majorities are also irrelevant to certain issues and questions, for\nexample, a majority of the population may say autistic people completely lack\nempathy if they were asked such a thing, but that doesn\u2019t make it true. \n \n \n Again, you see that if we don\u2019t know\nexactly what we\u2019re talking about \u2013 attitudes, opinions, or facts \u2013 then it is\nalmost impossible to expect agreement at a meta-level about \u201clistening to each\nother.\u201d Since those engaged with that meta-debate might all agree that\nlistening is great, but still get nowhere because the examples and consequences\nthey have in mind as they converse, colour and motivate responses that\notherwise appear un-necessarily aggressive. It\u2019s like an unseen whale moving\nunder the ocean surface. You can see the ocean is unsettled, and talk about how\nbad that looks when you were expecting and hoping for calm waters, but unless\nyou look under the ocean surface to study and understand the cause, you won\u2019t\nmake any progress. \n \n \n Even if we take one of the clearer instances\nof what someone is addressing in such \u201cself-advocate / parenting\u201d dialogues \u2013\nperhaps they\u2019re focused on attitudes around the advocacy for disability rights\n\u2013 relevant information is glossed over. Are we talking about advocacy for what\nsupports and services parents of disabled children receive; what their children\nreceive directly; or what adult autistics receive? In one of those cases the\nparents need to be heard the loudest, and in another it\u2019s the autistic adults\nthemselves.  \n \n \n Furthermore, the agenda (for example,\nfocusing on parents or autistic adults) may be completely outside of the\ncontrol of the warring parties. Sometimes the agenda reflects a particular concern\nat that point in time; maybe children are being focused on because it\u2019s \u201cInternational\nDay of the Child\u201d or \u201cMother\u2019s Day.\u201d Getting angry at others for utilising a\nplatform they didn\u2019t even create, seems misguided. As do attacks along the\nlines of \u201cyou\u2019ve (as a group) had your say, you\u2019ve been heard, now it\u2019s our\nturn.\u201d The voices of people affected by autism, are not mutually exclusive. One\nis the voice of a parent raising an autistic child (whether that parent is NT\nor ASD, or somewhere in between). Another is a voice of an autistic adult.\nEither trying to say the other voice is less important or less relevant \u2013 at\nleast, without a very clear context to establish the relevance and importance \u2013\nis confused and unhelpful to say the least. \n \n \n I\u2019m not saying we can\u2019t have such\nmeta-debates, where we talk about advocacy and relationships between those\naffected by autism; not at all. What I am saying is that where we see high\nemotion and lack of progress, it makes sense to try to introduce as clearly as\npossible what people are actually talking about; what examples and issues they\nhave in mind. What I see is rational dedicated adults passionately agreeing on\nthe importance of listening, while arguing on the largely unspoken subtext (the\ndetails and precise issues), in ways that bleed into the \u201clistening\u201d issue;\nmaking the disagreement a difficult beast to understand or pin-down, and making\nit last longer and stronger than it has to.  \n \n It\u2019s hard to have meaningful dialogue about\nthe ripples across the ocean, if you don\u2019t talk about the wind, the currents\nand the whales that make those ripples. Only once we tease apart what we\u2019re\nprecisely talking about, can we figure out where the disagreements lie and why.\nAnd since I simply don\u2019t see that occurring over at the Dialogues (yet), I am\npersonally weary about getting involved on that platform. I\u2019d be just another\nunder-explained ripple, trying to change the course of the ocean around me. \n \n \n \n Autism\n& Oughtisms  (http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/\n) \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/autism-oughtisms-what-are-you-talking.html", "title": "\nAutism  & Oughtisms: What are you talking about?

{"date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Continuing our posting of bloggers' thoughts on the dialogue between advocates and parents, here is Rachel's post from today. \n \n A Protest March is Not Dialogue \n \nby Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg \n \n \n I\u2019ve been doing some more thinking about the Self-Advocate/Parent Dialogues on\u00a0 The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism . \n \n \n \nLike many people, I\u2019ve felt frustrated, angry, and saddened by what I\u2019ve watched go on there. And I\u2019m realizing that it\u2019s because, each day, I show up wanting peaceful dialogue, and each day, I find myself in the middle of a protest march that keeps turning into a brawl. It feels exactly like wandering into a demonstration and counter-demonstration in which the police barricades, put in place to keep people from tearing one another apart, keep getting overrun. \n \nMaybe it\u2019s just me (and judging from the events of the past week, I\u2019m beginning to think that it may very well be just me), but there are things that I\u2019ve always expected from a dialogue, and that I\u2019ve always assumed were both necessary and reasonable: \n \n Expressions of respect for the other party \n \n \n Listening and responding rather than reacting \n \n \n Speaking with civility, even in the midst of great anger \n \n \n Asking questions that go to the heart of intent \n \n \n Equal time and representation for both sides to express their perspectives \n \n \n Care and concern for individuals across division \n \n \n An ability to acknowledge errors on both sides \n \n \nBut here are the things that I\u2019m seeing in the The Dialogues: \n \n Yelling. And I mean yelling that happens IN ALL CAPS because otherwise, MAYBE other people won\u2019t KNOW how WRONG they OBVIOUSLY ARE. \n \n \n People taking their pain out on one another. I see parents doing it because they feel stressed and abandoned and get to do it everywhere else in the autism world, and I see autistics doing it because they feel stressed and abandoned and never get to do it anywhere else in the autism world. On behalf of both parties, it hurts me to watch. \n \n \n Accusations of ill-intent along the lines of \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to derail the conversation,\u201d as though accusing someone of derailing the conversation \u2014 rather than bringing the conversation back on point \u2014 isn\u2019t derailing the conversation. \n \n \n Lots and lots of sentences beginning with \u201cYou,\u201d such as \u201cYou just refuse to understand\u201d and \u201cYou need to park your privilege at the door\u201d and \u201cYou have no right to be upset about whatever it is you\u2019re upset about, because it\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d \n \n \nAnyone here ever try to carry on a relationship in which both parties start every sentence with \u201cyou\u201d rather than with \u201cI\u201d? It doesn\u2019t go well. Telling the other person everything he or she has done wrong, over and over, instead of talking about its impact on you and what you want to see change, usually doesn\u2019t get you very far. It\u2019s quite cathartic, but in the end, it damages the relationship, and then there is repair work to do on top of the problems that were there in the first place. \n \n People laughing derisively at each other, judging each other, attacking each other, and accusing each other of saying things they never said and meaning things they never meant. \n \n \n People treating one another as walking incarnations of all of life\u2019s injustices, rather than as actual people with feelings and thoughts and tears. It\u2019s easy to take a swipe at an incarnation of life\u2019s injustices. It\u2019s quite a bit more difficult to do it when you realize that a person is standing in front of you. \n \n \n People getting their feelings trampled underfoot on the road to \u2014 what? Making life better for all of us? Excellent. But there\u2019s one little problem: I\u2019m not all that interested in creating change with people who think that\u2019s the way to go about it \u2014 for the simple reason that I fear for what the world will look like when we get there. \n \n \n People being unable to acknowledge any wrongdoing, either because they\u2019re oppressed and the wrongs done them are so much worse than what they\u2019ve done to others, or because as long as the cause is right, who cares? So, unlike most people who seem to have moved on as though nothing happened, I\u2019m still pissed as hell at what happened to Emily, and I\u2019m still waiting for someone else to sober up and say, \u201cMy God, we\u2019re so sorry. You didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d And I can feel, in my bones, just how irrelevant people seem to think that is. Who cares about Emily when we\u2019re talking about oppression? \n \n \nI do. It\u2019s not that I think that Emily is still hurting. It\u2019s the failure to take responsibility that concerns me so much. If we can\u2019t engage in self-reflection and mend things that are broken in our community, how can we have a prayer of mending a broken world? \n \nI\u2019m having memories of my days in Berkeley, when I\u2019d go to gatherings about social justice issues, hoping to listen to a few speakers and have a reasoned discussion, only to watch people yell and punch holes in walls and talk about how it wasn\u2019t such a big deal because people were suffering in the world. Yeah, the wall doesn\u2019t suffer, but the people in the room who watch it happen do. It\u2019s scary, it\u2019s intimidating, and it\u2019s not conducive to dialogue. \n \nNow, I can hear the objections to everything I\u2019m saying here: \u201cWell, we\u2019re oppressed. You can\u2019t expect us to be civil and well-spoken about it. There is too much at stake. And besides, we\u2019re angry. And besides, why don\u2019t you talk about what we\u2019re saying rather than about how we\u2019re saying it?\u201d \n \nAll I can say is that, in a protest march, or in a diatribe, you have to yell and say what you have to say, however you want to say it. And I share your suffering, and I share your desire to be loud about it, and I want change to happen right now, just as you do. I\u2019m a member of two minority groups that have suffered bitterly for generations upon generations, so I can hardly be accused of not getting it. \n \nBut a dialogue involves something very different. A dialogue involves saying things in a way that other people can hear them. This is not an argument from tone. This is a realistic appraisal of how to work around people\u2019s defenses and get them to hear us so that we can make change. We can\u2019t get people to listen to us by telling them that we\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong, over and over. They\u2019ll either put up their defenses and start beating up on us in the same way, or they\u2019ll go away altogether. Either way, we\u2019ve lost much-needed allies. \n \nWhen I look at history, I see oppressed people creating change by forming alliances with the majority, and by doing it in a way that takes the moral high ground. The civil rights movement finally had its day because Martin Luther King, Jr. invited white folk to join him in taking that moral high ground. You had people who had watched their loved ones lynched and raped, but they came together, in the spirit of peaceful dialogue and a yearning for justice, with representatives of the privileged class whose members had done the lynching and raping. \n \nThat\u2019s what I keep hoping for: that we carry this forward with some discipline, some respect for the perspective of the other, and some trust that we can make change by being the change we want to see.

It\u2019s on.\u00a0 Suddenly offering an alternative viewpoint is seen as completely invalidating how the first person feels.\u00a0 Further, by pointing that out to the second person, their feelings are completely invalidated too.\u00a0 Self advocates are shouted down for being too capable and not understanding what it is to parent a child with a disability.\u00a0 Parent advocates are shouted down for being too capable not understanding what it is to be a person with a disability. \n \nWhat about disabled parents of disabled children?\u00a0 Well, if they\u2019re like me, they\u2019re often caught in the middle.\u00a0 To many in both groups, I\u2019m not disabled enough to warrant listening to, and neither are my children.\u00a0 We become invisible.\u00a0 For those disabled parents of disabled children who are not like me, I\u2019m not sure where they fall.\u00a0\u00a0 I suspect that many have refrained from commenting, just as I have.\u00a0 And that\u2019s too bad if you think about it.\u00a0 They are the only people in the unique position of knowing exactly what it is to be disabled and\u00a0 what it is to parent a child with a disability.\u00a0 They should be the\u00a0 E.F. Huttons \u00a0in the conversation.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say that we shouldn\u2019t be listening to everybody, but that\u2019s just it.\u00a0 We\u2019re not listening to everybody. \u00a0 In fact, sometimes it appears that no one is listening to anyone. \n \nI used to think if everyone could just calm down, and enter the conversation seeking first to understand rather than to be understood, we would be able to come together for our common purpose.\u00a0 I no longer believe that.\u00a0 People seem either unwilling or unable these days to really listen.\u00a0 Everyone is just quietly waiting to talk. \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSo when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.\u201d Jiddu Krishnamurti \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lifeintheaspiehouse.wordpress.com/author/lhand0124/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc2GpmLx82k"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/showcase-laura-of-life-in-house-that.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Laura of Life in the House that Asperger Built\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 29, 2011", "body": "\n JESSICA \u00a0 \n \n Social Thinking \n \nDuring the summer I came across \"Social Thinking\", which was coined by Michelle Garcia Winner. Basically, social thinking is the ability to think oneself from a social perspective. In order to develop social skills, one must have evolved social thinking process. As an Aspergian, I constantly have to use my intellect to ensure that I practice appropriate social skills, which does not come naturally to me. Having sufficient appropriate social skills took me years to master and through trial-and-error. I was not diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome until age 30, so a lot of my social skills blunders were painful and frustrating. There did not seem to be a \"manual\" on how to navigate oneself in the social world. Now, I am 31 years old and have looked back in my life. It really amazes me that I have had\u00a0expended so much mental energy in figuring out the social world without any form of guidance. Hopefully that the current generation will benefit from a wide-range of resources related to social thinking. There are an abundance of books that would assist a socially-challenged individual with their navigation. However, one must remember that the social world is everchanging and evolving. What may have worked at one time may not be appropriate for a \"similar\", but different time. The most painful lesson that I had to learn was to accept that people's behaviour are \"illogical\". No matter what people said or have done, NEVER criticize them. They will take offense by it despite your good intentions. I've faced so many angry and frustrated people were deeply hurt by my \"critical\" comments. My intention was to \"point out\" why they were in their current situation. I wasn't trying to cause harm to them, but unfortunately my blunt approach wasn't taken graciously. I have a cause-and-effect type of thinking, which makes it difficult for me to stop myself from thinking of causes for current scenarios. Social thinking is an important skill to develop in order to survive in the neurotypical world. No matter how much you want to avoid or disregard the importance of social skills, you will not be taken seriously if you do not attempt to develop it. You must consider it as equal to your special interests. Consider learning about social thinking as a process to improve yourself as an individual. The more you learn about social thinking, the more you can find appropriate resources to assist you in becoming more socially competent. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aslaspergirl.blogspot.com/2011/09/social-thinking.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/showcase-jessica-of-aslaspergirl.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Jessica of ASLAspergirl\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n It's been two weeks of dialogues at TPGA. As we each work to figure out what it means to be a part of this community and where the boundaries are, I thought I'd share my latest from Countering. --KWombles \n \n Thought I'd Visit...Don't Get Around Much Anymore \n \n \n \n \"My mind's more at ease, but nevertheless, why stir up memories?\" And ain't that the truth? I don't get around to many blogs anymore, too many papers to grade, and an ever earlier and earlier bedtime as I find myself worn out. Some nights I beat the girls to bed, and am grateful that Rick shoulders the bedtime duty. I miss some of my blogging buddies, those women and men whose lives I got to share in, but I don't miss the drama of visiting places that are angry, hostile places. What I have read, though, are the dialogues at TPGA, some of the comments, and many of the posts written by other bloggers in response to those posts and comments. We've been putting those blog posts over at the directory as I'm able to find time to contact the blog writers and get their permission. If I haven't gotten around to you and you've written one, email me and I'll get it up. When I started blogging in 2009, the autism community seemed to be clearly divided into two vocal camps: neurodiversity followers versus those who believed autism was caused by vaccines. The neurodiversity camp also lined up in opposition to autistic adults who very much want a cure for their autism. Of course, that's an oversimplification, but those were the factions I was initially exposed to. It was easier to find a place, in some ways, because you were immediately routed to one camp or the other based on what you thought about vaccines. I made several close friends in the midst of blogging, advocating, and trying to make a difference. I made some enemies, too. I acted intemperately at times. I stumbled, occasionally, and I learned a lot. I lost some friends, too, people who quit blogging, or who retreated when something besides vaccines popped up and revealed that there was another line that could create a divide. The directory that Kathleen and I run, the bloggers we've met through that, has changed my views, tempered my opinions, and led me to react differently than I did back in the summer of 2009. You can't practice inclusion, read hundreds of people with a variety of beliefs and experiences and not come away changed. What I learned from reading parents who believe a multitude of things that differ from my own beliefs is that they write to reach out, to get comfort, to know they are not alone. Adults on the spectrum write for the same reasons. We all want the same basic things: acceptance, appreciation, accommodation, and to know that when needed, people will act on our behalf for our benefit. Far too often, they don't find this, even in a community where we should have an abundance of experiences that should lock us together in solidarity. And yet, it often doesn't. Far too often there is rancor and strife and instead of making people's lives easier, we make them harder. Instead of finding comfort, we find drama. Perhaps we could all spend a little more time asking what we bring to the equation: comfort or drama. And if I've brought you drama in the past, I'm sorry. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/09/thought-id-visitdont-get-around-much.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/09/thought-id-visitdont-get-around-much.html", "title": "\nThought I'd Visit...Don't Get Around Much Anymore\n"},

Hooker , or any of the other shows Shatner has done over the last five decades), reading Shatner's latest book is a bright spot, a delight. If you pop for the kindle version, you can even listen to Shatner read it (which I may very well have to do!). \n \n \n \nShatner's book is an easy read, flowing gently and meandering as it suited him. Shatner makes the rules. At 80, he remains humorous and charming. He's also pretty damn frank in this book, too, and if you think he feels fondly about George Takei and Nichelle Nichols, you'd be wrong. Thirty some years of the mutterings of his co-stars has had its effect, and he doesn't mince words. He also points out how stupid that kind of emnity is given their advanced ages and how they could better use their time. \n \n \n \nIf there's one thing that's abundantly clear it is that time is something Shatner uses to its fullest. He's a busy man, even at 80, and making the most of his time. It's inspiring to read and see that 80 can be even busier than 40, filled with good work, good friends, and close family. \n \n \n \nShatner is bluster and swagger and primal male, still. But Bill, he's a nice guy, a family guy, and a gentleman. I like them both very much. \n \n \n \nIt was a lovely book to read, and Lily's excited to read it next. We love Shatner in this house, no matter what his age or what he's playing in. All the Shatners in one evening is fun to do, and Rosie was disappointed when\u00a0 Shit My Dad Says \u00a0was canceled. She adored watching Star Trek and then diving into the new show when it came on. Neither girl ever worried or wondered over the marvel of seeing a young William Shatner and an old William Shatner. All they cared was that it was Shatner. \n \n \n \n \n \nHere's to hoping for another twenty productive years, Bill. You rock! I grew up watching you, am growing old watching you, and am honored to watch my children grow up watching you act, listening to your music, and reading your books (TekWar and the Star Trek books!). You have shaped me and permeated my life. When I'm down I listen to\u00a0 The Transformed Man . Thank you for your contributions. You'll always be the best Star Trek captain. :) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KpgpNdArKMo/Tp4NjXG_xcI/AAAAAAAA3CY/6hYaVJsTOZw/s1600/PA180098.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/10/shatner-will-always-always-rule.html", "title": "\nShatner Will Always, Always Rule\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "body": "\n \u00a0  This week, I had the pleasure\u00a0of interviewing Ilene from  My Family's Experience with Autism . \u00a0It is a very straight forward and honest blog-sometimes funny-sometimes hard. ( Here is one of her favorite  posts ). I think that it would be worth your time to go and check it out.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n 1)\u00a0 Tell us about yourself.....likes, dislikes, favorite things to do....silliest thing you've ever done...where do you see yourself 20 years from now.....what would you tell yourself (if you could) 20 years ago? \n I've always been a very goal oriented person.\u00a0 I always had my to-do lists and would get things done.\u00a0 I guess you can call me a go-getter.\u00a0 And I still am.\u00a0 I volunteer for things even though I know I don't have the time for it because I know I can figure out a way to \"squeeze it in\".\u00a0 And I had my life planned out.\u00a0 Then life actually happened.\u00a0 20 years ago, I always figured I'd be one of those who had it all.....family, career, the perfect balance.\u00a0 And it worked for a while.\u00a0 When I had 1 child, balancing career and family was (reasonably) easy.\u00a0 Then after the twins were born, everything changed and I chose to stop working and become a Stay At Home Mom.\u00a0 And I have NEVER regretted that decision.\u00a0 And, given what's happened, I'm extremely happy I went that route because I don't know how I could balance a career working in medical research (what I had been doing) and autism in the home.\u00a0 My life became more predictable.\u00a0 My life became a schedule.\u00a0 I'm not saying that's a bad thing.....change often isn't a bad thing and just because things turn out differently than expected doesn't make it a failure.\u00a0 But there have been times where I wish I could have told myself in the past that things don't always work out as you plan.\u00a0 And sometimes, you need to follow the path as it lays out in front of you to see where it leads....you never know what you may find down an unexpected detour...... I really am quite a boring person.\u00a0 I always did what others expected from me, not really because it was expected but because I wasn't daring enough to push those boundaries.\u00a0 I like relaxing with my family and traveling to tropical locations.\u00a0 I love going snorkeling in the Caribbean and downhill skiing (not that I've done either of these in ages).\u00a0 I have hobbies that allow me to sit while watching TV including crocheting and knitting and I enjoy avoiding having to play (unsuccessfully, of course) the made-up games of my typical 6-year old.\u00a0 The silliest thing I've ever done is sing karaoke while vacationing and even in front of my in-laws in a bar after my brother-in-law's wedding (you have to know this when I say that's silly -- I CAN'T SING!!!!!).\u00a0 I went to college then graduate school and then went to work.\u00a0 I married for love and we've been together for over 13 years and have 3 wonderful children to show for it.\u00a0 Boring, predictable me....I guess that prepared me for what was to come.\u00a0 I now HAVE to be predictable.\u00a0 I MUST be a steady rock for my kids so they know what to expect.\u00a0 Things in this world change.\u00a0 But \"Mom\" can't.\u00a0 She is always the same.\u00a0 And because of that, at this moment, I can't imagine where I will be in 20 years.\u00a0 I just hope that my kids will be capable of being on their own so that I will have some of the freedom at that point that I currently lack. Autism HAS taken over my life.\u00a0 Even when I'm not with my children, I'm thinking about the subject.\u00a0 Either of my own kids or about advocacy.\u00a0 I \"admin\" a Facebook page ( http://www.facebook.com/CareAutism ) and am trying to start a career as a parent advocate, even though I'm not fully sure what it means.\u00a0 I have used my blog to cope with what I learn, to educate others, to vent or brag about things that are happening, and it's another one of those things that is often just on my mind.\u00a0 New opportunities for me to reach out about autism from a Mom's perspective keep cropping up and I can't turn them down.\u00a0 I've actually made Autism Awareness a personal mission for myself -- I need for people to GET IT!!!! (2)\u00a0 What's it like having twins?\u00a0 Especially after having one child?\u00a0 Was it a shock?\u00a0 Was it overwhelming?\u00a0 Has it gotten easier as they have gotten older?\u00a0 How did you oldest son deal with all of a sudden having 2 siblings? I was already freaking out about having kids close in age BEFORE learning I was expecting twins.\u00a0 My brother and I are nearly 8 years apart as are my mother and uncle (with no one in between). THAT is what I was used to.\u00a0 Then when I was told that I was carrying twins (at 6 weeks pregnant), my first reaction (other than holding to the table for dear life) was \"I CAN'T BE HAVING TWINS -- I HAVE A NEARLY 15 MONTH OLD AT HOME\", like that was going to change reality.\u00a0 But honestly, once I got over that shock and had some time to prepare, I really like the idea.\u00a0 They all have playmates (of a sort).\u00a0 They grow up together and my older son doesn't even remember life without his brother and sister.\u00a0 I think, for HIM, the fact that we had to leave them in the NICU for a few days really helped.....I was gone and then came home a few days later. He got to see pictures of his brother and sister before they came home and changed his life.\u00a0 By the time we were all under the same roof, he was ready for it all.\u00a0 But one thing's for sure -- parenting multiples is NOT the same as parenting singles.\u00a0 Not that it's harder, or more demanding.....it's just DIFFERENT.\u00a0 Having kids close in age isn't quite the same thing.\u00a0 I wouldn't change it for the world, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to be a mom to both a singleton and a pair of twins.\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Were you surprised with the ASD diagnosis for your twins?\u00a0 How did that change your perspective on life and on parenting? For Simon, not really.\u00a0 The subject had been brought up at least once before about 6 months before we learned the truth, and even though I wasn't ready to hear it or accept it, I think the thought was growing in my mind, even if I didn't realize it.\u00a0 When we were first asked if we wanted an autism work-up done on him, that just seemed like the right thing to do.\u00a0 And we might as well do it for Rachel to, not that we have anything to worry about.\u00a0 WOW!!!!!\u00a0 Was I ever wrong!!!!\u00a0\u00a0 A month later (approximately), a developmental pediatrician told me they were BOTH on the spectrum.\u00a0 I was upset about Simon of course, but learning about Rachel was just devastating!!!!! Looking back, everything was there.\u00a0 The behaviors, the lack of eye contact, the lack of interest in others...but I never saw it.\u00a0 I think it took until we started seeing success with ABA approximately 6 months later before I truly realized that she was also autistic and not just Simon, even though I was able to say it to others.\u00a0 And when the school psychologist AND the developmental pediatrician at Kennedy Krieger told us that both of them had \"Severe Autism\", it was another shock. Learning something like this DEFINITELY changed my parenting style and many other aspects of my life.\u00a0 What I was doing wasn't working.\u00a0 My older son who is not at all on the spectrum is a very independent learner.\u00a0 He loves to be with his friends and work in groups.\u00a0 He loves playing sports.\u00a0 All these things that when you become a parent, you expect to see in your children.\u00a0 When you learn about an autism diagnosis, you realize that YOU have to step in to make these things happen.\u00a0 YOU have to force the eye contact -- they don't seek it on their own.\u00a0 YOU have to encourage them to want to communicate, because (again) it won't happen on its own.\u00a0 YOU have to teach them how to interact with others.\u00a0 YOU have to be the example that would normally be set by their peers because they won't seek out their peers, but can't avoid YOU.\u00a0 YOU have to slow down and take things step by step.\u00a0 It changes YOU and often makes you appreciate all the wonders around you. YOU have to work through the sensory aversions and determine what you want them to appreciate.\u00a0 YOU have to learn to speak their language because, even if they are verbal, their ability to express feelings is slow to develop.\u00a0 You always have to read \"between the lines\". It also taught me that I have to learn to advocate for them.\u00a0 I have ideas of what they need; of where they should be; of what they should be able to do.\u00a0 And it's MY responsibility to make sure they are in an environment that will allow them to succeed.\u00a0 I searched for 2 years to find a dance class that can accommodate my daughter.\u00a0 I finally found it this fall and she is taking a dance class.\u00a0 And she LOVES it!!!!!\u00a0 She looks forward to it all week long!!!!!\u00a0 And I pat myself on the back because I made this happen for her.\u00a0 I kept looking.\u00a0 I kept asking questions.\u00a0 I convinced someone to develop a program to allow for kids with her unique needs and abilities to have a place they can go, just to dance -- something that all little girls should have the chance to do.\u00a0 And it has driven me to want to become a parent advocate professionally. (4)\u00a0 What would you tell a parent new to diagnosis? I would tell them that this is not the end.\u00a0 Not by any means.\u00a0 This is just a new opportunity to help your child now that you know that he or she doesn't think or learn in the same way that was originally thought.\u00a0 People with autism do learn.\u00a0 People with autism do feel compassion and empathy.\u00a0 People with autism just see the world a bit differently.\u00a0 I would also remind them that they are seeing the same person today that they saw yesterday, before learning that they were on the spectrum.\u00a0 They were loved before, they are loved now.\u00a0 It's just now you realize how special they are and that they need you to address things in a different way.\u00a0 I have learned more from my children because I have been forced to see things from their perspective.\u00a0 I have learned to slow down.\u00a0 I have learned to embrace every little detail.\u00a0 I have learned to SEE every little detail because that's what they need for me to show them if they are to understand what I am trying to teach them.\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 What is the most important thing you would want people to know about your family? That we are simply a family.\u00a0 We live together -- Mom, Dad, 3 kids, and a dog.\u00a0 We love each other.\u00a0 We fight amongst each other.\u00a0 We run around like crazy people to accommodate the Saturday extra-curricular activities.\u00a0 And we live with the reality of Autism.\u00a0 We have our good days and our \"A-days\", or at least our \"A-moments\".\u00a0 Everything we do is based on a routine.\u00a0 We can no longer be spontaneous.\u00a0 Even if it appears to be that we are doing something spur-of-the-moment, we previously planned for it.\u00a0 We thought out the pros and cons.\u00a0 We thought about how we would handle potential meltdowns.\u00a0 We have the goldfish or the gummy bears in a bag in my pocket, to be pulled out if the need arises.\u00a0 And our lives have continued, thanks GREATLY to the Big Brother!!!!! But most importantly, WE ARE A FAMILY! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://myfamilysexperiencewithautism.blogspot.com/", "http://myfamilysexperiencewithautism.blogspot.com/2011/07/3-amazing-words.html", "http://www.facebook.com/CareAutism"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/10/showcase-ilene-from-my-familys.html", "title": "\nShowcase--Ilene from \"My Family's Experience with Autism\"\n"},

Your life..your favorite things to eat..favorite things to do.. I am the mum of a 6 year old child with autism and apraxia. \u00a0I work full time in Consumer Insights. Between work and life and autism life is very full . But its also very good\u00a0 \u00a0I am married to the love of my life. He is a Stay at home dad and is one of those people that know how to do everything!\u00a0 I grew up in India \u2013 my dad is a doctor and he was in the army. I \u00a0grew up in a very close-knit \u00a0family with my mum, dad and sister. I had a lovely childhood living all over \u00a0the hidden India \u2013 lots of splendid \u00a0small places with unpronounceable names\u00a0 I have too many \u00a0favorite things to eat ( the reason for my cosy appearance) \u2013 but among the top are the street foods of Delhi, red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese icing, chocolate mousse and the \u00a0fluffy down-comforter like cheese omelets my husband makes\u00a0 I am fickle with my favorite things \u2013 but top favorites currently are Fall, Southern small towns like the one I live in , \u00a0French Press Coffee, the color red , murder mysteries, happy stories \u00a0, psychology, bloggers, blogging, picture windows, yoga pants, basil, Facetime and of course playing with R,\u00a0 \n 2)  Your blog reads like lovely poetry. \u00a0Even when you are talking about the hard things. Tell us about your style of writing...is it easy to do? \u00a0It is so free flowing and yet exact.. Thank you for the lovely compliments in your question . I am all ablush. It\u2019s not only very easy , but the only way I know how to write. One of the most important choices in life, is what \u00a0we choose to pay attention to.\u00a0 Depending on perspective, life really can be quite luminous( sometimes, even when its on the surface quite hard )\u00a0 I think that gets reflected in what I write about which is why my blog has a \u00a0happy feel to it\u00a0 \n 3)  What do you think about autism-the way the world (general public) perceives it..the way you see it...the way your son sees it? I think that there is a lot of confusion around autism because \u00a0there is no \u00a0one autism \u2013 There are many autisms \u2013 with the only commonality in all the autisms having social and language challenges Some of the debate in the autism community can get almost acrimonious, but often we are talking of different autisms.\u00a0 On top of that our coping mechanism varies greatly. \u00a0If my child is suffering and I am the warrior type \u2013 I will have a certain way of dealing with it. Versus if my child is quite happy and I am the zen type I will have another way ( and all the permutations and combinations within these extremes ) I have become very very tolerant of other parents\u2019 attitudes towards their children\u2019s autism as long as they love and respect their children.\u00a0 Its hurts me when I hear parents \u201cventing\u201d about their child in front of their child assuming that just because their child cannot speak \u2013 they don\u2019t understand about feeling like a burden. I wish parents would look at their autistic children and think about the strengths they have and not compare them with neurotypical children.\u00a0 Like they say, if you measure a fish\u2019s abilities by how well it can fly \u2013 you will always see the fish as a failure. I and DH (him particularly) have a very accepting attitude towards autism.\u00a0 Though R gets a lot of therapy and help \u00a0\u2013 we have never thought in terms of curing autism.\u00a0 In fact, we don\u2019t really think of what he has anymore \u2013 we just think about what he needs. We have really questioned a lot of the models of looking at autism-\u00a0 Autism is not a shell through which R needs to break through. Autism does not preclude independence. Becoming normal is not the only way to be happy. Doing well in school does not mean doing well in life ( and vice versa ). And that a successful life has many versions etcetera The general public is very aware of autism \u2013 things are so different than they used to be. We can sometimes rail against public ignorance \u2013 but really things are so much better than they used to be ( remember \u201crefrigerator mother\u201d days \u00a0).\u00a0 Our friends have really been amazing and accepting of R \u2013 autism and all- so we have been real lucky with that In terms of how R sees himself - I don\u2019t know if R really sees himself as very different or if he knows he has autism. He has had lots of therapy since he was 26 months old and takes hard work \u00a0as a regular part of life He probably has a high opinion of himself. He is being raised by a very adoring family.\u00a0 We don\u2019t really plan on having \u201cthe talk\u201d( about autism ) \u00a0\u2013 because we want him to see it as just another part of him. But sort of tell him casually. And we don\u2019t ever want him to think that there is anything wrong with him.\u00a0 Often its not the condition, but what we think about the condition that causes the real pain in life 4.)  What is the most important thing you would want people to know about your son...your family?: I think the main thing about my family is love\u00a0 DH and I are very dissimilar on the surface \u2013\u2013but \u00a0where it really counts \u00a0- we are very similar.\u00a0 We have 3 or 4 organizing principles.\u00a0 We do our best to be happy , we always prioritize love and caring in many of the things we do , we remember to be grateful\u00a0 About R, I and his therapists call him our Human Prozac. \u00a0He is bright, hardworking \u00a0and sweet and loving . He is an amazing person and I thank god that he was given to me . \n \n \n \n Dances With Rain \n Last evening DH and I are settling into watch Medium (a show where a psychic finds suspects by dreams)\u00a0 DH and I always castigate the show. Me from a Feminist standpoint (how \u00a0come the only crime show where the woman is the main protagonist, is one where she catches criminals, not by her brains but by her \"feminine intuition\" \u00a0)\u00a0 DH from a lack of logic from the spirits (\u00a0 if the dead people spirits want her to find the suspect why do they not tell her the whole story in the first dream- why do it in installments? ). Additionally her family is always on the brink of some crisis or another which provides plenty of opportunities for joint eye rolls.\u00a0 \u00a0 Despite our low opinion, we DVR and watch it every Wednesday over ginger tea and popcorn after I get back from work.\u00a0 And enjoy ourselves tremendously. But yesterday evening its not to be\u00a0 The new swimming pool( if you can call it that ) is beckoning like a beacon to R\u00a0 Swib \u00a0!! he says\u00a0 Its starting to rain heavily.\u00a0 But we pretty much say no to nothing for R ( the two things that we say no to are -bad manners or bad for R \u2013 that is it- we say no to nothing else. \" Following the child's lead \u00a0\" is a Floortime Principle that has pervaded every part of our life )\u00a0 And of course I can never ignore purposeful communication\u00a0 So we go out to the pool in the rain\u00a0 And play all our games.\u00a0 I must pick him up and swing him according to the chants of an rhyme (\u00a0 Zip Zap Zoop \u2013right side together \u2013 left side together \u00a0\u2013 a rhyme my niece taught me on a train journey once 8 years ago. My dog had died recently and my niece -only 4 \u2013 was trying to cheer me up \u2013 I have adapted it to Floortime purposes and R loves it )\u00a0 I am sure he will be fed up with the rain after he is done with the pool and we are both soaking wet\u00a0 But its not to be\u00a0 He insists \u2013 \" Siduh Huduh \"( Swing me a 100 times )\u00a0 By this time we are wetter than fish and I have given up trying to avoid getting too wet. So after swinging I agree resignedly, when he says \" Jumpuh jumpuh jumpuh \" We get on the trampoline which is wet and slick . Hold hands\u00a0 Jump higher and higher\u00a0 Making circles. Rain has made a little pool in the center of the trampoline and the water jumps up in rhythm with us. We go on like this for almost a half hour Interrupted only by the thunder and R's giggles and squeals of \u00a0\" Hyduh \u00a0\"( higher)\u00a0 This dance in the half light of a dark sky feels like magic\u00a0 If it is all about not waiting for the rain to pass but learning to dance in it. Then surely this lovely life has brought me both \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://drycappucino.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/10/showcase-floor-time-lite-mama.html", "title": "\nShowcase-Floor Time Lite Mama\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n The Reality of an Autistic Person \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImagine you\u2019ve gone to a different country, one where people speak your language but the way they live their lives is completely different to how you do it. Any time you ask someone a question, like what sort of currency they use or what public transport is available, they look at you like you\u2019re crazy and tell you that you should already know. Worse, every so often, others will tease you and point you out to other people as someone who doesn\u2019t get the simplest things. Angry, frustrated and confused, you give up asking questions and try to avoid having to speak to anyone about things you don\u2019t understand. You try to work out what\u2019s going on by watching the other people around you and trying to copy what you see for the duration of your stay. \n \nNow imagine that you are autistic, that that country is your society, and the duration of your stay is the rest of your life. This is the reality for autistic people. We have no idea, literally, what you think you are doing when you ask us to go for a quick drink in the pub. This won\u2019t apply to everyone of course, but for many autistic people, a typical thought cycle on being asked to go for a social drink in the pub is something like this: \u201cWhere am I going to sit? What are we going to talk about? When will it be appropriate to leave? What if there\u2019s an awkward silence? How do I order a drink? What if there\u2019s a queue? How do I queue? Why do people all crowd around the bar if I need to queue, where should I stand? How do I know what to order? How will I know how much that costs? If I\u2019m going with this person, are we going to queue together? Who goes first? If I get a drink first, how am I going to decide where to sit? Should I stand with the other person while they get a drink? If so, are we going to make small talk? What are we going to say? If they get their drink first, should I ask them to wait? Should we choose somewhere to sit that\u2019s quiet so I can hear them, or somewhere I can use the surrounding environment to act as distractions for me or opportunities to say things? When we sit down, how quickly should I drink my drink? If I drink it quicker than them, does that make me look bad? Is it acceptable to buy another one if they drink much slower than me? If I drink really slowly, are they going to feel obliged to not buy another drink if they want to because of how slowly I am drinking? I don\u2019t want to ask any of this of the other person, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m stupid. Normal people don\u2019t ask these things. I can\u2019t deal with it. I won\u2019t go.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s before you even get to the art of attempting to hold a conversation with something that isn\u2019t exclusively on your obsessive interests. The sheer anxiety of having to answer all of these questions will perhaps explain to you why I refused to go to any event exclusively deemed social until I was 19. I went to a grand total of two birthday parties during my entire time at high school, not because I wasn\u2019t asked, but because I found the two I went to so stressful I decided it wasn\u2019t worth going again. While I slowly got over this aversion, to begin with I had to organise socials for different groups that I ran in order to justify my existence in a bar. It wasn\u2019t \u201csocial\u201d, it was \u201cwork\u201d. That made it marginally less scary. I\u2019m still not a fan. Perhaps those of you reading this will now now why I appreciate being asked to house parties (validation that I am accepted into the group) but don\u2019t actually go (People! Noise! Crowds! Uncertainty!). \n \nThe fact that other people don\u2019t get these extreme anxieties and will regard you as weird if you try to deal with them makes it harder to get answers to the questions that make you so anxious. I refused to go to a hairdressers until I was 15 because I thought that the spaceship style hairdryers would burn my head off and I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near them. I didn\u2019t want to tell my mum about this because the fact that other people were using them clearly meant that there was a reason people were using them that didn\u2019t involve burning their head off, and I thought she would laugh at me. But I couldn\u2019t ask, so I made my mum cut my hair until I finally volunteered to go to a Supercuts \u2013 notable for not having hairdryers at all and thereby allowing me to avoid the issue altogether. And even though I am writing this as if I\u2019m over it, I still haven\u2019t set foot in a hairdressers that has one\u2026 \n \nMaybe you think that if my parents had tried to socialise me at an earlier age, this wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. Well, they did try. My mum used to try to invite other children round when I was small, but I didn\u2019t like them because I thought they were boring. I refused to invite anyone from school round during the holidays: when my mum asked why, I replied, \u201cI see them all the time at school, why would I want to see them out of it?\u201d I spent my time reading, watching children\u2019s TV, and making mud pies in the garden. I enjoyed reorganising cupboards and making inventories of my toys. I obsessively played the same 15 songs that I really loved over and over again. I was mostly alone, I enjoyed being alone, and when my parents tried to take me to play with other children, I made it very clear that I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near them. But sometimes parents\u2019 well-meaning efforts to \u201csocialise\u201d their child can make things a great deal worse: when I was 8, I was taken to a friend\u2019s birthday party. I got there to discover it was at a sports centre and everyone was playing games. I was dressed in sports gear, handed a hockey stick, and expected to immediately join in a loud hockey game I didn\u2019t know the rules to with 12 children I\u2019d never met in my life. I totally freaked out, refused to leave the bench, and sat watching the game until I was rescued from my parents\u2019 anger by the birthday child\u2019s mother, who let me play computer games outside the sports hall. My parents decided to punish me for *their* humiliation and took me home before the lighting candles on the cake, the part of the party where I knew what I was supposed to be doing and knew I\u2019d get cake as a reward for awkwardly singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. That experience largely stopped me wanting to go to birthday parties again. I still feel bad when I think about it now. \n \nThe autistic community is largely united in spending a great of time alone in their childhood, but are split into two different camps on whether that was because they wanted to play with other children and couldn\u2019t work out how or were rejected by them, or whether they actually just didn\u2019t find other children interesting and wanted to ignore them. I was largely in the latter camp and it wasn\u2019t until I hit puberty that I really noticed the existence of other people at all. That might seem strange to you, but I really did view other people as walking furniture that were as relevant to my life as the table I sat at. I talked to them when I wanted to get something done, and I cried when they were cruel to me, but that was as far as it went. The only reason I wanted friends was so I had someone to sit next to when we had to sit down and I didn\u2019t have to deal with the anxiety of working out where to sit or being bullied for sitting alone. The happiest memories I have of my childhood was when the people around just let me get on with my thing and went with what my history teacher kindly called my idiosyncrasies. At holiday club, I built a shelter out of a table and tablecloth and spent a lot of time just sitting in it \u2013 a wise youth worker told the other children not to bother me and I really enjoyed that particular summer. A cool RE teacher used to throw all the other kids out of the reception room after school and let me stay and read the room\u2019s bookshelf on my own. \n \nBy contrast, when I was 17, someone sat in my chair in History. I asked them to move. They refused. I appealed to my teacher. She told me to sit down and stop being silly. I sat on my bag next to her and proceeded to make pointed comments about how I wanted my chair back for the next twenty minutes. My history teacher told me to stop being a bully and get over it in front of the entire class. I uncontrollably burst into tears and had to leave the rest of the lesson. It was incredibly and mortifyingly embarrassing for me and my teacher, who told my class that no-one was to ever sit in my chair again. They didn\u2019t. \n \nI should point out that none of that was explainable at the time. If you had asked me as I sobbed my eyes out in the school toilets why I cared so much about sitting in \u201cmy\u201d chair, which was no different from any other chair in the room, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you. Now I can tell you that it\u2019s an aspect of autism to keep the same routines as much as possible in order to avoid anxiety over the uncertainty of having to make a choice. Sit in the same place, eat the same food, wear the same clothes, and you don\u2019t need to deal with the paralysis of having to choose between more than one option. All of my socks are exactly the same colour so I don\u2019t have to worry about it. You can work out ways to deal with things that make people think you\u2019re a massive weirdo, but I don\u2019t think they will ever go away. Maybe you think I don\u2019t seem that bothered anymore about people sitting in the same chair that I always sit in? Maybe you didn\u2019t notice that I sit as close to that chair as possible\u2026 \n \nMy life changed when I hit 18, left home, and had a chance midnight conversation with a flatmate who was sufficiently drunk he didn\u2019t mind repeating himself over and over again until I understood that I had no regard for the feelings of other people because I hadn\u2019t really considered that other people had feelings. That might sound a bit cold to you, and perhaps a bit strange that I had made it to the age of 18 without realising that, but that\u2019s how undiagnosed autism works. You don\u2019t realise you have a problem negotiating other people\u2019s feelings and social cues because you actually aren\u2019t aware that there *are* other people\u2019s feelings and social cues that are different from your own, let alone that you aren\u2019t paying attention to them. All we understand is that authority figures and peers punish us for things that they won\u2019t explain properly, and we don\u2019t know why. You can learn that people get upset when you shout at them when you\u2019re angry, but you\u2019re simply observing the reaction rather clinically. Making the link between how you feel when people shout at you when they\u2019re angry and how other people feel when you do it to them, and the fact that these two feelings may well be different, doesn\u2019t happen automatically the way it does to other people. \n \nThis is especially true if, as is the case for many autistic people, you look down on emotion as illogical (if *anyone* says this to you, break out the diagnostic tools). Maybe you\u2019ve had a conversation with an oblivious autistic person who\u2019s just upset someone and you\u2019re trying to explain why and you say \u201cAnd so when they asked you if they looked fat and you said \u2018yes\u2019, they felt sad\u201d, that person replied, rather surprised, \u201cBut they shouldn\u2019t, that\u2019s stupid\u201d (again, if anyone says this, test \u2018em). A lot of well-meaning people will then say \u201cBut how would you feel if someone said that to you?\u201d and get the response, \u201cWell, it would be true. Why would I feel down?\u201d It\u2019s hard to deal with that kind of approach, and in my experience, accepting that other people have emotional reactions over stuff that doesn\u2019t make sense to them is one of the most profound and conscious-raising realisations an autistic person can make. Certainly the moment I realised that my comments on my flatmate\u2019s tennis-playing skills were factually true but had nonetheless hurt him in a way that I hadn\u2019t intended, and that he didn\u2019t accept, \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t feel that way\u201d as a reason to stop being hurt, was one of the most significant moments in my life so far. \n \nAn important corollary to this is that just because the autistic person just said \u201cbut they shouldn\u2019t feel that way\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean that they themselves won\u2019t. Someone may well then call that autistic person fat one day, or tell them they have a friend who would beat them at tennis, and they will be upset by it, but duly apply their own value system and deem their feelings irrelevant. A struggle will then ensure between the urge to be upset and the feeling of disgust that they are feeling upset. This can often result in an autistic people refusing to believe that they are sad, or refusing help and support for depression, because they shouldn\u2019t be having those feelings at all. This can be pretty catastrophic in relationships with non-autistic people if it doesn\u2019t get picked up. The self-aware autistic person has to learn to accept that both they and other people can have a variety of emotions, that that is ok, and that whatever they and the other person is feeling has to be worked into their logical response to things. \n \nReaction tends to be mixed when I tell people I\u2019m autistic now. A lot of people with experience of autism say, \u201cYeah, totally, that\u2019s cool.\u201d Others say, \u201cNah, you don\u2019t seem autistic. You\u2019re just a bit blunt.\u201d Some will flat out tell me that I\u2019ve been misdiagnosed and I couldn\u2019t possibly be autistic in their opinion. I think that\u2019s for two reasons. The first is that I have known that I\u2019m autistic for four years. That\u2019s a lot of time in which to sit down and actively work out how to fit into society, to realise why you feel uncomfortable in various situations and work out ways to cope with them. I know what I can deal with and what I can\u2019t, so you\u2019ll rarely catch me in a situation where I\u2019m being \u201cweird\u201d because I don\u2019t know what to do or feel very anxious. I think the other reason is that if you aren\u2019t an arm-flapping, constantly interrupting, space-obsessed Aspie of the most unself-aware order, people will refuse to believe that there\u2019s anything wrong with you. Because they perceive autism as being something \u201cwrong with you\u201d. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s just a different way of thinking. The reason we get so distraught over it is because the things that make us tick aren\u2019t understood very well at all \u2013 if you look at the internet and medical literature, you\u2019d think autism is something that happens to children, mentally challenged people, and psychopaths. The idea that the work colleague at the desk next to you who just seems extremely driven and antisocial might be consistantly refusing to go to the pub with you because they\u2019re afraid is rarely to be found. As are any explanations as to why your otherwise attentive and charming lover might be unable to conceive of why you would be upset that you told them something heart-wrenching and painful and they had no reaction to it (because they have no frame of reference to refer to in order to know how they should feel). \n \nI find this really annoying because I think autistic people are really cool, although I would. If autism renders you incapable of understanding social cues, it also renders you largely oblivious to accepting the status quo. Polite people call us blunt, others call us rude. I call us honest. If your colleague is being a bully and getting away with it because no-one wants to call them out, often the autistic person, unconcerned about the intricate social webs this person has built around themselves will just say, \u201cWhy do you keep saying that we have to work as a team when you keep forcing us to do projects we don\u2019t want and which you don\u2019t help us with?\u201d Autistic people will break omerta. They get hated for it because then the non-autistic people have to deal with the things they were afraid to confront. But wouldn\u2019t the world be a lot more straight-forward and easier to navigate if people just said \u201cWe seem to be getting quite close lately. I quite like you and I would like to have a casual sexual relationship with you that might lead to something more if both our feelings change but only if we actively agree that is the case \u2013 would you like to have a date on that basis?\u201d Maybe in slightly more romantic language\u2026 \n \nAutistic people are also extremely helpful, for the most part. I know few autistic people who if asked a factual question they don\u2019t know the answer to, won\u2019t go off, find it out, and get back to you, usually with references and notes on further information. You\u2019ve piqued our curiosity, and now we want to know the answer as much as you do. This is why I ended up learning about EU official chemical risk and safety phrases last night. All that information then gets stored away for the next person who asks. Autistic people are dedicated to everything they enjoy, including people. If they like you, you won\u2019t find a more devoted and faithful friend or lover. Tell us exactly what you want, in plain language, and you will probably get it. Expect us to mind read, and you\u2019ll both be very unhappy without knowing why (if they\u2019re undiagnosed). So when two self-aware autistic people get together, the result is a ridiculously practical but deep mutual understanding. I really like that. \n \nWhat I am basically trying to explain here is that autistic people, above all, like certainty. We want to know exactly where we stand, at all times, whether that\u2019s in relation to our parents, teachers, friends, lovers, or socks. If we cannot have that information, we get anxious, confused, upset and \u201cweird\u201d.

{"date": "Saturday, December 3, 2011", "body": "\n \u00a0 This week we have the pleasure of showcasing Jeff Stimpson-author, blogger and dad to 13 year old Alex. \u00a0I hope that you all take the time to read his wonderful post-and go visit him on his blog.\u00a0 \n \n \n JeffsLife  (jeffslife.tripod.com/alextheboy)  continues the story I began in my books \u00a0Alex: The Fathering of a Preemie \u00a0and\u00a0 Alex the Boy: Episodes From a Family's Life With Autism \u00a0(both available on Amazon). I post more or less weekly about life with my 13-year-old son Alex (PDD-NOS and solidly on the spectrum), the stories being personal about our life with Alex. Topics range from school and activities to eating, sleep, public behavior (see \"tantrums\") and other topics. I started these essays in 1998, when my son was born almost three months premature and he began what would turn out to be a whole first year spent in the hospital. As a journalist, I soon realized that what I was going through back then was at least as interesting as much of the stuff I had written about, so JeffsLife was born. The current site's layout is plain (see \"ugly,\" according to my wife Jill) with few links to autism news or other stuff. I've meant to improve this, but I do think it highlights the writing -- what I've learned the hard way is my best, if not only, talent. JeffsLife is also Tweeted on Twitter and via LinkedIn (I welcome followers and connections, if you're on those sites).\u00a0 The following is an example of what you'll find on JeffsLife. I hope you can drop by (you might want to turn on your popup blocker), and thanks. You can also email me at jeff_stimpson@yahoo.com. \n \n The Overnights \n \n \u201cYou\u2019ll have fun, Alex. Listen to the staff there.\u201d I\u2019m taking Alex to overnight respite. The program, operated by the agency that provides many of Alex\u2019s services, is mostly for adults: Some live for days in an apartment across town, with buses picking them up for school or their day programs right at the door and dropping them back off at the apartment at day\u2019s end. Overnight guests also go bowling or to parks, go to movies or to other New York attractions. Their parents stay home and sleep. (I have two questions: 1) Can Alex\u2019s dad stay in this program instead? and 2) How long before some politico decides that funding for Overnight Respite simply isn\u2019t important enough for people like my son?) We hope that when this program is humming in our lives, it\u2019ll help get Alex out of the house, which he wants to do (a 13-year-old who wants to get away from his parents now and then: somebody call \u201c60 Minutes\u201d), and it will help us recharge from the drain that is living with Alex as he gets older and bigger. It\u2019s potentially a dynamite program. Alex almost screwed himself out of it late last winter. He ran from the apartment and explored the building. He refused to listen to the staff. He hogged the TV. The staff\u2019s response was to let him get his feet wet by the half- and then full-day stays, instead of overnight; they helped arrange for a 1:1 para, too. \u201cIf you took me to a strange place where I didn\u2019t know anybody I wouldn\u2019t know what to do, either,\u201d the program director told me. \u201cTell him he\u2019s going to have fun. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with you to get him respite ready. Tell him beforehand that he\u2019s going to go and he\u2019s going to have fun, and that he has to listen to the staff\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve going to have fun, Alex, and you have to listen to the staff,\u201d I say as we head in on the first morning. There is indeed a lady to para-shadow him on this first half-day. They want to know where to take him. I recommend the Mac Store and the FAO Schwartz. \u201cHere\u2019s his transit card,\u201d I say, and I prepared this note for you to refer to\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Alex likes going into Laundromats and looking at the machines. He also likes grocery stores and helping pick out and bag the produce. He will pick items off the shelf if you tell him what kind and point to them and tell him how many\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re all set,\u201d they say. \u201cYou can take off. Say bye to daddy, Alex.\u201d \u201cBye, daddy!\u201d I spend the morning buying wine, sitting on benches, picking up paperwork from Alex\u2019s pediatrician. My dogs are howling when I swing back by around 1 o\u2019clock. \u201cHow\u2019d he do?\u201d Last time I asked this in this place \u2013 how many weeks ago? who can recall when you\u2019re parenting autism? \u2013 I got wags of the heads and promises to work to get him respite ready. \u201cExcellent!\u201d they say. No running away? No bolting? No. By week\u2019s end, Alex is doing full days. That Friday afternoon, I\u2019m on a bench nearby when he gets off the city bus with his para. For an instant I see a woman and a tall boy, almost a man, before I recognize his lope. He looks like a guy headed into something new. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jeffslife.tripod.com/alextheboy/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/12/showcase-jeff-stimpson-of-jeffslife.html", "title": "\nShowcase-Jeff Stimpson  of JeffsLife\n"},

The wonderful eBook publisher\u00a0 MeeGenius\u00a0 (publisher of great children's books) has started their challenge to find the next children's author. I mentioned in a\u00a0 blog two months ago \u00a0that I had entered \"Chicken Boy: The Amazing Adventures of a Super Hero with Autism\" as a tribute to my godson Gabe who was diagnosed with autism when he was very young. His sister Natalie and I formed this story based on Gabe and wanted to share a book for kids - about a kid - told through the perspective of one very special boy that could let people into his 'world' in a different way. \n \n \n \n \n Gabe Watching the Circus \n \n \n Now we need the help of everyone to get the word out about the book. Voting for round 1 will continue until December 18th. Please click\u00a0 HERE\u00a0 and click the LIKE button to vote. (It seems as if you have to be connected to facebook in order to vote.)\u00a0 We can't wait to see what comes of this book and just hope to make it to the Finalist Round with YOUR help! (The finalist round will be January 31-February 21, 2012 and a winner will be announced by March 7.) \n \n \n \n Autism is nothing to be afraid of and we hope with this book to encourage other children to not be fearful of that child in their class that may seem a little different than they are. Children with autism are just like every other kid. They want to play. They have incredible imaginations. They enjoy bugs, snakes, the children's museum, the circus, horseback riding, the beach...they just show their enjoyment in a different way. (And my little guy loves to wrestle with Greggy every Wednesday night after we return from our dinner at Friday's: chicken fingers, fries, ketchup and red velvet cake.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \n And they can get to you like no one's business! When Gabe reaches over and grabs my hand to walk into the\u00a0restaurant - my heart melts!\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Thanks for voting!

When you came out, Mom, you knelt down to hold me, and you were crying. I didn\u2019t know what was happening, but I knew that something was wrong. I realized for the first time in my life that you were vulnerable, and that you needed to hold me. Yet what strikes me now is not the sadness of that day, but the beauty of your spirit. Mom, you reached out for me. You drew me in at a time when you must have wanted to push everyone away. \n \nLikewise, you reach continually out on Willie\u2019s behalf, seeking therapies and doctors and medications and activities and services for him. You encourage him in his interests, yet you also allow him the space he needs for himself, to be himself. You have taught me how to count his small victories, to see the steps of progress he makes as miracles. \n \nDad, I remember how many times you took Willie with you on work trips, on errands to Costco, to Edie\u2019s for haircuts. You\u2019ve made sure to include him in all aspects of your life. And I have never seen you act self-conscious or embarrassed by his behaviors, strange and frightening though they have been. You model a relaxed, take-it-as-it comes attitude for me and for others, and your corny humor dissipates many awkward moments. \n \nIn the times when Willie struggled with violent outbursts and self-injurious behavior, you took on bruises and cuts. You made sure to protect Willie from himself when necessary, and you\u2019ve protected us as well. Rarely did you let the pain of keeping our family together show through. I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s cost you. You continue to keep the faith as Willie\u2019s condition improves, and that patient trust is bearing fruit. \n \nOf course, these things do not always come easily for either of you. I have seen you struggle. I have seen you doubt your decisions. I have walked with you into the places where there are no \u2018right\u2019 choices, only choices less terrible than others. I have sat with you on the floor of our upstairs hallway, none of us knowing what to do or how to carry on. \n \nWe have been totally at a loss, and yet we have never been \u2018lost,\u2019 because we have been together. \n \nI love you, and I am amazed by you every day. \n \nCaroline \n \n*** \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.awishcomeclear.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2011/12/showcase-caroline-mcgraw-of-wish-come.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Caroline McGraw of a Wish Come Clear\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 7, 2012", "body": "\n In the autism community, there are plenty of heated opinions, which lead to even more heated attacks against those who believe differently. Some of the fiercest attacks come from those who believe in debunked treatments like facilitated communication. No other treatment offers such fantastic results. Autistic individuals who've been unable to talk, write, communicate are suddenly able to speak eloquently with the help of a facilitator.\u00a0 For a desperate parent, it must be a dream come true--one's child communicating finally, the words flowing. All those hopes and dreams suddenly realized, parents are not likely to be skeptical of this sudden flowering of skills. For nearly two years, I've been writing about facilitated communication and trying to convey the research and prevent parents new to the autism world from falling for it or its kissing cousin, rapid prompting method. ABC's 20/20 just ran\u00a0 an entire episode \u00a0on the tragic Wendrow case, which I, along with James Todd, have written about this past year. This is a must see episode.

He missed the bus.\u00a0 He ended up being tardy that day. \n \nThe Necklace- After \u201cThe Belt\u201d we made sure to have EVERYTHING ready for him for school for the next day.\u00a0 Clothes laid out.\u00a0 Backpack all packed, etc.\u00a0 The day before, Timmy had received a necklace from a party at school.\u00a0 It was one of those cheapy mardi-gras type necklaces.\u00a0 He had decided this was his new favorite thing.\u00a0 When he had gone to bed that night, I had told him he couldn\u2019t wear the necklace to bed.\u00a0 When I tucked him in, he didn\u2019t have it on.\u00a0 All was good.\u00a0 Except he had hidden the necklace away so his brothers wouldn\u2019t find it, and the next morning he couldn\u2019t remember where he had put it.\u00a0 And \u2026. we had a meltdown. \n \nHave you ever witnessed a child with Autism have a meltdown?\u00a0 This isn\u2019t just a tantrum that a NT (neuro-typical) person has.\u00a0 They honest to goodness think that the world is going to end or something.\u00a0 They cannot see past this one thing.\u00a0 This one thing at this time was that necklace.\u00a0 Nothing, and I mean NOTHING mattered, but that necklace. \n \nAnd so he was tardy again.\u00a0 (Mind you, while trying to deal with his meltdown and help him find his necklace, I\u2019m still getting the other two boys ready and out the door to their bus that comes 15 minutes before Timmy\u2019s). \n \nThese are just two instances.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had others that centered around \u2026 socks that were \u201cpokey\u201d to him.\u00a0 We changed his socks 6 times, and all of them felt \u201cpokey\u201d to him.\u00a0 We finally found a pair that he was comfortable wearing.\u00a0 Him getting down to the bus and realizing that there is a tiny little water spot on his pants.\u00a0 Being upset because his brother ate the last of the Fruity Pebbles and only left him Cocoa Pebbles, and even though he had Cocoa Pebbles the day before with no issues, today he will. \n \nOh yes, I can hear some of you saying \u201cYou are just letting him be a brat.\u00a0 You need to not let him rule like that.\u201d\u00a0 I say to you \u2026 \u201cYou don\u2019t have a child with Autism, and don\u2019t understand.\u201d \n \nHe is not manipulating.\u00a0 I know what manipulating is.\u00a0 I see it in children (including my own) quite often.\u00a0 Timmy\u2019s world STOPS.\u00a0 Just stops.\u00a0 There is not school.\u00a0 There is not work.\u00a0 There is not ANYTHING that is more important to him at that moment.\u00a0 You can try to redirect.\u00a0 You can try to talk him down.\u00a0 Sometimes it works.\u00a0 Other times, no.\u00a0 Especially if I miss the warning signs and don\u2019t get it taken care of before the meltdown goes ahead at full steam. \n \nWe get up with plenty of time for he and his brothers to get ready for school.\u00a0 We get things all set up the night before, and I set breakfast up and make lunches and pack backpacks in the morning before they wake up.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t a scheduling thing.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t a lazy thing.\u00a0 This is an Autism thing. \n \nI believe the mother in the video should get a good lawyer and fight this.\u00a0 I believe that a good lawyer that specializes in special needs cases could really help her.\u00a0 He is late due to his special need.\u00a0 They should write this into his IEP or something along those lines. \n \nWhat do you think? \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bcuzmommysaidso.com/2012/01/09/good-morning-autism/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/01/showcase-catrinas-good-morning-autism.html", "title": "\nShowcase: Catrina's Good Morning Autism!\n"},

Sometimes, it's to attack and condemn other parents or individuals, but sometimes, when the disability community works well, it's to gather together to bring about change, to fight for a family. \n \n \n \n \nThis time, it's to protest a doctor at CHOP who told a family he would not recommend a transplant for their young daughter because of her cognitive disability. \n \n \n \nThe mother, Chrissy, writes of this horrifying conversation at wolfhirshhorn.org in a post titled\u00a0 \"Brick Walls.\" \u00a0We can all imagine ourselves in this situation, but even this imagining cannot come close to the sheer terror, rage, and grief that Chrissy and her husband must have felt. \n \n \n \n \n In a voice that mimics hers, I snort, \u201cWell, what happens if you die tomorrow? Who will take care of your children? Your responsibilities at work?\u201d She breathes in and her eyes widens. \u201cRight!\u201d I throw at her. \u201cNeither of us can predict the future and we shouldn\u2019t try. But if Amelia does not have this transplant she has no future!\u201d \n \n The doctor interrupts. He puts his hands up and tries to take a stern voice with me. \u201cThese medications she has to take after the transplant, they are very dangerous. They can cause seizures. We have to get the dose exact. They may cause brain damage.\u201d \n \n \u201cDO OTHER CHIILDREN WHO HAVE A TRANSPLANT TAKE THIS MEDICATION?\u201d \n \n \u201cYes, but it is different for her. She is already brain damaged and mentally retarded.\u201d \n \n He pauses as if he is choosing his words carefully. \u201cI have been warned about you. About how involved you and your famliy are with Amelia.\u201d \n \n \nThe community has rallied around this family, inundating CHOP's facebook wall \u00a0with comments decrying this doctor's actions and demanding action. A\u00a0 petition has been set up \u00a0at Change.org. People have been using their blogs to spread the word and advocate action. It is our community at its best.

Please know that CHOP strives to partner with families and make appropriate decisions based on input from many sources, none more important than the patient\u2019s family.

We are also taking action to review all existing policies to make sure that they reflect the core values we live by, including our deep commitment to not discriminate in any way. The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia is an institution. But more important, we are a team of men and women whose life\u2019s work and greatest passion are the care of all sick children and the support of their families. To be entrusted with the care of these children is a privilege, one we take with the utmost seriousness. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLet's hope that this will lead the ethics committee to careful deliberation and this doctor to reconsider his beliefs about those with cognitive disabilities. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wolfhirschhorn.org/2012/01/amelia/brick-walls/", "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHospitalofPhiladelphia", "http://www.change.org/petitions/executive-vice-president-and-chief-development-officer-allow-the-kidney-transplant-amelia-rivera-needs-to-survive", "https://www.facebook.com/miastransplant?sk=wall", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2012/01/petition-asks-childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-to-allow-kidney-transplant-to-disabled-child.html", "http://autistichoya.blogspot.com/2012/01/life-not-worth-living.html", "http://mdbeau.blogspot.com/2012/01/denied-transplant.html", "http://birdonthestreet.com/2012/01/quantify-this/", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.com/2012/01/intellectual-disability-disqualifies.html", "http://donnathomson.blogspot.com/2012/01/ethics-of-amelias-transplant-story.html", "http://healingandempowerment.blogspot.com/2012/01/retardation-make-girl-unworthy-of.html", "http://www.jewishjournal.com/jews_and_special_needs/item/mlk_civil_rights_denying_a_kidney_transplant_20120114/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2012/01/15/a-stunning-injustice/", "http://kidneysandeyes.com/2012/01/14/who-deserves-a-kidney-chop-says-no-kidney-for-amelia/", "http://www.care2.com/causes/hospital-no-kidney-transplant-for-girl-with-disabilities.html", "http://www.myspecialks.com/2012/01/quality-of-life.html", "http://www.littlebitquirky.com/2012/01/who-determines-who-should-live-and-who.html", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/2012/01/should-kids-with-disabilities-be-denied.html", "http://mybrainyourbrain.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/176/", "http://notdeadyetnewscommentary.blogspot.com/2012/01/philadelphia-young-girl-being-denied.html", "http://mamatude.blogspot.com/2012/01/memo-to-doctors-and-hospitals-you-want.html", "http://pennyspeeps.blogspot.com/2012/01/no-transplant-for-youif-you-have.html", "http://asd2mom.blogspot.com/2012/01/eugenics-in-america-help-amelia.html", "http://www.reallywhatwerewethinking.com/2012/01/chop-denies-transplant-to-mentally.html", "http://ssadisabilityandyou.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/the-story-of-amelia/", "http://specialchildren.about.com/b/2012/01/13/hospital-denies-kidney-transplant-because-of-girls-intellectual-disability.htm", "http://www.specialeducationadvisor.com/occupy-chop-for-amelia/", "http://supportforspecialneeds.com/2012/01/16/quality/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2012/01/amelias-kidney-our-heart/", "http://theloadeddiaper.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/chop-statement-mia/", "http://threepuzzlepieces.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/copy-of-amelias-story/", "http://niederfamily.blogspot.com/2012/01/stand-up.html", "http://you-leave-me-breadless.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-is-this-legal.html", "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHospitalofPhiladelphia"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/01/when-disability-community-works.html", "title": "\nWhen the Disability Community Works\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 16, 2012", "body": "\n www.autism-daddy.blogspot.com \u00a0 \" A Letter To The Dads That Left Because Of Autism & The Ones That Are Thinking Of Leaving... (from a dad who stayed)\" \u00a0 I hear alot on my   Facebook Page  from women who say that their husbands bailed out on their families/ marriages due to the stresses of autism in their lives. And every day I see another new Facebook page from single autism moms like  \"Single Mothers who have Children with Autism\"    and  \"Tales Of A Single Mom Raising A Child With Autism\"    The whole thing, the idea of leaving your family due to a disability sounds so completely bizarre to me that I thought about writing a letter to these dads... And here it is...    A letter to the autism dads that left and to the ones who are thinking about leaving....   ________________________________   Dear Dads,    Let's get something out of the way right out of the gate.  Let's admit it. Let's call a spade a spade  You were a jerk already, before the autism, right?  You probably would've left for some other reason.  It was already in your DNA to be a loser, right?    Let's be honest, if you didn't have a kid with autism I still don't think you'd be winning any father/husband of the year awards...    If you leave your wife and family cuz of autism then I'm betting you probably never would've been satisfied with your life /marriage and probably would've bailed at some point no matter what the circumstances or stayed and been miserable and/or a jerk.  Because if you honestly left your wife and family solely because of the hardships of life with this condition than you are not a man. You are a weasel.    I mean if your kid had cancer would you have left?  Would you have left your wife to deal with all of the stress alone then?  Or what about some other disease/ disorder?  Or what about cerebral palsy or down syndrome?  Would those have sent you running for the hills?  Or what was it about autism that scared you off so much?    I mean I get it fellas, you may not be able to have the \"typical\" family life you were always expecting.  You may not be able to take your kid to the ballgame, or play catch, or a million other things, but \"WAAAA!\" stop crying and get over it...  And do something to be happy!  I mean what else are you gonna do?  Try again for a typical family with another woman?   What if the autism is in your genetics?  You gonna keep trying to you get it right?    Now if you already left and divorced your wife. It's not too late to step up and be a man and be an integral part of your ASD kid's life.    Learn more about him. Learn what makes him tick. Take him more often and give your ex-wife a break more often. Take your kids for an extra weekend here, a week off from school there. Give your ex-wife a small chunk of the peace and quiet that you get all the time since you bailed out.     But when you do have the kids please abide by the rules your ex-wife has set up. You bailed out and left her in charge. So now you have to accept the decisions / choices that she's made. If she's got the kids on the GFCF diet, stick to it even if you don't agree with it. If she's got rules about how much tv they can watch abide by it. You gave up your right to help make those decisions. The least you can do is follow the rules / protocols she's set up. RESPECT HER CHOICES.    And also try to be a unified front both in your parenting of your kids and out in the world. What I mean by this is  even though you're divorced doesn't mean you shouldn't show up to your kid's IEP meetings or open school nights or other important events like this. Even if you're out of touch on the details just showing up as a sign of support and solidarity goes a long way!!    So if you were a loser who bailed on your wife / family because of autism, it's not too late for you to step up and be a real man!  You can even start today!  Instead of going somewhere to watch the NFL Playoff games today call your ex-wife and grab your kids for the day and give her a break. You can always DVR the games and watch them tonight. I know you don't want me to let all te women in on our little secret... But all us men know that if you remove the commercials, timeouts and halftime the average football game can be over in about 52 minutes....  :-) So now you've got no excuse not to start today!    And to the dads of newly diagnosed kids with autism that are thinking about leaving...     Stay.    You don't need to reinvent yourself and become this super amazing autism dad. That's not what your spouse is looking for. Just be a wee bit better than the husband / father you were before autism hit.    If you were the kinda husband / father that went out 3x a week with the fellas, poker one night, golf on Saturday, football on Sunday, then that's the precedent your family dynamic has set. So when autism enters your household don't think your wife is looking for you to drop everything, just drop one of them, maybe two on stressful weeks.    And then pretty much do all the things I suggested to the divorced dads above. Be more involved, be a unified front, respect her decisions, etc, etc.    But if you are gonna stay in the marriage you have to be there.  Be present.  Don't stay if you're gonna stay and be miserable and distant and drag your wife down with you.  I would leave if I felt i was dragging my wife down.  But first I'd try to make myself better, thru drugs or running or something. Read this  other post of mine with more tips and pointers on how to be happy in your marriage when autism comes along.    And to both the dads who bailed because of autism and the dads who are thinking about leaving because of autism... the fact that you are reading this is a big step. It's not too late for you to make things right and to step up a be a real man, a true father, a good husband or ex-husband. Just take the first step. And if you ever want to chat about things or need a male shoulder to masculinely cry on :-) please join my\u00a0 Facebook page  or email me at autismdaddy.fb@gmail.com    Sincerely yours,    Autism Daddy\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://draft.blogger.com/goog_729617976", "http://autism-daddy.blogspot.com/2012/01/letter-to-dads-that-left-because-of.html", "http://www.blogger.com/goog_559619434", "https://www.facebook.com/AutismDaddy", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Single-Mothers-who-have-Children-with-Autism/258728120832823?ref=ts", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tales-Of-A-Single-Mom-Raising-A-Child-With-Autism/244844845571182?ref=ts", "http://autism-daddy.blogspot.com/2011/12/12-ways-to-keep-your-marriage-strong.html", "https://www.facebook.com/AutismDaddy"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/01/post-from-autism-daddy.html", "title": "\nA post from Autism Daddy...\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 14, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Cooking to Connect and Communicate \n \n By Gabrielle Kaplan-Mayer \n \n www.kitchenclassroom4kids.com \n \n We are fortunate that my son George\ngoes to school just half a block from our home at our local elementary school.\nHe is an autism support classroom there, but our school district makes a great\neffort to include George and his classmates in school events (Cheltenham's\nrecord on inclusion is one of the reasons that we bought a home here several\nyears ago). This coming Monday, the school is hosting a service day in honor of\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as so many schools, places of worship and other\norganizations are doing. \n \n One piece of the service day that\nMyers Elementary is sponsoring is for families to bring a home cooked food that\nwill be delivered to a homeless shelter. This is a project that my son will be\nable to engage in\u2014and enjoy participating. We have been cooking together since\nhe was four years old and I share our experience and the benefits of cooking\ntogether in my children\u2019s cookbook \u201cThe Kitchen Classroom.\u201d \n \n I will cook this at home with my\nkids on Sunday afternoon. It makes me happy that my son can be of service to\nothers through helping to prepare food. I know that many of the themes of Dr.\nKing day are too abstract for George to understand at this point in his life,\nbut I absoluetly believe in the value of instilling a foundation of doing\nservice in him, just as I do with my daughter June. It would be hard for me to\ntake George to do some of the other big service projects in our area: the sheer\nnumber of people and the noise generated in the space where the service will\ntake place could easily overwhelm him. But cooking for others at home in our\nkitchen is the perfect kind of service for us. \n \n George, like many other children\nwho have autism, is especially loving and it is interesting to me to watch the\nway that he doesn't notice a person's skin color, their size, whether their\nclothes or old or new. Both of my kids go to schools with diverse populations\nand are growing up in a neighborhood where people of different backgrounds mix\nhappily and easily. George's autism has brought me into the incredible world of\nparents who have specail needs children, where I frequently meet people from\ndifferent faiths, cultures and socio-economic backgrounds, with whom I have so\nmuch in common with.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 1, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Guest Post \n \n \n \nHi everyone! I'm Dan, and I'm the author of  http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com .\nI was diagnosed with Asperger's ten years ago, and I've spent the years since\nmy diagnosis studying social skills so I can overcome the challenges of\nAsperger's. \n \n \n \nI wrote this blog post to share the  most important rule  I\nlearned for learning social skills with Asperger's syndrome. I've addressed\nthis post to readers who have Asperger's themselves, but these tips can just as\neasily be used to help a loved one who has Asperger's. \n \n \n \nThe most important rule I've discovered is this:  Learn\nsocial skills by understanding the reasons behind them, not through rote\nmemorization. \n \n \n \n The Problem With Rote\nMemorization \n \n \n \nThe most natural way that people with Asperger's learn\nsocial skills is through rote memorization. We learn a specific response that\nworks for a specific situation, and so when that situation occurs, we deploy\nthat response.  \n \n \n \nFor instance, we learn through trial and error that if\nsomeone tells us their name, we should tell them our name in return or they\nwill be upset. Easy enough. \n \n \n \nBut if the situation changes, our memorized response doesn't\nhelp us. Let's say Bob introduces Joe to us. Do we tell Joe our name, or is\nthat Bob's job? We memorized what to do in one specific situation, but when the\nsituation changes we are out of luck. \n \n \n \nOf course, rote memorization is better than nothing. But\nthere's a better way. \n \n \n \n Learning To Understand \n \n \n \nInstead of memorizing specific responses to specific\nsituations, learn to  understand the reasons behind a social situation .\nTrain yourself to think through what other people expect from a situation, and\nponder how you can help meet the expectations of others and make the\ninteraction more positive.  \n \n \n \nWhen you learn to think through the reasons behind a social\nsituation, you can use that knowledge to derive the correct response to the\nsituation--even if you have no rote response memorized. All you need to do is\nponder your understanding of what people expect from a situation, and then\nrespond in a way that matches their expectations. \n \n \n \nFor instance, let\u2019s dig deeper into introductions. What\npositive results do people expect from an introduction? \n \n \n \nThe obvious result is that an introduction allows people to\nshare the data of what everyone's names are, but there's more than that. Some\nother desired results of an introduction might be: \n \n \n \n-The sharing of relevant information about the people being\nintroduced (for instance \"Hi, I'm Dan, and I'm a friend of Bob\u2019s) \n \n- Giving everyone the chance to speak so they feel included. \n \n-Creating a socially acceptable way to start a conversation\nfrom scratch \n \n-Allows people to get a feel for each other before the conversation\nbegins in earnest. \n \n \n \nWhen we know the results that people expect from an\nintroduction, we can use this knowledge to guide our actions. \n \n \n \nFor instance, if we see that one desired result of an\nintroduction is to give everyone the chance to speak, we know that we shouldn't\nstart telling a long story until everyone has been introduced. \n \nIf we see that introductions create a socially acceptable\nway to start a conversation, we know that if someone introduces themselves to\nus, they are trying to start a conversation and we should respond\nappropriately. \n \n \n \nThis concept applies to all situation situations, not just\nintroductions.  When we learn the desired results that people expect from a\nsocial situation, we can choose responses that help achieve the desired results\nfor that situation . All you need to do is take a moment to think through\nthe reasons behind a situation, and you can deduce what you should be doing in\nthat situation. \n \n \n \nBy learning to understand the reasons behind a situation, we\ncan free ourselves from the massive list of rote responses, and have a much\ngreater ability to handle whatever social situation we find ourselves in. It\nreally is that simple, and it really is that powerful. \n \n \n \n Practical Applications \n \n \n \nI'll close with a few pieces of advice for how to apply this\nrule to your own lives. \n \n \n \n First , please realize that you will not be able to\ncreate a comprehensive list of every desired result that people expect from an\ninteraction, especially at first. But you should be able to think up at least a\nfew, and you can ask friends and family to help you uncover more. You will also\nnaturally discover more desired results of a given\u00a0 social situation simply by observing people\nin that social situation. So as time goes by, your understanding of social\nsituations will grow more and more. \n \n \n \n Second , if you are still having trouble understanding\nthis idea, there is a metaphor that might help. Picture a classroom. The\ndesired result of the classroom is for students to learn. A teacher has two\noptions for trying to achieve this result. He can either make a lengthy list of\nrules--no talking in class, no chewing gum, raise your hand if you have a\nquestion, etc. Or, he can teach the students to think \"If I do this\naction, will it disrupt the other students from learning?\" \n \nThe lengthy list of rules is similar to the rote\nmemorization. The problem with it is that it's impossible to make a rule that\nforbids every negative thing a student might do, and it's also no fun for\nstudents to have to memorize a huge list. The better option is for students to\nunderstand that their goal is to be non-disruptive, so they can think for\nthemselves, and realize when a potential action would disrupt the classroom. \n \n \n \n Third , if you need another example of understanding\nthe reasons behind an interaction, take a look at my guide on  how to make\nconversation . I explain the reasons behind conversation, and show you how\nyou can use those reasons to guide your responses. \n \n \n \n Finally , remember that like everything, this is a\nskill that grows with practice. If you learn to understand the reasons, you\nwill not magically become a social superstar. It will take time, practice, and\nhard work for you to learn social skills in this way. \n \n \n \nBut it will take considerably more time, practice and hard\nwork if you learn through rote memorization, and you will have much less\nsuccess overall. When you learn to understand the reasons behind social\nsituations and train yourself to react accordingly, you will dramatically\nmultiply the benefit you receive from studying social skills. And as you\ncontinue to study social skills and grow in your understanding of social\nsituations, you will find yourself increasingly able to thrive in social\nsituations and build the deep, intimate relationships that you deserve. \n \n \n \nThat's not magic. But it's incredibly powerful, and it's\nsomething you can start today. Good luck! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/", "http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/conversation"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-learn-social-skills-with.html", "title": "\nHow to learn social skills with Asperger's syndrome\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 1, 2012", "body": "\n Lydia blogs very eloquently at  Autistic Hoya . Given the continued difficulties communicating our realities in a way that is honest and yet respectful of others, this is a very timely post--Kim \n \n Since the Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism hosted the Self-Advocate/Parent Dialogues over a period of two weeks from September to October 2011, there has been a continued and consistent flurry of discussion and responses to the dialogues in the blogosphere. In the last few months, it\u2019s mostly died down, with only occasional articles and posts addressing the complex, interwoven, and intricate relationships between parents and Autistics and Autistic parents.  When Kim Wombles asked me to write a response to the dialogues close to six months ago, I was at first excited and enthusiastic to embark on such a project -- to join a conversation that had been watched with keen interest throughout the autism community.  It took about two days before I realized that I was tackling a series of complex issues that no one article or blog post could truly do justice. So I kept procrastinating. I put the article at the end of a rather long to do list, reassuring myself (and Kim) that I was working on it and would have it done in a timely fashion. Occasionally I would think of ideas or phrases to use in this article, but just as quickly, I would discard those same ideas as too cliche or lacking the right amount of nuance for the feelings and ideas I hoped to convey. It\u2019s five months after I received that email, and still I fear whether I can adequately address the myriad of underlying issues that have been brought to light through the TPGA-hosted dialogues, and all of the subsequent writings from the autism and Autistic communities since then.  Let me start, then, with a simple declaration. Dialogue is painful.  That might seem like a pessimistic statement, a defeatist declaration, or a cynical look at the possibilities for the outcomes of these dialogues. But it is a true statement. We have seen this to be true throughout history and across the world. Whether it is the family member of a murder victim engaging in dialogue with the condemned inmate who committed the deed as part of a restorative justice program, or children from Israel and Palestine engaging in dialogue at a peace camp, or survivors of genocide engaging in dialogue with the perpetrators of the crimes against humanity -- dialogue is painful.  To dialogue means to engage in a reciprocal conversation in which all participants are equal (setting aside privilege or familiar footing) and equally welcome and accepted. A true dialogue is an open conversation in which nothing is hidden or withheld, nothing is sugar-coated or skirted, and nothing is off-limits or out-of-bounds. To be put on equal footing means that the participants in a dialogue have to relinquish their need to be cautious in every word. It means, in a sense, that they have to relinquish their privacy.  Dialogues are about people. People have pasts. They have experiences and emotions and ideas. Dialogues must reflect and include all of that -- the best and worst parts. And we all know that it is impossible to talk about sensitive topics, or indeed any topic in which one is personally and emotionally vested, without eliciting passionate emotions. We have to recognize that. Especially when we dialogue about autism -- each of us has a deep and personal connection to autism, whether it is by way of being Autistic, having a family member who is Autistic, or otherwise. Many of us have had painful experiences. Words like anxiety, depression, and indignation resonate with the members of our community very well.  Thus, dialogue is painful.  But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Dialogue has to be painful, because if it\u2019s not painful, then it isn\u2019t -- and won\u2019t be -- succeeding. The problems that we encounter arise when we allow our emotions -- of deep hurt and offense -- to influence our words to each other. It is very easy to speak from anger or hurt, but it is very difficult to speak  of  anger or hurt.  This is one of the major reasons why our community has seen such vitriol and vicious infighting over the last several years. Each of us has had such intimately painful experiences for an entire amalgam of reasons, and when we hear another person say something that seems to ignore, dismiss, or diminish those very real experiences, we have the natural tendency to retaliate through harsh words. That\u2019s true of all of us, by the way. It is not exclusive to Autistic self-advocates, or to non-Autistic parent advocates, or to Autistic parents of Autistic children.  But let\u2019s not dwell too long on the past. It is wrong to ignore the past and to ignore past experiences. It is equally wrong, however, to languish in it without attempting to move forward. After all, dialogue has a  purpose . The purpose of dialogue is to use such open conversation as a means of achieving some goal or outcome -- in this case, I think, to bridge the often mutually alienated Autistic self-advocate and non-Autistic parent advocate communities (and to include Autistic parents of Autistic children, who have often stated their frustrations with the non-Autistic parent community.)  What are the problems, then?  The original dialogue participants and many of the responses to the dialogues touch upon a whole host of them. First and foremost is language. One of the primary purposes for language is to communicate and express ideas, but a major pitfall to interpersonal communication occurs when one person uses language with the intent of expressing one idea, and another person understands that same language with an entirely different nuance. Other pitfalls come when definitions have not been agreed upon before entering dialogue, or when certain language has come to be associated with negative connotations among members of one group but not another.  These consistent failures to communicate over shared use of language can and do result in miscommunications. It is evident to me that the failures in our community\u2019s ability to dialogue within itself are the result of gross misunderstandings and misconceptions on all sides of the aisles.  Some Autistic self-advocates fail to adequately recognize in their words that the vast majority of non-Autistic parents care deeply about their Autistic children and genuinely want what is best for them. Similarly, many non-Autistic parents fail to adequately recognize that Autistic adults who are not their children have valuable and important voices in the national conversation about autism. (In fact, it may be that Autistic adults may be the best role models for Autistic children -- but that\u2019s a conversation for another time.) Yet despite the very valid expressions of discontent, disappointment, frustration, and hurt resulting from the vitriol and infighting within out community, there are occasional instances where we see that cooperation and joint efforts can effect powerful change. This became more evident after the Change.org petition demanding systemic changes in a county in Kentucky after an Autistic child was restrained and confined to a bag intended for sensory integration therapy -- it has over 191,000 signatures to date, and did not merely draw non-Autistic parents of Autistic children together with Autistics and Autistic parents, but also galvanized national attention around the systematic abuse of restraints, seclusion, and aversives in a way that has never really happened before.  So what should we expect when entering dialogue? Expect to be offended. Expect to cause offense. Expect to misunderstand. Expect to be misunderstood. Expect to recognize privilege that you have. Expect to have your perceptions challenged and questioned. Expect to be upset. Expect to be emotionally involved. If those things aren\u2019t happening, then neither is dialogue.  \n \n ______________ \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autistichoya.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/03/dialogue-is-painful-by-lydia-brown.html", "title": "\nDialogue is Painful by Lydia Brown\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n I wrote this post almost two years ago. \u00a0It was in response to many things..most notably, some tragedies that had been discussed within the online autism community. Well, tragedy has once again struck. Again there has been much \"discussion.\" Sides have been taken-lines have been drawn. This deeply upsets me-on so many levels. \u00a0No one ever really knows what another person is thinking, feeling, or why they do the things that they do. \u00a0They(myself included) can guess, they can suppose, they can make suppositions, argue and judge. All the while never looking at all the pieces-and instead, only finding the ones that best support their position. \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0A mother killed her son and then herself. Two lives were lost. Two. \u00a0This is not a time for argument-or debating the worth of one life over another. Who deserves more compassion-or who loves their kids more. This is a horrific and terrible tragedy. One that maybe could have been prevented. \u00a0I don't have the answer to that. I was not there, I was not in that mothers head. None of us were. \u00a0I do know that I feel incredible compassion and empathy for the two people involved. \u00a0So maybe ..instead of arguing with each other over who deserves more sympathy or who REALLY loves their children..maybe we can honor those two lost lives by by reaching out to each other. By building bridges instead of platforms..and maybe we can stop something like this from ever happening again... \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ---Kathleen \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nThe way it is.. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\"Well I looked my demons in the eyes, laid bare my chest, said \"Do your best, destroy me. \n \n\u00a0You see, I've been to hell and back so many times I must admit you kind of bore me.\" \n \nTheres a lot of things can kill a man, theres a lot of ways to die \n \n. Listen, some already did and walk beside me. \n \n\u00a0Theres a lot of things I don't understand. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0Why so many people lie. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0It's the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me.\" \n \nRay Lamontagne \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I can really remember a time before autism. \u00a0Oh sure, I can divide my life in pieces..There was the time\" before kids\" and the time \"after kids\". There is a clean divide. \u00a0There was a time when we had so much more freedom..and a time when we had lots less. Kids do that to you. Now, as they get older, I find myself having more freedom again. \u00a0But it isn't the same kind as\" before kids\". \u00a0Because no matter what, they are always on your mind, there are always pieces of them that travel with you. Kind of like a backpack crazy glued to your heart. \u00a0I think it is just the nature of being a parent. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0When I say that I don't remember a time before autism, I mean that my kids were always autistic. \u00a0I don't know having children any other way. I never lamented their being anything other than who they are, because they have always been who they are. I had nothing other than themselves to measure against. Does that make sense? \u00a0How could I possibly mourn something that never was. I'd much rather celebrate what is. I guess in a nice way I'm saying that I don't understand when I hear about parents speaking desperately of \"recovering\u00a0\u00a0their child\". I always think\" recover?\" \u00a0\"They're right in front of you\"! \u00a0Understand, this doesn't mean that I don't help my kids, work with them,or get them the services and supports they need. \u00a0That is my job-my responsibility. \u00a0It is called being a parent. Whether my kids are neuro typical, have three heads or autism-it is what a parent is supposed to do.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0I know that people mean well when they say things like \"I don't know how you've done it\" to me. But it really annoys the crap out of me. How I've done what? \u00a0These are the only kids I've known as a parent. I don't deserve a medal for that. That doesn't mean I wouldn't like a medal though..NOT for raising autistic kids-but maybe for getting them all fed, and dressed in clean clothes on a daily basis, for not losing my patience (too much) when they can't find their shoes, or when they are fighting over one thing or another. Yes, there are days when a parade in my honor would be nice.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0Believe\u00a0me, I am in no way minimizing what it takes to raise children with disabilities. The early days with my boys were some of my hardest. There were years of sleep deprivation of ceaseless screaming, times when I became a punching bag because I thought that was better than letting them slam their heads into the walls or the glass windows. There were times when I wanted to quit-to give up, to run away from home and join the Foreign Legion. Oh the powerlessness I felt. \u00a0Because I was their mother-and I didn't know what to do-how to help them-to make their world right .But \u00a0never-not ever, NOT ONCE did I hate them, or blame them, or wish them away. \u00a0Those feelings were instead directed towards myself because I felt helpless. Like a failure. I was the Mom-it is MY JOB to makes things right. My job to figure things out. To make their world better. It wasn't up to them. I have never been\u00a0burdened\u00a0by their disabilities-but rather, my own inability. Although I look at them now and think we've done o.k. They continue to develop and thrive. Sometimes I think it is because we let them just be. Wait! \u00a0Before any nay sayers start with their naying..Letting them be means simply that although we got them services and supports-and have continually helped them to learn and grow-we never treated them as if they were\" less than\" or\" broken\". Got it? So I don' think that I deserve a medal for doing my job. (although if you would like to send me chocolate or coffee, I won't complain) \u00a0I chose to have children. That is where my choice ended. These are the ones I have. Case closed. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0The past week or so the online autism community has been abuzz with a couple of stories. Two mothers did the unthinkable. They murdered their children. One of the mothers killed herself as well. The reason given in both cases was that they had autistic children and were overwhelmed by it. Some prominent people in the community are using this as a platform. Claiming that this is just the beginning-that we are going to see more and more of these stories because not enough is being done to help parents of autistic children. \u00a0No mention is made of the innocent victims-nor of the probable mental instability of the mothers-none. Nope, it is all about the evil autism...and I am reeling. Yes, there does need to be more done-more services, more programs-more support. \u00a0I don't argue that. However, I find it morally reprehensible that it is being argued for in this way. I also find it offensive....and a lot of other strong words-that I don't use on this blog.(but I do use in regular life) \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0I came across another parent's blog this past week. \u00a0It was by a mom who was raising a child with medical issues. \u00a0Sadly, last week her daughter died. In her post she spoke of her loss her agony..her girl..and of how she would miss her for the rest of her life..the rest of her life. I thought to myself..\"parenting never ends\" (I say that in a loving way).. I know that when I look at my herd..at each individual child-at all that they are..I can say the same. Because no matter what..regardless of how they are..what they look like..who they become..I will fight for them, work for them and advocate because I am their mother..and I will love them for the rest of my life. \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/03/platforms-bridges-and-way-it-is.html", "title": "\nPlatforms, Bridges and The way it is...\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 23, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Also crossposted at Countering and Science 2.0.-- Kim Wombles \n \n How a society treats the disabled, especially those in need of specialized care due to aggressive behaviors and self-injurious behaviors, says a lot about the morality and compassion of that society. Are they locked away out of sight, left to live in horrendous conditions, abandoned not only by society, but by family members as well? The United States does not have a good record when it comes to the care provided to the mentally and physically disabled. From lobotomies to forced sterilization, from electric shock therapy and restraint systems that resemble the horrors of a torturer\u2019s chamber, we as a society have wreaked havoc on those unable to defend themselves. \n \n And then, in an effort to make things better, we closed several institutions and placed the disabled in their communities, except that we failed to fund group homes adequately, we failed to legislate adequate training for carers, we paid the caregivers substandard wages, and we neglected to make sure those placed in the community were safe and well-cared for. In actuality, many ended up homeless, some ended up in jail, and ill-equipped families took in their disabled and did the best they could with no training, little support, and few opportunities. \n \n Today, our society is facing an overwhelming crisis of what to do and how to help those who are disabled have equal access to society and all that being a full member of society entails: work that is fulfilling, socialization opportunities and safe living environments. Parents and families struggle to find appropriate programs from early childhood on as school districts prove themselves ill-equipped to provide for the disabled and as our children reach adulthood, we and our adult children find ourselves struggling to find workable solutions that keep our loved ones safe and allow them autonomy and satisfaction. \n \n Some disabled individuals, faced with a past that failed to help them get aggressive behaviors and self-injurious behaviors under control, end up in jail for attacking their caregivers or carted off to various institutions until there\u2019s no place left that will take them, except the Judge Rotenberg Center, which prides itself on\u00a0 not rejecting anyone . Of course, one of the hidden costs of admission is being hooked up to electrodes that will shock the individual should he engage in any behavior deemed unacceptable. In addition to shocks administered by staff with minimal training, restraints, including four-point restraints, are a favored tactic. \n \n You would think that the stories that come out of the center would ensure its closing, but instead\u00a0 parents of those institutionalized\u00a0 there go before the Massachusetts government \u00a0and argue that the shocks are good things. And perhaps, for the parents, grown children suddenly malleable and cowed, seems like a boon.\u00a0 Parents go home \u00a0with the shock boxes and the ability to stop their children on a dime if \u00a0they choose to act out. Who wouldn't want the ability to taser an aggressive individual, right? And that is what it's \u00a0tantamount to : tasering.\u00a0 \n \n Abuse story \u00a0after abuse story comes out,\u00a0 advocates and organizations rally and the federal justice\u00a0 department investigates , and yet nothing really changes. Autistic advocates and parent advocates have come together over the years, writing piece after piece, like\u00a0 Lydia Brown's\u00a0 work on Change.org \u00a0 and at the\u00a0 Autism Education Project \u00a0and\u00a0 Marj Hatzell's\u00a0 piece \u00a0 in The Stir. The ICAA recently\u00a0 wrote about the center , noting that\u00a0 \"The GED skin shocks were created and used by the JRC to deliberately apply painful burns to the skin of people with disabilities who become students at the JRC in Massachusetts. The skin shocks are many times more powerful than that of an average\u00a0 dog shock collar \u00a0which is universally considered abuse for humans and is controversial for use on dogs or other animals.\" \n \n This should be a no-brainer for anyone concerned with the humane and responsible care and education of individuals with disabilities. It should be an easy thing to stand up and say \"We stand against the restraint, abuse, and torture of the disabled.\" Every organization dealing with disabled populations should feel a moral imperative to do this: to stand against the Judge Rotenberg Center and its thirty year plus history of shocking clients, refusing food, restraining for hours without any kind of break for the client.\u00a0 \n \n However, that is definitely not the case. Two major autism organizations have not stood up and led the way on this issue. Two major autism non-profits have failed to stand against restraint, seclusion, the withholding of food, and the administration of painful shocks that the Judge Rotenberg Center engages in. Autism Speaks and the Autism Society have chosen, for whatever reason, to remain silent on an issue their stature and recognition among the public would certainly bring attention to. \n \n \u00a0 Autism Speaks \u00a0has no official statement on the center, according to Marc Sirkin, \u00a0Autism Speaks Vice President, Social Marketing & Online Fundraising. The\u00a0 Autism Society \u00a0did not respond to a request for its position on the center and no information about Judge Rotenberg Center could be found on the society's website. \n \n The National Autism Association\u00a0 stands up against \u00a0the Judge Rotenberg Center.

When concerns about money take precedence over the absolute right of human beings to be free from torture, restraint, and abuse, the morality of society as a whole is in jeopardy. \n \n I call upon these two organizations, Autism Speaks and the Autism Society, to take a moral stand--to speak up for the victims of the Judge Rotenberg Center, to put the weight and clout of being multi-million dollar organizations into getting the center shut down and the aversive shocks outlawed permanently.\u00a0 \n \n Don't let a handful of parents arguing before the Massachusetts government for the continued abuse of their children keep you, Autism Speaks and Autism Society, from speaking out and helping to put a stop to this. Don't let the fear of offense to those who would line your coffers keep you silent. \u00a0 \n \n To fail to speak, to fail to act, to fail to show compassion and respect for the rights of these individuals who find themselves consigned to the bizarro world of the center with its opulent reward centers coupled with abusive, painful shocks, some of which come by the dozens, is to fail humanity utterly. \n \n To be at the forefront of the autism community, to wield fiscal power, demands integrity of the highest order. Failing to speak out against acts like those that\u00a0 happened to \u00a0Andre McCollins is simply unconscionable.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.judgerc.org/", "http://respectforinfinitediversity.blogspot.com/2010/07/over-thirty-years-later-when-ends-do.html", "http://respectforinfinitediversity.blogspot.com/2010/07/ruminations-on-judge-rotenberg-center.html", "http://respectforinfinitediversity.blogspot.com/2010/07/judge-rotenberg-center-serial.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/07/parentdish-judge-rotenberg-center-and.html", "http://www.dredf.org/pdfs/Letter-from-Disability-Rights-Advocates-Sept-09.pdf", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/02/u-s-department-of-justice-opens-investigation-on-judge-rotenberg-cente/", "http://www.change.org/petitions/stand-up-for-disability-rights-demand-the-video-of-andre-mccollinss-torture-at-the-judge-rotenberg-center", "http://www.autismeducationproject.org/about.html", "http://thestir.cafemom.com/big_kid/133624/using_shock_therapy_on_disabled", "http://thestir.cafemom.com/big_kid/133624/using_shock_therapy_on_disabled", "http://www.icaaonline.org/?p=1613", "http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,486252,00.html", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://asa.pub30.convio.net/", "http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/06/25/national-autism-association-opposes-the-judge-rotenberg-center/", "http://www.dredf.org/pdfs/Letter-from-Disability-Rights-Advocates-Sept-09.pdf", "http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/teen-tied-and-shocked-for-hours-mom-calls-it-torture-20120219"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/03/why-principled-positions-matter-judge.html", "title": "\nWhy Principled Positions Matter: The Judge Rotenberg Center and Autism Organizations\n"},

Written by \u00a0 Cindy Ariel , a licensed  psychologist \u00a0who provides therapy for a variety of issues, including relationships, it is an easy-to-read guide to understanding Asperger's Syndrome and why partners on the spectrum behave in ways that may be hard for those unfamiliar with the syndrome to understand. \n \n \n \nMuch of this book is valuable for any couple struggling with issues dealing with miscommunication and unmet expectations. It does have a few areas of concern, though, that may make it unpalatable to some people on the spectrum: mention of Maxine Aston's Cassandra Syndrome is certain to rile those familiar with her speculations that neurotypical partners are victimized by their autistic mates and a failure to include any autistic voices in the text. To be fair, the voices of neurotypical partners are not included, either, and this lack of real-life examples both keeps this book at a manageable length and avoids any additional emotional entanglement.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe best people, though, to explain what is going on in the autistic mind are autistic people.

Don't leave. \u00a0I need to talk to you.\" \"You've been talking to me for 20 minutes. \u00a0You're to repeating yourself. \u00a0I have to go.\" \"Well can I come with you?\" Why? So you can complain more in the car. \u00a0I don't think so. \"I have no idea what kind of mood your brother is going to be in when I pick him up. \u00a0The last thing he needs is to listen to you ranting if he's already upset. \u00a0The boys don't want to hear that either.\" The boys I'm referring to are Blue's best friends who carpool with us. \u00a0They are also on the spectrum. It turns out it's a good thing. \u00a0When I pick Blue up from school he is very ...well, blue, sad, over the whole ridiculous middle school thing. \u00a0The kids who tease him and try to make him feel less than. \u00a0The kids who make fun of him for being nice to a girl, and tease him that he must \"like her\". \u00a0He takes it all so personally. \u00a0His emotions and feelings are so extreme. \u00a0\u00a0Having his besties in the car usually cheers him up, but not today. By the time we pull into the driveway at home, he says to me, \"I just can't do this anymore. \u00a0I don't want to go back to school. \u00a0I'm tired of fighting with everyone at home. \u00a0I just want this all to end. \u00a0I just can't live anymore.\"\u00a0 OUCH! Blow to the gut. \u00a0Heart sinking in to the depths of the ocean. \u00a0\u00a0These are words a mother never wants to hear coming out of the mouth of her child. \u00a0I know within my heart that he doesn't really want to end his life, but he wants to end his pain. \u00a0And he wants me to understand the depth of his pain. Before we can get out of the car...here comes Red. \u00a0He couldn't wait for me to come into the house to start moaning and complaining. \u00a0I stop him in his tracks. \u00a0\"Look...your brother is feeling pretty bad right now. \u00a0I need you to go back into the house and let me deal with him, and when we come in, I need you not to agitate him and set him off. \u00a0I don't want him to end up in the hospital. \u00a0He's feeling that bad.\" Of course I get ninety questions before he actually backs off and goes into the house. I call the Neurologist who is currently prescribing his medication. \u00a0He suggest that I get him to see his Psychiatrist, or take him to the local pediatric Mental Hospital. \u00a0I am so not even trying to here this. \u00a0That place is horrid! \u00a0I had to place Red there once and I vowed never to go back there. \u00a0I don't care if I have to drive a country mile to find somewhere else for help. Blue can hear my conversation with his doctor. \u00a0He notes the serious possibility of him having to go to the hospital. \u00a0He doesn't want to go there. \u00a0I make an appointment for him to see his Psychiatrist the following day. \u00a0Meanwhile we all treat him with kit gloves doing everything we can to keep him relaxed. \u00a0I don't leave him alone at all. \u00a0Before bed, I have dad rub his back with a GABA calming cream and lavender essential oil. \u00a0We make sure he goes to bed early. \u00a0Having good rest is really important for his mood. Meanwhile, I am trying to keep Red from ranting about becoming a Professional Videographer. \u00a0He is reading all kinds of information on the internet and comes up with the ridiculous notion that he needs a $15,000. camera to make this all happen. \u00a0A friend of the family has asked him to do amateur video of a small wedding. \u00a0He thinks he can't do it without a professional camera (which he would probably have no idea how to use). \u00a0I have to explain the impracticality of his request while trying to keep him from amping up and disturbing his brother who is already off to bed. To prove his point he begins to read to me and his father a good 3 paragraphs of technical writing in support of his need for professional equipment. \u00a0He reads it so eloquently with such fluency, I'm a little taken a back. \u00a0This is the boy who says, \"I can't read! It's too hard!\" \u00a0So when he finishes reading, I stop him dead in his tracks and say, \"Hey! Is that YOU? \u00a0Reading all of that technical information so quickly and easily without making any mistakes? \u00a0So you can read!!!\" \u00a0And with that ....we all give him a round of applause and a standing ovation. He can't do anything but smile. \u00a0And thank God...he shuts up for the rest of the night! I crawl into bed, feeling a little sorry for myself, for my children, for our crazy life in this house of insanity. \u00a0I have a glass of wine or 2 as I browse through Facebook and read a couple of blogs that I follow. My friend Scotty ( John Scott Holman ), a fellow writer and Aspie, writes about being homeless right now and his father taking advantage of him, stealing his money and refusing to pay it back. I read a blog by my friend Rhonda, of \u00a0 Pugariffic -\"I Hate Autism\"\u00a0 \u00a0who has a 17 year-old son with autism who is pretty big and strong, a gentle-giant until he looses it, has a meltdown and rages, he physically hurts her, but she refuses to put him in a group home or Residential Treatment because of the barbaric conditions there. Then I read about my friend Laurie @\u00a0 Adopting Special Needs -There is no Calvary . \u00a0She writes about her adopted daughter 8 year-old Hope who has PTSD, among other things, and rages at any given moment, biting, kicking scratching and hurting her mother because she forgot her pencil in the car. \u00a0She writes how she may have to be placed in a Residential Treatment Facility so that she can no longer hurt the members of her family, all because some sicko physically and sexually abused her when she was younger. Before I close my eyes I am praying for my bloggy autism friends, and my \"Confessions\" Facebook Community\u00a0 asking God to continue to give them strength to endure the insanity that we are living through. \u00a0I pray also for my own children, and suddenly realize, my Insanity-ville is not as bad as many others. \u00a0My autism is not your autism. \u00a0It's still hurts when my child is in pain and I can't do anything to magically take it all away. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/living-in-insanity-ville.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DNnSJ3merk8/T3XOw5IIw6I/AAAAAAAAAow/3z-l7h5cHu8/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/JScottHolman?ref=ts", "http://pugariffic.blogspot.com/2012/03/i-hate-autism.html", "http://adoptivefamilyno2.blogspot.com/2012/03/there-is-no-cavalry.html", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-confessions-of-aspergers-mom.html", "title": "\nFrom Confessions of an Asperger's Mom\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Multicoloured Mayhem vs Light It Up Blue? Informing, Forming, and Responding to Public\u00a0Opinion.  (from Mar 29) \n \n \n World Autism Awareness Day (WAAD) \u00a0isn\u2019t far off, and always manages to attract a fair amount of both attention and controversy. One of the most controversial aspects of the day (for the Autism community at least) is the way that Autism Speaks has managed to somewhat hijack the day with its \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d campaign. If all the campaign did was raise awareness of autism \u2013 without importing a particular view about the nature or value of autism as a condition \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it would attract the same controversy; but the fact is that the campaign is strongly and clearly tied back to the specific charity and its views about autism, whereby the awareness being raised is about the \u201ccrisis\u201d of autism and the need for a cure. \n \n \n \nHere in New Zealand, there is awareness of the \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d campaign, but the main national autism charity \u2013\u00a0 Autism New Zealand \u00a0\u2013 uses a different campaign and message for WAAD. It\u2019s called \u201cMulticoloured Mayhem Day\u201d, and comes with a much more positive message of highlighting the differences and abilities of autistic people. The campaign\u00a0 is encouraged in schools, where children dress in colourful clothing; happily celebrating difference rather than mournfully reflecting on the existence of autism. \n \nThere was a time that I found the Multicoloured Mayhem Day to be quite deceitful and even damaging; I felt that it unhelpfully \u2013 and too simplistically \u2013 highlighted the \u201cpositive\u201d (or at least, \u201cnon-negative\u201d) aspects of autism, without addressing and raising awareness about the very harsh realities faced by autistic people. I felt that the message was directed at and about the \u201chigh functioning,\u201d to the detriment of the lower (as my son very much was at the time). This is no longer my attitude towards Multicoloured Mayhem Day. On pondering the change in my attitude towards the day, I\u2019ve had further related thoughts about awareness raising and how (and whether) awareness arising efforts should change to reflect public opinion. \n \nIn part my personal attitude towards raising awareness about autism, has changed alongside my son\u2019s abilities; the message of hope and encouraging people to see autistics like my son as capable and specially talented (if given the chance to shine), now sits closer to my concerns and hopes. Having said that, I still think the needs of the most severely affected individuals deserve the most resources and attention in\u00a0 a world of limited and competing resources , and I\u2019m still very aware that my son will face serious challenges at the end of his school days (employment, self-care in independence,\u00a0 driving , etc). So how does an \u201cawareness day\u201d deal with these seemingly conflicting messages of light hope and dark hardship? \n \n I think the answer for a condition like autism \u2013 with the word \u201cspectrum\u201d built right into the description \u2013 is obvious: First and foremost highlight the diverse realities and challenges of the condition. Indeed, this understanding of the huge diversity in abilities and outlooks for autistic people, is something very lacking in the public. I\u2019d love to see more awareness going into explaining what autism actually is, how it affects autistics (and their families), and how wide the spectrum is. That is to say, the role of informing . This approach can obviously be seen though as diluting the message; when you\u2019re trying to make people pay attention to and care about autism, it can be hard when you\u2019re \u201cinstead\u201d focusing on just describing the condition, this will be particularly true if you see the point of your organisation as one of helping the worst affected, or alternately as giving a helping hand to those who just need that extra support and understanding. \n \nI would have thought the \u201cinforming\u201d role was prior and more important than the \u201cand this is how you should all feel about the condition\u201d bit (\u201cinforming\u201d the public, rather than focused on \u201cforming\u201d public opinion), but autism community politics is legendary, and those politics obviously show through on days like WAAD. \n \nI think there is another vital consideration which came up already in what I\u2019ve mentioned; the importance of\u00a0 responding \u00a0to existing public opinion, and it is because of this particular consideration that I am coming down more so on the side of Multicoloured Mayhem (right now, and if forced to choose between the two campaigns). Lately the news about autism coming through the media is a heavily negative one, with references to crime, school shooting, hackers, and autistic children seriously hurting their siblings. Add that to\u00a0 the recent discussions about euthanizing disabled children (and the somewhat frightening public response to the issue) , and it seems a good time to be highlighting the positive and \u201cdifference\u201d aspects of autism, over the more negative / \u201clets wipe out autism\u201d (to put it coarsely) aspects. \n \nIt\u2019s easy to argue against this conclusion. For one, it can be pointed out that there are also many overly and distortingly optimistic stories out there about autism right now too; ones over-stating autistic talents for instance, alongside TV shows and movies that romanticise autism. A second argument against the idea is that if public awareness campaigns are always in \u201cresponse\u201d mode \u2013 reacting to current public sentiments \u2013 then they will have to change each year (or every few years if you prefer). This constant changing creates confusion in the public\u2019s mind, and lessens the impact generally of the approach taken any given year. Always shifting back and forth; the \u201ctruth\u201d as such, lying somewhere unspoken in-between and on both sides at the same time. \n \nAnd so ultimately I return to my previous point; that it would be rather preferable to have these awareness days focused on raising awareness of autism and its huge variations. Thus combating at a more basic level the public misunderstandings and lack of knowledge about the condition itself. In doing so, in-roads would surely be made on also combating whatever the public perceptions towards autism are at the time \u2013 whether overly negative or overly positive, understanding the diversity within the spectrum assists an understanding that both messages are (arguably) always accurate. \n \nAutism is a spectrum, of conditions and challenges and realities. Certain characteristics and issues bring together the grouping of autism, by definition; but just like the rest of humanity, people within the autism spectrum are still individuals. Individuals that can and do shift up and down the severity of the spectrum too. Autism is complicated; attempts to overly simplify the truths of autism \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 does everyone a disservice in the long run. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/multicoloured-mayhem-vs-light-it-up-blue-informing-forming-and-responding-to-public-opinion/", "http://www.un.org/en/events/autismday/", "http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-autism-awareness-day.jpg", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/rodney-times/4848396/School-celebrates-talents-of-autistic-people", "http://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/unfriendly-consequences-what-competition-for-limited-resources-does-to-the-autism-community-and-autism-families/", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/the-challenge-of-driving-with-aspergers/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "http://www.autismnz.org.nz/", "http://www.lifesitenews.com/blog/disturbingly-one-sided-tv-show-promotes-euthansizing-children-with-disabili", "http://www.lightitupblue.org/Markslist/home.do"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-autism-and-oughtisms.html", "title": "\nFrom Autism and Oughtisms\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 6, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n Assume Good Intentions: Autism Acceptance\u00a0Month \n \n \n \n \nWelcome to April. I\u2019ve been lurking around the Autism Blog-o-verse long enough to know that April is when people tend to really polarize, so much more so than the rest of the year. It\u2019s when the opinions and emotions intensify to a breaking point. When people read and judge, often without context. When we are most likely to get caught up in a wave of support for group or hate for another. When divides between different groups within the community shift to become deep schisms. April is an interesting month. Love it or hate it, it\u2019s here, and with it, all of the Awareness, Acceptance, Advocacy, and Autism that it entails. It\u2019s only the 3rd, and already, good, honest, kind people are hurting. Welcome to Autistic April. \n \nNow this is the Internet. And for some reason, on the internet, some people turn into the same people they are when they are driving super aggressively. Anonymously, they feel they can say or do whatever they want, no matter who it hurts. But most people aren\u2019t like that. Most people have good intentions. If a parent is on the internet, it is most likely that they love and care about their child and are trying to help them however they can. And if an Autistic individual is on the web, they are likely there to self-advocate and have a discussion. (Of course, this is not true for every individual, but for a vast majority it is, and thus, the assumption should be that they are reasonable people.) They may not have said or done whatever they said in a way you personally agree with, or that you find horribly offensive or seriously misguided. But chances are, when they said it, they didn\u2019t think to themselves \u201cI\u2019m going to write this essay and publish it because I think it will piss off a lot of people in the Autism Community. I\u2019m hoping to have a major argument and get nasty comments and cause a mess.\u201d Rather, it\u2019s far more likely their thought process was something along the lines of: \u201cthis is something that I think might resonate with some people. I want to help.\u201d Unfortunately, most of the time, when there\u2019s an offending essay, article, or anything else, we pounce. I think its human nature, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right reaction. In some situations, I\u2019m sure it is, but I have a simple rule that I live by, and it seems to work out pretty well. \n \n Assume Good Intentions. And give the benefit of the doubt. \n \nNow while saying something that offends someone is really not very nice, we have all been guilty of an \u201copen mouth, insert foot\u201d moment (or two or many). Sometimes we say something that is offensive. I\u2019m not perfect, and really, I\u2019m pretty sure no one is. We\u2019ve all said and done things that have offended others, usually completely accidently, coming from a place of ignorance, not a place of hate. Unfortunately, once the offense is out there, it can\u2019t be un-done. Offense is offense. I simply contend that there are multiple ways to respond. If you say or do something that offended someone, would you rather have them scream in your face about how much of an awful person you are, while dissecting everything you\u2019ve said to prove that you are terrible, or would you rather they told you, calmly, what was offensive to them and why? Which person are you more likely to apologize to? Which person makes you more likely to want to make amends and broaden the way you think? Even if you disagree completely with the person\u2019s viewpoint, agreeing to disagree, while maintaining a respectful dialogue is progress. Exchanging verbal blows simply alienates, which is exactly the last thing we want. \n \nAnd after all, it is April. Like many people out there in the Autism Community, my hope is that this April, there will be increased dialogue. I keep reading things like \u201cawareness is easy\u201d and most people are already \u201caware\u201d of Autism. They\u2019ve heard the word before. They have an idea of what it is. For most people outside the Autism Community, it\u2019s a stereotypical, completely untrue image. But we want more than Awareness. We want Acceptance. And without dialogue there is no acceptance. So during this incredibly triggering month, allow yourself to be triggered. But before you respond, take a deep breath, assume good intentions, and if you choose to engage, do so in a positive, constructive way. Because it\u2019s how you would want to be treated in the same situation, and\u00a0 because kindness, honesty, and discussion are what lead to understanding. And understanding is what ultimately leads to acceptance. \n \nHappy Autistic April! \n \n \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \n \nSome post-scripts and notes: \n \nThere are certainly some nasty awful people online, and honestly with those people, I find that if they don\u2019t respond to kindness, then I simply disengage. Those most likely aren\u2019t the minds we will be able to change, anyway. HOWEVER I simply contend that most people online are NOT awful people. Especially many parents out there\u2026 they want the best for their kids. They want their children to grow up well. They LOVE their children, want what\u2019s best for their children, want to give them the best opportunities in life that they can have. They are inherently GOOD PEOPLE. This doesn\u2019t mean I agree with all that many parents do ( remember, my parents abused me, physically and mentally, for my Autistic traits, in their misguided attempts to \u201cfix\u201d me , an extreme of a situation that many young people live daily). It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t cringe inside when I hear a parent say \u201cI hate Autism and everything about it. I want to cure my child and rid him/her of it completely.\u201d Hearing those things hurts. Knowing that many people believe someone like me shouldn\u2019t exist hurts. But responding with direct anger only leads to escalation, and more pain and misunderstanding, on both sides. We say bullying is so awful. But sometimes we dish it right back. \n \nThere are a LOT of opinions, topics, and other things out there in the world of Autism. What works for some people doesn\u2019t work for others. People have lived a multitude of lives and experiences surrounding Autism, and that diversity is what makes this community so great. But it\u2019s also what makes the community so volatile, and when we hit April it intensifies. I know there\u2019s a lot of frustration with \u201cawareness done wrong\u201d, and I share a lot of that frustration too. It\u2019s very frustrating when well-intentioned people organize \u201cawareness events\u201d without ever consulting the group of people they are trying to bring awareness of. It\u2019s infuriating and often incredibly hurtful when people ignore Autistic voices, and talk about us as a public health crisis or an epidemic that needs to be eradicated. But if we want awareness and further, acceptance, done right, we have a responsibility to lead by example.\u00a0 If we want respect, we must give it. If we want to be heard, we must listen, too. \u00a0There is absolutely a time and a place for conflict, but it shouldn\u2019t be our first reaction. Reach out with compassion. It\u2019s likely that the person you\u2019re reaching out to will respond similarly. Give the benefit of the doubt, and assume good intentions. Acceptance takes time. It takes work. It takes enduring an awful lot of awfulness. But compassion generates dialogue. And dialogue brings consideration, understanding, and maybe even acceptance. But any one of those steps is better than the alienation, distrust, hate, and anger that come from conflicts where we make the wrong assumption. I\u2019m not advocating letting others walk all over us. I\u2019m not suggesting that we just let the offensive material stand and go unchecked. It shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying \u201cdon\u2019t get angry\u201d. Anger is an important emotion. I\u2019m simply saying that anger isn\u2019t always the best response. Sometimes it is. Anger is easy. But sadly, what is easy is not always best. \n \nAnd to officially end the end of the post-script to the post (say that 5 times fast): \n \n \n\u201cWe have to choose between what is right, and what is easy.\u201d \n \n\u2013 J.K.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n\n Labelled With Love (Alphabet Street?) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTall, stumpy, beautiful, minger, fat, skinny, clever, thick, odd, boring, quirky, loud, lazy, blonde, ginger, selfish, slutty, bald, hirstute.... Labels are all around. They are attributed to us to mark out our differences to the herd so that we can sort out life's rich tapestry into pigeon-holeable categories. Us humanoids are quick to judge and categorise - presumably some deep-rooted self-preservation instinct. \n \n \n \nHowever, the subject of labelling kids - to willingly attach a label, highlighting their differences, to your own flesh and blood - brings a whole orchestra of tooth-sucking and \"expert\" (you know the type I mean) opinions! \"There's a label for everything these days\", \"ooh people are so quick to label their children - we're getting so American\"!!!!! \"It's all to do with Bad Parenting\" (?!!!) There are all sorts of negative articles about the stigma and damage that labels can bring. \n \n \n \nWhen I was at school I can't remember any of my classmates sporting any clinical diagnoses of anything. There was always the \"square\", the \"boffin\", the \"thicko\" or the \"weirdo\". Yep - who needed educational psychologists - anyone slightly different and we just made up our own labels and stuck them on with super-long-lasting glue. Kids are pretty unforgiving. Differences scare them. Their form of self-preservation is group attack. Horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach that I might have had a part in this filthy show of human nature - I wish I could find those poor kids and apologise, be their friend, protect them.... Sigh. And what happened to them? Did a whole school career of being negatively defined by their classmates lead them to happy and fulfilling lives - god, I hope so. I hope they found their dreams and shouted \"F**k You, losers - look at me in my big shiny car with my wonderful career and perfect life, you cruel bastards\". But let's get real. They possibly have lives pitted with low self esteem, trust issues, depression etc etc etc. Oh how sorry I am. I just wanted to be \"normal\", part of the majority....not noticeably different... \n \n \n \nFast forward to now and most classrooms have at least one kid with a diagnosis of something: ADHD, Dyslexia, OCD, Dyspraxia, ASD - some kids even have two or more labels since a lot of these conditions go hand-in-hand - then they get a special collective label - \"Alphabet Kids\". Jaysus. Who knew? \n \n \n \nSo J is \"labelled\" with ASD (an Autistic Spectrum Disorder). High Functioning Autism. He has a Statement of Educational Needs. He gets Disability Allowance. He attends an ASD specific unit attached to a mainstream school. He gets speech therapy and occupational therapy. His label marks him out as different to \"normal\" kids of his age. And different he is - quirky, hilarious (his favourite word, incidentally!), scarily clever, socially inept and unable to deal with many everyday situations. His label is not debatable - he looks like an angel (when he's not constantly picking his nose!) but his \"differences\" are setting him apart from the crowd more and more as he gets older. However, he is in the right place, getting the right support and spends several sessions a week in a mainstream class (with support). \n \n \n \nI have no issue with J's label and don't think I'd find anyone who does because his autism is fact. It is thankfully recognised as one of the big hitters these days. The ASD label brings much needed help and support (in some areas but not others....whole other post...grr) \n \n \n \nIt's the kids who are on the cusp of \"normal\" that fall through the gaps. The ones who, to all intents and purposes, can look like they're coping in a normal classroom setting. Many of the diagnoses that encompass what, on the surface, looks like \"bad behaviour\" are the tricky ones - this is the grey area that causes the tooth sucking debates. A lot of the behaviour looks like an exaggerated version of normal kid behaviour - figeting, bumping into things, hair twiddling, constant trips to the toilet, impulsiveness, lack of self control, too much talking, rudeness to figures of authority........ you get the idea. In a society where One Size of Education is supposed to Fit All (unless you're minted and can go Private) these Square Pegs are going to come to light. Particularly when they reach Secondary Education where teachers take no prisoners - it's all about results and not at all about individuals as far as I can gather (Shudder). This is where the debate comes in. Should they be labelled? Would a label make them feel more different or would it be a relief to them to know that they're neurologically programmed slightly differently to their buddies and can get some extra support? Would they grow out of their behaviour eventually without a diagnosis? Would a label become a self-fulfilling prophecy? \n \n \n \nI really don't know the answer to this. I've thought about it a lot. I do wish people didn't use that word \"Labelled\" though - it sounds like a Stigma which is crazy considering the fact that many really successful people have/had similar conditions: Einstein - possibly Aspergers/ADHD; Mozart - possibly on the autistic spectrum/ADHD; Gary Newman - Aspergers; Stephen Wiltshire - High Functioning Autism; Daryl Hannah - mild autism; Tom Cruise - ADHD.... The list goes on. If the L word was replaced with \"Recognised as being a perfectly acceptable and wonderful human being who struggles with a few areas of life and could really do with a bit of help now and again and a bit more understanding and a lot less judging\" then that would be make the debate a no-brainer! To my mind - my adult mind - being different is just fine. Great, actually. I'm drawn to quirky interesting people. I love eccentrics. I've never particularly liked conforming. But kids hate to be different. So what would a label do to them? To their self esteem? \n \n \n \nActually, I think it depends on the individual. Differences are ok. It's down to whether those differences are causing an impairment for the child or not. Are they stressed out of their minds? Do they cry a lot? Is their work suffering? Are they getting told off a lot in class? Do they struggle with friendships? Are they being labelled anyway by the other kids? Are they angry and frustrated at home? Are they getting less and less invites to parties/playdates? If any of this is the case then, as parents, and knowing that there's help out there (and \"help\" doesn't always mean drugs - there's a whole host of other methods/therapies etc as well) , I think we'd be very very wrong (and cloyingly British!) to brush our concerns under the carpet and ignore the situation and refuse the label. If the child is quirky, but happy then all power to them but please please please watch out for any signs of bullying when they get into secondary school. \n \n \n \nBlimey, it's a minefield. And here's the skinny: I know a little boy who is struggling. He says he's rubbish. He hates school. He finds it very very hard to sit still. Friendships are tricky for him. His self esteem is at rock bottom. He is hugely knowledgeable about the history of video games. His peers sometimes call him a cry baby. He has a lot of irrational fears. He is extremely bright and funny. He is very over-sensitive. He finds change very hard. He has a brother with autism. He is different. His parents don't want those differences to be seen as negatives and have started on the quest to get him some help to be happier. They have come to the conclusion that if a label will help and therefore make his life happier, then bring it on. He's a very loved, loving and totally cool kid. I should know. He's mine. \n \n \n \n \n \n POSTED BY\u00a0 WISHIHADAKARMAANGHIA\u00a0 AT\u00a0 13:20 \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism-somethoughts.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/labelled-with-love-alphabet-street.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-df6x5amI46E/TVPsZY2Ki6I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/IKmxpQOC7w0/s1600/odd-one-out-2.jpg", "http://www.blogger.com/profile/01567554348537949592", "http://autism-somethoughts.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/labelled-with-love-alphabet-street.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-everything-starts-with-a.html", "title": "\nFrom EVERYTHING STARTS WITH AN A\n"},

Because, awareness is great but\u00a0 ACCEPTANCE \u00a0is so much more important. \n \nAnd, finally, I\u2019d like to encourage you to visit the\u00a0 Autistic Self Advocacy Network .\u00a0 The name speaks for itself as the organization empowers Autistics to speak for themselves. \n \n If you don\u2019t live with autism, it may be hard to understand why it is so important to listen to the voices of those who actually are autistic. These are the voices which will help us shape the future for our children, open the minds (and doors!) of employers, educators, business leaders and politicians about what is possible for so many people who are otherwise marginalized because of myriad manifestations of autism. These are the voices which can help us establish more and better supports for adults with autism once they leave the school system. \n \n Their voices can help shed a light on the tremendous potential within each person regardless of how autism affects them. The potential within each person may not be the same, but the potential to be so much more than what meets the eye is far greater than you might imagine. \n \n Only through dispelling the myths and the fears, through support and acceptance \u2014true acceptance, can we empower each autistic person to meet their potential. \n \nSo, um, I guess THAT is what we\u2019ll be doing for the month \u2014 and always ; helping our son find his \u201cvoice\u201d and meet his potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/moving-from-awareness-to-acceptance/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/author/niksmom/", "http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2012/p0329_autism_disorder.html", "http://www.un.org/en/events/autismday/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/accidental-advocate/", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2012/03/autism-awareness-begins-at-home.html", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/awareness-2012/", "http://stimcity.org/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2012/03/26/autism-awareness-month-and-month-military-child", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2012/03/26/autism-awareness-month-and-month-military-child", "http://cmkaa.org/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2012/04/autistics-slice-of-life-autism.html", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://maternalinstincts.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/promote-what-you-love.jpg", "http://maternalinstincts.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/100_2505.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-niksmom.html", "title": "\nFrom Niksmom\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 11, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Winning Against\nMesothelioma\u00a0 \n \n \n http://www.mesothelioma.com/blog/authors/heather \n \n \n My world just seemed to\ncrumble on November 21, 2005. I had three and a half month old child, my only\nchild, and I had just been diagnosed with cancer. It was malignant  pleural mesothelioma , a very deadly type of cancer. At this time I realized that I was\ngoing to have to face one of my biggest fears, facing a deadly illness, and\nthat I was going to have to be stronger than I ever realized possible.  \n \n I was referred to Dr.\nDavid Sugarbaker, the world's leading mesothelioma doctor, at Boston's Brigham\nand Women's Hospital. He helped me to have hope and boost my confidence. He\nhelped me to believe that I would beat this cancer and live to see my daughter\ngrow up. With a survival rate of only 2% after five years, it was very\ndiscouraging, but I was determined to be a part of that small percentage of\nmesothelioma patients who lived. I would win this fight against cancer. I spent\nthe next year using every bit of energy I had to fight this disease. I had to\ntravel to Boston, about 1900 miles away from my daughter, now six months old,\nwho was staying with my parents while I fought this cancer. I had surgery that\nremoved my left lung and all of the lining around it where the tumor was. After\nsurgery, I spent months undergoing  treatment\nfor mesothelioma  which included chemo\ntherapy and radiation, but I continued to raise my daughter. I spent the first\nyear of her life battling cancer, but she knew nothing of it. We had a huge\ncelebration for her first birthday. Friends and family traveled from all over\nto not only celebrate Lily's birthday, but also to celebrate the fact that I\nwas winning my fight against cancer. It was only one month short of a year\nafter being diagno sed that I finished my last treatment.\nI promised myself I would never have cancer again.  \n \n I learned many things\nthrough that year of fighting against cancer and the years that followed. Now I\ndo not take things for granted. My cancer made me look at everything\ndifferently. Now I appreciate the little things in life much more. My\ndaughter's laughter, a puppy's breath, a rainbow after the rain are all reminders\nto me of how precious life is and that I need to LIVE.  \n \n There are so many\namazing people that I've met along this journey; people who will forever remain\nin my heart. It is the people who tried with all their might and still lost\ntheir battles, the people who support and care for their loved ones while they\nare fighting cancer and those who have won their battles who continue to\ninspire me with their determination. I want to raise awareness of mesothelioma\non their behalf. Mesothelioma is a real disease that affects real people.  \n \n I'm living my life as\nbest as I can, being grateful for everything. Even when I have bad days I\nremain thankful. In my eyes, this is what life is about.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mesothelioma.com/blog/authors/heather", "http://www.mesothelioma.com/mesothelioma/types/pleural.htm", "http://www.mesothelioma.com/treatment", "", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lH-Zxyi7gck/T4YYm5Nmm1I/AAAAAAABDxI/_IAD3OmmtW8/s1600/Heather+and+Family.jpg"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/guest-post-winning-against-mesothelioma.html", "title": "\nGuest Post: Winning Against Mesothelioma\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 12, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Autism Freaking Awareness Month. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYay. It's April. It's Autism Awareness Month, and to celebrate, me and the five million other people who blog about autism have set out to piss each other the hell off. Or at least, some think we do. Ughghggg. \n \n This is what autism looks like. So handsome. \n \nIt's tough. I think we go into this \"community\" thinking that because our children have the same diagnoses, we are ALL the same. It's totally ironic. We shout from the rooftops about how great it is to be different, but the minute someone thinks differently from us, to hell with them! ( This isn't just an autism community thing. It happens everywhere. ) Just like autism is a spectrum, parenting a child with autism is a spectrum. We approach it differently.\u00a0 We have our own beliefs as to\u00a0 where it came from, \u00a0 how to treat it , and\u00a0 how to help others .\u00a0 And that's good.\u00a0 I have my own beliefs. I have my own damn blog. You're here. You're reading it.\u00a0 These are MY views. They are not that of the autism parent community and definitely not shared by people who HAVE autism themselves.\u00a0 Where it Comes From: This question is huge. And it's a huge source of fighting within the community. Despite all of the research, the vaccine debate rears its ugly head in too much of the source-of-autism discussions. I do not believe that vaccines CAUSED Casey's autism. I think this jump in numbers of autism cases sort of lends itself to \"proof\" that vaccines don't cause autism. If they did, this anti-vax movement would have AT THE VERY LEAST slowed the prevalence of autism. It has not. I do believe that\u00a0better diagnostic criteria can be attributed to the rise. It doesn't nearly explain ALL of it though. If so, there would be a HUGE subset of adults who are autistic and were never diagnosed. It's called the \"Hidden Hoard\" theory. Granted, I think there are A LOT of people who have high-functioning autism who were never diagnosed, but that still doesn't account for all of those who went undiagnosed. But what it really comes down to is that we just. don't. know.\u00a0 Which makes research so vital. Treating Autism There are the Mommy Warriors. The Jenny McCarthyers, who say you can \"cure\" autism through diet, cleanses of different sorts, vitamins, etc.\u00a0 There are the behaviorists. These believe that the way to \"cure\" or treat autism is through a regimented program ( ABA and the like ) that is akin to a full-time job for kids on the spectrum.\u00a0 There are those who don't treat it at all. They think it's completely natural. And then there is EVERYTHING in between. I get comments from people ALL OF THE TIME about how it's wrong that I medicate Casey. Their child does not have the same autism my child has. If your child can be \"cured\" through Music Therapy, your child does not have the same autism.\u00a0 I treat my kid based on my own research, his personality, my personality, and his medical and behavioral needs. I personally do not believe that he will be \"cured\" and I think this \"curing\" autism speak is dangerous. Not all kids on the spectrum respond to dietary changes\u00a0 (Casey didn't) , not all kids need or can do 40 hours a week of ABA.\u00a0 You treat your child based on their needs. Don't compare your child to others and please, for the\u00a0 love , do not tell another parent that what they are doing is wrong just because it's not how YOU would do it. If they are asking for your opinion or help, that's one thing. But to seek out parents to preach to is something else completely. Helping Others\u00a0 \n \n If we all believed staunchly that research was key, we'd all go to every Autism Speaks walk and hold hands and sing. But we don't.\u00a0 I understand the criticisms of Autism Speaks. Too much money spent on ads you don't agree with, too much money spent on research, not enough spent on services towards individual families.\u00a0 Many have criticized the amount of money that the head of Autism Speaks makes ( $391,892; the highest paid employee of Autism Speaks, the Chief Science Officer, makes $456,420\u00a0 ). It's a lot of damn money. It does make me cringe a little when I think of how hard I worked to raise the little money I did for the Autism Walk\u00a0the year after Casey was diagnosed, only to have it\u00a0go to make someone rich. But then I looked into it. Check out the salaries of the top paid people at these organizations: American Cancer Society: $2,222,000 American Red Cross: $1,000,000 Susan G. Komen: $481,000 United Way: $864,000 ( figures are from www.charitywatch.com, verified through BBB Charities ) These non-profits are run JUST like other businesses. In order to grow the charities, they need to compete; in order to compete, they need to have CEO's\u00a0who know what they are doing. It may not be right, but it's the way it is. If you don't like it, don't support them. I do believe that Autism Speaks ( and the other organizations listed above ) does a lot of good. Autism Speaks is educating people. They are raising awareness. They are giving families who are newly diagnosed some direction. The reality is that they can't help every family with a child with Autism.\u00a0 There are just\u00a0TOO many of us.\u00a0 They should have more on their staff who have autism themselves. I think it would prevent some of the outrage that has come over some of their ad campaigns and terminology. Regardless, they aren't going to be able to make everyone happy. There are many fantastic organizations that deal mostly in research. Research is important. It will help future generations in better diagnostics and treating. I particularly like http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/ . If you believe in the importance of good research, this is a great organization to give to. For Autism Awareness Month, I'm asking the same thing I asked last year: for your help. Specifically, to help parents YOU KNOW who have children with autism. \u00a0Call a mother of a child with autism and ask her if you can take her kid(s) for a couple of hours. Respite is what I think we, as parents, need most. And it's really one of the hardest things to get. With Abby, I got respite just because she has an extra chromosome. She got the funding for it right away. For parents of children with autism, even here in Virginia, it's TERRIBLY tough to get. I looked into it with Casey. The waiting list is 5 years. He's been on the waiting list for respite services in Washington State since he was 18 months old.\u00a0 Autism is TOUGH, there is very little relief. We don't sleep. We deal with more stress than I think others would even believe.\u00a0\u00a0 If you don't have the capacity for whatever reason to babysit a child with autism, send their parents a check. Tell them to get a babysitter. Or even just get a movie and treats to watch after they've sedated their child for the night. But not us. Lance and I are good. We get a lot of help from the wonderful people around us. We have our nanny coming. \u00a0So not us. \u00a0You have to know someone else who has a child with Autism. If you do not, email me, I'll send you an address. Do something, then tell me.\u00a0 I'd LOVE to hear what you did.\u00a0 Back to my original thought. Autism is a spectrum. The ways we approach it and deal with it are going to be as different as our children are. As we are. And that's okay. If you disagree with me, that's totally fine! In fact, I welcome it! It's how I learn about other points of view. It's how I see things I haven't seen. If nothing else, it gives me someone to fight with. My husband won't fight with me. But remember, not everyone who speaks their mind wants to be fought with. Sometimes they're just airing things out as a way of dealing with them. Working through them. My views on autism have changed a lot in the last seven years. I'm still learning. Be nice to the jerks who aren't as awesome as you. And, I'm a little late, but I'm linking up over at\u00a0 Adventures In Extreme Parenthood , if it's not too late. If it is, Sunday, I will murder you in your sleep. Love. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mostlytruestuff.com/2012/04/autism-freaking-awareness-month.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1J62pzY1NeA/T3i16qanl6I/AAAAAAAAC7U/CE_58bc1uxk/s1600/6122518911_951f796bf8_o.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--wM6P9tLPE8/T3ivduAur8I/AAAAAAAAC68/ZxI2qdbfdYg/s1600/images.jpg", "http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/health/autism-speaks-in-new-york-ny-1456", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GrNZjU3k4W0/T3i1EpDtJWI/AAAAAAAAC7M/bt5MJcW8xL8/s1600/ddddd.jpg", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.extremeparenthood.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gmviCYF1igk/T3i4oTJfmCI/AAAAAAAAC7c/WXEtWs55Rvw/s1600/rg.png"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-mostly-true-stuff.html", "title": "\nFrom Mostly True Stuff\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 14, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n The Hard\u00a0Things \n \nApril 2, 2012 at 11:55 am  ( Autism ,\u00a0 Autspeaks doesn't speak for me ,\u00a0 Stigma ) ( autism acceptance , autistic pride ,\u00a0 Baltimore ,\u00a0 hard things ,\u00a0 joy ,\u00a0 neurodiversity ,\u00a0 Southwest Airlines ,\u00a0 the hard things ) \n \nOften, but especially this month, there tends to be a false equivalency that gets promoted- that Neurodiversity advocates ignore the hard things, or that we don\u2019t experience the hard things. From there, self-advocates are told that we can\u2019t speak to the lives of other, usually younger, Autistics. \u00a0Obviously this is false. The hard things are a part of our lives, are a core part of them. \n \nOn the 18th of March, I had to go to Baltimore. To manage airports, I have a pretty set script that I follow in order to make sure that I make it through the airport and flights. Usually it works fairly well, and if I get confused I let a security person know I\u201dm Autistic and it typically works out. The first time I went through security by myself, I had a TSA agent walk me through the security point step by step. (I have a soft spot for Pittsburgh, PA\u2019s TSA agents as they\u2019ve treated me fairly well. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else\u2019s experiences though.) I\u2019ve had people let me be or give me appropriate instructions when I\u2019ve lost words. Mostly I have decent experiences. Not as peaceful as trains, but decent. \n \nExcept this time I flew southwest, and their gate check process is different. Instead of picking your bag up at the gate, they put it through to the\u00a0carousel\u00a0in bag claim, and instead count it as a late bag check. A bit nerve wracking as I rarely if ever do a regular bag check. But this wasn\u2019t the hard part. Nor was sitting on the floor next to the assigned\u00a0baggage\u00a0carousel for an hour. (I took video of myself rocking there, and it is edited in with other video on my youtube\u00a0channel.) But by the time I got through what my bag looked like, I couldn\u2019t verbalize words any longer. The words went away. Thankfully the BWI Southwest baggage customer service acted like it wasn\u2019t unusual at all for someone to get out a netbook and start typing instead of talking. I also had to get help getting on the van- which was directly across the room- to the hotel. \n \nThat evening, I had to leave dinner because I couldn\u2019t sit upright any more. My brain was completely done, and I poured coffee on the table because I could no longer judge where my cup was in space. The next morning, I couldn\u2019t get out of bed because I had no clean clothes. The very thought of putting on dirty clothes Shut me down for hours. Thankfully, the thing I was at was Developmental Disability centered, so the organizers were understanding, ordered me lunch, managed dealin with the airline and hotel, and the person I was supposed to facilitate with took over my duties. (Thank you Nachama!) \n \nAnd this is only a mildly hard \u201cday.\u201d \n \nEven the tiny Hard things add up. Loud noises making me need to hide, camera flashes leaving me utterly disoriented, the wrong smells, colors, and textures- the little hard things could make me have issues where I would normally have none or even where I\u2019d normally\u00a0excel. I curl up in a ball in a grocery store because I don\u2019t know the practical steps rather than economic difference between using credit and debit. I sit on floors in airports for hours because I can\u2019t figure out the steps to get to my hotel.\u00a0 I get C-Diff or MRSA because I can\u2019t remember when to clean . I pee myself because I hear the wrong noise and become scared. I can\u2019t tell until the last moment that I need the restroom, and then I better get running before I forget or lose control. \n \nA thousand tiny hard things. \n \nI had to live off campus because I didn\u2019t understand paperwork for housing and couldn\u2019t figure out that I needed help. I had to drop out of school and became house bound for 6 months because I didn\u2019t understand or know how to ask for help with school tuition or paperwork. I watched my carefully laid goals collapse, and can\u2019t do anything beyond repress and hide when people I know graduate or talk about completing midterms. I lose my ability to conceptualize my goals after having plans go awry. \n \nA thousand hard things. \n \nBecoming homeless for a thousand tiny reasons. Being unable to navigate the housing system, and having to rely almost entirely on my Intensive Case Manager to even fill out the forms let alone deal with the people. Having difficulty with a form because I want to answer truthfully but have no idea how much people have spent buying me toilet paper- and then crying, pacing, yelling the same phrase repeatedly and staring at blank walls. Hiding in my 3 year old\u00a0niece\u2019s\u00a0closet because I can\u2019t calm myself, can\u2019t process my environment further to get away from what is bothering me. Being trapped in town because I can\u2019t speak that day and I need to find a way out. \n \nHard things. \n \nKnowing something is wrong, large or small, and not having the words for it for 5 years. Being told I\u2019m articulate when I can\u2019t get my basic needs across to be met. Trying to report abuse, and not having the words to articulate it yet- then having my call dismissed because of my disabilities and inability to articulate it. Pressing myself into walls or running into them full stop because the pressure is soothing and I can\u2019t get my world to stop- and then being treated poorly for daring to do so. Being put through unneeded procedures because my self soothing behaviors look scary to others, and echoing (oh echolalia!) their words back when they ask why I do them- Is it because of self hate, self loathing? Do you want to die?- because I don\u2019t have the words yet to tell them how it really feels in my head. \n \nLife is full of hard things. \n \nBut the hard things don\u2019t make that life less worthy. It doesn\u2019t make it okay to deny accessibility. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t adjust a little- and often to mutual benefit- to make the world more navigable to us. \n \nThe Hard Things don\u2019t take the joy out of it. It doesn\u2019t make the self soothing activities less self soothing. It doesn\u2019t take the joy of observing the infinite diversity of our world within even human neurology- a joy that we can share, if we are willing, despite having infinitely diverse faiths or even having none at all. It doesn\u2019t make my niece\u2019s bringing me my stuffed cat less an act of love. That my former cat, \u2018baka, was my service animal that I needed to help me self regulate doesn\u2019t make my affection- nor even my grief at her passing- less deep. \n \nThe Hard Things, though, mean that you will look at them and say: \n \n \nI don\u2019t want that for my kid. \n \nThat is not safe. \n \nThat is too strange to do in public. \n \nIf you\u2019d only \u201cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d and get over it, the hard things wouldn\u2019t be hard. \n \nYour tears and meltdowns prove my point of your\u00a0incompetence/that you will always be a child. \n \n \ninstead of finding a way to make the hard things livable. Instead of accepting that I need help today even if I didn\u2019t yesterday. That I am an adult who is able to make my own choices- even when they are bad ones. That the reason it\u2019s so strange is because of repression. That there are ways to make this all safe. That risk is a part of being human. \n \nThat there is joy in being one\u2019s self. \n \n Written for\u00a0 Autism Acceptance Day and Month .

{"date": "Friday, April 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Reflecting on World Autism Day \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhenever I see a comment that says \"Autism is everyday, not just once a year\" in reference to Autism Day, I have to pause for a moment. Some say that just to add to awareness, but some are genuinely insulted that there is a day on the calendar named for our cause. And that's not just the cause of people like me who are lucky enough to be verbal, or parents working with their children, but everyone who lives with autism,\u00a0 everyone . Having a day on the calendar given to us in this manner is not to suggest that people should only pay attention to autism once a year. It is a grand step towards educating and awareness and we should all be proud of it and thankful for it. Every step that goes towards awareness is a good one and having a day is no small achievement. And lets also not forget that April is also\u00a0 Autism Awarenes Month ! Let me put it another way with an example. Take Veteran's day. Veterans should be thanked whenever you come across them, not just once a year. But there's a lot more to veterans day than that, isn't there? It's a day set to commemorate them and honor them. Yes, to those of us who live with autism, it's every day. To those who don't, we need to not expect people to wake up and pay homage to autism every day. There's only so much you can expect out of people who don't live with it. There's a fine line between education (awareness) and shoving something down someone's throat. Don't shove it down their throats, the results always turn out bad. Now, look how far Autism Day has come. It's gone from being celebrated with blurbs in the newspaper to being heralded on all media sources. I saw an advertisement that said \"make it blue\" and liked that. It's for awareness and everyone sees it. It won't be long before you go buy a calendar and find it marked on that day. That's a great achievement towards awareness. So I say \"thank you\" for autism day! Thank you for\u00a0a day that brings awareness to so many people across the globe. Thank you for a day I don't have to break my own back to give out that awareness. Thank you for a day that may mean less stigma and more understanding for a growing issue. Thank you for showing me how much you are trying to understand. The day is an honor, not an insult. It's recognition, not ignorance.

{"date": "Sunday, April 15, 2012", "body": "\n Apparently the CDC recently released a study claiming that now 1 in 88 children have autism. \u00a0I\u2019ve been seeing a large number of articles and blogs about that, with lots of speculation as to why it could be happening. \u00a0The answers seem to largely be split between \u201cbetter testing\u201d and the usual conspiracy theorists talking about vaccines or \u201ctoxins\u201d or other such things. \u00a0I did, however, find two articles to be particularly interesting. This article \u00a0\u00a0was one that I found talking about the issue. \u00a0There was one particular sentence towards the end that really jumped out at me. \u00a0\u201d[The CDC] checked health and school records to see which children met the criteria for autism, even if they hadn\u2019t been formally diagnosed.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s just me, but that seems very, very odd. \u00a0Health and school records do not a diagnosis make. \u00a0Instead, what it seems to be is that 1 in 88 children\u00a0 might \u00a0have an autism spectrum disorder, but it does not seem at all reasonable to treat that statistic like an actual fact, given how it was achieved. This brings me to a\u00a0 blog post \u00a0\u00a0I found talking about the issue. \u00a0In it, a parent of a child with a developmental delay (DD) cautiously speculates that maybe an increasing number of children with DD might be getting lumped in with autism, even if they don\u2019t actually fit. \u00a0Why might this be happening? \u00a0Well, there is a lot of overlap. \u00a0They can look superficially similar, and it can require more careful testing to determine what is actually going on. \u00a0Even worse, parents have incentive to diagnose their developmentally delayed child with autism, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s accurate because apparently right now autistic children get better support and more services than children with other developmental delays. I was actually rather shocked when I read that last article. \u00a0Not just because of what it said, but because I realized that in my ponderings on Asperger\u2019s and autism, thoughts of other DDs had never even crossed my mind. \u00a0I like the idea of neurodiversity and autism pride and celebrating differences and all that stuff, but how can I champion neurodiversity while privileging ASDs above other forms of DDs or neurological differences? \u00a0The answer is \u2013 I can\u2019t. \u00a0Yes, my personal focus is Asperger\u2019s because that\u2019s what I have, but I can at least keep in mind that there is more to neurodiversity than autism and NTs (neurotypicals). \u00a0April is autism awareness month, which I\u2019m sure is a good thing for many people, but I think for me it\u2019s also a good time to remember that there are other things that also deserve awareness, and they seem to be getting lost in the noise. All of which leads me to speculate if maybe the people doing that CDC study were unconsciously privileging autism as well \u2013 lumping children with overlapping symptoms into autism, even if they fit something else better. \u00a0I guess that\u2019s another way of saying that I\u2019m not so sure I trust this 1 in 88 statistic. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com/news/autism-rates-now-1-88-some-attribute-better-testing-37782942", "http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/blog/2012/03/29/a-very-cautious-guess-about-the-spike-in-autism/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-blog-aspergers-and-me.html", "title": "\nFrom the blog \"Asperger's and Me\"\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 16, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n ABA: Methods versus Mission \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Big Daddy with blue hair for Autism Awareness and Acceptance Month. It has nothing to do with the post, but I just had to share it. He is the coolest man on the planet. \n \n \n Selecting a therapy for a kid on the spectrum is a little like deciding on a religion. \u00a0Each therapeutic technique has its own set of beliefs, rules, objectives, and techniques... a little like religions. What do you believe about autism? Is autism something to be \"cured\", to be \"tolerated\", to be \"accommodated\", or is it to be \"celebrated\"? How do you think autism works? \u00a0Is it a brain\u00a0 disorder , a neurological \u00a0difference , a whole body\u00a0 disease ? What is the purpose of therapy... \u00a0to change behavior?... to alter brain functioning?... to provide and adapt information processing methods to better fit the neurological picture? What is the outcome desired for therapy: \u00a0being 'normal'?.... highest level of functioning?.... optimization of potential? What you believe about autism can fundamentally effect what type of therapy you choose for your child. This is why I believe that research into the causes of autism is so important: \u00a0once we have a better sense about the why, shaping the beliefs about autism's meaning becomes a little easier to accomplish. \u00a0And then, decisions about therapy can be guided by those beliefs. \u00a0But this is for another discussion, perhaps. Today I wanted to discuss the difference between therapeutic methods and the mission of the therapy. Huh? Okay, bear with me, because I am probably going to fumble along with this post. Anyone who has been following J-man's story knows the following: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* He has autism and apraxia of speech \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* He has been in some kind of therapy since he was 16 months old (ST, OT, ABA, EI) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* We had some serious issues with putting him in ABA and have had both tremendous successes and\u00a0frustrations since he has been in the program. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* I personally like more relational styles like Floortime or Communicating Partners. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* I believe that autism is a neurological difference in which the communication between the different areas of the brain is altered, and it makes things like language and social communication difficult. \u00a0I also believe that the capacity of the autistic brain to develop is tremendous but requires different methods and techniques than a neurotypical brain. \u00a0 \u00a0 * We believe J-man is awesome and his potential is unlimited. There are other things that I believe it is important to mention: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0I believe \u00a0all\u00a0 children deserve to learn how to be in this world, and ability or disability should not exempt them from this. \u00a0Even the hard stuff. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0I believe every child learns differently and is motivated to learn for different reasons. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0Behaviors exist for different reasons, and the decision to increase, decrease, or change a behavior needs to be weighted with the reason the behavior exists and the reasons to change the behavior. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0Communication and connectedness are more important than words. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0We convey messages to our children via our actions moreso than our words. Recently I have been observing a lot of debates about the benefits and drawbacks to different therapeutic techniques. \u00a0I'll be honest, most of these debates have been on (in-your)Facebook... *sigh*... but a few have been in Real Life, in relation to the legislative work I have been doing this year. \u00a0I have found some of these debates particularly interesting, and I have noticed that often the arguments fail to differentiate the\u00a0 methods versus the\u00a0 mission . So I thought I would take a stab at it. \u00a0 \u00a0 And I am going to pick on ABA. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Cause it is just soooo easy.... ABA, or\u00a0 Applied Behavioral Analysis , is one therapeutic technique that tends to generate a lot of heated discussion. \u00a0ABA takes a task or behavior, breaks it into its smallest parts and builds upon each part is a systematic way in order to eventually get to the full behavioral step. \u00a0It focuses solely on observable behavior and each step is tracked through through data collection. \u00a0It is not concerned with internal processes, merely on what can be externally seen and tracked. \u00a0Largely that is because it comes from the behaviorist tradition in which the focus is merely on observable behavior and its relationship to the environment. \u00a0The internal world of thought, cognition, and feelings was of little importance to the behaviorists, and while that extreme position may not be adhered to as strictly today, it has definitely informed the ABA tradition. As a result of its focus on specific observable (and trackable) behaviors and its strict adherence to external environmental factors in shaping behavior (reinforcers, punishers, etc), ABA has a wealth of data that shows it is highly effective at changing behavior. \u00a0Period. \u00a0As a method, it works. \u00a0If you want a behavior changed, you can get behavior change with ABA. If you want to teach a task, or shape attention, or increase or decrease a certain behavior, ABA works. \u00a0It works with autistic people. \u00a0It works with neurotypical people. \u00a0It works with children, adults, the old and the young. \u00a0The principles and methods are effective... to me, there is no question about this. And a child who has difficulty with information processing... who may have difficulty allocating attention and learning things that require the coordination of multiple brain centers at any one time... ABA can help by both providing motivation, positive reinforcement, errorless teaching through careful analysis of the task and situationally setting the task up for success while concurrently increasing the difficulty up to the next level. So as a method, ABA is pretty awesome at what it does. But in my (humble) opinion, ABA cannot make you \"not autistic\". You might be able to get a child to\u00a0 act \u00a0less autistic, but I promise you... they are still autistic. \u00a0They still have their brain, and it is a pretty sweet brain as it is. \u00a0The pathways might become more defined because through repetition and effort the child has learned those skills, but they still process the world the way they do. \u00a0They may be able to respond to new information faster because they has developed those other pathways and therefore do not have to try and process everything at the same time... \u00a0memory and skill sets take over.. \u00a0but they still are autistic. And this is where the mission of the therapy starts to become really important. What are you trying to accomplish? \u00a0What are the goals? \u00a0And why? \u00a0What message are you sending to the child? \u00a0Are you changing their behavior because it does not fit into social expectations, and if so, why? \u00a0Is it dangerous? \u00a0Distracting? \u00a0How important is it to be like everyone else? \u00a0Is it? \u00a0What are your desired outcomes? These are murky questions, people. \u00a0As I said before, ALL children (autistic, neurotypical, whatever) need to learn about the world, and we (as elders) need to teach them. I think ALL children should be given the opportunity to learn... within their ability.... to communicate, to behave within some basic social rules, to develop academically, emotionally, and socially within their highest potential. \u00a0Of course, who determines what those things are is what gets murky, but overall I do not think that it is wrong to expect all people to strive for these things. However, I think we have to be very careful when therapies start to promise to change the child OUT of their autism. \u00a0The implication is that the autism is wrong, and therefore the child is wrong. \u00a0And THAT is wrong. \u00a0Autism isn't wrong.... autism just IS. \u00a0And I might... as a parent... need to adapt my teaching and interaction style based on that difference.... and ABA might be a helpful \u00a0tool \u00a0to do that.... but to assume that the goal is to so fundamentally change the child so that they are \"not autistic\" is both foolish and insulting. Recently a friend of mine and I were talking about ABA and her hopes for her child. \u00a0She wanted her kids \"indistinguishable from their peers\". \u00a0I guess I understand that to mean she doesn't see a world where their autism can be any benefit to them, and therefore getting rid of it should be the goal. \u00a0I told her I don't see that for J-man. \u00a0To me, ABA serves a purpose in that it helps teach him to be able to do things that he couldn't learn through just natural observation. \u00a0It breaks things down and provides reinforcement for the tough work of learning. \u00a0But my mission isn't to make him \"not autistic\"... \u00a0my mission is to make him the best J-man he can be, and the world is not built to teach him in a way that is accessible to his learning style. \u00a0ABA methods help. \u00a0But I am on constant guard for the curest messages that might get to him.... and it is very hard to communicate that with the therapists who tend to look at atypical behavior as deficits. \u00a0Which might be why I have always tended to like the relational approaches more... the mission \u00a0is more about creating relationships with the child where they ARE instead a more adult or \"normal\" way of being. So we do ABA because as a tool it is working to help J-man learn. \u00a0But we stand on constant guard for WHAT they are trying to teach him, and I do foresee a time when ABA as a central therapy for him will be used up, because while the methods might still be effective, our focus for what is important to learn will change. \u00a0 My advice to those who are out there and trying to figure out what to do: \u00a0read as much as you can about different techniques. \u00a0Go with therapies that have empirical evidence (and I mean serious journal publications, not just some study they did and got published in the journal of crap research). \u00a0Carefully vett the therapists: \u00a0what are their goals, how do they view disability, what are their beliefs about learning and behavior, and why? \u00a0Examine your own ideas, and ask yourself: \u00a0does this honor my child? \u00a0Does this help him be the best HE can be, or am I trying to fit him into some kind of \"ideal\" that I want? \u00a0Am I meeting him where he is or am I trying to force him into being something he is not... and frankly, doesn't need to be? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thecrackandthelight.com/2012/04/aba-methods-versus-mission.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RMZqcyCAPhk/T4yHuQtbKZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/TiXijb-WM-I/s1600/IMG_9447+5x7+web.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/04/from-pia-at-crack-and-light.html", "title": "\nFrom Pia at The Crack and the Light\n"},

Keep passing the link on--it was at 28 signatures last night and this morning it is at 178. We see petitions all the time, I know.

Make the number of signatures grow. If you've got a blog, write a post. Show your outrage. Make sure that anytime someone googles the JRC, what they see first is hundreds of people's blog posts speaking out against the JRC's methods. \n \n Gregory Miller, a former JRC employee, has set up a \u00a0petition on Change.org , and given permission to repost his petition letter: \n \nHi, my name is Gregory Miller. I used to work at a school in Massachusetts named The Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) where we used powerfully painful electric shock devices (45 \u2013 91 milliamps, at 66 volts) on students to control their behaviors. These devices are much stronger than police stun guns (1-4 milliamps). Unlike stun guns, the electrodes most commonly used at school are spaced 3 \u2013 4 inches apart so that the electrical volts passing through the flesh create the maximum amount of pain with those amps and volts. The United Nations is aware of JRC, has called these shocks at JRC \u201ctorture\u201d, and says that \u201cThe prohibition of torture is absolute.\u201d Please see the attached video of a student named Andre getting shocked at JRC, covered by Fox News. \nRather than shocking students for only severe behaviors, JRC also shocks students for minor behaviors, such as closing eyes for 15 seconds while sitting at the desk, pulling apart a loose piece of thread, tearing an empty used paper cup, going to the bathroom in one\u2019s clothes after signing that they need to use the bathroom for over two hours, standing up and raising a hand to ask to go to the bathroom, blowing small bubbles in saliva between one\u2019s lips, and shocking a non-verbal nearly blind girl with cerebral palsy for making a moaning sound and for attempts to hold a staff\u2019s hand (her attempts to communicate and to be loved). \nI would greatly appreciate your help to protect my former students by petitioning Massachusetts legislators to make these shock procedures illegal. These students are among Massachusetts\u2019 most vulnerable citizens and have no voice of their own to describe their pain. They need YOUR voice! \nI urge you to please CLICK on the Petition Letter tab to carefully read the petition that I have written based on what I have personally witnessed at JRC, and sign the petition. \u00a0Then please invite as many friends as you can through\u00a0 www.Change.Org , email, Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere, to sign this petition. \u00a0Please value these student lives enough to let Massachusetts know that Americans do not condone shock procedures in this country. Thank you. \nSincerely, \nGregory Miller \n \n \n Petition Letter: \n \nPlease Stop Painful Electric Shocks on Students at JRC in Massachusetts! \nTo Massachusetts State Legislatures: Please Stop Painful Electric Shocks on Students at JRC in Mass \nI just signed the following petition addressed to: Massachusetts State Legislatures. \n---------------- \n- Whereas, the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (JRC) of Canton, Massachusetts is the only place in the world that specializes in delivering extreme pain as a behavioral treatment for autistic individuals and delinquent youths; \n- Whereas, for the first time ever, YOU, including families of students at JRC, Massachusetts judges, legislators, and American citizens and voters, are allowed to see through video what electric shocks and torture look like on a student inside of JRC in Massachusetts, as recently reported on Fox News: \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/12/judge-rotenberg-center-trial_n_... \n- Whereas, the United Nations has declared the treatment at JRC to be deemed as torture that the US government should end:\u00a0 http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/shock-therapy-massachussetts-school/stor... \n- Whereas, JRC uses shock devices (45 \u2013 91 milliamps, at 66 volts) that are much stronger than police stun guns (1-4 milliamps) (see p.14): \n http://www.mdri.org/PDFs/USReportandUrgentAppeal.pdf \n http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/the_shocking_truth/ \n- Whereas, some students have had to have periods of approximately 4 - 5 weeks off the shock devices in order to allow the bloody scabs to heal on their arms, legs, and torso; \n- Whereas, JRC receives court consent to administer electric shock to control very severe behaviors, Massachusetts legislators do not directly observe the students with autism actually receiving high numbers of shocks for minor behaviors that are never included in JRC\u2019s marketing materials, such as closing eyes for 15 seconds while sitting at the desk, pulling apart a loose piece of thread, tearing an empty used paper cup, going to the bathroom in one\u2019s clothes after signing that they need to use the bathroom for over two hours, standing up and raising a hand to ask to go to the bathroom, blowing small bubbles in saliva between one\u2019s lips, and shocking a non-verbal nearly blind girl with cerebral palsy for making a moaning sound and for attempts to hold a staff\u2019s hand (her attempts to communicate and to be loved); \n- Whereas, students who just observe their peers being shocked react in fear by standing up out of their seat, yelling or crying in reaction, attempting to pull their own electrodes off their skin, and/or pushing the arm of the staff away from the remote control\u2026 and are then shocked for these reactions; \n \n- Whereas, non-verbal students with autism who receive the most electric shocks at JRC are not able to speak for themselves to describe the psychological harm they experience for simply being in the classroom while watching their classmates get shocked; \n- Whereas, many parents may not have given \u201cinformed consent\" because they signed papers without being permitted to actually see for themselves what \u201ctreatment\u201d by electric shocks at JRC actually looks like, as now viewable on Fox News (see link above);

{"date": "Thursday, June 7, 2012", "body": "\nI'd like to introduce a  new blogger , John Mark McDonald, an autistic adult who wants to help others with autism, especially adults on the spectrum having difficulty navigating the unstated social rules on the job. This is his first post, but I have no doubt he'll soon have more insightful offerings, so I hope readers will keep a lookout for new posts from him. --Kim \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sensory Issues in Autism \n \n \n \nAn important thing to remember for people with autism of all ages is sensory stimulation issues. It is well known in the autism community that people with autism can easily be over stimulated by certain things. After that things get a bit fuzzy. I have heard it said that autistic people can be over or under simulated by certain types of stimuli. From my own experience, autistics tend to need a small amount of sensory stimulation of the right type (sensory attraction) and shielding from stimulation of the wrong type (sensory over-stimulation) or overwhelming amounts of stimulation of any type. To make things more confusing, what kind of sensory stimulation is bad and what is good can be different for each autistic person. \n \nSensory overload can be especially disabling for people with autism. The symptoms of sensory overload vary from person to person. Some of the common effects range from confusion, anxiety, and restlessness to more serious effects like panic attacks, physical pain, physical illness, migraine headaches, paralysis, meltdowns, and breakdowns. \n \nOn the other hand, people of autism are well known for \"stimming.\" The most well-known forms of this are repetitive motions or sounds that are used to reassure or entertain themselves. Stimming probably has the worst reputation of all the autistic behaviors because it sets autistic people apart as being \"weird, abnormal, or unnatural.\" This can lead to stimming issues to be treated all out of proportion of their importance, or even worse being treated with fear and revulsion. Yet for people with autism, sensory stimulation can be needed in order for them to be able to function effectively. Therefore, the goal should not be to eliminate sensory stimulation behavior, but to channel it into more appropriate and productive activities. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Being able to balance sensory issues is critical for any autistic person to be able to function in a \"normal\" environment. In order to do this, you need to identify what the sensory stimulation issues are for any given autistic person. This is especially difficult on caregivers of nonverbal autistics or autistic children that are too young to talk and analyze their own situation. In this case the only way to figure this out is by observation. Let me give some examples with each sense of both sensory overstimulation and attraction and some possible tools that can be used in either case. \n \nIf an autistic person makes noise or screams every time it gets quiet, it may be that they need sound stimulation. Some low background music like classical or ambient could make a great deal of difference. Another idea is fans or other sources of \u201cwhite noise\u201d to keep things from being \u201ctoo quiet.\u201d \n \n\u00a0On the other hand, if they get upset every time there is a noise (especially sudden ones), this could mean they are being overwhelmed by sound. A pair of headphones that completely cover the ears could be an amazing help to them. I really want to test the effectiveness of a pair of noise canceling headphones with access to both music and a parabolic microphone for controlling audio stimulation. \n \nIf an autistic person likes to hide in dark places, or seems reluctant to go out into the sunlight or other bright places, or they shy away from flashing lights or bright colors they may have light sensitivity. A pair of sunglasses, even indoors, can be a real help. Another idea is dimmable lights or indirect lighting. Personally, visual overstimulation is the fastest way to give me a migraine headache. \n \nIf they are drawn to the light and things that are brightly colored, they made need more visual stimulation. Bright colors or shimmering, iridescent or spinning things could be very comforting to them. \n \nIf an autistic person is constantly rubbing or scratching themselves they may need more tactile stimulation. Even more disturbing signs of the need of tactile stimulation are so-called self injurious behaviors like hitting themselves or head-banging. A sensory stimulation brush such as occupational therapist use could be very helpful. I used to love corduroy pants, embroidered patches, or those old-fashioned 3-D books that had the plastic ridges on them that I could run my fingers over. The idea here is something that is tactilely interesting that they can handle in public and still be considered appropriate. Any suggestions on this would be welcome. \n \n\u00a0On the other hand, it is not uncommon to be overwhelmed by things like clothing touching their skin. Warning signs here are things like constantly taking off their clothes, wearing their clothes inside out or rejecting rough blankets or towels. In this case removing clothing tags and making sure the inside lining of the clothing is smooth and not scratchy can be very important. Autistic people who are sensitive to touch often say that light touches leaves an itching sensation that may last long after the touch is over. My son still likes to wear his clothing inside out as often as he get away with it. \n \n\u00a0Another thing to watch out for here is sensitive skin. If they are constantly scratching at her skin until it's red and raw, they may be sensitive to things like the chemicals in fabric softeners or the scents in laundry soaps. I have sensitive skin and it leaves me itching nearly constantly and I have to be constantly aware of whether or not it's appropriate to scratch in public. \n \nSmell can also be the big sensory trigger. If they are constantly burying their nose in things, they may be smelling them. In this case scented candles or Glade plugs might be useful. Conversely, they may be overwhelmed by smell. If they avoid the kitchen or rooms that have just been cleaned or any other strong smells, scents may be overwhelming to them. In this case, Frabreze becomes your friend. Sensitivities to smell can often result in an autistic person getting violently ill in the presence of a noxious smell. \n \nThe last of the primary senses is taste. Taste is a tricky one because eating is such a sensory rich activity. Eating involves smell, touch, heat, cold, visual appearance, and deep pressure as well as taste. Teasing what is taste and what is other sensory issues can be a bit difficult. To make things even more complex, taste is divided into five sensations: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and meaty (or umami). \u00a0People with autism are notoriously picky eaters. They are often so repelled by certain foods that trying to get them to eat them is like telling them to drink poison. Other times they may get so fixated on a certain food that they don\u2019t want to eat anything else. My son would not eat anything brightly colored for many years. Personally, I can\u2019t eat potato salad because I can\u2019t stand texture of the smooth potatoes with crunchy bits in them. I also love sweet and salty tastes and can hardly stand bitter or sour tastes and can barely taste meaty tastes at all. Just to make things more fun, neither my son nor I can stand hot spices because the burning sensation is completely overwhelming to us. \n \nBeyond the five primary senses, there are other senses that autistic people can be drawn to or are oversensitive to. The sense of balance and motion is one I've seen many autistic people to be drawn to. They tend to love to run, dance, or spin and never get tired of it. On the other hand people who are sensitive to motion may get easily carsick and find things like roller coasters at theme parks to be torturous. I remember that when I was a small boy, I used to spin until I got so dizzy that I fell down, over and over, and it never made me feel ill. \n \nAnother obscure sense is deep pressure. Those who are drawn to deep pressure tend to love hugs and massages in infinite amounts, while those who are sensitive to it can hardly stand more than a light touch. This particular overstimulation can lead to a major misunderstanding about an autistic person \u201crejecting affection,\u201d when in actuality they just can't stand the sensation of deep pressure. There are therapies involving wearing weighted jackets and ankle and wrist weights to help with deep pressure stimulation. \n \nThe sensations of heat and cold are also senses. When I was young I could not get enough of warmth. I was forever wearing coats on warm days, never wore shorts even 100\u00ba+ weather and could not get enough of long hot showers. It drove my poor mother crazy. I haven't known anyone who's drawn to the sensation of cold, but it should be fairly obvious to spot. Just a couple of notes here, warmth and burning are completely different sensations: I love the sensation of warmth but hated the burning sensation. Also, just because you love warmth does not mean you'll hate cold and vice versa. \n \nThere might be other senses that autistic people are drawn to, but these are all I'm aware of. I would also like to remind you that these are simply examples of personal experience and other people eyes seen or read about. There are plenty of other ways in which autistic people show they are drawn to or overwhelmed by sensations. Besides this, they can also be drawn to or overwhelmed by different commendations of sensations. I mentioned that I was drawn to certain rough textures, but this was especially true when I could use them to make a sound that I could hear and could also feel the vibrations as deep pressure. For someone trying to unravel this from outside observation they can be very complex and confusing. \n \nOne last thing to note is that sensory issues can and do change over time and the methods of coping certainly change with growth. An autistic child of four may be overwhelmed by touch to the point of never wanting to wear clothes and spend much of their time spinning. The same person at fourteen may have difficulty with eating any food they consider slimy, but loves to run whenever they find room. At the age of twenty-four, the same person may love to wear light, flowing clothing and have become a professional dancer. Some sensory issues disappear over time while others become problematic seemingly out of nowhere. \n \nIn any case, sensory issues tend to be a big deal for people with autism throughout their lives. Understanding sensory issues can be key to understanding how to help an autistic person to improve grow and thrive in their environment. \n \n \n \nJohn Mark McDonald \n \n Scintor@aol.com \n \n http://www.facebook.com/Scintor \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismtothefourth.blogspot.com/", "mailto:Scintor@aol.com", "http://www.facebook.com/Scintor"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/06/guest-post-john-mark-mcdonald.html", "title": "\nGuest Post: John Mark McDonald\n"},

{"date": "Friday, July 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kimberly Gerry-Tucker' s memoir is not just another Asperger's autobiography; it is much more than that. From rich recollections of a childhood where things were often more real than people, where words often failed to come out, where one call almost feel the textures Kim paints with her words to the story of a how a family copes with the diagnosis, illness, and subsequent death of the husband and father from ALS,  Under the Banana Moon  is a window into Kim's world and her unique way of seeing and experiencing it. \n \n \n \nDiagnosed as an adult with Asperger's at the same time her son received his diagnosis, Kim has been a presence in the online autism community since its outset. \u00a0Although she was always different and recognized that difference, it wasn't until she read Donna Williams' book that she got a sense of why she was different. Donna encouraged Kim to write this book and has taken the time to interview Kim on her website two times,  first when the book  was published on lulu.com in 2010 and  again this year  when it became available on Amazon. \n \n \n \nKim's writing is fresh and interesting, and if the memoir were packaged as fiction, would do very well. We like interesting and different characters in our fiction, and this book is an easy, fast read that was reminiscent in essence (though not in style) to Fried Green Tomatoes--the warm feelings, the sense of connection to the interesting characters--all that you get in Kim's book--and it's a bit of a shock to stop and realize these are real people with real lives. Howie, her husband, is rich and real, from the way he insisted she wash his hair when they were first dating to how he is larger than life as an adult, controlling much of her life. He's flawed and human, but throughout the book, Kim's devotion to her husband and their family is steadfast. \n \n \n \nWhen he falls ill, she is by his side, and they make the journey to various doctors together as a unit, with him somewhat begrudgingly letting go of control. It's a journey that would test the strength of any person and any relationship, and her care of him, all the way to becoming \"the keeper of the penis\" is not saintlike, but real. They fight, they laugh, but most of all, they get through it together. \n \n \n \nKim acknowledges how important her parents were in helping her become the person she is, how their love and acceptance helped her to function and grow. Kim married, had children, is a grandmother, a writer, a volunteer, and an artist and she's on the autism spectrum. Her autobiography is a testament to the reality that autistic individuals can have rich, full, productive lives and that it is easier to do this when they are accepted as they are for who they are. \n \n \n \nWe like our fictional characters to be oddballs, to beat the odds. We connect with them and can feel euphoria when we see them triumph. We connect with their struggles and we root for them. It seems to me that it's harder, though, when they're real people we actually have to deal with. We could and should do better at acceptance in the real world of the real people. After all, if we were all alike, what fun would that be? We rob ourselves and our society of the opportunity to experience the rich diversity of humanity when we confine our connection to those who are different to fictional portrayals. \n \n \n \nKimberly Gerry-Tucker's memoir is a worthwhile read. It's a fun read. It's also a very real one. I encourage you to check her book out at Amazon; it's an extremely affordable buy as a kindle e-book. \n \n \n \nThe book's facebook page is here:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Under-The-Banana-Moon/333985336618583 . \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kimberlygerrytucker.webstarts.com/index.html", "http://blog.donnawilliams.net/2010/09/26/communication-breakdown/", "http://blog.donnawilliams.net/2012/07/11/under-the-banana-moon-by-kimberley-tucker/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Under-The-Banana-Moon/333985336618583"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/07/under-banana-moon-by-kimberly-gerry.html", "title": "\nUnder The Banana Moon by Kimberly Gerry-Tucker\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Guest post by John Mark McDonald \n \n \u00a0 \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just want to let you in on a few things that you may not be aware of. The autism spectrum is much larger than people know. There are people on the spectrum that are some of the leading geniuses of all time. People on the spectrum are already in critical positions that help keep our nation\u2019s economy afloat. Employing people on the spectrum is not about charity; it\u2019s about finding the right person for the job and keeping them there. As a matter of fact, you probably already know people who are doing important jobs whom you were not aware were on the spectrum. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Autistic people tend to have several characteristics that make them able to do certain jobs better than your average worker. Some of these qualities are: organization, creativity, superior memory, hyper-focus, calculation ability, routine-focus, and brutal honesty. I\u2019ll try to some personal and general examples of each of these. Now, sometimes these extraordinary abilities can come with a price, and I\u2019ll point this out as well. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People on the spectrum have a need for things to be organized. If I walk into a store and the shelves are messy and disorganized, it truly bothers me. It bothers me enough that unless I am restrained, I will spontaneously start organizing them (my wife would frequently chastise me with the phrase, \u201cyou don\u2019t work here,\u201d whenever we were out shopping.) The right person on the spectrum will keep your inventory organized far better than the average worker without having to be asked or reminded. \n \n Downside: Organization is often not optional and can be confusingly inconsistent from an outside perspective. Having things out of place can leave a person on the spectrum distracted and confused until things are put in the \u201cright\u201d place. \n People you may know: If you have run across a person that can keep an entire store or warehouse organized and always seems to know where everything is without having to look, this person is probably on the autistic spectrum, even if they don\u2019t know it themselves. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creativity is also a hallmark of people on the spectrum. We tend to look at things from a slightly different perspective than the average worker, which allows us to do things that can really catch the customer\u2019s attention. Eye-catching displays, memorable slogans, more efficient ways of doing things, and even new products and services that add to your business are things that someone on the autistic spectrum can bring to your business. \n \n Drawback: Creativity is a very hit or miss thing. Sometimes even the best seeming ideas just don\u2019t pan out. Also, autistic people can sometimes get stuck on an idea that turns out to be unworkable. A frank discussion may be needed to get us to move on. \n People you may know: Most new products are created by people on the spectrum as well as things like logos and artwork. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superior memory is one of the most useful of the autistic \u201cquirks.\u201d People on the spectrum often become fascinated by something and will quickly become an expert in whatever that is. This often leads to an encyclopedic knowledge that can give you your own in-house expert. \n \n Drawback: The subject has to \u201ccatch our attention,\u201d and this is not really voluntary. It either fascinates us or it doesn\u2019t. This type of memory is also extremely quirky. I can remember amazing amounts of historical data but can\u2019t remember the names of people that I know quite well. Warning! If we start talking about a subject we love, we can talk for hours. \n People you know: If you know someone who knows everything there is to know about a particular subject, they are most likely on the autistic spectrum. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hyper-focus is another ability that can be very useful to an employer. Hyper-focus allows the person to become completely absorbed by the task at hand and to then do it at an amazing rate for long periods of time. I remember doing an inventory once where I got into hyper focus and I started going so fast that the other people could barely record what I was inventorying in time. \n \n Drawback: When someone is hyper-focused they stop noticing anything else around them. It\u2019s often difficult to get their attention and they may not notice you even yelling their name in their ear. Another problem is that they can forget about their physical needs like eating, drinking or taking bathroom breaks and have been know to collapse exhaustion or dehydration when in this state. Having a supervisor or co-worker look out for them and make them take breaks nay be needed. \n People you know: Artists are especially known for getting into creative \u201cmoods\u201d where they will go on marathon creative streaks and forget about things like eating, sleeping or personal hygiene, but turn out amazing works. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some people on the spectrum have amazing calculation and mathematical abilities. These people seem to eat and drink numbers. Because of this people on the spectrum make some of the best bookkeepers, accountants and auditors around. \n \n Drawback: No real drawbacks for this one. \n People you know: If you know someone who is more comfortable with numbers than people in one of the above professions, that is a good indication that they are on the autistic spectrum, although they may not know it themselves. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similar to the need for organization is the need for predictability. This most often manifests itself as a reliance on routine. This can be very good in an employee as they tend to be always on time and get things done in a set predictable pattern, which they never tire of. While most employees might find this boring, they find it comfortable and reassuring. \n \n Drawback: People who take comfort in routine predictability have a hard time with unexpected major changes. The more warning they have, the better they can accept the change. \n People you know: Anyone can get into a rut, but there are people who have no interest in getting out of theirs and in fact, get quite upset if their regular rhythm is disturbed. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brutal honesty is also a common trait among autistic persons. People on the autistic spectrum tend to remember things by how facts and images relate to one another. If you ask a question, they will answer with the relevant facts. This leads to a straightforward and literal answer to the question asked (which can sometimes be mistaken for sarcasm or aggression.) The tendency is to say exactly what they mean and mean exactly what they say.\u00a0 \n \n Drawback: Tact does not come easily to someone on the spectrum. An offhand question that is asked suddenly will usually get a brutally honest answer. Not that people on the spectrum are incapable of lying, but it is difficult to learn and reluctantly used. People on the spectrum do not tend to use subtexts or implications in their speech and do not usually recognize it in other\u2019s speech. (i.e. hints and sarcasm are often lost on them which can lead to misunderstandings.) \n People you know: People on the spectrum make very good if hard-nosed judges and law enforcement officers. \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All in all, people on the autistic spectrum make very good \u201cniche\u201d workers. They are very common is positions like IT, engineering, and accounting, and are often successful in these and similar roles as well as artistic areas like actors and writers. The one caution is that we are very specialized workers: we can do some things better than anyone who is not on the spectrum, but the price we pay is in generalized abilities and social interactions. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If we are pushed to do the things that we find painful because \u201canyone can do this,\u201d then the same thing will happen that would happen if you used a cell phone for a hammer, it would break. It doesn\u2019t mean that the cell phone is defective; it\u2019s just being used for something it\u2019s not designed for. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, we have trouble with social pecking orders and socialization. If you push one of us to act \u201cjust like one of the boys,\u201d it will end in disaster. We are also especially vulnerable to bullying and social sabotage. I have more than once gone from the top employee to fired because of a new person that was uncomfortable with me began spreading rumors and accusations, and every person on the spectrum that I have talked to has similar stories. All it usually takes for this to stop is a word to \u201cleave them alone and let them do their job.\u201d \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Last of all, I want to remind you that the autistic spectrum is wide. It goes from people like the character \u201cRain Man\u201d who needed help to be able to survive to people like\u00a0 Temple \u00a0 Grandin , who is a world renowned expert in her field to entertainers like Dan Aykroyd and Daryl Hannah. Not every person on the spectrum has every one of these abilities and weaknesses but put one of us in the right position and these abilities will amaze you.\u00a0 \n \n \nScincerely, Scintor\u00a0 AKA \n John Mark McDonald scintor@aol.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["mailto:scintor@aol.com"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/08/why-people-on-autism-spectrum-make-good.html", "title": "\nWhy people on the autism spectrum make good workers\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nFrom  Everything Starts with an A \n \n \n \nNobody's perfect. Especially me. We all say things that can be misinterpreted by others at times - stuff that we don't really mean or haven't fully thought through. Things that are well-meant but that can inadvertently make the recipient feel awful.\u00a0Some people have a need to fill in the gaps - say fluffy stuff to keep the conversation going - or to try to \"fix\" the other person and make them feel better. A very titchy minority of people are just plain nasty. We're all guilty, now and again, of listening to others with our own agendas playing at full blast over what they're saying. Some people just think that the less said, the better! \n \n \n \nSocial interactions are full of nuances and expressions and body language. X says \"blah\" and Y responds with \"blah diddy blah\" but if the correct intonation or body language isn't employed than we can all get into a terrible pickle. \n \n \n \nI'm sure that most things that people have said to me or any other parent on the subject of \u00a0our children with autism have been pretty well-meant. On the whole, people want to understand, to listen and to share in our highs or empathise with our lows. But there are some things that people say that, however they are meant, just get me where it hurts. I knew very little about autism before I met my children. Generally people are slightly better informed these days but, unless you live with someone with autism, there are just some things that should fall into the \"Approach with Caution\" category. I would, however, hate to think that people are walking on eggshells when talking to me about my boys so I've made a little list of the things that are better not to mention when talking to a parent of a child with autism. And I've thrown in a couple of do's too because nobody likes a whinger! \n \n \n You look tired Not particularly helpful but thanks for noticing. Yes I am tired. I'm knackered. And so would you be if your child was awake half the night and then you were constantly on red alert, never able, for safety reasons, to just leave your child to his own devices. There are so many children with diagnoses these days - I don't understand why so many people want a label. You think I got my children labelled for the good of my health? Hmm. Well actually I wanted to get my kids the help they need from as early on as possible to give the chances they deserve. He looks fine - if you hadn't told me he has autism I'd never have known Autism is an invisible disability. It's all the bits that you can't see like the extreme anxiety that give it away. But did you not think the flapping and screeching was a little suspect? Did you give him the MMR - we gave our kids separates Well done. No I did not give him the MMR. You are amazing - I couldn't do what you do. Thanks. But I am not. I am doing what any parent would do which is my best. Of course you could do that if you had to. He'll get better as he gets older. Sigh. No. Autism isn't an illness. It won't just go away. Some things will get easier for him. Some things will get harder. He'll sleep when he's tired/ He'll eat when he's hungry Both statements are false when talking about autism. \u00a0Some people, particularly people who've had their own children, like to put their experience of what their children did onto all children. Oh yes my child does that too Yes I'm sure he does but does your child do this this this this this this this and this too? They're all brilliant at maths He has splinter skills - some way above the average and some way below. While J does not have any academic delays, autism is still referred to as a Learning Disability. It's all well and good being able to do your 143 times tables but if you can't tolerate sitting in a roomful of people.... Not all children with autism have superpowers. Have you tried ear defenders/lavender oil/etc Sigh. Did you really think I hadn't thought of that when J throws himself to the ground screaming every time he hears a siren. And, believe me, I've tried nearly every sleep aid known to man - I would sacrifice lactating porcupines in his bedroom if I thought it would help him. Wow, I wish.... could read as well as J can Thanks. I wish J could live comfortably in the world and have friends. You needn't have worried - he's fine at this party/dinner/gathering That'll be those hours of preparation and visuals and the fact that Dave and I are tag teaming him constantly while we're here and unable to give anyone else - including our other son - our attention. And then when we're safely back home, the fall-out from all that stress will commence in full. What's his\u00a0name? He's standing right here - ask him! Our friends did a Gluten and Casein-free diet/Sonrise/Tantric Cat Bouncing/ whatever \u00a0- and their child is totally cured. I'm happy for them but I don't believe autism is cureable. I have tried the diets but my walls looked like the Turner Prize after a week of gobbing and puking. And that toad-therapy course in Kazakhstan is a tad too expensive. That child needs a good smack. I hope that you are reborn as a dung beetle. My son shouldn't be here - it's like a lunatic asylum Oh. Did you actually mean that my son and all these other children in this ASD specific nursery that your son is attending are lunatics....! (a mother really did actually say that to me!) We didn't invite G/J to .....'s party (which happened 2 weeks ago and you've already heard about from everyone else) because we knew he wouldn't want to come. Ouch. I'm sorry that we are party poopers but please invite them if you're inviting the whole class anyway and then let them say no. And my least favourite: Autism? Never heard of it. Do you actually live in the silt at the bottom of a pond? And now for the Do's. It's not all negative. There are plenty of things that are ok to say to a parent like me. So here are a couple of examples: Do you want a glass of wine? Yes Do you want another glass of wine? Yes Another? Yup \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism-somethoughts.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/a-few-things-its-best-not-to-say-to.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/09/guest-post-few-things-its-best-not-to.html", "title": "\nGuest Post: A Few Things It's Best Not to Say to Parents of Children With Autism\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nGuest Post: \u00a0AMFAS update. \u00a0This is for military families by military families.. \u00a0This is chock full of links and opportunities for those of you serving in our military. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe air is becoming crisper and the trees are starting to change color, meaning it\u2019s been a year since we put out our last AMFAS Status Update for Fall. We hope everyone is getting ready to start toward the holiday season very shortly. \n \nSince our beginnings in 2008, AMFAS was established to lead the way in supporting our military families as a true collaborative effort. Because of the importance we put on transparency, it\u2019s vital to give a status update on the AMFAS project and share some opportunities you in the community have to help the only organic (by military families) national grassroots effort specifically focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder. \n \n Email list \n \nEarlier this year we started setup of our subscription service but have put off implementing it until this point. Our plan is to start sending out weekly updates on AMFAS-related information to help families keep up to date. You can signup at AMFAS.org or by sending an email to subscribe@amfas.org to be added. People who register on the website are automatically added. \n \n Facebook and other Social Media \n \nIf you\u2019ve been on our Facebook page recently, you might have noticed we passed 2,500 community members. This is quite impressive, if you contrast this to other pages with large number of followers, where they are begging anyone to \u201clike\u201d their page. AMFAS policy is we will never pander for a \u201clike\u201d but do ask that you invite military families or others who can benefit from our community to visit. Keep asking questions, sharing information and making suggestions on how we can continue to better our community. \n \nWe still have our\u00a0 Twitter ,\u00a0 Google + ,\u00a0 Tumblr ,\u00a0 YouTube , and earlier this year added\u00a0 Pinterest \u00a0to our lineup. We will be putting more emphasis into these in the near future. \n \n Website \n \nLast year we launched the AMFAS website, finally finishing what had taken a number of years to accomplish due to work and military requirements, battles with schools, behavioral issues, family obligations and numerous site platform changes. This is still a work in progress as we strive for continual improvement. The site is designed and put together by military families. Much like a special needs diet recipe, you just can\u2019t go out and buy everything already put together like others have done. We refuse to, simply because it\u2019s about putting your heart and soul into the effort and there are many areas we focused on. \n \nNow we\u2019re getting ready to improve on what was built with the next update. This time we are keenly focused on the AMFAS Experience, how each of our areas are complimentary to each other and the benchmarks we conceptualized when the project was started. \n \nSome areas we are working on include finally launching the AMFAS News Service, upgrading the AMFAS Groups content by adding pages and contact information for each group, better integration of the many community functions already on the site and providing a sleeker, safer, stable location for military families and those who support them. Our goal all along has been to create the community area where your information isn\u2019t harvested for profit like other social network websites, because we believe in military families helping military families. \n \n Resource \n \nIf you haven\u2019t used our\u00a0 Worldwide Installation Resource , take a look. There are currently 1,084 listings and 533 categories in our website, including all EFMP offices, CDCs, EDIS offices and main installation listings for every base worldwide. Anyone registered on the site can add, rate or review entries around any installation worldwide. Our listings are a bit different since we focus on providing information centric to installations where our families will move to. \n \nBusinesses like ABA providers, merchants and support providers are welcome to register and list their businesses as friends of AMFAS. This process was originally meant specifically for ASD support but many of the support areas are applicable to all special needs. . We\u2019ll be upgrading some of the features to make searching easier and streamline the look and feel with the rest of the site. \n \n Military Bloggers Support \n \nIt\u2019s now been a few years since we started\u00a0 AMFAS: The Blogs \u00a0and our numbers continue to grow. We now have 30 bloggers featured with 2,344 posts available for viewing. What\u2019s unique about this effort is that this site is our way to promote these military families. People visiting the site can keep up on the latest blogs all in one place, with all links to articles going directly to the specific blogger\u2019s pages and help showcase them. So far in 2012, this effort has 8,739 visitors looking at over 69,000 pages of blog posts and accounting for 2.21 GB of bandwidth. \n \n AMFAS Groups \n \nLast year at this time we had nine AMFAS Groups setup. Last week we brought our 25th online. We have consolidated the look and feel of all groups for cohesion and implemented guidance for Group administrators to optimize support at the local level. The links below are for the Facebook versions of the groups. If you live near, know someone near there or might be PCSing there in the near future, you need to join in as a member, a team lead for your community or even an AMFAS Ambassador who represents AMFAS in local outreach to improve community support for our families. \n \nAlabama - AMFAS Alabama Group \n \nArkansas - AMFAS Little Rock Group \n \nAlaska - AMFAS Anchorage Group \n \nCalifornia - AMFAS Bay Area Group (San Francisco Bay area) ,\u00a0 AMFAS Edwards AFB Group ,\u00a0 AMFAS San Diego Group \n \nColorado - AMFAS Colorado Springs Group \n \nDistrict of Columbia/Virginia/Maryland - AMFAS Washington DC- Capital Region Group \n \nFlorida - AMFAS Ft Walton Beach Group \n \nHawaii - AMFAS Hawaii Group \n \nIllinois - AMFAS Scott AFB Group \n \nKentucky - AMFAS Fort Campbell Group \n \nMaryland - AMFAS Fort Meade Group \n \nMassachusetts - AMFAS Boston Group \n \nNebraska - AMFAS Offutt AFB Group \n \nNevada - AMFAS Nellis AFB Group \n \nNew Mexico - AMFAS Alamogordo Group \n \nNew York - AMFAS\u00a0 West Point \u2013 Stewart ANGB Area Group \n \nNorth Carolina - AMFAS Ft Bragg / Pope Field Group \n \nNorth Dakota - AMFAS Grand Forks Group \n \nPennsylvania - AMFAS Harrisburg Group \n \nTexas - AMFAS Dyess AFB Group ,\u00a0 AMFAS San Antonio Group \n \nVirginia - AMFAS Hampton Roads Group \n \nWashington - AMFAS West Puget Sound Group \n \n \n \n Opportunities \n \nIf you would like to volunteer to help AMFAS better support our families, it\u2019s time to take action. Tell families who are in our boots that this is available, invite your EFMP coordinators to visit and learn more about real issues being faced by our military families and offer ideas and input into making our community better. \n \nIf you would like to volunteer in any capacity, send us a note to info@amfas.org and tell us what your interests are related to autism and any experience pertinent to helping the community online or locally. AMFAS is not about raising money, being the most popular people or putting our name in lights. We need team-oriented people with passion, not an agenda. \n \nIf you want to represent AMFAS in your area, consider becoming an AMFAS Ambassador. Send an email to ambassadors@amfas.org. \n \nIf you are a business owner or know of those who are not military families but want to support our cause, we are starting a Friends of AMFAS program to help partner with support agencies, including other nonprofits to better our effectiveness in helping families. Send an email to info@amfas.org. \n \nIf you would like to start an AMFAS Group near your installation, either ask on\u00a0 Facebook \u00a0or send an email to groups@amfas.org. \n \nIf you want to add your personal blog to our blogging community or would like to blog for AMFAS or write a guest post for feature on AMFAS, send an email to blogs@amfas.org. \n \nIf you want to make a difference for families volunteer to add local resources around your installation to our Worldwide Installation Resource . \n \nIf you are a writer, photographer, videographer, love to make graphics or even blog or vlog, our AMFAS News Team needs your expertise. Send a note to news@amfas.org to get started. \n \nYou can also use\u00a0 this feedback \u00a0form to contact us and tell us how you feel you can assist in this project. Everyone who pitches in can make a difference for our families.\u00a0 Remember, there are plenty of Special Needs support groups and websites out there for military families. AMFAS is the only one of this type specifically for military families dealing with autism. It\u2019s about all our families. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://twitter.com/militaryautism", "https://plus.google.com/116695616484718310383", "http://militaryautism.tumblr.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/AMFASnews", "http://pinterest.com/amfas/", "https://amfas.org/resource", "http://blog.amfas.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/219340801490849/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/411513792231230/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/240925655946480/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/271565069588766/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/368254769913963/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/153720594707617/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/240086932697909/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/268258816521168/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/124311117664388/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/228189867294630/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/230608906984892/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/405572016126915", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/234068369987200/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/197703876958549/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/302381589791098/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/438819546147042/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/264156926946021/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/196281060468667", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/196281060468667/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/114768745289261/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/278505808834575/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/192927144140654/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/258140170955807/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/332011500171745/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/162451563867126/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/534086863284216/", "http://www.facebook.com/militaryautism", "https://amfas.org/resource", "http://update.amfas.org/comments-and-ideas/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/10/guest-post-american-military-families.html", "title": "\nGuest post: American Military Families Autism Support\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, November 25, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n\u00a0  \"How do you make it work with children with autism in the family? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI am often surprised by how differently other people live their lives. They can do some really nifty things that are totally alien to us. I'm not criticising or complaining - I am just genuinely in awe of the differences when I notice them. By \"other people\" I mean families who don't have autism as an ingredient. Neurotypical families. Of course I know that there really is no \"normal\" - life's rich tapestry and all that - but I am increasingly less aware of our differences unless I really think about them. \n \n Here are a few of those things: \n \nPeople can \"pop\" to the shops with their children without giving written notice. \n \nPeople can attend parties and gatherings and their children merrily fit in with other children and look after themselves at these occasions. \n \nTheir children happily eat things that come from the earth or the tree. \n \nTheir children do after school clubs or go to childminders without it causing a nuclear explosion at home later. \n \nTheir children occupy themselves. \n \nThese families can go for a walk on a beach and actually keep on walking without stopping to examine every grain of sand or to fill their wellies with sea water! \n \nThese families can do a fun leisure activity that everyone in the family enjoys at the same time - together - all of them... \n \n \n \nThe list could go on and on. The fact of the matter is that these things seem like little miracles to me. I have no idea what \"normal\" is these days and, although there is no real \"normal\" there are a lot of societal expectations of children that are mostly do-able by \"normal families\": your child will ride a bike, have/attend and enjoy birthday parties, keep his clothes on in public, not make a \"scene\" after the age of 6?, play football, like going on playdates etc etc \n \n \n \nAnd here's the thing: when you have one/two/three?? etc people on the Autistic Spectrum in your family, it is helpful to learn, pretty early on, that if you aspire to this type of \"normal\" then you will have a whole truck-load of unfulfilled expectations to bite you on the bum! \n \n \n \nA wise woman recently said to me \"Don't compare yourself or your family to something that is totally unachievable\". This small nugget is possibly one of the most helpful things anyone has ever said to me and I realised that most of the times that I've felt desperate and heartbroken about my children's autism, I had been comparing my family to something that we can't be. That's not to say that we can't be amazing in our own way - my boys totally rock and I love them for exactly who they are. We are just never going to be a Neurotypical family. \n \n \n \nIn answer to the title of this post, I think that learning to discount the \"normal\" is the first and most important part of making life work for families with children with autism. Of course every family is different. Every autism family is different too so it's horses for courses here. I can only tell you about what helps us to make life work because some of it we've learnt the hard way and I wish someone had told me some of this when we started out on this journey. \n \n \n \nSo here goes: \n \n \n \n Do what works for your family .\u00a0 Find your own pace of life \u00a0- the pace that suits your children and you. As much as it would be lovely to attend all parties/weddings/bbq's/bar mitzvahs/concerts etc, if it's really not going to work for your kids, then find a way to do a little bit of it and avoid the rest. I'm not saying that all things that would be challenging should be avoided totally, but, if spending an entire day at a family wedding is going to be like Dante's Seventh Circle of Hell for all involved, then find a way to do a bite-sized chunk of it with your child/children that will be achievable and enjoyable. The worst mistakes we made early on were pretending that we could manage these things and causing J/G and us excruciating amounts of stress and a whole load of knock-on anxiety to boot. \n \n \n \nI do sometimes feel that my little family are in one of those videos where we are operating at normal speed and everyone around us is speeded up. But that's ok because that works for us. I'm not saying that that doesn't scald and hurt sometimes, but the alternative - constantly running to keep up and causing my kids large amounts of stress - is much worse than the occasional (and getting rarer) feeling of being left behind by the world. \n \n \n \nThe next thing that I think is important is to\u00a0 always follow your gut feeling . There are so many autism experts and so much information and advice - a lot of it conflicting - out there. It can be so confusing. I recently saw a video on YouTube about the \"biomedical\" approach to \"cure\" autism. It all makes such perfect sense when you watch something like that. But when we looked into that approach a while back and discovered that we were going to have to part with hundreds of pounds a month and force 20 different food supplements into J, who is not into any unapproved food items passing his lips.... Well... gut feeling says \"NO\". My gut feeling says a big resounding \"YES\" to never letting my kids feel like they're \"broken\"; to concentrating on all the brilliant things that they can do, not the things that they can't do; to never saying never; to reading and learning all the time and staying open to suggestions. My gut feeling said \"Bring it on\" to filling my house with dogs and cats because they have such a positive effect on all of us (and because we are at home rather a lot - taking it at our own pace, remember!) My gut feeling (yes, it IS a big gut to have all these feelings!) was that money would be wisely spent on Occupational Therapy for J - as long as it is Sensory Integration OT (more in another non-gut-related post). Basically, unless your gut feeling tells you to gorge on gargantuan amounts of chocolate, it is probably correct. \n \n \n \n Visuals Visuals Visuals ! Autism is a visual thing. Spoken words can be overwhelming at times. We always use visual schedules with J even for the little bits of life that seem obvious. Now that J can read, we do written lists with little sketches to back them up. A Saturday visual might be: Play at home - At 10:30 get ready to go to the Library - Walk to the Library with Mum - Chose a book - Walk home with Mum - Have lunch - Play - At 14:30 take Claude for his walk to B Park - Home for Dinner, Play, Bath, Toilet and Bed. It works for us. More complicated outings have separate, more detailed visuals. \n \n \n \n Remember the Importance of Solitude \u00a0to people on the Autistic Spectrum. Solitude is a great healer. When the proverbial hits the fan, quiet time on their own, doing something that they like, is the biggest restorative. I found this hard to accept, initially. A Mother's instinct is to \"fix\" and hug and soothe. I now know that solitude needs to come before these other things. \n \n \n \n Remember that all behaviours have a root cause . My kids don't wind me up for the good of their health! If J suddenly starts biting himself or me, for example, there's normally a reason. Last time it was a wobbly tooth that he didn't know how to get out. \n \n \n \n Look after yourself! \u00a0OoOh I am bad at this one. But it is so so important. If I am operating on one spluttering cylinder, then I am rubbish at being a mum to my boys. I need time to be me sometimes - loud music and dancing and just being without being needed. Vital. I've also found a brilliant counsellor who I can see whenever I feel the need to \"explode\". Sometimes, I only need to see her every couple of months. Sometimes, when things are all a bit much, I can see her weekly. I can't begin to tell you how much this helps! \n \n \n \n Remember that even if something has always worked before, it can all change at the drop of a hat! \u00a0It's really good to be prepared for this - it took me by surprise the first time. Things and routines that seem totally set in stone can suddenly become defunct. Something else will always come along though... \n \n \n \n Active Acceptance - as opposed to Passive Acceptance . I think that's what mostly what I'm banging on about. By \"Active\" Acceptance I mean that we are constantly learning more about our boys' autism. Reading, researching, trouble-shooting when things go wrong, tweaking, encouraging, pushing their boundaries. We are looking to the future, but never saying never. Passive acceptance would be using autism as an excuse to shut down and blame everything on the big bad A. \n \n \n \nSo. How do YOU make it work with children with autism in the family? I'd love to know how everyone else does it. I'm open to ideas and suggestions......By \"making it work\" I mean \"functioning\"/\"enjoying being a family\"/\"having a good giggle now and again\"etc etc. We're still learning all the time - we most certainly don't get it \"right\" every day of the week but we're getting closer to finding out what we all like and what we all need to be the Hughes Family and we're doing ok! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/11/guest-post-everything-starts-with-a.html", "title": "\nGuest post-\"Everything starts with an A\"\n"},

As we grapple with the idea that there is often no way to foresee such a horrendous act, even as people pretend they could and shift to blaming those around the young man who acted so violently, so viciously, with such evil.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe grappled this week with how to tell our children, whether to send our children to school. We read and watched in horror as the media and people on the internet blamed Asperger's for the shooter's spree killing. We also stood and fought against such ignorance, and then as the individual victims' stories came out, we felt all too keenly the pain and the bravery of the parents, siblings, spouses, children who lost someone. We learned that at least one, probably two of the sweet, innocent children lost were autistic. And we grieved some more. \n \n \n \nGrief, disbelief, anger, despair. I have little doubt we all felt that this week, even those who wrote such nasty, awful things about individuals with Asperger's and those grappling with mental health issues. Those who kept posting pictures of weapons and advocated everyone being armed, that more guns were a solution, felt the same things. So did those who advocated strict gun control. \n \n \n \nOut of the same swirling morass of similar emotions came vastly different responses. We forget that we all experienced the same emotions. We continue to forget the common humanity that underlies each of us. We see enemies everywhere. And we forget that we are a global community: one people, with all life valuable.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nEach of us can only do the best we can. It's all we've got: the belief that what we do can and does matter, that we can make a difference. It's up to us whether it's a positive or a negative difference. \n \n \n \nSomehow we must loosen the heaviness weighing on our hearts and souls while still holding on to the lessons learned: lessons that move us forward into a more full \u00a0and \"joyful participation with the \"sorrows of the world.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. --Joseph Campbell \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://plus.google.com/109421029164188105089", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hp2Q-zQ_D-k/UNEajqXUjCI/AAAAAAABULg/Z0iPvXbja4M/s1600/017.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bTFh2ic0x7I/UK0_AFPdKFI/AAAAAAABTwo/6P6PGokGmww/s1600/PB200054.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2012/12/because-we-must.html", "title": "\nBecause We Must\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, January 23, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n So, you've  finally  gotten the appointment. \u00a0After waiting a year (and sometimes more) you are actually getting in to see the developmental pediatrician. If you are like me-you have been waiting so long, that by the time you do get in-you lose sight of why you made the appointment to begin with! So much may have changed in that year of waiting. Your child may have changed, your needs may have changed...you start to wonder..\"Why are we going?\"..\"What exactly is going to happen at this appointment?\" \u00a0\"What can I expect?\" and (I think) more importantly-\"What  should  I expect?\" \u00a0 I know that I could have really used some information before our appointments. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Thankfully, we have just the person to ask. \u00a0Dr. James Coplan, (who blogs  here  and  here ) is the author of  \" Making sense of Autistic Spectrum Disorders \" .\u00a0 He was very gracious to take the time and answer some questions for me. \u00a0(more info on Dr. Coplan is on bottom of post) \u00a0After reading this, I think you will agree-the man knows his stuff. Whether or not you are new to diagnosis-I think that this is insightful for everyone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What\nis a developmental pediatrician? \n \n \n \n \n A Developmental Pediatrician is,\nfirst and foremost, a  pediatrician  \u2013 a physician who has\ncompleted a rigorous training program in general pediatrics, and been certified\nby the  American\nBoard of Pediatrics . Developmental Pediatricians complete\nadditional training in either Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics (D-BP), or\nNeurodevelopmental Disabilities (NDD). For additional information, go  here .  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n More\n  than you probably wanted know \n \n Strictly speaking, there is no\n  such thing as a \u201cdevelopmental pediatrician.\u201d Rather, there are  Developmental-Behavioral Pediatricians ,\n  and  Neurodevelopmental Disability\n  Pediatricians . Most of the time this distinction doesn\u2019t matter, and in\n  day-to-day usage, we use the term \u201cDevelopmental Pediatricians\u201d to encompass\n  both Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics (D-BP) and Neurodevelopmental\n  Disabilities (NDD). \u00a0I am one of the\n  few pediatricians certified in both D-BP  and  NDD. To make matters even more\n  confusing, Child Neurologists also can take NDD training, and become\n  board-certified in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities. Child Neurology is an\n  offshoot of internal medicine, not pediatrics, so most Child Neurologists are\n  not pediatricians.  \n \n \n \n \n \n And what you\n  really do need to know \n \n You\n  may not be interested in the finer details of the doctor\u2019s training (although\n  some people have Googled me all the way back to High School!), but what you\n  need is a doctor who can  listen to your\n  story ,  establish rapport with your\n  child , perform a competent  neurological\n  exam and developmental assessment , and  talk with you in terms you can understand . You want the doctor to\n  be knowledgeable regarding  medical\n  diagnosis, developmental diagnosis ,  behavior\n  management ,  family function ,\n  and  community-based therapy services \n  (public and private). Finally, you want the doctor to be  someone you and your child both will look forward to going back to  periodically. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n What\ncan I expect at my first appointment? \n \n \n \n Even before the visit itself, the\ndoctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire, and may have gathered up\nwhatever records already exist (hospital discharge summaries, Early\nIntervention or school evaluation summaries, therapist reports, etc.). You can\nexpect the doctor to have reviewed these child\u2019s records before the day of the\nvisit. \u00a0The visit itself typically has\nthree phases:  History-taking ,  evaluation , and post-evaluation  counseling .  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n History-Taking \n \n The doctor should sit down, give\ngood eye contact, put you at ease, and encourage you to tell your child\u2019s story\nin your own words, while occasionally asking you clarifying questions (\u201cCan you\ntell me a little more about that?\u201d etc.). Once you have finished describing\nwhat you are worried about, the doctor will complete the history-taking portion\nof the evaluation, including additional details about your child\u2019s development,\nas well as your child\u2019s medical history, family history, and social history.\nThis information is helpful to put your concerns about your child into a larger\ncontext, and may lead to specific recommendations regarding medical evaluation,\ndevelopmental intervention, and/or measures to address family function. \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n In my practice, I require both\n  parents plus a third adult to attend the initial visit. I bring the parents\n  into my office, and leave the child in the waiting room under the supervision\n  of the third adult (typically a grandparent). This gives the parents a chance\n  to speak freely about their child, rather than talking in front of the child.\n  Having both parents present highlights differences in parental perceptions or\n  management styles, that are often just as important as the specific details\n  of the child\u2019s development. This is particularly true if the parents are\n  separated or divorced. Both parents need to believe that they have been given\n  a fair hearing, and that my evaluation is non-partisan, and meant to serve\n  the child\u2019s needs. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Evaluation \n \n The\nnext portion of the visit involves direct interaction with the child. Developmental\ntesting typically includes measures of your child\u2019s verbal and non-verbal\nabilities and academic skills, if relevant. The specific measures will vary,\ndepending on your child\u2019s age, developmental level, and the preferences of the\nphysician. Developmental testing by the pediatrician is similar to what a child\npsychologist or speech-language pathologist does, but briefer, less formal, and\nshould not use instruments that are reserved for use by psychologists or SLP\u2019s.\nThe purpose of developmental testing (in my view) is not to duplicate what a\npsychologist or SLP can do. Rather, it\u2019s to enable the pediatrician to  compare notes  with the psychologist or\nSLP \u2013 in the same way that a pediatrician or internist may look at an X-Ray,\nform his or her own opinion, then talk to the Radiologist. If you are at a\nmulti-disciplinary clinic, the developmental evaluation phase of your child\u2019s\nvisit also may include assessments by other clinicians in addition to the\ndoctor, such as a psychologist, Occupational and/or Physical Therapist, or\nSpeech-Language Pathologist. You may be interviewed by a social worker. \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n Ideally,\n  your child will be given a chance to warm up to the doctor before any testing\n  begins. In my practice, once the parent interview is completed, the parents\n  and I return to the waiting room. I instruct the parents to play with their\n  child, as if they were at home, and not to worry about getting their child to\n  perform for the doctor. Initially I sit across the room and observe. Then,\n  bit by bit, I approach the child and eventually try to insert myself into the\n  child\u2019s play, still letting the child direct the interaction. Of course, all\n  of the child\u2019s behavior during this phase of the visit helps me in forming my\n  diagnostic impression, but the child does not feel the as if he or she is\n  being \u201ctested\u201d at this point. Once the child is comfortable with me, we move\n  on to the next phase: Developmental testing. This means shifting from the\n  waiting room (full of toys) to the examining room (bare, except for whatever\n  toys or other items I produce out of my desk or bag). Depending on the\n  child\u2019s age and developmental level, testing may occur with the child seated\n  on the floor, in a parent\u2019s lap, or seated in a chair at the table. The\n  parents are present as observers, but I instruct them beforehand to remain\n  silent, and direct their eye gaze towards me. This gives the child the\n  unspoken message that I am the only source of adult attention for the moment,\n  and has the effect of greatly increasing compliance. Another reason I bring\n  parents into the room during developmental testing is so that they can let me\n  know afterwards how well I did at eliciting their child\u2019s cooperation, and\n  respond to the question \u201cHow did your child\u2019s behavior compare to what you\n  thought he or she would do under these circumstances?\u201d \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n The\nnext portion of the evaluation phase will be a physical and neurological\nexamination by the doctor. You should be present for this portion of the\nexamination. Sometimes, with teens, the doctor may ask you to step out, and\nhave a nurse in the room instead. The doctor will look for any findings on\nphysical exam that might offer a clue as to what\u2019s going on developmentally. During\nthis phase of the evaluation the doctor will also look at gross and fine motor\nskills, tone, and coordination in ways that overlap with what an Occupational\nTherapist (OT) and Physical Therapist (PT) do. As with the assessment of\ncognitive and language skills (which overlap with the domains evaluated by a\npsychologist and SLP), this portion of the evaluation is not meant to replace\nwhat an OT or PT can offer. Rather, by doing a hands-on evaluation, the doctor\nwill be able to meaningfully compare his or her impressions with those of an OT\nor PT. \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n Occasionally\n  I come across a situation where someone has referred a child to a Child\n  Neurologist, \u201cbecause the child needs a neurological exam.\u201d In actuality, one\n  does not need to be a neurologist in order to perform a neurological exam.\n  Most Developmental-Behavioral Pediatricians, and all Neurodevelopmental\n  Pediatricians, are capable of performing a comprehensive neurological\n  examination. I frequently refer children to Child Neurologists for a second\n  opinion if I find an abnormality on neurological examination. But if my\n  neurological exam is normal, then sending the child to a Child Neurologist for\n  a second exam is unlikely to turn up additional information.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Counseling \n \n The\nfinal phase of the visit involves summing up the findings and making\nrecommendations. If your child\u2019s evaluation is being conducted by an\ninterdisciplinary team, there may be a wait of several days or more between the\nevaluation phase and the parent conference. During the parent conference, the\ndoctor (and sometimes other members of the team) will share their diagnostic\nimpressions. These will include some statement regarding your child\u2019s\nunderlying developmental diagnosis and medical diagnosis, as well as\nrecommendations regarding further testing (medical or developmental), and\nintervention (therapies, school, etc.). The doctor and/or social worker should\nexplain what will happen next (how to connect with your Early Intervention\nprovider; applying for Medical Assistance, etc.) \u00a0Finally, the doctor should suggest a time for\na follow-up visit, to see how your child is progressing, and to see how well\nyou are doing, both emotionally and with respect to putting together the necessary\nteam of people to help your child. \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n In\n  my practice, counseling occurs immediately after completion of the evaluation\n  phase. Upon completion of the physical and neurological exam, the child\n  returns to the waiting room and goes back under the watchful eye of the third\n  adult; the parents accompany me into my office. Having the child out of the room\n  lets the parents give me their undivided attention, and gives the parents a\n  chance to react emotionally. My practice is a bit unusual. Most physicians do\n  not require a 3 rd  adult, or even that both parents attend. This is\n  unfortunate. Often, it is inappropriate to talk about a child in front of the\n  child, and it is supremely unfair to burden one spouse with the task of\n  having to go home and tell the other spouse \u201cwhat the doctor said.\u201d This is\n  doubly true if the parents are separated or divorced. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n What\nare the questions I should be asking? \n \n Remember the things every cub\nreporter is taught to put into each news story:  Who, what, when, where, why, and how . \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Why?  \n \n Why isn\u2019t my child walking, talking,\nor behaving as other children the same age? This question has two answers: the\ndevelopmental diagnosis, and the medical diagnosis. For example, if your child\nhas no eye contact, echolalia, stereotypies, and insistence on routines, the\ndevelopmental answer may be \u201cYour child has Autism Spectrum Disorder.\u201d For a\nphysician, however, ASD is just a list of symptoms. The deeper \u201cwhy\u201d is\nmedical: Your child has ASD  because of \nsome underlying medical condition (Fragile-X, some other genetic or metabolic\nabnormality, family genetics, etc.). Sometimes, answering this medical \u201cwhy\u201d\nleads to additional information about medical care, prognosis, and/or can\nenable you to link up with other parents whose children have the same underlying\nmedical condition. There is always strength in numbers. Sometimes the medical\n\u201cwhy\u201d also touches on another parental concern: Could this happen to us again?\nOr, what about our children\u2019s children?  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n What, Where and How? \n \n What can we do to help our child achieve\nhis or her milestones? This includes a discussion of different forms of\ntherapy, who the therapy providers are, as well as where and how to get your\nchild enrolled in services. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n When? \n \n When will my child achieve specific\nskills? Sometimes the best answer to that question, especially at the initial\nvisit, is \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d In fact, I would be a bit skeptical of anyone who\ntries to give you unequivocal answers to prognostic questions at the initial\nvisit. \u201cWait and see\u201d all by itself is never an appropriate strategy. But\n\u201cLet\u2019s start therapy, and then revisit this question in a few months\u201d is\nusually acceptable, and often preferable to offering the family hasty\npredictions (pessimistic or optimistic). \n \n \n \n What\nis the most important thing(s) we can tell the doctor? \n \n \n \n This\nmay sound corny, but the most important thing you can tell the doctor is  exactly what\u2019s on your mind . Sometimes\nparents are embarrassed or afraid to speak their mind. Don\u2019t be. Some parents are\nafraid of disagreeing with their spouse. Don\u2019t be. This is a time when the\ndoctor needs to hear from both of you.\u00a0 Don\u2019t\nworry about asking the doctor \u201cstupid questions.\u201d There is no such thing as a\nstupid question, and any doctor who makes you feel otherwise isn\u2019t someone you\nwant to go back to. Likewise, don\u2019t be afraid to ask the doctor to repeat\nsomething, or re-phrase it, until you actually understand. And don\u2019t be afraid\nto redirect the doctor, if necessary: \u201cDoctor, I need you to talk about X.\u201d What\nthe doctor doesn\u2019t want is for you to say to yourself in the car on the way\nhome \u201cI never got to talk about what was really bothering me.\u201d  \n \n \n \n How should I\nprepare my child for this visit? \n \n \n \n Be\nsure you and your child both get a good night\u2019s sleep the night before the\nvisit. \n \n \n \n The\nspecific information you give your child will depend on your child\u2019s age and\ndevelopmental level. For preschool children, something like this is usually\nenough: \u201cWe are going to see a new doctor, like Dr. X (your child\u2019s regular\nphysician). The new doctor will ask you some questions, play some games with\nyou, and do a checkup, but no shots.\u201d You might want to tell your child a few\ndays ahead of time, show them on the calendar, and then repeat the same\ninformation each day, marking off the days until the visit. \u00a0For older children, who may be aware that they\nare struggling, or somehow different from their peers, something like this is\ngood: \u201cWe know that you have a hard time with (X). This doctor may be able to\nhelp make it easier for you.\u201d It\u2019s also good to tell older children in several\ndays in advance, but children who are anxious or obsessive may get overly fixated\non the impending visit. If that describes your child, then telling your child\none day in advance is probably best. You definitely do  not  want to spring the visit on your child as a surprise, on the\nmorning of the visit. \n \n \n \n Your\nattitude is just as important as whatever specific factual information that you\nconvey to your child. If you are calm and relaxed about the upcoming visit,\nyour child is more likely to be calm and relaxed too. If you are anxious or\nfearful, your child will \u201ccatch\u201d those feelings and become anxious and fearful.\nI realize that this may be asking the impossible of you, especially if you are\n(a) worried about your child, and (b) you have had to wait a long time for the\nappointment. The best thing to remember is \u201cI don\u2019t have to get everything out\nall at once. I can take this one step at a time.\u201d This carries over to the\ndoctor\u2019s office: Try to refrain from urging your child to perform for the\ndoctor (unless asked). This can be difficult! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What do I do if\nI feel that I\u2019m not being listened to? \n \n \n \n The\nbest thing to do is be candid, in a way that is clear, but non-confrontational.\nMake \u201c \u2018I\u2019 statements\u201d rather than \u2018You\u2019 statements.\u201d Saying \u201cDoctor, you just\naren\u2019t listening!\u201d is not going work as well as saying \u201cDoctor, I just don\u2019t\nfeel that I\u2019m making myself clear.\u201d The former way of putting it is liable to\nmake the doctor feel defensive or impatient. The latter way of putting it may\nelicit extra effort from the doctor, and a clarifying question such as \u201cTell me\nwhat you mean.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t, then you may need to find a physician who is a\nbetter listener. On the other hand, be wary of quacks, who are very good at\nsounding sympathetic, but whose technical skills and methods are suspect.\nQuackery thrives in part because of the substandard listening skills of some\nmembers of the mainstream medical profession. \n \n \n \n What should I\nexpect after the visit? \n \n \n \n You\nand your child\u2019s primary care physician should each receive a detailed,\ntypewritten report summarizing your concerns, a brief synopsis of the outside\nrecords, a summary of the findings during the evaluation, and the specific\nrecommendations. This report should be written in terms a lay person can\nunderstand. If there are recommendations for medical testing, the report should\nspell out whether the developmental pediatrician will be doing them, of if they\nhave been deferred back to the primary care physician. The doctor is not doing\nyou some kind of favor by writing a report; it is his or her legal\nresponsibility to document what happened during the visit, and you have a right\nto receive a copy of the report in a timely fashion. Typically, the report also\nwill include a suggested time for a follow-up visit. In many instances, one or\nmore follow-up visits will be necessary in order to determine your child\u2019s rate\nof progress, and in order to monitor the \u201cfit\u201d between your child\u2019s developmental\nsituation and the services he or she is receiving. \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n In\n  my own practice, about one third of families come  just\n  for an initial visit; another third come \u201clike clockwork\u201d every six to 12\n  months, and the final third come episodically, usually when there is a crisis\n  or major transition in the child\u2019s life. Distance is not as much of a factor\n  as you might think. I have families from all over the country who come to see\n  me on a regular schedule. I also have families that live nearby who ought to\n  be coming in for routine monitoring, but who only call when there\u2019s a big\n  problem. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Dr. Coplan completed his residency in pediatrics at Hartford Hospital (1973-75), followed by two years in the National Health Service Corps (1975-77).

{"date": "Thursday, January 24, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nTalkability is a  parent-oriented program  offered by the Hanen Centre, and they have a guidebook with the same name. Geared towards parents of verbal children on the spectrum, it offers excellent tools on how to help children learn to engage in reciprocal conversations. \n \n \n \nSo often, as parents, we're lost on what to do to help our children. It can and is painful for us to watch when our kids are always on the periphery, not interacting with their neurotypical peers, and we flounder, trying to figure out what tools our children need and how we can help them acquire them. \n \n \n \nAnd let's be brutally frank: we, their parents, might be floundering on how to help them because we find those same situations confusing and uncomfortable. How many of us wandered the edge of the playground, watching but not sure how to engage other kids? I know I was one of those who preferred to be with the teachers and talking to them or in the library where I could read to my heart's content. I found my peers often unapproachable, as if they were living in a completely different world. \n \n \n \nNow, sure, I turned out fine without that toolkit... \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd chances are, your kids will find their niche with positive support and acceptance, but if they are on the edges watching and wanting to engage, then giving them some tools, well, come on, that's a good thing to do. The more tools in their toolkit, the easier they will find it to approach others confidently and to make sense of what we often find to be mystical: the chit chat that people do to pass the time. \n \n \n \nIt beats standing there looking blank and planning ways to escape. \n \n \n \nTalkability is colorful and most important, it's not intimidating. The skills it teaches are helpful for parents, too. I mean, how many times have you stood there at the school with all the other parents, shuffling your feet, avoiding looking at them and hoping to heck that they wouldn't ask you a question? I know that was an everyday occurrence for me when I'd pick up the kids from school. I'd get there early because I was terrified they'd come out the door and bolt into the busy parking lot because their teachers were distracted. So there I was, twenty minutes early every day for years waiting to grab them as they hit the doorway. I'd stand there, leaning against the wall, waiting, nodding as mom after mom joined me and we did this weird dance of glancing, nodding, shuffling, muttering something about the weather, enduring the awkward silences that popped up. If I'd had this book five years ago, both the girls and I would have probably found their early years of school easier to endure. It's that good a toolkit. \n \n \n \nI still would probably find chit chat with strangers kinda pointless, but I'd be able to do it better, and that's a good skill to have. It beats closing your eyes and pretending you're alone. :) \n \n \n \nGive the Hanen Centre a look. I enjoyed reading Talkability and will be implementing some of their tools with the kids and when I'm getting my haircut and the hairdresser asks me questions.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hanen.org/Hanen-Programs/Programs-For-Parents/TalkAbility-Parent-Program.aspx", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r7QqT3kNe-U/UP8ZzFgncsI/AAAAAAABWr4/aUfCf4PbK2s/s1600/P1220009.JPG"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/01/book-review-we-all-need-people-skills.html", "title": "\nBook Review: We All Need People Skills\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 11, 2013", "body": "\nIt's something brushed over, forgotten, hidden, tucked away: when our children are violent, are aggressive, and we need help to get them help. \n \n \nNot all of us in the community will be able to personally relate, and that's okay--what's important is that we recognize and support everyone. \n \n \n \nSome children (and adults) with autism will be physically aggressive, will need a greater degree of support to manage these outbursts, to find ways to communicate their needs in a way that doesn't hurt themselves or others. \n \n \n \nInsurance companies don't like to pay for long-term treatment, and good treatment centers, well--there aren't enough of them, and they're expensive. And the government, through medicaid, rarely wants to pay for the length of treatment needed or period. \n \n \n \nIt isn't right. It isn't fair. And it adds a stressor to families already teetering on the edge. And this isn't about bad parenting, nor a lack of love and care for the autistic child. These parents who have children with aggression issues often love their kids deeply, are doing everything they can to help them, and they keep coming up against brick walls and no answers. \n \n \n \nTo compound it, to make it all so much worse, is that when the families do reach out to the community, they are often left with vitriolic, judgmental comments and a holier-than-thou attitude by people certain they could keep it from happening. \n \n \n \nListen, some things you just have to live through to know. We've been blessed that aggression was something we only dealt with for a few years, before Bobby's stroke rewired his brain so that the aggression stopped cold. Before that, I was his punching bag, his jungle gym. When he was three, four, five, that wasn't a problem. When he was nine and 100 pounds thanks to risperadol, getting climbed on, smacked, head butted, well, hey, that shit hurt. \n \n \n \nWe got lucky. I know that. Bobby knows that. He found other ways to channel his frustration. He got better at communicating. After his stroke, all the meds he was on were stopped, and we brought him home to home school him. Huh, was it the stroke, or everything else after that stopped the aggressive behavior? I'll never know for sure, and that lack of certainty is a good thing. \n \n \n \nIt means I can relate, that I can stop and consider whether I have any answers to give with absolute conviction to this mom, Kelli,  as she battles to raise enough money to keep her daughter in treatment .\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI don't. I can't even promise with conviction that everything will work out, that things will get better. I can't and won't use platitudes, either. \n \n \n \nWhat I can do is this: share her story and her family's obvious deep love for their daughter Issy and their desire to help her. I can support the family, refuse to shower judgment and disdain on a family that is struggling, hurting.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIssy has a glorious smile. I can't help but notice how glorious all our children's smiles are, how genuine and real they are. Bobby, my sweetheart of a son, refuses or can't fake smile--so we don't do those family portraits at Sears because who wants to go through that when I can wait at home and capture his joy? \n \n \n \nI know, that digresses. But, those smiles, the genuine joy and delight that lights up Issy's face? You need to see that. To know she is a real young woman who needs help so she can live a happy, successful life, so that she and her family can get the tools they need to help her do that. \n \n \n \n Team Issy .

{"date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2013", "body": "\nA new blog and website came to my attention through Flappiness Is's  latest post :\u00a0A Dog for David:\u00a0 http://www.dogfordavid.com/ . \n \nA family is trying to raise the money for their son to get an autism service dog. Service dogs are wonderful resources for individuals who need them. Let's be honest, dogs are wonderful for all people. The bond between a dog and his or her person is a delight to witness and a wonder to experience (In Kathleen's case, sometimes the bond is one of duty to a dog that drives everyone crazy and tries to eat the chickens, which is not cool). \n \nWe've added this new blog to the directory, and I thought I'd bring both Flappiness Is's post and the blog to readers' attention for a specific reason: drama. \n \nI don't know the details of who's currently attempting to discredit the author of the blog, and I don't need to. If you've been online long enough, there's no doubt that you've experienced being on both sides of that equation. I have. It's not pretty. It's not fun. In the end, it's completely a waste of time, time that could have been spent making a positive change. \n \nSo why do we keep striking out at one another? Why can't we put common interests ahead of egos and competing ideologies? \n \nMostly because we're human and flawed. We come online for a variety of reasons, and sometimes that's to strike out, sometimes that's to try to counter what we think are horrendous mischaracterizations and misinformation, and in our zeal to to right wrongs, we commit our own wrongs. \n \nI think the drama, the trolls, how ugly it can get when we put ourselves out there in our truth, all of that contributes to a rapid turnover in bloggers. Yes, some hang in there for years, but I've seen bloggers come and go in the last four years, people I thought were wonderful writers and had important perspectives to share. These are people I still miss. I understand, but still... \n \nI've also seen that blogging relationships and friendships rise and fall on the focus of interest, and how a difference of opinion can destroy what were supportive friendships. \n \nWe're thorny people, and we've all been wounded by our friends, our communities, strangers, and sometimes, even our own families. All of us, whether we are on the spectrum, bouncing around the edges of it, or simply connected to ones who are, have been hurt, misunderstood. \n \nWe come here, online, seeking kinship and community and distraction, and we each find these things in our own way. \n \nWe often forget that there are people at the other end of our rants, our accusations, our own hurt or anger, and that our words, our responses can make their lives harder. We forget to be kind. We forget to empathize with someone in a different situation, especially if the other person is combative,\u00a0acerbic, or bitter. \n \nI once took comments that disagreed with me or were curt, short, abrupt, as meaning that the other individual was discounting my perspective. I was shortsided, as one of my most rewarding friendships has been built with an individual whose comments I once viewed combatively. I'm so glad we kept trying, though, to understand each other. What a difference. Support, understanding, respect and no need to agree with everything with each other. See, we can be blessed and find that with people who are incredibly similar and yet fantastically different, like I have with Kathleen, and we can find it with those who hold radically different points of view, too, if we'll hang in there and work to understand. It's not a one way street, of course, as relationships take two to build. \n \nKurt Vonnegut often repeated his favorite lines from his Uncle Alex, one that resonates more each day with me, and showcased in his novel\u00a0 God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\u00a0 (despite the fact that Vonnegut was a flawed human being who often failed to live up to this line):\u00a0\"There's only one rule that I know of, babies\u2014God damn it,  you've got to be kind. \" \n \nOne thing is certain: we can't go back and undo damage we've done with our words or actions, but we can go forward trying to live up to that adage, even though we are sure to fall short. \n \nGive A Dog for David a looksee, share it if you see fit, welcome the family into the online autism world, with all its flaws and all its glory, and damn it, be kind if you can, and if you can't, try not to make other people's lives worse. \n \nBest, Kim\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://flappinessis.com/a-plea-to-my-readers-with-apologies-for-the-drama/", "http://www.dogfordavid.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/02/dog-for-david-and-drama.html", "title": "\nDog for David and Drama\n"},

The FDA is being swayed by these letters.

The last three years, I've asked my students to think about it, too. It was again the topic of a class discussion this semester. \n \n \n \n 2010 \n \n \nIt's time to look close, deeply at ourselves, our prejudices, and acknowledge that we all have them, that there's a group of folks we disparage. We need to question why. We need to challenge ourselves on our language, and acknowledge our slips and that we all have a ways to go towards accepting others who are different, with different challenges. We need to experience that dissonance, hold ourselves up to examination, and accept that we've got some dark sides that we need to bring out to the light. \n \n \n \n 2011 \nI'm not sure there's a solution here; people do some spectacularly stupid things, even the smartest people. There ought to be a way to convey those failures of cognition without a derisive attitude that somehow still conveys the humanity, the value, and the validation of that humanity and value. I fear it's so much easier and so much more satisfying to just slip into the use of those words that convey that attitude than it is to painstakingly break down the claims being made, bit by singular, spectacular failing bit. \nThe problem is we're human, hypocrisy is inevitable, and lapses in theory of mind and the golden rule are going to happen. \n \nI'm all for ending the use of the \"R\" word, but it's the attitude behind the word that has to be changed, and whether we use that particular word or not, I'm willing to bet that underlying attitude is one we all employ at one point or another. \n \n \n 2012 \nWords HURT. We have to work harder to remember that, and to remember that we are all human and frail, fallible creatures who make mistakes but get up the next day determining to do better. \nLet us not only resolve to do better, but actually do better. \n \n \n2013 \n \n \nI am not certain we are any closer to changing the use of the word nor the underlying attitudes behind that usage. I look around at the nastiness on the internet, at how t rolls can be rewarded with hundreds of thousands  of followers for their nastiness, and I wonder if we can even put a dent in it, this nastiness that festers. \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0I have to believe, though, that while we cannot eliminate entirely the nastiness that intentionally mean people put out there, that we can change how we use language, that we can create a more accepting society, and that we can become sensitive to how pejorative language demeans us all. \n \n \n \n \n\n\nMcGinley says that it is time to respect individuals with intellectual disabilities, time to end the R-word. \n \nIt's past time to respect those who are different, to accept them as equally valuable human beings. \n \n- See more at:  http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.r-word.org/", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/02/word-that-slips-off-our-tongue-without.html", "http://www.science20.com/countering_tackling_woo_and_science_asds/its_often_not_word_its_attitude-76643", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2012/03/and-again-word-that-slip-off-our.html", "http://gawker.com/5985943/the-princess-and-the-trolls-the-heartrending-legend-of-adalia-rose-the-most-reviled-six+year+old-girl-on-the-internet?post=57693225", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/03/end-word-end-attitude-behind-it.html", "title": "\nEnd the Word: End the Attitude Behind It\n"},

Sure, maybe sometimes they don't do it on purpose, but I have a feeling, having read this excellent book, that this is rarely the case. \n \nThink about the things that our kids are able to do without constant reminders from us. Are there things about that activity that provide external cues or reminders? If there are, then you have your answer. Video games are a perfect example of this--tons of external cues. \n \nOur three part commands or regular routines that we think our child should be able to do on their own since they do it every day? If you aren't there providing the external cues, are there any for them? If not, then they may have an executive functioning issue--if they can't internally cue themselves and keep track of where they are and what they need to do, then why would you expect them to? It doesn't matter if the routine is the same. \n \nI wish this book had been in my hands two decades ago when Bobby was three. It would have saved us all tremendous frustration. \n \nI've written over the years at Countering how I'm mystified by the things Bobby does so very well, and those things he just can't hold onto, and in the end, it really does boil down to executive functioning. \n \nWhen he's cooking, if it's something he needs to tend to closely, he can--external cues. Microwaving or baking he can walk away from and unless he gives himself an external cue like a timer, he doesn't remember to check it. \n \nExternal cues. That is the answer to a lot of his problems in focusing. The problem is that the external cues have to be auditory and sufficient to draw his attention. Written text, notes, signs--those are wholly inadequate for him, but for others they may be just the right thing. \n \nWith the knowledge and insight I've gained from this really excellent text, I can help my children and myself create external cues that work for us so that I don't have to be the external cue for them. \n \nThis, in all honesty, has been a tremendously beneficial book--I rarely am effusive in praise, but what a life-changing book for Bobby and me--any reduction in frustration and the most important thing--the realization that the behavior (not doing something) isn't intentional--oh, my---what a weight off of me and him. \n \nDo yourself and your children (or spouse) a favor and if this is an issue your family is dealing with, read this book. \n \nAnd then don't wallow in guilt for not having known it sooner. \n \n--Kim Wombles\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=24763"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/03/its-all-about-executive-functioning.html", "title": "\nIt's All About the Executive Functioning: A Book Review\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 21, 2013", "body": "\nLast month Kathleen and I were asked if we'd review Dr. James Coplan's book  Making Sense of Autistic Spectrum Disorders . I love its subtitle:  Create the Brightest Future for Your Child with the Best Treatment Options. \n \nIf there's such a thing as an autism expert, Dr. Coplan is it and his book is the first book I'd hand new parents. New parents. Not just new parents to autism, but to all new parents. The first chapter alone is worth the price of the book. Far too often, despite what first time parents might read on the pregnancy and new baby websites and in traditional books, they are still often unprepared for what typical development and atypical development are. And with all the fear being spread about autism, it's likely to be the main concern new parents have. \n \nDr. Coplan's book is detailed and yet easy to read, has easily understood graphics that provide a quick overview of development, and explains autism in a way that is not focused on a deficit model so much as a difference model. His approach is a calm, accepting one and parents will not be terrified if they begin to suspect their little girl or boy fits the autism spectrum traits better than she or he does the typically developing model. \n \nAnd because his book is no-nonsense and evidence-based, parents who read it before they go googling autism and finding those who are not evidence-based, there's a greater chance that parents reading his book won't panic, won't be desperate, will have a clear roadmap to getting diagnosis and approaching therapies and looking at outcomes. That, my friends, is priceless. \n \nOne of the biggest heartaches I've experienced over parenting in the last 23 years is the lack of a guidebook, no clear idea of what to do exactly, and having to find my own way, with some pseudoscientific stumbles along the way. It didn't help that the professionals I dealt with the last two decades were either doom and gloom or clueless, either. \n \nI may be well along the autism path, with my oldest approaching his 24th birthday and the girls turning 12 and 10 this year, but there's still a lot to learn, a lot of growing up to do, and even though I've read countless studies, focused on autism in my master's degree, and read everything I can get my hands on when it comes to autism, I have to acknowledge I can't know it all, keep up with it all, and a handy guidebook to thumb through when I've got a question or am anxious is worth its weight in gold. Dr. Coplan's book will stay by my chair, where I can easily pull it out and thumb through it for hope, for comfort, for guidance, for my three kids. --- Kim Wombles \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 I could easily just write \"What Kim said\" and it would be the honest truth. In the years that we as a family have been aware of autism, I have yet to find a book that helped to explain the many ways that autism can present itself. \u00a0A book that not only explained what was going on-but also gave valuable help as to what could be done-In a positive and matter of fact manner. Until now. \n \n \n \n\u00a0Ten years ago, when my oldest was four, we were basically handed a diagnosis and a hand shake. Kind of \u00a0a \"Here's your diagnosis-good luck with that!\".. We relived the same experience two years later with our next child. I remember feeling so lost-and so very alone. \u00a0The doctors and other professionals we were working with seemed to know as little as we did-or did not seem to think it was worth our while to really explore any other options. There was so much that we had to figure out on our own-so many opportunities that I think we missed-simply because we did not know enough. The information was hard to find.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0 In some ways the world has changed since my boys were diagnosed. \u00a0There is much more information readily available-especially through the internet. \u00a0The problem is in figuring out what is good information and what is not. Having done this for so long-I really thought that I knew most of what there was to know. Until one of my daughters was diagnosed four years ago. I felt so silly for not having recognized it earlier! \u00a0As Kim mentioned above-clearer\u00a0guidelines\u00a0and a\u00a0road-map\u00a0is information that is priceless indeed. Dr. Coplan's book has it all. \n \n \n \n\u00a0 I would absolutely recommend this book to the parents of any child on the spectrum. It is direct, it is matter of fact and most importantly it is positive.

{"date": "Sunday, April 14, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nFrom  KATiE MiA/Aghogday :\u00a0 Views From the Autism Spectrum and Beyond The \"Broader Amish Autism Phenotype\" vs. \"The Autistic Matrix\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n There is a 1 in 271 prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders reported in two Amish Counties in a door-to-door screen, from preliminary results of a study in 2011, as opposed to the 1 in 50 prevalence in the rest of the US, from a phone survey of parents for children actually diagnosed, a recent study supported by the CDC.\u00a0 https://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper7336.html\u00a0 http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr065.pdf\u00a0 Autism is diagnosed as not only symptoms characteristic of the condition, but also as one that impairs one in a major area of life functioning. Acceptance is an ongoing issue in daily life that changes by the moment depending on who one is dealing with.\u00a0 One cannot demand acceptance from one that chooses not to provide it, except when there are carrots and sticks that others yield to in response. People often act as if they accept their supervisors or other authority figures, but it does not mean they feel that way inside.\u00a0 I suspect that people on the spectrum are more likely accepted by others, in Amish Counties and contribute greatly to society, as there is often enough to do to keep everyone busy for basic survival. Along with enough social roles to fill in a close knit society.\u00a0 People in Amish Counties often do not do well in the larger world when they leave there to join the rest of the world.\u00a0 It is more likely the social stress of the larger world, which makes characteristics on a much broader autism phenotype, 30 to 45 million people just in the US, observed in every country and small culture in the world, a diagnosis in some cultures verses a continued broader autism phenotype in others.\u00a0 It is also potentially part of the reason that some folks, who are being diagnosed at 40 now, would likely be diagnosed at 20 now if born 20 years later because the social demands of this fast paced chaotic culture, now exceed capacity for fuller social adaptation.\u00a0 People do not usually get a diagnosis, unless they are having substantial problems adapting. They often remain on that broader autism phenotype.\u00a0 The DSM5 now defines Autism as symptoms of a broader autism phenotype that occur in early childhood but may not fully manifest as symptoms of an actual diagnosed condition until social demands exceed social adaptation.\u00a0 Every child, later diagnosed with Autism, starts on a broader autism phenotype first.\u00a0 There can be many associated factors that lead to the actual diagnosis, including superficial issues such as how the condition may be defined, how it is subjectively assessed, and awareness and accessibility of health care leading to a diagnosing professional.\u00a0 I do not think it is practical to use the term Autism for online communities. I like the phrase \"neurodiversity communities\" as a place where every person who feels \"neurodiverse\" can feel free to interact with others with an almost unlimited number of neurological differences.\u00a0 That is already the effective reality anyway, as many people have not made it to the point, where they feel the need or have access to healthcare to move from broader autism phenotype to actual diagnosis.\u00a0 That is as long as everyone is welcome, as is the case most often on some websites, like the Wrong Planet website, where people do not find themselves in the same larger world trap of unspoken political/social ideologies they are not accepted for unless they comply and conform.\u00a0 I think in Amish counties, overall, it is an issue of effective opportunity for and resulting social adaptation, which is often associated with acceptance from others.\u00a0 I think that overall that is what all social animals look for in life.\u00a0 I do not generally observe people on the spectrum as anti-social animals.\u00a0 I think it is possible to legislate greater opportunities for social adaptation through employment and laws like the ADA. However, acceptance more often depends on social adaptation, which does not necessarily mean being a \"social butterfly\", as much as finding an environmental niche in a role to play as some type of contributing player.\u00a0 People are having a harder time adapting, so overall society is not working, as it should, at least for those who are having trouble adapting.\u00a0 Things are getting better for those most severely impacted by co-morbid medical conditions, but that is only a piece of the overall adaptation pie that exists from birth to death. The other pieces do seem to be harder to find for some now than they used to be.\u00a0 The result of that is the expansion of people identifying with Autism as a source of online acceptance. That expansion currently, is not effectively inclusive enough for everyone looking for that acceptance on a much broader autism phenotype or what others refer to as \"neurodiversity\".\u00a0 This is a potential source of conflict that exists between some parents of children on the spectrum and other people identifying on a spectrum. They are most often on the same team of a broader autism phenotype, and at times cannot clearly see that commonality, in each other. Additionally, they are most often looking for the same thing for themselves, support and acceptance. That will probably eventually change for the better online, as the basic opportunity for social adaptation and acceptance in the \"real world\" does not appear to be moving in a positive direction.\u00a0 The Sequester is near evidence of that future. So is increasing avenues of online participation among those identifying with Autism as not just a diagnosis, but also a way of life.\u00a0 I think it is unfortunate the potential reasons why the prevalence rate of Autism is much lower in Amish counties cannot be fuller explored by research, because, at least in part, it has become politically incorrect to do so, over the unwarranted vaccine concerns.\u00a0 I think this type of research could go a long way in helping people on the spectrum. I provided that comment in the last congressional oversight hearing, as a written one, but the results of that hearing in the continued focus on unwarranted mercury fears, continues to drown some of the valid concerns and efforts that could potentially help people now.\u00a0 I believe that offline connections, which do not currently do well past support groups in large cities, are the first step to a larger \"real life\" community of people on the spectrum. However, I think that part of the reason that the offline connections do not happen, is because the opportunity for online ones continue to expand dramatically.\u00a0 In addition, this certainly is not an issue specific to people on the spectrum.\u00a0 Most ironically, it could be part of the overall issue of what leads to a diagnosis in the real world for some, moving from that broader autism phenotype to a diagnosed spectrum.\u00a0 It is in some ways potentially a \"catch 22\" situation.\u00a0 I had offline connections with people on that broader autism phenotype through most of the course of my life through school and work.\u00a0 There were no labels then, however as I look back those people were always there. Those same opportunities I had in my historical field of work I could depend on with job security no longer exist.\u00a0 For many reasons, my field of work was a magnet for people on that broader autism phenotype that one could observe nationwide. Effectively, my workplace was a \"Neurodiversithy Community\".\u00a0 One of my co-workers did the \"flapping stim\", where my \"stim\" was a religious routine of vigorous exercise. I never made the connection in his \"flapping\" and my exercise routine until it was pointed out as a \u201cstim\u201d that some people on the spectrum share.\u00a0 There is no description of \"flapping\" in any diagnostic manual. The only place one can usually find a description is in online autism communities. Alternatively, as was in my case, a real life observation in my \"Neurodiversity Workplace\".\u00a0 I never came across anyone \"flapping\", in school that I can remember.\u00a0 The people have not changed that much but the opportunity for \"Stims\" has. The idea of sitting still was horrifying to me in the workplace, behind a desk job, as I was hyperactive, now identified as ADHD.\u00a0 I might have eventually \"flapped\" too, as when I was finally trapped behind a computer; I had to do push-ups to release frustration and tension, and eventually succumbed to problems with hypersensitivity to light and sound.\u00a0 In trying to explain that to an elder co-worker, also obviously on a broader Autism phenotype, her response was stress does weird \"s**t\" to you.\u00a0 There is now research that shows dysfunction of the stress response and adrenaline associated neuro-hormones, is associated with sensory integration problems.\u00a0 I think this is part of the issue for people who are young that are under a level of chronic stress that I cannot imagine in a rural town, with a short walk to a small school, without even stimulation from a TV set.\u00a0 For all practical intents and purposes, I grew up in something similar to an Amish County, and my ancestors more so.\u00a0 That is how culture used to be for thousands of years.\u00a0 People were closer to the earth in hunting and gathering, and/or agriculture. The old order of \"Agri\" Culture is in many ways like Amish Culture.\u00a0 Some of the answers seem blatantly obvious to me because I have experienced so many different perspectives in just one life.\u00a0 People now are often born in to an environment of one full serving of cultural complexity on one plate. The yearning for a place where people can successfully adapt is at the crux of many of the problems of modern civilization, I think, and again this is certainly not an issue specific to Autism.\u00a0 However, I do think that people on the spectrum are among the effective \"Canaries in the Coal Mine\", per inherent propensity toward these greater difficulties in this type of new required social/environmental adaptation.\u00a0 With that perspective taken, the discussion from the Wrong Planet website related to this issue linked below is in some ways a cautionary tale for the rest of society. Some people in that discussion may be among those singing the song of the \"Canary in the Coal mine\".\u00a0 In this event, not a noxious gas or vaccines are the offender.\u00a0 It is a way of life, at least in part, that people are attempting to escape that they are \"virtually\" trapped in, per \"Catch 22\", in what is becoming an effective life that is \"Matrix\", in nature, for some. \u00a0 http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt224454.html Continued\u00a0Discussion and Informal\u00a0Poll\u00a0from the Wrong\u00a0Planet website linked here: http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt228582.html \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://katiemiaaghogday.blogspot.com/", "http://katiemiaaghogday.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-broader-amish-autism-phenotype-vs.html", "https://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper7336.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr065.pdf", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt224454.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt228582.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/04/guest-post-katie-miaaghogday.html", "title": "\nGuest Post: KATiE MiA/Aghogday\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2013", "body": "\nFrom  Yes, That Too What Reading Self-Advocate Blogs Does I probably wrote this way back in October, and  I have had thoughts about the term self-advocate since, but here's one of the things  I wrote on Autism NOW . Not sure when the rest will be up. Trigger Warning: Mentions of abuse, tragedy/burden talk There's plenty of autistic people blogging, mostly adults since it's mostly adults who blog. Most of the ones I've read, most of the autistic adults who are involved in advocacy that I've talked to, most of the parents who \"get it\" say how important it is to listen to autistic adults. Some people might take the \"what's in it for me\" approach. I'd prefer that self-determination and the right to be included in conversations that concern your own future be reason enough, but just in case it isn't, here are some answers of how it really does help parents to read self-advocate blogs and how it really does help kids when their parents \"get it,\" which is a pretty common result of reading them. You can have hope. Too many of the resources you will find about autism paint a rather dreary picture of a person who will never do, well, anything. Self-advocate blogs and blogs written by Autistic adults that don't have any more relation to autism than \"the writer is Autistic\" both give back the idea that yes, Autistic people really can be satisfied with their lives. It's not even that unusual. It also gives the idea that somehow becoming less disabled isn't a prerequisite for being satisfied with life, which helps with seeing your kid as something other than a tragedy. You can get a good idea of what needs to change so that your child will be OK as an adult. Unfortunately, many of us have had some bad experiences. Reading about them is hard. Imagining that something like that could happen to your child if societal perceptions of autism don't change provides quite the impetus to make sure things do, and it can help you realize that the way you treat autistic adults is, well, the way you are suggesting autistic adults should be treated. That's how you're suggesting people  treat your child later . \n You can get a good idea of what therapies and skills your child will find most likely find useful later (communication skills of some type, ability to speak up about problems, ability to remove oneself from a bad situation) and which ones are less likely to be useful/more likely to make your kid really, really angry ( suppressing all stimming , working towards a career that is not interesting, being taught not to have boundaries.) \n \n You might get a better idea of what is going on in your kids head. Plenty of people talk about how frustrating it is to have no clue what their kid is thinking, and while we don't know exactly what's going on in any head besides our own, there is a good chance that at least one of us has reacted similarly in a similar situation, and it's reasonable that something similar was going through our heads at that point. (Demanding these explanations is bad because it's not our job to translate your kid, but I'm not arguing if you get that understanding from stuff I write anyways and I'm an educator at heart so I'll probably try to answer if you ask.) \n \n You might get a better idea of how your kid can communicate better. (Typing is a favorite of mine, and is generally worth a try.) You can get ideas for things you can try with explanations of exactly how and why it helps and how to tell if it is working.\u00a0 \n \n Being able to think of your kid as something other than a tragedy and a burden is good for your mental health. It's also good for your kids mental health, since knowing that your family considers you a tragedy and a burden really sucks. Like, this is of the level where people have committed suicide over being considered a tragedy and a burden. Talk to any parent of a child who died of cancer- a living child is much better than a dead one, always. Go read  Don't Mourn for Us  while you're at it- it covers the idea that you have an autistic child, and the neurotypical child you may have expected never existed, is not trapped inside the child you have. Having a mentally healthy autistic child is much better than having a psychologically traumatized autistic child, too. Basically, realizing that your kid being autistic is not inherently tragic is going to be good for both your and your kids mental health.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLong story short, as long as your goals for your child come anywhere near lining up with the ones most parents of neurotypical kids I've spoken to have (wanting the kid to be happy, satisfied with their own life, not in danger of dying due to physical/medical needs having been neglected, not traumatized, not getting abused,) reading the blogs of autistic people is a way to realize that all this is possible and give you both hope that this will happen for your kid and ideas on how to help your kid make it happen. Sure, you won't be there to take care of your child forever, but if you help your child learn to take care of his or herself and to get help from others when needed, you won't need to be. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/", "http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/2013/03/what-reading-self-advocate-blogs-does.html", "http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/2013/03/true-but-incomplete.html", "http://autismnow.org/blog/what-reading-self-advocate-blogs-does/", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2012/07/things-you-want-people-to-do-to-your.html", "http://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/quiet-hands/", "http://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/05/guest-post-alyssa-from-yes-that-too.html", "title": "\nGuest Post: Alyssa from Yes, That Too\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 4, 2013", "body": "\n \n guest post  by Suzanne McRae \n \n June 2, 2013 \u00a0By\u00a0 Suzanne McRae \u00a0 \n \n \nToday June 2 nd , 2013\u2026 it is 20 years later after our son\u2019s autism diagnosis, on this day in 1993. \n \nAs I was working in my flower gardens this weekend and I was remembering the year that we had created our first big flower garden at our home and it was the year after our son had been diagnosed with autism. All of a sudden I remembered what date we were\u2026 and realized the next day June 2 nd \u00a0was going to be the 20 th anniversary of our son\u2019s autism diagnosis, a day where it feels that our life was changed forever in so many ways. \n \nA year ago I wrote a\u00a0 blog post \u00a0\u00a0about his diagnosis, he had just turned 3 years old and just a few weeks ago he had his 23rd birthday. \n \n \n \n How is it different for us today than it was for those first 20 years? \n \nWe have survived what felt like intense early years. I had so many fears of the unknown for him especially as an adult. I don\u2019t know how it happened, but he\u2019s now a young adult and we got here without fully realizing it. It seemed to happen almost overnight. \n \nBack then life felt like one big roller-coaster ride for so long\u2026 so many ups and downs, we were rarely ever coasting it seemed\u2026 we were either going upwards at a slower more relaxed page\u2026 but mostly it seemed that the ride took us on a downward dive, experiencing what felt like steep high-speed drops. They were painful times to go through. It felt like we had very little control about our situation, like there were no other choices but to hold on for dear life with all we had so we wouldn\u2019t be thrown off the roller-coaster. \n \nToday it no longer feels like we are on a roller-coaster ride. We choose instead to coast through life with our son at the speed that we wish most of the time. I must say that we rarely ever have any speed bumps along the way. The ride is so much smoother. We have learned to navigate life with greater ease. Learning that we could co-create the life we desired for ourselves was such an important stepping stone in helping us get us there. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, but it certainly does feel like we have arrived. \n \nI believe as a family together we have come through to the other end of the autism tunnel. For the longest time I saw no glimmer of light and today all I am able to see is the light. I no longer see the autism tunnel. We have learned as a family how to shine brighter than we ever have and to live life from a much happier and more peaceful place. We are far from perfect or having it all figured out, but the strides we have made is now very clear to us and boy what a feeling that is. Our life feels so different than it did even 4 years ago when he came out of school. With a shift in our focus and also beginning to dream differently for him and our family, it all began to unfold as we saw it with time. \n \nThe autism has taught me to let go of so many things over the years. I had to learn to trust God and to trust myself and in the future even when I didn\u2019t know how that would look or what would be available to our son. We are learning to live our life from a happier and more peaceful place and from that place more good things will come, even the things we can\u2019t see yet. \n \nIt took me a long time to do this, but eventually I had to learn to disconnect from the things that were driving me over the edge. I could no longer do what didn\u2019t resonate with me anymore. It felt like the fun and joy in my life had been sucked right out of me. The gut-wrenching feelings I experienced all too often were simply trying to show me how to listen to those feelings and learn to trust that they could show me the right way for my son. I had to learn to listen to those feelings, they got so intense I could no longer ignore them. My daughter has been instrumental in teaching me about those gut feelings and what they were trying to tell me. She\u2019s been a powerful influence in my life these past few years as I began to learn to take steps towards trusting and finding my way to my own answers. My husband\u2019s unconditional support all these years has been monumental as well in allowing me to do whatever I felt needed to get done, and this was simply another turn on this journey that he took in stride. \n \nI am now able with greater ease to put my attention and focus on my deepest desires. This has been a lot more fun than how I used to do things. Swimming upstream or against the current so much of the time was never, ever any fun. I am going much more with the flow now, and I am able to attract more of what I wish for in my life because of it. \n \nI rarely ever focus anymore on what anyone else is doing, or what is happening in the autism world. I make conscious efforts to listen to how I feel instead. If it brings me that not so great feeling, I choose for the most part to not go there. If what I wish for my son is slightly different from someone else, I will follow that path that feels right for us instead of not listening to my inner voice. I prefer to keep my energy flowing in the direction that feels right where I know that a world of unlimited possibilities awaits for us and our son. \n \nI have come to realize that our son is showing us what he wants in life. He always believes that what he wants, he can have. He chooses what he loves and eventually, almost always (not quite) it become reality for him. He is teaching us to focus on whatever it is that we want, so we can attract\u00a0it. He knows that the world is filled with unlimited possibilities when one believes. \n \n \n \nSome of the greatest desires that I have for my son is that he always continue to experience an over-abundance of joy\u00a0and happiness in his life; that he feel loved and supported by those that he is closest to in life; that he be able to get access to\u00a0all of the\u00a0opportunities in life that he desires just like us, with no limitations; that he be able to use his gifts and talents and share them with the world. I truly believe that he has many talents that will continue to be revealed. I wish to continue seeing him make his greatest desires a reality and that they continue showing up in his life. \n \nThe past 20 years has helped us to grow and be in a place that is much more peaceful, fun and light-hearted.\u00a0If any of this can give hope to another parent of a special needs child or anyone else for that matter\u2026 it is my hope that my journey has been able to do that for you. I didn\u2019t have any of this figured out 20 years ago. It took me a long time to understand that I had the power within me to change. You can do it too. Keep reaching for the feel good feelings and dream the impossible dreams. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://suzanne-mcrae.com/2013/06/02/20-years-after-the-autism-diagnosis-autism-files/", "http://suzanne-mcrae.com/author/Suzanne/", "http://suzanne-mcrae.com/2012/06/02/the-autism-diagnosis/", "http://wp.me/p2p4iW-2FU"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/06/guest-post20-years-after-autism.html", "title": "\nGuest Post:20 years after the autism diagnosis: Autism Files\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, August 6, 2013", "body": "\n \n Article tries to link Autistic MEN with Child Porn \n \n \n \n \n \n I am sick to my stomach. My blood is boiling and I could burst into flames any second now. Yes, I could spontaneously combust with the disgust I am experiencing right this second. What has me so bent? This article: \n Autism and Child Pornography: A Toxic Combination \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Go ahead. It opens in a new window. It's an article by none other than Eustacia Cutler, Temple Grandin's mother! It's written for the Daily Beast (not sure what I think of that combo) and it's getting more than a few autistic adults up in arms. Before I explain why, I'm going to come right out and say this article is irresponsible and dangerous. If you go by just the bold print, sure, child porn is a toxic combo with anything. It's practically the most heinous of the heinous. It's a level of crime that gets you murdered in prison just for being there. And this article wants you to believe there is an alarming trend of autistic men viewing child porn. \n \n \n \n So what's wrong? First lets take the author's credentials into consideration: \n \n \n \n Eustacia Cutler is a published author. She has a Bachelor of Arts (in what I don't know). Her research in retardation and autism established the basis of two television documentaries. And finally, she wrote school programs for television. That and she raised the most famous and popular autism icon we can mention; Temple Grandin. \u00a0Add all that together and it's reasonable to say that this woman's word is going to be taken at face value as rock solid fact by people who don't know enough about autism themselves. \n \n \n \n And I want to add, I'm sure she knows plenty about autism, but this article is bad news with a capital B-A-D! \n \n \n \n The article starts out with a single case of a young man being caught with child porn on his computer. This young man has autism. Now it's important to note that Eustacia did not interview this man, did \u00a0not examine him or read any of his psychological records (at least she says nothing about any of that). Therefore, everything based on this \u00a0man as an example is absolute speculation. By the way, this is the only case she offers to support her theories or \"facts\". She presents all of her information as fact, by the way. Never does she say \"in my opinion\". \n \n \n \n That brings us to what the whole of her article is really \"supported\" by. Yes, I mean \"supported\" as in using matchsticks to hold up a brick building. She states in the article that her years in studying autism have given her \"insight to autism's social hurdles\". \u00a0I want to point out at this point, that she is specifically talking about autistic MEN. Just the men. She doesn't say \"in such and such circumstances\" she says \"autistic men\" period. What does she say? \n \n \n \n Autistic men have the minds of ten year olds : She doesn't say that certain types of autistic men are like this, she just says that we have the minds of ten year olds. \"They look like grown men but inside they're only 10 years old.\" \u00a0I will agree that immaturity (to varying scales) is commonplace in autism (to both sexes!) but we do grow up. Amazing thought eh? I'm 43 years old, have an IQ of 145, have had jobs since I was 14 (until disability in 2008), managed to survive on my own since I was 14 (in the streets), now have 4 children and a loving wife, and I harbor an intense hatred of crimes against children. You might call me a special case but get this; in my 9 years of study, research and advocacy, in talking to hundreds of different people with autism (my Facebook page has over 4000 people connected to it) I have traded words with exactly ONE person who was arrested for child porn. That was Dr. Nick Dubin and he admitted he knew it was wrong and is now presumably serving time somewhere. And he should be! Even for Dr. Dubin, while he may have had immature thinking, is not 10 years old nor does he have the mind of a 10 year old. At least there's no research evidence to prove this and that brings us to the next point. \n \n \n \n She admits there's no supporting data : That's right. Right in the middle of the article she admits there's no data available to support that autistic men are any more prone to becoming pedophiles than any other classification of human being on the planet. But she continues to present her \"insights\" as \"facts\". Mind you that won't matter one wink to the layman who's trying to learn about autism and stumbles across her article. Posting an article like this, expecting to to be accepted as fact without supporting data (studies, research, crime statistics) is extremely irresponsible. The layman is going to look at this article and go \"OMG, autistic men become pedophiles!\" or \"Oh yeah, I bet that weirdo down the street is one of these.\" \u00a0And my next point doesn't \u00a0help because I'm quoting her directly when I say: \n \n \n \n \" They don't want to be taught by adults, they want to be taught by 10 year olds \": Dear God! When I was dating at 17, 18, and 19 on up... I had an age requirement that I was very serious about. If you couldn't go where I go because of age... we didn't date, PERIOD. I wouldn't go more than a year backwards at 17. \u00a0A couple years ago I gave my daughter grief for dating a guy a bit older than her. And for the record, I was taught by a woman older than me. I wouldn't have had it any other way. You can bet I plan to teach my son what's appropriate too! All of this article is so sadly generalized it's frightening. There's no way to misunderstand highlighted points like that unless you just can't figure out basic English. And what studies do these words come from. What supports the idea that adult men with autism (spectrum not withstanding) would rather mess around with 10 year olds? Well, according to Eustacia, adult autistic men are retarded and infantile and don't know any better. According to her, we're slaves to our sex drives and stunted in the brain. But this article targeting autistic men doesn't stop making leaps into madness there.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n She takes a slap at Tony Attwood that's not even related to the article : You read that right. What does Tony Attwood have to do with any of her article. Oh, I know, he's a man and has autism! But her slap actually has nothing to do with the article at all!\u00a0 \n \n Quote: \n \n\u00a0 I asked Tony Attwood, an internationally known autism counselor who works directly with those young men with Asperger who despair of finding their way in the world\u2014or of even understanding it. \n \n \n \u201cWere you ever able to stop a boy from suicide?\u201d \n \n \n \n He turned from me, his face taut: \u201cI think maybe I did ... once.\u201d \n \n Wha? Suicide? What does Tony Attwood saving some kid from suicide have to do with child porn? What does Tony Attwood have to do with the article at all? I can only call this a personal slap or stab. Apparently she doesn't like Tony Attwood. What better place to bring out the slapping glove than an article about autistic men going pedophile?\u00a0 \n \n I can safely tell you that I am not the only person who feels this way. Check out \u00a0this article \u00a0by Emily Willingham. She breaks it down quite nicely. \n The autism community has enough stigma problems. We're associated with being retarded, weird, or violent. We get labelled as school shooters or fanatical whackos. The last thing in the universe we could ever need is to be associated with pedophilia. I've said it before and I'll say it again:\u00a0 having autism does not make a person any more likely to be a criminal than anyone else. It does not make for instant psychopaths.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I believe we need to teach our children about sexuality and how to protect themselves from predators. We need to teach them internet safety and the law. I don't believe my child having autism automatically makes him a risk as a pedophile. In closing, I submit that, just because you're a celebrity (Jenny McCarthy anyone?) or raise one, it doesn't make everything that comes out of your mouth gold. It doesn't make you an expert. Eustacia Cutler is not a doctor in any form of psychiatry. She posted flamboyant information with no supportive facts or studies to back it up. If I were Temple Grandin, I would be really pissed at my mother about now. \n \n \n \n \n \n Posted by\u00a0 David Wilde \u00a0 at\u00a0 8:24 AM \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thewildeman2.blogspot.com/2013/08/article-tries-to-link-autistic-men-with.html", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/05/autism-and-child-pornography-a-toxic-combination.html", "http://thewildeman2.blogspot.com/2013/08/article-tries-to-link-autistic-men-with.html", "http://thewildeman2.blogspot.com/2013/08/article-tries-to-link-autistic-men-with.html", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/08/05/temple-grandins-mother-links-autism-with-viewing-child-pornography/", "https://plus.google.com/112947551578286185652", "http://thewildeman2.blogspot.com/2013/08/article-tries-to-link-autistic-men-with.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/08/wildemans-words-guest-post-responding.html", "title": "\nWildeman's Words: Guest Post Responding to Eustacia Cutler's Daily Beast piece\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, September 19, 2013", "body": "\n Normally, I would let any critical emails pass right by. Honestly, we don't get many, and most of the time, we're more than willing to consider if we've overstepped.  When the attempted murder of Issy Stapleton happened a little over two weeks ago, we considered whether coverage of it here was appropriate. Instead, we covered it on our own blogs. We do not think of the directory as our soap box, so we try to reserve it for reviews or other people's posts. We'd be willing to post people's pieces on the directory, and if you're interested, please email us with the link. Because the directory belongs to all of us, and all views are welcome, as long as your piece isn't promoting hate speech, we'll most likely post it. Today, Kathleen and I got an email that pissed me off. Big time. I've not been very snarky in a long time, but I had to. I am still raw. I am also a believer of letting things stand rather than whitewashing them away or deleting them. It's hard to maintain accountability when you delete things willy-nilly. Because this email is not terribly personal, and is instead, someone telling us what is right and wrong (see my latest post), I am printing it and my response as I sent it out. That way, anyone who wonders why Kelli Stapleton's request for help back in February remains on this site can potentially run across our answer to that question: We don't remove posts unless the writer of the post requests that we do. Hello. I came across this post by Kelli Stapleton of The Status Woe on your blog: http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/07/guest-post-kelli-from-status-woe.html I don't know if you are aware of this, but she has been arrested and charged with the attempted murder of her 14 year old autistic daughter: http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/10/justice/michigan-autistic-murder-attempt/?iref=obinsite Of course since it is your website, you may post whatever you want. But, REDACTED, I was taken aback that her post(s) remain on your site. Isn't the purpose of your site to provide resources to families with ASD? This isn't exactly a good role model for us. I'm certain that MOST of us are not plotting our child's murder.  I would hope that you would consider removing her post(s). Thanks. -REDACTED_, My immediate reaction to your email was not pleasant. After all, who really likes sanctimonious emails trying to tell you what your site should and should not have on it? But then I thought perhaps you really didn't have a clue as to what our reaction was to the Kelli story, given that it is such a large community. So, here are Kathleen's and my reactions to a story that shook us to the core given my friendship with Kelli and our work to try to help Issy get the treatment she needed. Kathleen's:   http://autismherd.blogspot.com/2013/09/more-than-enough.html Mine: http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/barreling-forward.html http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/recognizing-our-limits.html http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/ignorance-shows-itself.html http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-hope-for-illumination-issy-deserves.html http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/raw.html We're not removing that post. It's going to stay right where it is. She wasn't actively plotting the murder of her daughter in February when she was frantically trying to get help. And by not whitewashing the past, we'll be those good role models who own their history rather than trying to cover up and pretend something didn't happen or wasn't said. But not to worry, should any future searchers happen to come across our directory of over a thousand bloggers, many of whom have also written blogs condemning the actions of Kelli this September as well as blogs of support back in February, we'll copy and paste this response to your email so future searchers will know asking us to remove something we posted on behalf of one of the bloggers linked to on our site is a waste of time. After all, sanctimonious, self-righteous emails do eat up a fair portion of one's day, and I would hate to see anyone else waste precious time that could have been spent wringing her kerchief. Thanks,  Kim *And if you think your email struck a nerve, read Raw. It did.  \n \n \n \n \n Certainly this could be seen as impolitic of me. I don't care.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Removing that post won't change a damn thing nor alter whether we're good role models or not. If there's one thing for certain, it's that we have a huge diversity of opinions reflected in our bloggers. They run the gamut of reactions and I respect them and their right to have their voices heard and read. \n \n \n \n So, impolitic or not, my honest gut reaction to someone telling me what to do regarding this is Bite Me. Big Time. And it's okay if you don't like that reaction.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/10/justice/michigan-autistic-murder-attempt/?iref=obinsite", "http://autismherd.blogspot.com/2013/09/more-than-enough.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/barreling-forward.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/recognizing-our-limits.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/ignorance-shows-itself.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-hope-for-illumination-issy-deserves.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2013/09/raw.html"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/09/fck-censorship.html", "title": "\nF*ck Censorship\n"},

I know that's harsh, but that's what Kelli was that day. It seems that the news coverage and far too many people are forgetting that fact. \n \nThe  latest news story  is about Kelli's friends flooding her with letters of support and money for her defense fund. \n \nIt's not about Issy. Issy appears almost irrelevant: \n \n \nIssy Stapleton, who spent four days in a coma-like state, made an incredible recovery, her father, Matt Stapleton, said earlier this month. \nShe is believed to have suffered brain damage. \nThe Traverse City Record-Eagle earlier featured the family dealing with the girl's acute autism and violent episodes. \n\u00a0The story's focus, though, is squarely on Kelli. As is the focus of the latest post on Kelli's blog: the concern from  Kelli's supporters isn't about Issy ; it's about Kelli. \n \nI am still, three weeks later, reeling. You know that feeling of sick despair that takes hold in your chest and gut and twists? I'm there. And I'm so far on the periphery of this family's horrible situation. I can't even imagine how it's tearing up Issy's family. How scared, devastated, confused Issy must be feeling, the emotions her siblings are grappling with, her dad is dealing with. \n \nThis is a nightmare I am sure they all, including Kelli, wish they could wake up from. It's not, though, and how we talk about autistic people is vitally important here. We have a responsibility to Issy, to our children, to our friends on the spectrum, and to ourselves to get this right: to remember who the victim here was. It was not Kelli. She was the perpetrator. \n \n--Kim Wombles \n \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0I can not imagine what it must be like to stand in Issy's shoes right now. \u00a0To be at the center of this horrific crime-and yet, not be the focus. \u00a0I can't imagine how her siblings are feeling, or her dad. \u00a0I can only think that they ALL must be torn in so many different directions. \u00a0Yet, all we hear about is Kelli.  \n \n\u00a0\u00a0It has only been three short weeks and already Issy has been mostly forgotten.

{"date": "Thursday, October 3, 2013", "body": "\n \n Language for Perspectives on Disability \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Trigger Warning: references to ableist slurs It's for the class, Perspectives on Disability. The question is: \n What language do you use to talk about disability? Why might person-first language be helpful? \n Yeah, it's leading. It implies that person-first language is inherently better,\u00a0 which, um, no . And the professor has a stepson with autism, so... this is going to be\u00a0 fun . Here's the answer I'm giving. The language I use to talk about disability varies depending on many factors. The first factor is who I'm talking about. If I'm talking about one specific person, the language preference of that one specific person is the\u00a0 only \u00a0factor I'm going to think about. That's it. The language they want used when referring to them and to their disability is what I'm going to use. Sometimes that means \"person with autism.\" Sometimes that means \"Autistic person\"- that's what I am.\u00a0Sometimes that means \"person with CP.\"\u00a0Sometimes that means \"palsy person.\" Yes, I really do have a friend who has palsy person as one of her accepted terms- she blogs at\u00a0 That Crazy Crippled Chick. If I'm talking about a group of people, my language depends on the group. If it's a group of people who are together as part of an organization, I look up the organizational preference. Sometimes that's person-first, sometimes it's not. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) uses identity-first language. TASH accepts both, largely because of working with ASAN and the ASAN people wanting to be able to use identity-first language when talking about themselves. Some organizations will want \"person with a hearing impairment.\" Others will want \"Deaf people.\" For a group that's outside an organization, I check on the individual member's preferences. If I can't find theirs, I see if there is a preference for their specific disability as a whole. (Blind/with low vision, Deaf/with hearing impairment, and Autistic/with autism are examples of there not actually being a consensus, no matter what people on the individual sides may try to tell you.) The language the people use talking about themselves can provide clues, too. When I talked about Ethan, the author of \"Ethan's Story: My Life with Autism,\" I could guess from his language that he prefers person-first, so I used it. I called him a person with autism. When there really is no way to tell what the preference is for the people being talked about, it can go one of two ways. If it's autism and I can't tell, I default to\u00a0 my \u00a0language preference, since I am Autistic. Otherwise, I go for \"what is the majority preference of people with this disability/these types of disabilities in my audience?\" followed by \"what is the majority preference of audience members in general?\" When\u00a0 I wrote a piece for ASAN about the use of the R word , my use of \"people with developmental disabilities\" came from majority preference of people with these types of disabilities- autism isn't the only developmental disability out there, not by a long shot, and as far as I know, none of the others have major pushes for identity-first language going on. With \"the whole internet\" as my potential audience, I went for person-first language. Person-first language has things it was meant to do when it was first put forth by self-advocates. Those are good things. It's supposed to be about seeing people as\u00a0 people . It's supposed to be about respect. It's supposed to be about recognizing humanity, essentially.\u00a0 For people who prefer to be\u00a0referred\u00a0to using person-first language , it is the most respectful language to use. For most disabilities, it's a safe default, too. That's another use. It's better than assuming we know a person is suffering because of disability, certainly- I'd not censor someone who\u00a0 does \u00a0think they are suffering from something, but it's really presumptuous to assume that they are! So that's another way that person-first can be good- it beats a thing that's presumptuous as can be.\u00a0It's just not something we should insist on using to describe\u00a0 people who don't want to be described that way . That's about respect too. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/2013/10/language-for-perspectives-on-disability.html", "http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/p/dont-call-me-person-with-autism.html", "http://thatcrazycrippledchick.blogspot.com/", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/10/calling-people-the-r-word/"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/10/yes-that-too-guest-post-by-alyssa.html", "title": "\nYes, That Too Guest Post by Alyssa\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 18, 2013", "body": "\n \nDespite evidence to the contrary, the idea of high divorce rates in parents with autistic children continues to resonate with a portion of the autism community. Big numbers make for dramatic effect. And if there's one thing we like, it's drama. \n \n--KWombles \n \nI wrote the following in 2010 on the inaccuracy of the oft-repeated 80% divorce rate: \n \nA 2010 study out of\u00a0 Kennedy Krieger Institute \u00a0today shows that this statistic is emphatically not correct: \u201c64 percent of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) belong to a family with two married biological or adoptive parents, compared with 65 percent of children who do not have an ASD.\u201d According to the website, researchers came up with these figures from \u201c\u00a0data from the 2007 National Survey of Children\u2019s Health [ 1 ] \u00a0, they examined a nationally representative sample of 77,911 children, ages 3 to 17.\u201d \n \nThis a myth that is prevalent on the internet and was even repeated by an Autism Speaks presenter at a conference I attended in 2010. \n \nOne place this myth is presented is at\u00a0 The News \u00a0on \u201cThe Faces of Autism\u201d by Adam Richardson. Granted this is a fairly old piece, dated May 2008, but it\u2019s still relevant, considering the tendency of many writing on autism to engage in quasi-journalism and quoting (and it could be argued the making up of statistics to suit one\u2019s purpose). Richardson writes of a mother with an autistic child:\"Lindblad says more than 80 per cent of marriages with an autistic child end in divorce. She\u2019s living proof.\u201d \n \nDoes Richardson ascertain the accuracy of the statistic? Nope. He presents it again at the end of the piece and makes no distinction as to its accuracy: \n \n \n \n\u201cFACTS AND MYTHS ABOUT AUTISM\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u2022 The divorce rate for autistic parents is over 80 per cent. \n \n \n \n\u2022 Not all autistic individuals possess special skills and genius abilities. Movies like Rainman created a stigma around the disorder. Less than 10 percent possess \u201csavant\u201d abilities shown in the popular Hollywood movie. \n \n \n\u2022 Not all autistic individuals are withdrawn, avoid eye contact and engage in self-injurious behavior. Many are outgoing and work well within groups of children.\u201d \n \n \nSo, is this 80% a fact or a myth, Mr. Richardson? Do you know or care? Garbage reporting like this seems to be, gasp, epidemic. \n \nOf course, the whole autism ruins marriages and just about everything it touches isn\u2019t new. Kristina Chew wrote more than once on\u00a0 the myth of high divorce rates\u00a0 for parents of autistic children back in\u00a0 2007 . \n \nLisa \u00a0Jo Rudy at Autism.about.com has also\u00a0 touched on it in the past , writing: \u201cIn short, while I don\u2019t honestly believe that 80% of parents with autistic children divorce (because there\u2019s no basis for that figure), I certainly DO believe that 80% (or more) are often under extra stress.\u201d Rudy\u00a0 covers\u00a0 the new study, noting that Disability Scoop has reported on the study\u2019s findings. \n \nWhy do people rely on what research shows for one set of numbers and then pull out another set of numbers with no backing? And the comments are even more illuminating and proof that people rely far too often on the availability heuristic. If it\u2019s easy to recall, then they believe it is true and representative. It\u2019s sort of like the global warming thing: it can\u2019t be real because it\u2019s colder than usual where I live. Folks, there\u2019s a reason scientific evidence trumps anecdote. \n \n*This 80% figure is all over the internet.\u00a0 Susan Leiby \u00a0throws it out there in an effort to get families assistance by appealing to pity: \u201c80-90% of marriages fail when a child with autism is involved.\u201d Another newspaper uncritically runs with the figure, as well: Denise Ryan in\u00a0 The Age \u00a0writes with no substantiation: \u201cAs well, up to 80% of marriages fail in households where a child has an ASD.\u201d \n \nIt keeps going, though. At TACA,\u00a0 Mary Romaniec \u00a0writes: \u201cThe divorce rate in couples who have a child on the spectrum has been suggested to run as high as 80%.\u201d \n \nThere seems to be a never-ending parade of folks who like to say statistics say blah blah. I completely get where the Freakonomics authors were coming from as they pointed out the pedophile numbers on the internet, a supposed even 50,000. Here a\u00a0 minister\u2019s wife \u00a0passes along the bad information: \u201cStatistics estimate that 80 percent of marriages that have a child with autism fail.\u201d No statistics don\u2019t say that. Another urban legend is born. \n \nThis alone ought to make it clear why scientifically-minded folks tend not to rely on Joe Blow saying something. It\u2019s usually bullshit. \n \nAnd sometimes it\u2019s myth that reaches all the way to governmental bodies, like Australia\u2019s Parliament, where\u00a0 Don Randall \u00a0uses the made-up statistic : \u201cParents of children with autism face immense challenges. Aside from the care of their child, the resulting stress is enormous, and studies show that up to 80 per cent of\u00a0marriages where there is an autistic child fail.\u201d Come on, people! Studies say. Statistics show. Where\u2019s the actual studies, the real statistics? You heard it and it sounds good. It makes the folks who stay married appear all the more heroic and it makes it so much clearer that autism is a burden that ruins lives, right, if 80% of marriages collapse under the weight of autism? \n \nOh, look what I found:\u00a0 National Autism Association \u00a0spreading the myth: The divorce rate in the autism community is estimated at 80%. In an effort to help keep families together, NAA is developing a new program that will provide marriage counseling to parents of children with autism.\u201d I thought they were going to confirm the number before using it?: \u201cNAA is presently conducting a national divorce survey of autism families. Several organizations and news outlets have used the often-quoted autism divorce rate of 80%\u2013NAA hopes to confirm or update that percentage before referencing it in its program materials.\u201d And this was all the way back in June 2007. It\u2019s been 2.5 years; haven\u2019t they figured it out yet? Well, as of this December, they decided \u00a0to hedge it some\u00a0 and write: \u201cDivorce rates are disproportionately high within the autism community. Government aide is needed for these struggling families.\u201d They are, of course, soliciting donations. \n \nNow, interestingly enough, in the\u00a0 NAA\u2019s letter to Obama , those divorce rates: \u201cThen again, skyrocketing divorce rates in the autism community really need our attention along with the fact that \u201cautism\u201d is just a word some guy came up with 70 years ago to describe a new, rare mental condition that we\u2019re finding is actually more environmental.\u201d \n \nAgain, high divorce rates make it so much worse, right? What does all this do? Prove that it\u2019s about the blame-game, victimhood, everything and anything but about the autistic individuals. \n \n Age of Autism\u2019s \u00a0loyalists buy into the whole thing kit and kaboodle;\u00a0 some of them \u00a0 even elevating it to 85%.* \n \nWhat are some realistic estimates of divorce rates? \n \nAccording to the\u00a0 National Autistic Society , \u201cSiegal (2001) suggests that the divorce rate for couples with a child with autism is the same as that for the rest of the population.\u201d \n \nKevin Leitch \u00a0weighed in on the subject this past March , and it\u2019s well worth the read. Leitch discusses the Easter Seals\u2019 survey and its findings that showed that divorce occurred less in parents of children on the spectrum. Leitch\u00a0 also covers the new study \u00a0 at Left Brain Right Brain. \n \nSobsey\u2019s (2004) conclusion regarding divorce and parenting disabled children is worth repeating in full: \n \n \n\u201cIn short, evidence for increased marital discord and divorce rates among parents of children with disabilities is weak and inconsistent. Many more parents of children with disabilities report positive effects on their marriages than report negative effects, and many others recognize that having a child with a disability has little to do with the quality or durability of their marriage relationship. \n \n \n \n \nThere may be a very small increase in the incidence of divorce among parents of children with disabilities as compared to the general population, or there may be no increase at all. Findings are weak and inconsistent. Even if a small increase in the incidence of divorce exists, it is probably more likely that this increase is attributable to differences in parents\u2019 attitudes and behaviour rather than any effect of children with disabilities on their parents. Whatever the causal factors, many families with children, including many families of children with disabilities, experience marital discord or divorce. Whether or not having a child with a disability is a contributing factor in some cases, marital discord and divorce are difficult for all family members. Researchers should focus future efforts on understanding how children with disabilities and their families experience divorce and what can be done to assist them during what is often a difficult time in their lives.\u201d (p. 80) \n \nI sincerely hope that autism organizations get it right from now on, and that this myth ends. It does a tremendous disservice to families. \n \n \n(Journal) References: \n \nSiegal, B. (2001). Quality of life: preventing mental separations and legal divorce.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 3, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPHOTO FROM AUTHOR \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWilliam \n \nLearning to be a father by letting go of my son\u2026 \n \n \n \nBy Jeff Hall- Writer. Former soldier. Fun at parties. Reconciling flawed faith with present reality every day \n \n \n \n3 years and 31 days ago, I made a decision that I swore I would never make. I dropped my firstborn son off at a state run program in a mental hospital, admitting to him and to the world that our family was no longer the best place for him, and that someone else was better equipped to meet his needs than my wife and I. \n \nI institutionalized my son. \n \n \n \nWilliam was always special. He was born on New Year\u2019s Eve 1998, our second child, our first boy. He had big blue eyes and blonde hair. He was a big, round ball of chubby cuteness. \n \nBy the time he was 9 months old, he hadn\u2019t started babbling yet. He liked being in his swing. Really liked it. A lot. He wanted to swing all the time. Hours at a time. The motor burned out. He loved his pacifier and would not sleep without it. \n \nBy the time he had his one year checkup, Barbara was concerned enough about his development to ask the pediatrician about it. It\u2019s all good, the doc said. Boys are different than girls. Rates of development differ. Nothing to worry about. Barbara said, yep. I know all that. But something isn\u2019t right. \n \nShe got up and left the office. A few days later she was at another appointment and saw a flyer on the wall. The poster was for Project Child Find, which was offering a free screening for kids like William. Kids who were different. \n \nWilliam would get a screening, and by the time he was 18 months old he had attended his first therapy sessions for what was being described as sensory integration and pervasive developmental disorder. Disorder. It hurt to hear. The first time we would hear that William wasn\u2019t just different, he was abnormal. Wrong. \n \nAt least that is how I heard it. \n \nAs he got older, there were more therapy sessions, and groups, and talks with doctors. When he was 2\u00bd, he was in a group with 4 other kids. The group met with their therapist in a special room at Womack Army Medical Center (we lived on Fort Bragg). \n \nThe other kids in the group were like William. They didn\u2019t make eye contact. They flopped and flapped. They became agitated if one of their toys was taken. We began talking to the other parents who joined us in observing the group behind the two way mirror. It was a conversation that special needs parents will recognize. You see, not unlike elementary kids comparing Pokemon or middle schools boys talking football teams or high school kids talking about whatever the hell it is they talk about, we special needs parents compare diagnoses. \n \n\u201cIs that your son?\u201d \n \n\u201cYep, red shirt. Your daughter?\u201d \n \n\u201cYes. Pink boots. What\u2019s your son\u2019s diagnosis?\u201d \n \n\u201cPDD and sensory integration. Yours?\u201d \n \n\u201cAutism.\u201d \n \nWe asked another parent. Then another. Then another. Autism. ASD. Autism. \n \nOf course, that was not something we had to worry about. The therapist had told us that William didn\u2019t have autism. He was just in this group because he had a \u201ccommonality of challenges.\u201d He wasn\u2019t autistic. I mean, I had seen Rainman. William couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t talk, much less do amazing math tricks. \n \nDaphne, the group leader, had clearly seen parental denial before. She was very patient. She had a suggestion. I have something I would like for you to fill out she said. It is called CARS\u200a\u2014\u200athe childhood autism rating scale. Fill it out, and we\u2019ll talk about it. \n \nWhen we got home, we filled out the form. You could almost hear the ominous movie music playing in the background as we marked 4 after 3 after 4. We looked at one another, coming to the same conclusion at the same time. \n \nWilliam\u2019s got autism. \n \nAnd we have a lot to learn. \n \n \n \nFast forward a few years. We are world class autism experts. We became ace advocates. William was the first pre-K student with special needs at Fort Bragg to get a full day program WITH a one-on-one aide written into his IFSP. By school age he moved into a self-contained classroom and had amazing teachers and therapists. \n \nBut our life was ruled by autism. \n \nWilliam didn\u2019t sleep. He didn\u2019t talk. He wouldn\u2019t potty train. When we went to McDonald\u2019s as a family we always had to take extra money, because it was inevitable that William would walk up to someone\u2019s table and take their french fries. If it was a sit-down restaurant he would start fussing and whining as soon as we sat down. He didn\u2019t understand why the food wasn\u2019t there. Eventually we stopped going out. \n \nThere were so many things that we couldn\u2019t do. Go to church together. Sit and watch our younger son\u2019s soccer game together. Attend birthday parties. \n \nAll of our plans were subject to William\u2019s mood, whether or not staff was available and whether we could afford to cover them. \n \nAll of this was complicated by something else. \n \nArmy life. \n \n \n \nLife with William was hard. Lots of time, lots of hospitals and therapists. Not enough time for each other or our other kids. Constant worry that we weren\u2019t doing enough to help William deal with his challenges, weren\u2019t giving him enough. \n \nBut we had love, and we always found ways to laugh. Many days our life was good, and when it was we would smile. Because although life was challenging it was what we knew. And when William smiles it can melt your heart and light the room. \n \nWilliam got really worked up when it was time for me to go. When he saw the bags come out for another one of dad\u2019s deployments the tantrums would start. You could see the anger and frustration build. I would pack and worry and wonder what would happen when I was gone. \n \nI would head off to combat and Barbara and the other kids would prepare for their own kind of war. \n \n \n \nWe would purposely leave room on William\u2019s medications so that when I deployed we could increase his meds. We would try to make sure that we had staff lined up, that teachers were told when I would be leaving.We would talk to the kids, and prepare them. \n \nWe tried to explain, and tried even harder to understand, that William was already dealing with things that made him feel overwhelmed. He was bombarded with lights and noises and textures that made just functioning day-to-day a challenge. His brain couldn\u2019t make words to express what he felt on the inside and his feelings could only be expressed physically. \n \nWhen we were all together he could sense that the world was difficult but somehow right, and that he was loved and supported. \n \nBut we weren\u2019t all together. Because I had to leave. \n \nAfghanistan. Iraq. Uzbekistan. South Korea. Even 6 months in New Jersey. \u201cGarden State\u201d my ass. \n \nI was gone all the time. From 9-11 until I left the military in 2007 I was home for 20 months. \n \nWhile I was gone playing Army games, at home all hell would break loose. William would be easily angered, and physically lash out at whomever was nearby. He bit and banged his head and destroyed furniture. We still hesitate to buy nice things. \n \nIn 2007, it was time to leave again. I was part of a team that would be training the Iraqi army. I had to attend 7 months of training at Fort Riley, Kansas before I deployed for 18 months. Two years away from home. \n \nIt started like it always did. The bags. The fussing. The fear. \n \nBut it wouldn\u2019t end that way. \n \n \n \nI had just arrived back at the barracks at Fort Riley from a day of training. My cell phone buzzed. It was Barbara, calling from home. \n \n\u201cHey babe. What\u2019s up?\u201d \n \n\u201cSame old. I just wanted to give you a heads up.\u201d \n \n\u201cAbout what?\u201d \n \n\u201cI made a video.\u201d \n \n\u201cOf what? or do I want to know?\u201d (My attempt at cuteness. I am charming.) \n \n\u201cHa ha.\u201d (This isn\u2019t a laugh. She actually said ha ha. She is immune to my charm). \u201cIt was of Willie. Having a meltdown.\u201d \n \n\u201cOkay. What did you do that for?\u201d \n \n\u201cTo get people\u2019s attention.\u201d (Her statement felt heavy. Like she really, really meant it this time.) \n \n\u201cWhat people Barb?\u201d \n \n\u201cI sent it to the Governor, all of our representatives, the Senate Armed Services Committee and your chain of command from battalion all the way up to theater commander.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou did what now?\u201d \n \nBefore she could answer my phone buzzed again. My team leader. I clicked over. Meet me at the battalion commander\u2019s office. He said we have to talk now. Do you have any idea what this is about? I might, I said. Well meet me there now. I clicked back over. I gotta go. Shit just got real. \n \nWe walked into the battalion commander\u2019s office. We had been there lots of times, mostly just hanging out. I walked in and made a beeline for his couch, my favorite spot. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable. We are going to see General Ham.\u201d (Major General Ham was Division Commander and would, in a few years time, be in charge of all American ground forces in Afghanistan.) \n \nWe loaded into his Humvee and headed to Division headquarters. We went to General Ham\u2019s office and were escorted into his conference room by his aide. General Ham was seated at his table with his assistant Division Commander. \n \n\u201cSFC Hall, welcome. Come on in. Have a seat. Do you know why you are here?\u201d \n \n\u201cI have an idea, but I am not completely sure sir.\u201d \n \n\u201cI got a package in the mail today. It was from your wife. You know what was in it?\u201d \n \n\u201cA video.\u201d \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s right. A really powerful video. Very moving. Have you seen it?\u201d \n \n\u201cNo sir. I only heard of its\u2019 existence about 20 minutes ago.\u201d \n \n\u201cI see. Could we cue up that video please?\u201d \n \nHis aide dimmed the lights and pulled down the video screen. The computer flickered and the video came up:\u00a0 \n \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR7qo3S_57o \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR7qo3S_57o \nAs the video came to an end I was close to tears. \n \nThere he was. My baby boy. Struggling to make sense of a life impacted by a differently wired brain and not understanding where I was, or why I was there. I wasn\u2019t even sure that I knew anymore. \n \nAnd I heard him in my mind. Daddddaaaaddddddaaaa. \n \n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d \n \nThe question jarred me back to reality. \n \n\u201cI am not sure I understand your question, sir.\u201d I had a lot of experience dealing with senior officers. I was not used to personal questions from them. \u201cWhat exactly are you asking me?\u201d \n \n\u201cWhat do you think about what you saw?\u201d \n \n\u201cI think that it was hard to watch, and I wish I was at home sir.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou have a stellar record. What do you want to do?\u201d \n \n\u201cAgain, sir, I am not sure I understand the question.\u201d What the hell? What is this crazy old coot getting at? What does he mean what do I want? No one has ever asked me that in 12 years of active duty. \u201cWhat exactly do you mean? Sir?\u201d \n \n\u201cWhat would you say if I told you that I could get you out of the Army in a week?\u201d \n \n\u201cI would say yes. Please.\u201d \n \n\u201cThat is all I needed to hear SFC Hall.\u201d \n \nIt took a little longer than a week. It took three. And a trip back to Fort Bragg. \n \nBut 19 days later I went from Fort Riley, Kansas preparing to go back to war for the third time to a rental house on the north side of Fayetteville, learning how to be a stay-at-home dad. \n \n \n \nBy mid-2010 we were nearing the end of our rope. We had spent over a decade with William, meeting every need and foregoing every small sanity taken for granted by most parents. \n \nSleep. Family outings. Furniture that didn\u2019t need steel reinforcement. \n \nWe had been to IEP meetings and case management meetings. We had discussed Williams strengths (he can be a very loving child, a charmer with a great smile, and he is very smart!) and his weaknesses (when he gets upset he will beat your ass like you stole something and ran from the cops). \n \nWe were free from the constant worry and stress of life in the military. \n \nBut William was never, IS never, free from the prison that autism has created in his mind. \n \nWe heard about a program. Partners in Autism Treatment and Habilitation at Murdoch Developmental Center in Butner, NC. A state run program that was specifically designed to give kids like William the support, structure and care that they needed to thrive. \n \nA state run mental hospital. An institution. \n \nNo matter how bad things got with William, I always swore we would never institutionalize him. No way some government agency knew better than we did. No way I would warehouse my kid in some foundling home out of Dickens. We would care for our boy. We were his parents, for God\u2019s sake! Who knew better than us how to care for our boy? How to love him? \n \nOf course, I had on some Ray-Ban quality rose colored glasses. I hadn\u2019t been at home when William was at his worst. I hadn\u2019t been bit, been scratched, been hit with balled up fists of rage wielded by a boy who was already 5-2 and 140 at 11 years old and got bigger every day. It was easy for me to say no institution was necessary. \n \nBarb\u2019s bruises said something different. \n \n \n \nWe learned more about PATH. We talked to other parents that had made this impossible decision. We filled out the application, at first expecting that William would do a 90 day respite placement. When we were told he was a good candidate for the regular, two year program we amended our application. \n \nWe needed help. \n \nIt took a few months and a lot of paperwork, but William was admitted to PATH in October 2010. His \u201cmove-in\u201d day was 1 November 2010. \n \nWe drove to Butner and explained to William and our other 3 children what was happening. William was going to autism college, we told them. A special place that existed to meet his needs and care for him 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In ways that we couldn\u2019t. A full time nurse and behaviorist and dietitian. School in house. On site case manager. Therapists interacting all day, every day. Trained people always on call, always there. \n \nAlways rested. Always prepared. Always energetic. \n \nWilliam\u2019s younger brother wasn\u2019t convinced. \n \n\u201cAutism college? Sounds like autism jail.\u201d \n \nBut we persisted. Despite the doubts of the neurotypical children. Despite our own misgivings. \n \nMaybe it was desperation that drove our decision. Maybe it was fatigue. But when we had our first visit with William 6 weeks later (they had asked that we give him time to adjust), all our fears evaporated. \n \nWilliam was smiling. Happy. He looked healthy, rested. He had lost weight, and gotten taller. The combined effect was that our baby had grown into a young man over night. He even had a little peach fuzz. \n \nAfter a year at PATH, 4 psychotropic medications had been reduced to one. Clonidine, the first medicine that William had gone on and the only way we had to know he would sleep had been the first medicine eliminated. He went to sleep on his own every night by 9pm, and slept until 6am, when his daily routine started. \n \nHe was paying attention to tasks in school. He had reduced his angry outbursts. He hadn\u2019t bitten anyone since the day he arrived. \n \nHis life was scheduled in 15 minute increments. He knew when dinner was, when school was, when therapy was. He was expected to set the table, fold his clothes, and wash his own body. \n \nBy a year he was potty trained. \n \nAs William grew, so did we. We had dinners out. Played family games. Had nights where we sat downstairs together and watched \u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d and made s\u2019mores in the fireplace and talked and laughed and were a family. We weren\u2019t constantly listening for the back door to hear if William had snuck out. We weren\u2019t waiting for him to get mad or wake up or need attention. \n \nWe just were. \n \nHe was happy. We were learning. We all adjusted. \n \nEverything changed. Everything. \n \n \n \nWilliam lives in a group home in Statesville, NC now. It is a beautiful house in a quiet neighborhood with a big backyard, a trampoline, a basketball hoop and an industrial strength swing set. He has his own room with a flat screen TV (thanks Nana!), DVD player and cable. \n \nHis day is still broken into 15 minute increments. He lives with 5 other young men, including one that was at PATH when he was. He misses us, I know, but he loves his friends and loves his house. If he had his way, we would live at his new home with him. All of the structure, all of the security, the world revolving around his needs. But with his family as a nice distraction. \n \nWe see him every couple of weeks, and every month or so he comes home, back to Chapel Hill, for an overnight visit. He gets to eat cereal, drink soda, stay up late and generally break all of the rules he has to follow at his group home. We get to let him. \n \nHe is happy to be at home. For about 24 hours. Then he wants to go back to Statesville. He brings us his backpack and leads us to the door. I need the structure he seems to say. I need a life that meets MY needs. Take me home. \n \nWe pack up and we take him home. \n \nWhen we leave there is silence in the car. We are all sad. Our 6 piece band is missing its most unique and different piece. The part that makes us, us. \n \nBut we know that William is happy. And that we have done what is best for him and for our family. \n \nThe tears are dry by Greensboro. And by Burlington the jokes are flying and the putdowns are stinging and the parents are begging people to stop cussing \u201cjust a little. I mean damn.\u201d \n \nWe are a family in two places. Six people. One heart. \n \nAnd no matter what happens, or where he is, we know that we will always do whatever it takes to make Willie smile. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR7qo3S_57o", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR7qo3S_57o"], "link": "http://autismblogsdirectory.blogspot.com/2013/12/william-learning-to-be-father-by.html", "title": "\nWilliam-Learning to be a father by letting go of my son..a lovely wonderful post by Jeff Hall\n"}
