{"date": "Friday, April 16, 2010", "body": "\nIn the previous post I argued that a  Bass Diffusion Model fits the administrative prevalence of autism in California remarkably well , and made specific predictions based on this observation. You can think of a  Bass Diffusion Model  as a word-of-mouth or an adoption-of-innovation type of model. For the sake of completeness, I will now present a couple of Bass models I derived for the administrative prevalence of autism at the US level, based on data from the Department of Education, otherwise known as IDEA data. The following is a graph of the 6-17 IDEA prevalence along with Bass model hind-casting and forecasting all the way to 2030. Model # 2 (the red line) is the one I prefer in this case. (I'll explain why shortly.) It predicts that prevalence will eventually level off at almost 1.1%. This is completely plausible, not only because that's roughly  the new consensus prevalence of ASD , but also because Minnesota is already there. I also find it to be a fascinating prediction of the model. If you recall, a Bass model predicts a maximum prevalence of about 0.65% (at most 0.7%) for children 6 to 9 in California DDS. This absolutely makes sense. California DDS is not like IDEA. DDS does not find every autistic person to be eligible for services, and not all developmentally disabled Californians pursue eligibility with DDS. So, in my view, a Bass model makes predictions that are remarkably consistent with our current reality. If the models are correct, by 2013 IDEA prevalence should just have surpassed 80 in 10,000. Additionally, a leveling-off trend should not be completely evident yet. It may be slightly noticeable. Meanwhile, in the California report of Q4 2013 (and let's hope they produce data equivalent to that of reports currently available) a leveling-off trend should already be evident in the 6-9 cohort. Technical Details For formulas and variable names, see  the California post . Parameters of both models are, again, estimated by means of genetic programming. For model # 1 I simply tried to fit the 1993-2007 prevalence series without any modifications. The resulting parameters were: p = 4.808\u00b710 -8 q = 0.22 t 0  = 1938.809 (year) m = 118.32 (per 10,000 population) Model # 2 is based on the observation that IDEA practically did not have an autism category prior to 1993. However, once the category was introduced, many children would've been put in the category all at once. It's like introducing a product into the market that already has a number of owners. So I performed the calculation by reducing the prevalence in all report years by 3.864, which is the 1993 prevalence. Hence,  t 0  should be equal to 1993. The parameters actually derived by the code I wrote were: p = 0.0072 q = 0.222 t 0  = 1993.03 (year) m = 105.992 (per 10,000 population) Note: In this case, model results must be added to 3.864 to obtain the projected prevalence. The rationale of the derivation of Model # 2 makes sense to me, and that's why I prefer it. However, there's not a huge difference between the models. Addendum (4/16/2010) I forgot to mention that the correlation coefficient  R  for both models was approximately the same: 0.99993. This is exceedingly good, and better than the fit for CalDDS.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8iXcP8aukI/AAAAAAAAAO8/XiUVA8lxgsA/s1600/idea-autism-prevalence-and-bass-models.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/ideas-bass-diffusion-model.html", "title": "\nIDEA's Bass Diffusion Model\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "body": "\n MJ has written  yet another rebuttal  of  my post on the media's interest in the anti-vax movement .  MJ's primary argument is basically that the absolute article count for \"autism vaccines\" has grown. The count for \"autism\" has simply grown more. I say that the relative count is what matters, but let's look into this in more detail. As I've  noted in comments , MJ fails to take into account that the  total  number of articles indexed by Google News Archive has also grown from year to year. Presumably, this doesn't mean people are reading more newspapers, but simply that Google is adding sources to its index all the time. Estimating the total number of articles in Google News Archive could presumably be problematic algorithmically for Google. I have some ideas which I mentioned in comments, but I'm not confident that they would be unbiased. Instead, let's check if searches for \"autism genetic\" relative to \"autism\" have the issue MJ thinks relative counts have.  They do not. There's no peak in 2002 here. There's no downward trend after 2002. There's no dilution of the word \"genetic\" in autism articles as more topics are covered. What we see instead is a remarkably stable trend. We previously also looked at  relative counts for \"neurodiversity\" , which MJ had verified as well. This analysis also fails to support MJ's hypothesis. The same is the case of several other trends I've checked which I'm not going to go into here. It's also illustrative to look at the raw article counts for \"vaccine injury\" (in quotes). These counts are presumably also biased by increasing coverage of autism topics, but maybe less so. What we see here is consistent with a peak in 2002-2005, and a brief recovery in 2008 due to substantial propaganda efforts in relation to Jenny McCarthy and Hannah Poling. This effect cannot be expected to last very long, though. MJ has failed to explain why the pattern of media coverage for \"autism vaccines\" generally matches VAERS autism submission trends and the number of autism cases filed with the vaccine court. It's lazy and convenient to simply say \"the data was not meant to track this.\" What is the explanation? Additionally,  Smith et al. (2007)  reports that: MMR vaccine remains the number one \u2018top of mind\u2019 vaccination issue for parents.  The proportion of parents believing MMR to be a greater risk than the diseases it protects against has fallen from 24% in 2002 to 14% in 2006 . The proportion of \u2018hard-core rejectors\u2019 of MMR vaccine remains stable at 6%. There has been a gradual and sustained increase in the proportion of parents across all social groups saying MMR was completely safe/slight risk rising from 60% in 2002 to a current level of 74%.  There now appears to be a sustained move away from fears over MMR safety  and belief in the unfounded link to autism towards a more positive perception of the vaccine. (My emphasis.) Finally, an  immunization report by the British NHS  shows that MMR coverage had a low in the 2003-2004 period. Conclusion I've perseverated on this a lot more than I probably should, and I've gone out of my way to address ridiculous criticisms put forth by MJ.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8xv-kqbWpI/AAAAAAAAAPk/13urao0aCq0/s1600/autism-in-media-and-vaers.JPG", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/analyzing-medias-interest-aka-josephs.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8xwlOBfSDI/AAAAAAAAAPs/pXinLdqKGrw/s1600/media-autism-genetic.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8x1j_YM67I/AAAAAAAAAP0/V74MlKoMXLw/s1600/media-vaccine-injury-abs.JPG", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TD4-4N7YC41-1&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F16%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1300829336&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=85d9fe977cc36eda7057f73bfc7c351b", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8x7pP843pI/AAAAAAAAAP8/HnDm4eqAbuE/s1600/british-report-vaccine-coverage.JPG", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/immstats2005to2006/ImmunisationStatistics280906_PDF.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/anti-vax-movement-still-peaked-in-2002.html", "title": "\nThe Anti-Vax Movement Still Peaked in 2002-2003 and MJ's Excuses are Trivial to Address\n"},

I recently presented just two of them:  Google News Archive articles matching \"autism vaccines\" relative to \"autism\" articles, and VAERS report submissions . Additionally, Sullivan over at LB/RB has put forth a graph of  cases before the US vaccine court. It's not surprising that such easy-to-confirm observations would hit a nerve with some people.  Commenter MJ  took issue with my methodology, at first claiming that as more autism articles are written, the word \"vaccines\" would tend to become rare in them, and later claiming that Google News Archive does not have the right bias for this type of analysis. None of this made any sense to me, and you can read the exchange in comments. Then MJ wrote a  post in response to my analysis  where, evidently, MJ has come up with a reproduction (not repetition) of my prior result. You can see MJ's graph (which I copied with \"fair use\" in mind) on the right.  MJ takes comfort in the fact that newspaper articles matching the word \"neurodiversity\" are quite uncommon, relatively speaking. But see \u2013 and I doubt MJ doesn't realize this \u2013 that's a comparison of apples to oranges. Articles matching \"autism vaccines\" are about a public health issue, one that is bound to interest all kinds of readers. They are articles about court cases, studies, etc. Articles on neurodiversity are about an ideology, which reporters might not cover simply because they don't see a payoff in covering it. If you're going to compare them, it obviously only makes sense to compare  trends , not absolute article counts. MJ's scaling obviously doesn't allow us to see a trend, so I've produced the following graph. It's an entirely different pattern. (Note that since article counts are relatively small, there's bound to be more noise in these series.) One More Thing Regarding VAERS, MJ says: As for VAERS, it wasn't meant to do this sort of tracking nor is it an accurate measure of all children who had a reaction to a vaccine - especially for controversial relationships like autism. I didn't look at a measure of \"reactions\" \u2013 and it's not clear if reports with \"autism\" as a symptom are even valid. I looked at  submission  counts. These are clearly a valid proxy of new parents recruited into either an anti-vax mindset or vaccine litigation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8oHQwA5CTI/AAAAAAAAAPE/ebkPuE4QuVo/s1600/autism-in-media-and-vaers.JPG", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/04/how-much-do-autism-parents-really-buy-into-the-vaccine-causation-idea-not-so-much/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8oHq7zUxRI/AAAAAAAAAPM/paTcv3zwe6A/s1600/StoriesPer100.png", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/medias-interest-in-neurodiversity.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8oQglXok3I/AAAAAAAAAPU/5MtlEyyejow/s1600/media-neurodiversity.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/mj-reproduces-result-of-mine.html", "title": "\nMJ Reproduces A Result of Mine\n"},

I exchanged some emails with Dr. Gorski myself, prior to his post, about some rudimentary data analysis Mr. Higgs had done with special education counts. I sent Dr. Gorski a number of graphs in order to illustrate Mr. Higgs' interpretation errors. Do check out the post. What I actually wanted to discuss here is Dr. Gorski's observation about the apparent lack of anti-vax activity in Autism Awareness Month. The anti-vaccine movement\u2019s usual suspects haven\u2019t been all over the mainstream media, as they usually are this time every year, often as early as April 1 or even March 31.  Could the anti-vax movement be losing steam? Are they regrouping? I have no idea. But we can check how much interest the media has had in the anti-vax movement in the last 13 years. This is a graph of  Google News Archive  \"autism vaccines\" articles per 100 \"autism\" articles. Google News Archive has its own graphs where you can sort of see the trend as well, but it's methodologically better to look at article counts relative to \"autism\" articles, for obvious reasons. I also added a  VAERS  \"autism\" submissions series to the graph. Clearly, media coverage of anti-vax  speculation correlates well with VAERS submissions. See also how it compares to  Sullivan's graph of the number of autism cases before the vaccine court .    2008 was a good year for anti-vaxers, given that it was the year when the  Hannah Poling  story broke, and Jenny McCarthy started to publicize her autism books on TV. But if you look at the graph, 2008 provided only a marginal boost. I doubt anti-vaxers will have another 2008 ever again. That's the reality of the situation, even though in the blogsphere we seem to perceive things differently sometimes. Anti-vaxers often talk as though they are \"winning the debate.\" Next time you find an anti-vaxer who says they are winning the debate, ask them what they are basing that opinion on, and send them over to this post.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4621", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8RzTJG2neI/AAAAAAAAAOk/EtGQT5RqRME/s1600/autism-in-media-and-vaers.JPG", "http://news.google.com/archivesearch", "http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/10/number-of-cases-before-the-vaccine-court-drop-off-dramatically/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/category/legal/autism-omnibus/hannah-poling/"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/medias-interest-in-anti-vaccine.html", "title": "\nThe Media's Interest in the Anti-Vaccine Movement\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 15, 2010", "body": "\nThere's a new paper on the rise of autism diagnoses in California:  Liu et al. (2010) . Its findings are probably not surprising to my readers, I would imagine. It finds that children living in close proximity to a child already diagnosed with autism are more likely to be diagnosed with autism themselves. This reminded me of an  observation I made once  about administrative prevalence growth curves. They look like \"word of mouth\" growth curves, and they are devoid of abrupt \"step\" changes. [Note: Also see  Dr. Novella's take  on Liu et al. (2010).] It occurred to me to try to model this \"word of mouth\" type of process. The idea is that a model could be helpful in making predictions and understanding the reasons for the observed rise in prevalence ascertained from passive databases. I even wrote a simulation, and had some preliminary results. As much as I like to come up with my own models to explain things, however, I'd much rather use a proven model. So I kept trying to find an existing solution to this sort of problem. Eventually I found something that looked very promising: The  Bass Diffusion Model . This is a highly successful model that has been applied to the acquisition of durable goods, adoption of innovations, and more recently, the growth of social networks. Evidently, the model is unheard of in the autism world, and practically undiscovered in epidemiology in general. Interestingly, though, Liu et al. (2010) repeatedly uses the term \"diffusion of information\" to explain its findings. Mathematically, the Bass Diffusion Model can be expressed using the following formula. Model variables and parameters \u2013 adapted for our purposes \u2013 are defined as follows: N(t)  is the administrative prevalence of autism at time  t . t  is the time, typically represented by a year. t 0  is the initial time, when prevalence is zero. The coefficient  p  is called \"the coefficient of innovation, external influence or advertising effect\" (Wikipedia.) The coefficient  q  is called \"the coefficient of imitation, internal influence or word-of-mouth effect\" (Wikipedia.) m  is the maximum administrative prevalence of autism \u2013 i.e. the prevalence value reached when the prevalence curve finally levels off. In order to apply it to real world data, we need to derive the parameters of the model. This is fairly difficult because it's non-linear. So I used  genetic programming  to estimate the parameters that produce the best fit between the model and observations. I did this with the 6 to 9 California DDS prevalence, and I \"trained\" the model with two different time ranges. I will later explain the rationale. For 6-9 prevalence data between 1993 and 2007, the correlation coefficient was  0.9994 , and the parameters were: p = 5.959\u00b710 -8 q = 0.253 t 0  = 1943.246 (year) m = 65.395 (per 10,000 population) When trained with prevalence between 1986 and 2007, the correlation coefficient  R  for the model fit was 0.9991. The resulting parameters were: p = 1.415\u00b710 -8 q = 0.237 t 0  = 1934.1 (year) m = 70.45 (per 10,000 population) Anyone familiar with modeling and/or statistics will tell you that a correlation coefficient of  0.9994  is not only good, it's actually hard to believe. It might even be beyond law-of-physics good. The following is a graph of the observed 6-9 prevalence in California DDS, along with the 2 derived Bass models, with forecasting all the way to 2020. If the first model turns out to be correct, as early as Q4 2013 the 6-9 prevalence should be very close to 60 in 10,000, and a leveling-off pattern should already be evident. The first model predicts that prevalence will level off when it reaches 65.4 in 10,000. The second model predicts it will top at 70.5 in 10,000. I think these projections are reasonable, considering California DDS has eligibility restrictions. But we'll just have to see if they pan out. Limitations The main limitation of the models derived in this post is that they assume  m  is constant. In reality  m  could change, not just because of possible environmental factors, but also because of changes in diagnostic criteria, and changes in eligibility policy. That's why I used a shorter time range to derive the model I actually prefer: the one based on the 1993-2007 prevalence series only.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/651448?cookieSet=1", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4726", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8daOCS4qzI/AAAAAAAAAOs/97Pp3FRPoz4/s1600/BassModelFormula.JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/S8djTz6xT6I/AAAAAAAAAO0/L59QDp7pysQ/s1600/caldds-6-9-bass-models.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/administrative-prevalence-of-autism-is.html", "title": "\nThe Administrative Prevalence of Autism is a Bass Distribution\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 24, 2009", "body": "\nThe recent  Chicago Tribune Articles  have resulted in a  flurry  of  reactions , particularly from AoA. I'd like to discuss just one of them in this post. Kent Heckenlively was complaining that the Chicago Tribune reporters did not give weight to any of the documentation he had provided them. Specifically, to support the assertion that we are in the midst of an autism epidemic, Heckenlively cited a  press release  by the MIND Institute. Why cite the press release and not the paper? Well, that's because the conclusions of the paper said the following. Other artifacts have yet to be quantified, and as a result, the extent to which the continued rise represents a true increase in the occurrence of autism remains unclear. A true increase... remains unclear. Is that clear enough? The paper is titled \"The rise in autism and the role of age at diagnosis.\" I'll refer to it as Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche (2009). I've already criticized multiple aspects of the paper ( last time here ) but I'd like to say a few more things about it. The conclusions of the paper seem refreshingly honest, but I'm guessing they are that way simply to get through peer-review. The missing artifacts are not just any artifacts, either. One of the artifacts that did not enter the calculations is key:  awareness . It would be nonsensical to assume that awareness of autism has not changed since the early 1990s. But what did the press release say? \u201cIt\u2019s time to start looking for the environmental culprits responsible for the remarkable increase in the rate of autism in California,\u201d said UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute researcher Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of environmental and occupational health and epidemiology, and an internationally respected autism researcher. Hertz-Picciotto said that many researchers, state officials and advocacy organizations have viewed the rise in autism's incidence in California with skepticism. ( source ) This is completely at odds with the conclusions of the paper, and I find it quite dishonest. To make it perfectly clear, yes, I'm accusing Dr. Hertz-Picciotto of intellectual dishonesty. Dr. H-P further states that: \u201cThese are fairly small percentages compared to the size of the increase that we\u2019ve seen in the state,\u201d Hertz-Picciotto said. Is that even true? The paper finds that a 2.2-fold increase may be explained by changes in diagnostic criteria, 1.56-fold due to inclusion of \"milder\" cases, and  1.24-fold due to changes in age at diagnosis. If you multiply these factors, you come up with a 4.26-fold increase that may be explained by just these 3 artifacts. That's 62% of the entire rise the authors were attempting to explain. Maybe 62% is a \"fairly small percentage.\" In this case I'm going to give Dr. H-P the benefit of the doubt and say that she likely didn't know the factors needed to be multiplied. There are no indications in the paper that a calculation of the overall contribution of the 3 artifacts combined was even attempted. I won't even get into statistical uncertainty. The flaws of the analysis are not what bother me the most, however. Consider this. What is the value of this study? Why was it carried out? If you're trying to determine whether artifacts can explain the rise in autism service classifications in California, and you cannot estimate the contribution of all relevant artifacts, what is the point of the analysis? Here's an analogy. Suppose you wanted to determine if global warming can be explained by the greenhouse effect. In order to do this, you estimate the contribution of methane, water vapor and nitrous oxide to recent temperature increases, but you leave out CO 2 . You conclude that those 3 gases alone cannot explain the entire rise in temperatures, but perhaps that's because you did not consider the biggest contributor to the greenhouse effect: CO 2 . Then you tell the media that greenhouse gases cannot fully explain the rise in temperatures. Wouldn't such a study be better understood as a propaganda effort, rather than a contribution to scientific knowledge? Someone might complain that Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche (2009) does contribute to scientific knowledge, because it tells us about the impact of certain artifacts. But does it actually do that? Take what is perhaps the most important artifact the paper does take into account: changes in diagnostic criteria. What would you do if you wanted to determine the impact of changes in criteria? You might carry out a prevalence study with good case-finding that uses two different criteria on the same population: DSM-IV and DSM-III (or perhaps Kanner criteria.) Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche (2009) does not do anything that even resembles this. They use data from a separate study, so they didn't even contribute new data. We can't even be sure how well the data from Finland might apply to California. The case-finding of the Finnish study is not necessarily very good either. Plus it's just one data point, with all the uncertainties implied by that. To determine the impact of inclusion of \"milder\" cases (i.e. anything that is not \"autistic disoder\"), what would you do? I think you could evaluate a random sample of CalDDS autistic children and diagnose them with either autistic disorder, PDD-NOS or Asperger's. What the researchers did instead was use data from a separate MIND Institute study where CalDDS children had been evaluated with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Inventory (ADI.) Are these diagnostic tools even able to accurately  distinguish between autism spectrum diagnoses? I'm not aware of any evidence that they do. In other words, the MIND Institute study is not even informative about the impact of the artifacts it did take into account. I frankly can't see this study as a contribution to scientific knowledge at all. It gives the appearance of being part of a propaganda effort.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/11/the-unethical-treatments-that-autism-is-vaccine-injury-and-other-false-premises-gives-rise-to.html", "http://counteringageofautism.blogspot.com/2009/11/aoa-panics-over-chicago-tribune.html", "http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/newsroom/newsdetail.html?key=1861&svr=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu&table=published"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/11/word-about-hertz-picciotto-delwiche.html", "title": "\nA Word About Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche (2009)\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2009", "body": "\nWhat would be the value of telling a parent of a recently diagnosed autistic child that the child will never be able to hold a job, if this is unlikely to be true for a good majority of autistic children diagnosed at present? Is there any? I just don't see it. In fact, I think this would be at least as harmful as telling a parent that their child will grow up to be just like Dr. Temple Grandin. I was recently told that I shouldn't divulge data that could be interpreted as painting a \"rosy picture\" of autism. It's not only rude to tell people what they should or shouldn't write about, but this kind of suggestion is quite unreasonable in my view. Beyond the merits of the idea that it's best to presume competence, I believe one should have realistic expectations based on actual data, rather than vague assumptions based on stereotypes and outdated information of unclear origin. I also think it's highly questionable to dismiss new findings  solely  on the basis that they \"don't feel right\" or because they fail to confirm one's preconceptions and personal experience. This is the very definition of  closed-mindedness . (A lot of people seem to think \"closed-mindedness\" means you are not willing to accept pseudo-scientific claims, but this is simply  not true .) It's important that data is  current  too. It would be completely dishonest to pretend that autistic children diagnosed today are just like the children who were called autistic in, say, the 1960s. That's simply not a realistic view. I have discussed  adult outcome studies  in the past, and I think they are relevant, but they need to be understood in their proper context. For example, 61% of autistics born in 1983-1985 receiving services under the autism category in California were identified as having intellectual impairments. Meanwhile, only 27% of those born in 1993-1995 are identified the same say (Gernsbacher et al. 2005; The MIND Institute 2002.) This is despite the fact that California DDS has  eligibility restrictions , sometimes interpreted to mean that only persons with \"full syndrome\" autism are eligible (which is probably an untrue assumption, but it's also the case that not all persons with an ASD diagnosis are necessarily eligible.) I say this knowing full well that my own son is different to most autistic children diagnosed today, and perhaps more like children who were called autistic in the 1960s. I expect my readers to be similarly capable of distinguishing personal realities from population-level realities. If I divulge data applicable to autistics who don't have intellectual disability, and you have an autistic child with intellectual disability, then the data does not apply to your situation. I think this should go without saying. If you look at really good paper critiques, you will find a common characteristic: They don't just point out limitations and errors; they explain how the limitations and errors could make the results what they are, in the event that the hypothesis the authors have advanced is incorrect. This typically involves pointing out details the authors have apparently overlooked. For examples of remarkably good paper critiques, see the  Photon in the Darkness Blog .  Then you have really poor paper critiques. These come in various flavors. Perhaps the lowest form of critique is the  ad hominem circumstantial , otherwise known as an  appeal to motive : \"I suspect the author is biased, therefore the results of the paper are probably wrong.\" This is essentially a useless critique, since all authors of all papers could be suspected of having a bias. Some  additional criteria is required to make it worthwhile. For example, if a researcher is known to have engaged in substantial scientific misconduct (e.g.  plagiarism ), then it is reasonable to hold all subsequent works by the same author to be suspect a priori. It would also help to explain how the bias might alter the results. In a hypothetical case, it could be reasonable to speculate along these lines: \"Since the study was not blinded, it's probable that researcher bias could have inadvertently altered the results of the assessments.\" This is a plausible explanation, as opposed to a simplistic insinuation. Another precarious form of critique is what I'll call the  critique by anecdote or personal experience . Example # 1: \"How could this global warming theory be true? It was really cold this winter.\" Example # 2: \"I have never seen any autistic adults, and I know 'em when I see 'em, so this really expensive and exhaustive prevalence study just cannot be right.\" BTW, how is it that  David Kirby  knows 'em when he sees 'em, if he's never seen them at all? There are some reasonable forms of critique that don't require much effort. Appealing to the unreplicated status of a result is one example. This is a good convention that is part of the scientific method. \"The result could be of interest, but let's reserve judgment until it's replicated.\" Some people have said they don't yet buy the prevalence result from the  NHS study  because the study is unreplicated. In this particular case, I believe they are mistaken. For one, there's  considerable prior evidence  that autism can be found in various populations of adults where previously it was largely unrecognized. Furthermore, Kadesj\u00f6 et al (1999) found a prevalence of 1.21% among children born in 1985 in the small town of Karlstad, Sweden. The \"children\" happen to be  24  now. If the study were done today, on the same exact cohort, it would be considered an adult prevalence study. In this sense, the NHS study may be considered a replication. Let me make this clear. There's simply no excuse to continue to claim that autistic adults are a non-significant population compared to the population of autistic children. Doing so is just another form of denialism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/10/the_appeal_to_b.html", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/general/Eligibility.cfm", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/108/", "http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2009/10/on-passing-and-not-existing.html", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/mental%20health/mental%20health%20surveys/APMS_Autism_report_standard_20_OCT_09.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/11/false-despair.html", "title": "\nFalse Despair\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 02, 2009", "body": "\nIn the  previous post  I discussed data that contradicts the common belief that autistic adults are largely unemployed. In this post I want to discuss marriage. Marriage, again, is something that is considered very rare among autistics. It's a stereotype like any other stereotype, of course, but it's not an entirely unjustified one. Of all the autistics Leo Kanner wrote about, I believe only one (Robert F) is known to have married. Said Kanner: The contacts thus established led to the discovery that the boy-meets-girl issue was paramount in the talks of the companions. Again, there was a vaguely felt obligation to \"conform.\" Those attempts were sporadic and short-lived. The \"explanations\" offered indicated that there was not too much displeasure with the absence of any real involvement. Henry C. reported that he was single, that several girls \"had hoped to change that\" but that he had \"no desire to get tied down for a good long time.\" Thomas G. declared categorically that girls \"cost too much money.\" Clarence B., who \"socialized\" with a girl for a short time in college, stated that he \"ought to get married but can't waste money on a girl who is not serious.\" Bernard S. was said to have approached a girl once for a date \"in a very negative way\" (inviting rebuff). Fred G. \"experimented\" once with a double date arrangement (never repeated). George W. made things easy for himself by deciding a priori that girls were not interested in him. Sally S., the only girl in our group, once asked seriously at 23 years of age what she ought to do if ever she fell in love with someone, an experience she had never had before. She said: \"I have never had the interest in boys most girls my age have.\" At 30 years, she dated a man for a few months but gave this up because she was \"frightened by any intimacy.\" (Kanner et al. 1972) In several outcome studies we see the same pattern. Of the 16 autistic adults without intellectual disability from Szatmari et al. (1989), only one was married, even though 4 were dating regularly. Average age at follow-up was 26.1. From a  recent outcome study out of Utah  involving 41 autistic adults, we learn that only \"a few\" were married. One problem with these findings is that adults in outcome studies are young adults. Additionally, we should not assume that  diagnosed  autistic adults, first identified when they were children, are representative of  all  autistics from the general population, known and unknown. Current understanding of autism is different to what it was in the past. Once again, the  NHS adult prevalence study  proves useful in addressing these sorts of limitations in available data. The report tells us that the prevalence of ASD in three marital status groups is as follows. Married/cohabitating: 0.5% Single: 2.5% Widowed/divorced/separated: 0.6% There's also information on a \"base\" population that is not exactly representative of the general population, but it's probably close enough to being representative that it can be used to come up with estimated proportions of autistics and non-autistics in each of the categories. Married/Cohabitating Single Widowed/divorced/separated Autistics 33% 57% 10% Non-Autistics 61% 22% 15% Data for men only: Married/Cohabitating Single Widowed/divorced/separated Autistic Men 30% 63% 7% Non-Autistic Men 61% 26% 14% There are some differences.  Autistic people in the UK are apparently about half as likely to get married than non-autistic people . I would not say the characteristic is diagnostic, however. I should point out once more that the study only looked for autistic adults who live in private households. The data will likely change somewhat when autistics who live in \"communal establishments\" are considered. Implications For CADD I've  previously criticized the concept of Cassandra Affective Deprivation Disorder (CADD) . It's a pseudo-scientific, made-up and damaging idea to the effect that autistic people make for terrible significant-others and spouses to such an extent that they can cause their partners to develop psychological problems and health issues, even cancer. If CADD had an ounce of truth to it, you'd expect divorce to be rampant among autistics. Heck, you'd expect autistics to widow more often, if the claim about effects on health were true. Yet, the divoced-to-married ratio for autistics is 0.29, whereas the same ratio is 0.24 for non-autistics. (It's 0.24 vs. 0.22 for men only.) That's a minor difference, not significant by any stretch of the imagination. It's clear that the reason a lot of autistic people in the UK are single is not because they fail at relationships. It's because they are not good at starting relationships. The claim that autistic marriages fail much more often than expected is mythical, evidently. Nevertheless, many web pages state the following: \"Dutch research suggests that the divorce rate for people with Asperger syndrome is around 80 per cent.\" Interestingly, this exact phrasing appears throughout the web, as if it had been copy-pasted. I have tried to locate the original source of the claim, to no avail. One person says they \"lost the link.\" The claim appears in a book by Ashley Stanford for people whose significant-other has Asperger's: \"Preliminary research performed in Holland suggests that the divorce rate for couples in which one partner has AS may be as high as 80 percent (Relate leaflet).\" The  Relate leaflet  in question appears to be  this webpage  by none other than FAAAS. FAAAS, for those who don't know, is an organization of people who moan about their \"frustrations\" with their adult autistic relatives. FAAAS, not surprisingly,  is connected to Maxine Aston  of CADD infamy. The claim that appears in the  Relate leaflet  is exactly the following: For the partner of a person with AS, their bewilderment at the puzzling behaviour of their spouse can cause deep distress and a breakdown in their health. Inevitably this means that there is a high divorce rate amongst marriages where one partner has AS. Research in Holland suggests that this is as high as 80%, and research recently done in the UK is due to be published next year. It's entirely unsourced. I'm currently skeptical as the the existence of the famous Dutch research.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1982", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/mental%20health/mental%20health%20surveys/APMS_Autism_report_standard_20_OCT_09.pdf", "http://www.faaas.org/doc.php?24,95,847738p,faa845937,,,Doc,page.html", "http://www.faaas.org/doc.php?40,0"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/11/marriage-among-autistics-or-why-nhs.html", "title": "\nMarriage Among Autistics, Or Why the NHS Study Obliterates CADD\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 04, 2009", "body": "\nDear reader: Please go read Jon Mitchell's utterly dishonest attack on my two latest posts. It's titled  Some neurodiversity potpurri . First of all, I'd like to inform Jon that even though I've said this blog is pro-neurodiversity, I'm not a leader of neurodiversity proponents or anything of the sort. All my opinions are personal and should in no way be seen as opinions put forth by something called  neurodiversity . It's very uncool to try to use what I say (or what other bloggers say for that matter) as a way to attack the neurodiversity philosophy as  a whole.  Now, the most outrageous misrepresentation of what I said is the following: I see that Joseph of the autism natural variation blog has decided based on one published report based on the statuses of only 19 people that adults with autism don't have problems with employment nor with marriage. I could've predicted this was going to be Jon's response, and it's not the first time he's tried to misrepresent what I've said. I'll leave statistics for the end of the post. I want to discuss the misrepresentations first. What I said about lack of employment is that (1) figures used in prior estimates appear to be exaggerated; (2) that it would seem adult autistics who live in private households across the UK are largely productive individuals who contribute to the economy in a manner similar to their non-autistic peers. I never said autistic people don't have problems with employment. All I said is that autistics are largely employed. There's a big difference. The data can't tell me anything about specific problems autistic people have with employment, and I have no doubt there are a variety of problems. I stated that there appear to be some differences in the employment rates of autistics and non-autistics, but the authors didn't find them statistically significant. This is what the authors said: No significant variation in rate of ASD by economic activity status was found. That's a true statement. If you want to lash out at the authors for daring to say that, be my guest. The misrepresentation of my claims about marriage is even more outrageous, since my post clearly said  in bold  that  autistic people in the UK are apparently about half as likely to get married than non-autistic people . In the past Joseph presented some statistic saying that 25% of autistics were employed. As far as I can tell he neglects to mention any source or reference or link for this statistic in any post on his blog. OK, that one is my fault. I failed to cite a reference in the old post, and I don't even remember the exact reference. I'm usually careful about that sort of thing. If you're interested, Howlin et al. (2004) reports that almost one third of the adult autistics in that study had some form of employment. Szatmari et al. (1989), a follow-up of adults without intellectual disability, reports a rate of employment of 50%. So Joseph seems to imply that autistic persons are making just as much money as an NT. I never talked about salaries, and if you made inferences from my post in regards to salaries, that's really not my fault. The study does have data on salaries. The summary of the findings was the following. While the likelihood of having ASD appeared to increase among men as household income decreased, this was not significant (when analysis was run using household income grouped into tertiles). In this case, again, there might have been some differences, and if you look at the numbers in Table 2.3 it would be difficult to deny that autistics are making somewhat less money than non-autistics. But in a statistical sense, the numbers cannot tell us for sure that there's a difference. So again, we have ND trivialization of an autistics inability to get married or make a living. To Jon Mitchell, any figures and facts that don't agree with his personal views and experiences with autism constitute \"trivialization.\" Reality doesn't exactly matter if it doesn't jive with what he sees as the necessity of continuing to have a grim worldview. The Stats Jon doesn't like the stats of the study because: The authors of the reports extrapolated this number 19 to the greater population claiming that 1% of adults in the UK in private households have autism. However this was just a guess based on mathematical projections. For starters, saying that the result is a \"guess\" is clearly an inaccurate characterization, and I've explained this previously. Many of the 19 autistic people identified must have been assigned a probability of selection that is less than 1.0 in phase 1. For example, if 10 of the 19 autistic people had been assigned a probability of 0.25, then clearly there must have been about 40 autistic people in the original group who were assigned a probability of 0.25. This is a probabilistically sound projection, not a \"guess.\" (It's a bit more complicated than I explained, because there's also some weighing due to participation refusal based on some household variables.) Now, no study can prove a negative, i.e. that there's absolutely no difference between the characteristics of two groups (this is the \"null hypothesis.\") All you can say is that you found the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Of course, some studies are better able to rule out small differences as opposed to big differences, with statistical confidence. It does matter that only 19 autistic people were found, but what mostly matters is the overall sample size. In Table 3.6 they indicate the confidence interval for ASD prevalence is 0.5% to 2.0%. They list the sample size as 2854 and the \"weighed\" sample size as 7358.  There are prevalence studies smaller than this, and existing data on the characteristics of autistic adults are usually based on comparable or smaller samples of autistic people.  The confidence interval is actually what you would get if you had found 7 autistic people out of 700 in a standard sampling (and I have some thoughts about implications of this, but I won't go into them here.) Prevalence of ASD among adults who are employed was 0.9%. The confidence interval would be roughly equivalent to what you'd get if you had found 5 autistics out of 555 people, or 0.4% to 2.1%. (About 75% of all adults are employed in the UK.) So on the one hand you have a prevalence of [0.5% - 2.0%] and on the other hand you have a prevalence of [0.4% - 2.1%]. Is there a difference? We just can't say there is.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-neurodiversity-potpourri.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/11/jonathans-completely-dishonest-attack.html", "title": "\nJonathan's Completely Dishonest Attack on My Latest Posts\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 08, 2009", "body": "\nOver two years ago I wrote a post titled  Moving Toward a New Consensus Prevalence of 1% or Higher . At the time the prevalence of ASD was generally considered to be 0.6%. If you Google it, you'll find this figure is still the one that's cited most frequently. At present, no one has come out and precisely said the consensus prevalence has been revised to 1%, but I think that's pretty much where we're at. Consider what Roy Richard Grinker said recently to Time Magazine. \"It provides what scientists call convergent validity: no matter how you shake the bushes, you come up with this 1%,\" says Richard Roy Grinker, an autism researcher at George Washington University who has worked to determine ASD prevalence in South Korea. ( source ) Two years ago, and even long before this \u2013 as suggested by Lorna Wing \u2013 there were already some indications in the literature that 1% might be a more accurate figure. It was not a lucky guess or anything like that. My concern, which came to pass, was that as study methodologies evolved and awareness improved, the public would be frightened by what might appear to be a real increase in the prevalence of autism, with no end in sight.  Ms. Clark  (you remember her, right?) speculated that the process might be very gradual, with people getting increasingly surprised, and finally collapsing from exhaustion. It turned out to be a little more quick and relatively painless, at least so far. I believe the question at this point is whether we've reached a plateau. Is prevalence going to stabilize at 1%? Have identification methods been pushed to their limits? Is the level of awareness (important in phone surveys and passive systems) the highest it's ever going to be? I think that's possible, provided the same criteria and diagnostic tools continue to be used. But I gotta tell you, I have some reasons to believe we haven't seen the end of this just yet  \u2013 not very many reasons, admittedly, but some. We might find that a more accurate number for prevalence is a little bit higher, perhaps 1.2%, or even 1.5%.  I'm not going to discuss cultural trends or the inherent subjectivity of psychiatric diagnoses, simply because this would be difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. But I do want to discuss  case finding  in this post. What brings this about is the recent  NHS prevalence study  of autism among UK adults. The study has already been discussed by  Anthony Cox ,  Kev Leitch ,  Sullivan ,  Catherina , and others. It found that 1% of adults living in private households had ASD. This result should come as no surprise to regular readers of this blog, particularly those who have read  High Prevalence of Autism in Adults .  The NHS study did not look for autistic adults living in \"communal establishments\" (institutions.) According to the NAS, the report is \"the first part of a much more detailed research project\" ( source ) so I have little doubt there will be a follow-up that looks for adults in institutions. What will happen then? The NHS report says that 2% of all adults live in communal establishments. I believe pooled prevalence from both studies might turn out to be around 1.3%. It will  easily  be 1.2%.  Of course, there's some room for statistical uncertainty in these figures, and we'll have to wait for replications that use roughly the same methodology to see how the figures converge. But taking them at face value, 1.2% or 1.3% are a little higher than might be expected. Shouldn't the prevalence among children in the UK be even higher than this? Presumably, diagnostic stability to adulthood is not 100%, and autistics might have a slightly lower life expectancy than normal. It's important to understand that the NHS study is not only the first of its kind, but also one with a methodology that is both novel and innovative. The methodology is designed so that the prevalence of ASD can be estimated even if the screening tools available to the researchers are unreliable and not well researched. The method does not require knowing how a screening tool performs a priori. It's  preferable  that the tools perform well \u2013 it helps with statistical power \u2013 but this is not a requirement per se. I realize most people can't seem to make heads or tails of the methodology of the NHS study. I've tried to explain it with examples (e.g.  here ). You have my assurance that it's probabilistically sound. This can be proven mathematically.  That's not to say the methodology doesn't have any problems. Like any new methodology, it will be scrutinized in the scientific literature. Potential issues will be identified. Guidelines on how the selection probabilities should be defined will be proposed, etc. This is generally acknowledged by the authors: The present methods are therefore felt by the authors to be to the highest standard achievable at present. However this is a first methodological development of its kind in the autism field and it is to be hoped that future surveys could build and improve on the present procedures. Don't be surprised, though, if this methodology becomes a sort of standard that is subsequently used in studies of children, and not just those dealing with autism prevalence. Don't be surprised either if this in turn results in slightly higher prevalence figures.  The methodology of the NHS study is such that it doesn't leave any autistics behind, so to speak. It produces only an estimate, but it's an estimate that includes all autistics in principle (if we discount participation refusal biases.) A study that relies on a conventional screening process, on the other hand, can easily leave out autistics who did not pass the screening. It's not easy to know a priori how many autistics a screening tool might miss. Suppose you evaluate 1000 random persons with a reliable  diagnostic  instrument and also a screening tool you want to test. You might identify 10 autistic people by means of this undoubtedly expensive endeavor. Suppose 5 of them also passed the screening. Can you assume 50% of autistics are missed by the screening tool? Not really. With statistical confidence, you can only say that anywhere from 20% to 80% would pass a screening. Sure, you could test a much larger group of previously identified autistics. But how do you know this group is representative of all the autistics you intend to identify in a subset of the general population? This is clearly a limitation of pre-NHS methodology. In the old days, they didn't even take into account the likely unreliability of screening methods. In Lotter (1966), for example, they just provided a questionnaire for teachers to fill out and only considered children reported as having \"certain types of behavior.\" At various other levels of screening, it was always assumed the screening was perfect. This brings me to a relatively recent study, Kadesj\u00f6 et al (1999). It reported the prevalence of ASD was 1.21% in the small Swedish town of Karlstad. All children involved were born in 1985. What's interesting about this study is its intensity. The primary author personally evaluated 50% of 818 children attending normal classrooms. Unfortunately, it was a small study. They found 10 autistic children out of 826. If they had only found 9 autistic children, prevalence would be 1.1%. If they had found 11 children, prevalence would be 1.3%. I can't help but wonder, though, what might have happened if 100% of the children had been evaluated. Is it possible that at least one more autistic child would be found among the remaining 409 children who were not assessed for autism past the initial screening? To summarize, diagnostic criteria and diagnostic methods are not the only thing that matter in a prevalence study.  Case finding  is also crucial, but now the NHS has introduced a methodology that could make case finding practically a non-issue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1927824,00.html", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/mental-health-surveys/autism-spectrum-disorders-in-adults-living-in-households-throughout-england--report-from-the-adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-2007", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3203", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3232", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3238", "http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2009/09/end-of-idea-of-autism-epidemic.html", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1918&a=20481", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3238#comment-65280"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/10/is-it-more-like-12-to-15.html", "title": "\nIs It More Like 1.2% to 1.5%?\n"},

If you want to come up with cost estimates based on an ASD prevalence of 0.6% or 1%, you have to know the employment rate that corresponds to the ASD criteria that results in said prevalence. You can't just look at  diagnosed  adult autistics, and hope they are representative of all adult autistics, especially considering autism has been  very  much under-recognized in the past . Of course, data that addresses this objection was not available until recently. That did not stop me from coming up with a guesstimate, though. I suggested that perhaps 70% of autistic children diagnosed today might end up being employable a generation from now. I think it was clear in the blog post that this was a rough estimate extrapolated from other trends. The estimate, predictably, was met with accusations that I trivialize the challenges of autistics and so forth, specifically from  Jon Mitchell . It seems that whenever I do some math or look up figures in the literature, I'm automatically engaging in trivialization. Jon was of course \"mystified\" as to how I came up with the 70% figure, and implied that it's unbelievably high. Whenever he wants to snipe at me, this is the one thing Jon likes to bring up. He also proclaims I'm \"one of the more prominent ND bloggers\" so he gets to criticize not just me, but he probably thinks he's criticizing the entire neurodiversity movement in the process. Readers are probably aware by now that the UK National Health Service recently released its  first report on a prevalence study of autism in adults living in private households . The report includes some data on employment, but all the report says about it is this: No significant variation in rate of ASD by economic activity status was found. That's interesting enough by itself, but let's look at data from Table 2.4. There are 3 groups of persons considered in the study: Those in employment, those who are unemployed, and those who are  economically inactive . The following is the prevalence of ASD in each group: In employment: 0.9% Unemployed: 1.6% Economically inactive: 1.5% The report also gives a \"base\" population, which consists of all persons from phase 1 who had been assigned a near-zero probability of ASD. You may recall that 7461 respondents were interviewed in phase 1. The base population consists of only 5998 persons, divided as follows: In employment: 4492 Unemployed: 291 Economically inactive: 1215 The base population is not exactly representative of the general population (it's more \"non-autistic\" than normal if you will) but it will have to do. I will use it to estimate rates of employment and unemployment in autistics and non-autistics, as shown in the following table. In Employment Unemployed Economically Inactive Autistics 64% 7% 29% Non-Autistics 75% 5% 20% There are some differences, but the study authors didn't find them to be statistically significant. In any case, it would seem that adult autistics who live in private households across the UK are largely productive individuals who contribute to the economy in a manner similar to their non-autistic peers. Of course, this particular report doesn't tell us about autistics who live in \"communal establishments.\" I've  suggested  that when all is said and done, pooled prevalence of ASD might turn out to be around 1.3%. Even if all autistics who live in communal establishments are considered unemployed, total unemployment among autistics might be around 35%.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/jake-crosby-takes-nds-to-task-again.html", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/mental%20health/mental%20health%20surveys/APMS_Autism_report_standard_20_OCT_09.pdf", "http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/user-guidance/lm-guide/concepts/inactivity/about/index.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/10/unemployment-among-adult-autistics-in.html", "title": "\nUnemployment Among Adult Autistics in the UK\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 16, 2009", "body": "\nThere was  media coverage  recently about the discovery of the \"first common\" set of autism gene variants. The alleles are apparently found in 65% of autistic people. What's interesting is that they also occur in about 50% of non-autistic people. (Some sources say 60%.) That doesn't sound like a finding that, by itself, could be practically applied to the genetic screening of autistic people. I'm not too worried about that. Additionally, autism-related studies of this sort don't replicate a lot of times.  It seems to be a very difficult problem. Why is that? I'm sure different people have different views about this. What I was wondering is whether experts dealing with a similarly elusive problem could provide some insights of note. The problem I'm referring to is that of finding the \"race gene.\" The following are the recommendations regarding race and genetics by the National Human Genome Center of Howard University.  1. When the human species is viewed as a whole, underlying genetic variation and expressed physical traits exhibit gradients of differentiation, not discrete units. Therefore, modern extant humans do not fracture into races (subspecies) based on the modern phylogenetic criteria of molecular systematics. 2. The biological \u201cboundaries\u201d between any human divisions (groups, populations, nationalities) are circumstantial and largely dependent on what traits are chosen for emphasis. 3. The demographic units of human societies (and of the U.S. census) are the products of social or political rules, not the forces of biological evolution. The names and characteristics of demographic groups can change and have changed over time.  4. Group differences in health parameters are not encoded in the human genome as part of an evolutionary pattern of divergence. Thus, differences in health or disease cannot be treated as causally related to ethnoancestral groups. 5. Genotype-environment interactions are more important in explaining group differences in health than genotype, environment, or a factor called \u201crace\u201d. 6. The non-existence of human races (subspecies) does not mean the non-existence of racism. Racism is the structured systematic oppression against individuals and groups defined based on physical traits that reflect an extremely limited fraction of the human genome. Racism must be addressed. 7. Individuals cannot be treated as representative for all those who physically resemble them, or have some of the same ethnohistorical ancestry. Ancestries of individuals and groups should be ascertained in order to evaluate differential expression of genetic effects. ( source ) I thought that sounded quite pertinent.  I'm not saying that it won't ever be possible to fairly accurately distinguish an autistic person from a non-autistic one by simply looking at a genome sequence. As someone with a Computer Science background, I can theoretically speculate that someone will figure out a method eventually. I just don't think it will get done by simply looking for alleles that represent statistically significant \"risk\" factors.

{"date": "Friday, May 08, 2009", "body": "\nThere's been some renewed California \"epidemic\" talk recently because of a report released by California DDS ( this one ) despite the usual DDS disclaimer to the effect that report numbers don't represent epidemiological counts of all autistic persons in the state. Kristina  discussed it  and there's been some  media coverage  as well, with the usual Rick Rollens scare-mongering about an upcoming surge of autistic adults that the state of California allegedly doesn't have any experience dealing with. There are a number of inaccuracies and faulty assumptions in the media coverage of the report, to be sure, but I wanted to focus on one particular claim found  here : The percentage of people with both autism and mental retardation has dropped significantly, a trend that may provide clues for those trying to solve the autism puzzle. That's not stated accurately, but in fact there has been a gradual drop in the prevalence of  mental retardation  within the population of recognized autistics , at least for the last 17 years. See page 20 of the report. This is a well known fact, or at least I'd like to think it is. I've discussed it several times previously ( here , for example.) It is mentioned in  Gernsbacher et al. (2005)  as well. I'm sure broadening ascertainment denialists can find ways to rationalize this finding. But what if I told you that the phenomenon is not only a time-based phenomenon? It can also be observed when you compare one regional center to another. That is, regional centers with a higher administrative prevalence of autism will tend to have a lower proportion of autistics who also have a classification of mental retardation.  You know a chart is coming, but as usual I'd like to be clear as to where the data comes from, so anyone reading can double-check if they so wish. I'm using a file provided by California DDS upon request, named  CDERQtrData.zip . It only goes up to January, 2006, but it contains more autism-specific information for each regional center than you normally find in the regular report. I don't have population data for each regional center (and gathering that would be a bit much for a blog post) but I will use the Autism-Epilepsy ratio as a proxy of administrative prevalence. The administrative prevalence of epilepsy in California is roughly stable (just below 0.1%) so dividing the autism caseload by the epilepsy caseload of a regional center should provide us with an adequate proxy of the administrative prevalence of autism. The figure demonstrates an inverse association between the Autism-Epilepsy ratio and the proportion (%) of autistics who also have an MR (or unkown MR) classification. The downward trend is statistically significant with 99.6% confidence.  Now, you'll note the distribution of the dots in the chart is fairly random. I wondered why that might be, especially why the Central Valley regional center would have a low administrative prevalence of autism and a low proportion of autistics with MR.  The Central Valley RC has 9,284 clients with mental retardation as of January, 2006. That's comparable to other big RCs. Of all individuals with MR, only 247 (2.7%) also have an autism classification. This is ridiculously low. I'm sure that if someone went to the Central Valley RC and screened the individuals with an MR classification, they would find that a lot more than 2.7% of them are also autistic.  It's generally understood that there's been increasing recognition of autism in the population without mental retardation. This is what they call HFA. What's not so intuitive is that there's also been increasing recognition of autism in the population  with  mental retardation. Clearly, regional centers have different levels of recognition across both populations. In average, 7.7% of persons with mental retardation will have a classification of autism in California (which is still rather low.) Let's look at what the result would be if we were to adjust the autism numbers under the assumption that every regional center should have a level of recognition of 7.7%.  That's a lot more clear, isn't it? This suggests that differences in the recognition of autism in the population with MR across regional centers are an artifact. Thought Experiment Imagine there's a hypothetical regional center where recognition of autism has gotten out of hand, to the point where every person who resides in the area served by the RC is classified as autistic by it. In this case the Autism-Epilepsy ratio would be about 1,000.  You'll note the first chart above has a power regression model (the formula on the upper right.) The type of model is theoretically justifiable, and I can discuss that on another occasion. y = 32.235 x -0.4525 In the model,  x  is the Autism-Epilepsy ratio and  y  is the proportion of autistics with MR.  So what if  x  is 1,000? This model predicts that the proportion of autistics who have MR would then be 1.41%. This is basically what you'd expect for the general population. In other words, DDS data is entirely consistent with a cultural explanation of the differences in administrative prevalence of autism between regions.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.ca.gov/Autism/docs/AutismReport_2007.pdf", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/o_california_whats_going_on_with_the_autism_rate_in_the_golden_state", "http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12312452", "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_12316295?source=rss", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SgSMfs-EH4I/AAAAAAAAAIc/5ETCYjuIQ2Y/s1600-h/CalDDSMRInAutismRegional.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SgSVE8lVaDI/AAAAAAAAAIk/hZ_L-DbumCc/s1600-h/CalDDSMRInAutismRegionalAdjusted.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/05/another-way-to-tell-epidemic-in.html", "title": "\nAnother Way to Tell the \"Epidemic\" in California is Bogus\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 27, 2009", "body": "\nJust when I thought I wouldn't encounter  better examples  of the  intellectual bankrupcy  of anti-vaxers, comes Dr. Jay Gordon, pediatrician to Jenny McCarthy's son, with the following anecdote: I just saw an eight-month-old boy who got two vaccines then lost his language, motor skills, reaction to his own name and responsiveness to his 3 year old sister. This all happened three hours after a DPT/HIB combination. All previous observation and video of this little boy is normal. Lots of great video of a vibrant, talkative happy baby. He has autism now. No proof, but the temporal proximity of the regression to his vaccines is daunting to those of us who would like more rigorous proof rather than just a collection of hundreds of pieces of anecdotal evidence. Tempting to assume causation even if only this one case/child. Just thought you'd want to know. I usually see these kids in my office months or years after the event the parents think caused the problems. I have read hundreds of emails and spoken to thousands of parents who are certain that vaccines triggered or mightily contributed to their children's autism. Not this time: This family came to my office just days after the vaccines, distraught that he was no longer talking, smiling, acknowledging his sister or his mom and dad and was flapping his hands a lot. ( Respectful Insolence - Comment ) Don't worry. I waited for confirmation from Orac before writing this post. Some people doubted that was actually Dr. Jay, but it is. Since he posted at 00:44 Pacific, there's some speculation he might have been drunk, but who knows. That is monumentally absurd, isn't it? First of all, who in the hell diagnosed an 8 month old with autism? That simply can't be done. Even an 18 month diagnosis is pushing the envelope.  Then we're supposed to believe an 8 month old \"lost his language\" and that this was noticed in a matter of 3 hours. Typically, 8 month old babies do not talk. This is completely normal.  In so far as responding to his own name, this is possible for an 8 month old. The \"name test\" is supposed to be done on the baby's first birthday, however ( source ). Eight month old babies have little in the way of motor skills that they could noticeably lose, unless the baby becomes paralyzed or something like that. A baby of that age can't yet walk. He should be sitting by then. In any case, loss of motor skills is unrelated to autism, and in fact should be cause to consider explanations other than autism. If it was a really obvious loss of motor skills, I'd think the baby should be rushed to a hospital, but instead the parents decided to see Dr. Jay again in 3 days. Enjoyment of play with other children should occur around the age of 2 years.  Hand flapping is entirely normal in infants, and it seems to me that, as a pediatrician, Dr. Jay should be aware of this. Plus, in order to hand-flap, the baby needs some motor skills. The DTP vaccine is no longer used in the US. The DTaP vaccine is what is used. It's administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Same with the Hib vaccine.  So what do we have here? Did Dr. Jay make it up completely? Perhaps this is a non-event that was blown out of proportion. Now, I wonder, was this child vaccinated by Dr. Jay? If not, why would parents take a child with the apparent symptoms noted to a doctor who is not qualified to diagnose developmental disorders, in just 3 days? Then again, is it plausible that Dr. Jay would administer 2 vaccines in one visit? I suppose that a pediatrician who scares parents about autism and discourages vaccination could cause them to notice things that are completely normal all of the sudden.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php#comment-1592853", "http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/04/02/baby-name-autism.html?ref=rss"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-jay-gordon-caught-making-stuff-up.html", "title": "\nDr. Jay Gordon Caught Making Stuff Up?\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 25, 2009", "body": "\nI'm sure readers are aware fellow blogger  Alyric passed away  last week. Subsequent to her passing, there has been some discussion about something called  Cassandra Affective Deprivation Disorder  (CADD), which Alyric had felt strongly about. (See the  ASAN Petition ,  this post by Gonzo , and  this older post by ABFH  with over 60 comments.) I have to admit this CADD thing had completely passed me by. It was only after I read the documentation related to the recent activity that I realized it pertained to yours truly in a personal sense. But I wanted to see if the claims around CADD had any merit from a more objective point of view, personal implications aside.  The Syndrome Maxine Aston claims to have discovered a new syndrome called CADD, observed in the significant others of autistic adults. Unfortunately, the only definitions of the syndrome are found in websites and books that simply list the characteristics of the alleged syndrome. I could find no mention of it in the scientific literature.  I haven't found a \"how to\" on making up new syndromes. But it's possible to research how it has been done historically. In order to define a syndrome, it's not sufficient to just come up with a list of symptoms. You have to show that it exists. Testimonials are not sufficient. Consider Kanner (1943), which defined autism for the first time. Kanner wrote the case histories of 11 autistic children in detail, based on meticulous research observations.  This was not sufficient, though. For \"autism\" to be considered valid, subsequent research was required. For example, if autism had been found to be the same as other constructs like mental retardation or schizophrenia, say, when you match groups by IQ, then it would've been deemed an invalid construct.  The syndrome should also have some usefulness (e.g. Does it help predict something useful? Does it help define unique needs the individual might have?) In fact, today there's some controversy about the validity of Asperger's Syndrome, since the differences between HFA and Asperger adolescents and adults (when matched by IQ) are nearly non-existent. Asperger's could very well be an unnecessary construct. But I digress. For CADD to be considered valid, there not only needs to be a write-up of case histories in the scientific literature, you also need to show that it is different to everything that has been reported previously. Unhappy significant others and failed relationships abound. Are the relationships with autistic adults unique in this sense, say, when matched for socio-economic status and disability in one partner? And if so (which I don't doubt is true) are they uniquely bad, or are they simply different? Can any problems be explained by lack of acceptance? Causes The existence of the syndrome has not been established, so it seems a little spurious to talk about causes. Nevertheless, let's look into what the alleged causes are. As far as I can tell, \"sufferers\" of CADD claim that it is caused by lack of empathy and lack of emotional reciprocity in the part of the autistic significant other.  Regarding empathy, there's some  recent research  that shows adults with Asperger's Syndrome score lower in measures of  cognitive  empathy, but not in  affective  empathy. Persons with Asperger's actually experience higher levels of distress when observing others in distress.  These findings bring into question the means by which empathy is measured in research. I'd also recommend reading Dr. Gernsbacher's  Toward a Behavior of Reciprocity .  Symptoms The symptoms of CADD are claimed to be essentially the same as the symptoms of  Seasonal Affective Disorder  (SAD), including sleeping problems, depression, etc.  Again, in order to make these sorts of claims, some evidence, perhaps in the form of a case-control study, is needed. Testimonials are not sufficient. It would also be necessary to show that the symptoms can't be explained by socio-economic status, assortative mating, or disability in the significant other.  There are more far-fetched claims attributed to Aston, like CADD resulting in cancer. I'm sure this is based on one or a few anecdotes. Since cancer is fairly common in adults (the lifetime risk of developing some form of cancer is over 40%) such anecdotes are nearly useless.  Besides, there's some evidence that psychological stress does not contribute to cancer risk (e.g.  Johansen & Olsen, 1997 ). The matter appears to be unresolved.  Conclusion What we have here is a syndrome that has not been shown to exist, with alleged causes that might be erroneously attributed to autism, and with symptoms that haven't been shown to be associated with the alleged causes.  Sound familiar? This is no different to crankery like \"autistic enterocolitis\" or \"mercury-induced autism.\" Except the promotion of CADD has the potential to result in a lot more direct damage to the personal lives of autistic adults.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://alyric.blogspot.com/2009/04/very-sad-news.html", "http://www.maxineaston.co.uk/cassandra/", "http://asannorthernva.blogspot.com/2009/04/end-hate-petition-to-tony-attwood-and.html", "http://gonzogalore.blogspot.com/2009/04/in-memoriam.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/09/maxine-astons-cassandra-disorder-scam.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/03/empathy-and-autismasperger-research.html", "http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/gernsbacher_reciprocity.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9000613"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/maxine-aston-and-cadd-different-level.html", "title": "\nMaxine Aston and CADD - A Different Level of Crankery\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 20, 2009", "body": "\nAfter some recent discussion around the performance of autistics in college, I decided to read  Szatmari et al. (1989) . I was aware this adult outcome study looked at the academic achievements of autistics without intellectual impairment (IQ >= 70). I found that this 20 year old paper has a lot of other information of interest. Additionally, the population it studied is similar to that of the recent  outcome study out of Utah  that Sullivan had written about over at LB/RB. Even though the Utah paper is apparently not yet available, there is  some information  from it which we can use to compare and contrast. I thought it would be useful to go through Szatmari et al. and see how it compares to the Utah study when possible, and to other outcome studies I'm familiar with.  Group Sizes One limitation of Szatmari et al. is that it was small. They only managed to find 16 autistics who agreed to participate. The Utah study included 41 adults.  General Outcome Assessments Szatmari et al. doesn't really provide ratings of \"good\" or \"very good\" but a fair assumption is that half of the adults would've been given these ratings, which is basically the same thing the Utah study finds.  It also reports that 4 of the 16 (25%) might be considered \"recovered.\" This is how the paper puts it: If a naive individual were to meet the first four probands from Table II without knowledge of their early history, one might conclude they were essentially normal. The Utah study reports that 6 of the 41 (15%) no longer had autism diagnoses. As Sullivan notes, we don't know if they have Asperger or PDD-NOS diagnoses. Employment & Independence Szatmari et al. finds that 8 (50%) were in full-time employment, 3 involving regular contact with people. Five were living independently, 10 with parents, and 1 in a group home. In the Utah study, half had full-time or part-time employment. About half lived in group homes or with parents.  Dating & Marriage Szatmari et al. reports that 4 individuals had dated regularly and had been in long-term relationships. One was married.  The media report of the Utah study states: \"A few are married and have children. They have friends or acquaintances.\" Predictors of Outcome The usual predictors of outcome, like IQ, are noted in Szatmari et al. What I wanted to go over are some of the predictors and non-predictors, measured or qualitative, which are not well known but have been mentioned elsewhere.  On early severity as a predictor, Szatmari et al. says: Nevertheless, the results do suggest that, for this group of HFA probands, early history explained little of the variance in outcome. Indeed, the good and poor outcome groups differed little with respect to early impairments in social responsiveness, deviant language, and bizarre behaviors. From the Utah study: While all participants had baseline IQs in the nonimpaired range, there was limited evidence to support the use of other early childhood variables to predict adult outcome. About the time frame when most gains were observed, Szatmari et al. tells us that: Parents noted that the good-outcome cases had improved considerably by late adolescence. By this age, parents felt their children were still somewhat shy and awkward but not odd or eccentric. This is something I had previously read about in  Kanner (1972) : They have not completely shed the fundamental personality structure of early infantile autism but, with increasing self-assessment in their middle to late teens, they expended considerable effort to fit themselves \u2014 dutifully, as it were \u2014 to what they came to perceive as commonly expected obligations. And: It was not until the early to middle teens when a remarkable change took place. Unlike most other autistic children, they became uneasily aware of their peculiarities and began to make a conscious effort to do something about them. Szatmari et al. has something to say about the involvement of the parents: The mothers of these probands were, however, able to advocate forcefully for their child in terms of educational and recreational resources. A similar observation can be found in  Ruble & Dalrymple (1996) : What seemed to be an important predictor of success was that whenever individuals and their families were confronted with challenges, they sought and successfully accessed various supports. For example, when families were told to \"place\" their young children, their parents sought and created alternatives. Some of the families were the first to push for integration in school and used their natural community and family ties to include and support their child. College Outcome Unfortunately, we don't have data on college attendance from the Utah study. I will go over what Szatmari et al. finds, and also some data from Kanner (1971) and Kanner (1972).  Eight (50%) of the group from Szatmari et al. had attended college or university. Seven had obtained degrees. The remaining one was beginning his second year as an undergraduate.  I find this quite interesting, statistically. As of 1990, about 42.7% of persons 18-19 in the US attended college ( source ). It was 38.5% for 20-21 year olds. Of course, when it comes to Szatmari et al. we're talking about Canada, not the US. Additionally, the autistic individuals came from affluent families, according to the paper. Diagnosed autistics tend to be urbanites. Now, as of 2004, about 33% of college students in the US graduate in 4 years or less, 50% in 5 years or less, and 55% in 6 years or less. About 45% take 7 years or more to graduate, or never do ( source .) I think it's remarkable that none of the autistics from Szatmari et al. who attended college had failed school at the time of the study. Only one (age 19) had not obtained a degree yet, but was still in school. Note that the autistics from Szatmari et al. were not a bunch of geniuses by any means. The average IQ of those autistics who attended college was apparently 102 (range 86 - 110.) This is similar, probably even less than the IQ of the average college student.  They generally did not obtain graduate degrees. One had an MBA. A couple had Bachelor of Science degrees. This is probably not surprising statistically. Plus, again, the study is 20 years old.  College was a relatively adequate environment for autistics, according to Szatmari et al. Living in residence at university seemed to make a major difference to the probands themselves. It was as if the forced confinement of living with others had a beneficial effect on their socialization. Certainly, this was a time when the probands felt most accepted by their peers. To many, these were their happiest years. I also scanned Kanner (1971) and Kanner (1972) for mentions of autistics who had attended college. I found 7 such persons, not counting \"the gifted student of mathematics killed accidentally and the young man whom we have so far lost track after 1962 when he was in college.\" Of the 7, 5 had obtained some sort of college or university diploma. One of them had a Master's degree in Economics. One was said to be struggling in general college, but there's no follow-up as to outcome. One was a student, doing well at university, and gifted in Math. One issue with the Kanner papers is that they were qualitative in their entirety, so it's possible some of the autistics he saw went to college and failed, but he didn't write about that. Comment When you look at the outcomes of autistics who have a distribution of IQs similar to what you find in the general population, certain difficulties and impairments will be evident: autistics struggle a lot when it comes to marriage, dating, friendships, independence, etc.  When it comes to employment, we know that autistics are under-employed. It's not clear how well the autistics who are employed do at their jobs. Some qualitative data from Kanner (1972) suggests that autistics who grew up in the 1960s and who got jobs did fairly well. It's also not clear why half the autistics from Szatmari et al. were not employed. As far as college enrollment, there doesn't appear to be much of a difference between autistics and non-autistics of the same intelligence. In fact, autistics seem to do (or used to do) rather well in college, judging by the rates of graduation reported.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2745389?ordinalpos=10&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1982", "http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/36859", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1972.html", "http://www.starautism.louisville.edu/images/pdf/rubleanddalrymple1996.pdf", "http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/school/p20-460/tab01.pdf", "http://www.dailytargum.com/2.8663/more-students-fail-to-graduate-in-four-years-1.1514424"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/adult-outcomes-from-toronto-and-utah.html", "title": "\nAdult Outcomes from Toronto and Utah.

{"date": "Monday, April 06, 2009", "body": "\nIn my  previous post  I looked at a few statements JB Handley made during his recent appearance on Larry King Live. Whether the statements were dishonest or simply wrong, I can't tell, but they were notable in their wrongness. They have even been referred to as  fractally wrong . I left an important one out, which I was pretty sure was wrong, but I needed to research it a bit more.  So I would tell you either go back to the 1989 schedule before this whole mess happened or go to Finland's schedule, Sweden's schedule, Norway's schedule and use theirs. Because their autism rates are one tenth of ours. He must mean their rates of  identified  autism are one tenth of what they are in the US. I don't like it when people don't make that clarification. But let's see what a quick search of the literature has to say.  Sweden One study in the town of Karlstad, Sweden ( Kadesj\u00f6 et al. 1999 ) had found the prevalence among 7 year olds to be 1.21%. I'll let  Lorna Wing  summarize why this study is of interest: Kadesj\u00f6 et al (1999) report a study in Karlstad, a Swedish town. Although this was small scale it was very intensive (over 50% of the 7 year old children seen and assessed personally by the first author). The study found a prevalence for all autistic spectrum disorders for all levels of IQ, of 1.21%!!! Children were followed up four years later and had the diagnoses confirmed. That's not all, though. You have, for example,  Arvidsson et al. (1997) , a study that set out to identify \"all individuals with severe degrees of autistic behaviour.\" They found a prevalence of 31 in 10,000 among 3 to 6 year olds. This is more like half of the consensus prevalence in the US. Then there is  Gillberg et al. (2006)  which finds a prevalence of 20.9 in 10,000 for autistic disorder, and 32.9 in 10,000 for \"other ASDs.\" That's 53.8 in 10,000 total. There are several other studies from Sweden we could look at, but I think the wrongness of Handley's claim has been clearly established just with the ones mentioned.  Finland Mattila et al. (2007)  found a prevalence of 25 in 10,000 for Asperger's Syndrome alone. This is actually higher than what the prevalence of Asperger's in children is normally found to be. An older study,  Kielinen et al. (2000) , finds a prevalence of 20.7 in 10,000 among 5 to 7 year olds. This is lower than the US consensus prevalence, but it's only 1/3rd of it, not 1/10th. Additionally, note that 50% of the children had IQs below 70. This is different to what you see in California DDS, for example. Norway The most recent epidemiology from Norway is a bit old, and here we do see that the prevalence is similar to what it traditionally was for Kanner autism. For example,  Sponheim & Skjeldal (1998)  find a prevalence of 4 to 5 in 10,000 for 3 to 14 year olds, using ICD-10 criteria.  However, there's a recent screening of 7 to 9 year old children using the ASSQ. That's  Posserud et al. (2006) . It finds that 2.1% of children were high scorers in the ASSQ when both teacher and parent questionnaires were considered. (It was 2.7% if they considered teacher forms only, as some parents declined to participate.) That seems high. Unfortunately, Posserud et al. don't tell us how many were confirmed to be diagnosable with ASD after the screening. There's an update of that study,  Posserud et al. (2009) .  I wish I had a copy. All I know is that the ASSQ is found to have a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.86, which appears good. In any case, JB Handley's assumption is kind of simplistic even if we only consider the country of Norway, as it ignores all the issues involved in identifying autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/new-phrase-fractally-wrong.html", "http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=q7842p370v730g2j&size=largest", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&a=2618", "http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/163", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/1144h1p24j53t5jt/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17450055?ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11095038?ordinalpos=15&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9656133?ordinalpos=14&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16423148?ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18592364?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/one-handley-turd-i-left-out.html", "title": "\nOne Handley Turd I Left Out\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 03, 2009", "body": "\nYesterday was World Autism Awareness Day. (That's right, its acronym is WAAD, and it's the day after April Fool's day.) Given the occasion, I thought I would discuss \"awareness.\" More specifically, I wanted to discuss how we can tell that awareness has had an impact in what is usually referred to as the \"autism epidemic.\" That awareness could account for much of the increase in autism diagnoses since the early 1990s is taken for granted. You will find awareness mentioned in many autism papers. In the recent MIND Institute paper (Hertz-Picciotto et al. 2008) awareness was acknowledged but not taken into account in the calculations. While H-P et al. apparently did not believe awareness to be an important factor, many other researchers seem to think it is. I personally believe it's supremely important. Changes in criteria can't in themselves cause the number of diagnoses to rise. Autistic persons need to be found and diagnosed (with autism) before they are counted. If diagnostic substitution is increasingly occurring, there's probably a reason why it's occurring: awareness. Nevertheless, as far as I know, no one has ever demonstrated that awareness explains the rise, statistically. Thus, we fall into the same trap that proponents of most environmental hypotheses fall into. We assume that because awareness has increased in the information age (as it obviously must have) and rates of autism have also increased, one causes the other. Could it simply be a  coincidence ? How do you measure awareness? Here's one way. I will use  Google News Archive Search  to search for the phrase \"autism california\" every year from 1992 to 2006. I propose that the number of results is an adequate proxy of autism awareness in California, though like all proxies, it's just an approximation.  I'd like to have data on diagnoses of autism to be able to make a comparison. I don't have that, however. Here's the next best thing. I will use data on number of California DDS clients with a classification of autism as reported on March of every year from 1993 to 2007. More specifically, I selected the number of autistic children born only 3 years prior to the report.  Let me explain the rationale. If we were to choose 5 year olds, that wouldn't work very well, as they could've been diagnosed when they were 2, 3, 4 or 5. It would be difficult to correlate caseload in the report year with awareness in several prior years.  If we instead  choose children born only 3 years before the report year, they almost necessarily have to have been diagnosed the year prior to the report year.  This is especially true if we use the March report. If we were to use the December report, this again might not work very well. Without further ado, the following is the graph I came up with.  The blue line represents awareness. The green line represents autism caseload of 3 year olds, approximately. There are 2 Y axis scales, left and right respectively. I think the 1 year lag between one and the other is pretty clear. If you prefer to visualize the data in a scatter chart, here it is: It's true that correlations that are purely coincidental (e.g. pirates vs. global warming) can  result in convincing scatter charts like the one above, and I haven't done further statistical analysis to rule out coincidence, but I think there are a couple of clear features of the series that make me think we're looking at causation. First, I already noted there's a 1-year lag in the expected direction. Second, awareness seems to start to shoot up in 1999. Autism caseload, in this cohort of very young children, starts to increase noticeably in 2000. Then there's also a clear spike in awareness in 2005, which corresponds to a spike in caseload in 2006.  Considering there's also plausibility, I think we can safely say awareness did have an impact in the rise of autism diagnoses. I only looked at very early diagnoses, but this is because I don't think I have other data that could be adequately used instead. I would imagine awareness has an impact on diagnoses at any age.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.seanbonner.com/blog/archives/001857.php", "http://news.google.com/archivesearch", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SdZGsJihVvI/AAAAAAAAAH8/qWqfmHqERC4/s1600-h/awareness-autism-series.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SdZJr4pkksI/AAAAAAAAAIE/r7VUEcwGCpk/s1600-h/awareness-autism-scatter.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/autism-awareness-and-its-relationship.html", "title": "\nAutism Awareness and its Relationship to the \"Epidemic\"\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 04, 2009", "body": "\nLast night I was changing the channel and I stumbled upon Larry King Live ( transcript here .) It must have been only a couple of minutes before they switched to Anderson Cooper. During that time, I got to watch JB Handley make a monumentally false statement. I'll go over several statements he made during the show, but first I want to address the one that caught my attention.  Did you see the January study from UC Davis using California's numbers that said unequivocally there's been a clear rise, it's not do [sic] to diagnostic substitution. Handley is referring to  Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche (2009) . This is what the conclusions of the paper actually said: Autism incidence in California shows no sign yet of plateauing. Younger ages at diagnosis, differential migration, changes in diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases do not fully explain the observed increases.  Other artifacts have yet to be quantified, and as a result, the extent to which the continued rise represents a true increase in the occurrence of autism remains unclear. That's not an unequivocal determination of a clear rise, by any stretch of the imagination. Besides, that paper was surprisingly poor. None of the figures used by the paper approach anything that might be called certain or accurate. One of the artifacts the paper fails to take into account is probably the most pertinent artifact of all:  awareness . A summary of all the very serious problems the paper had can be found at the end of  this post .  Next statement: We're looking for something that's caused this epidemic. It went from one in 10,000 in the 1970s to less than one in 100 today in many states. The first epidemiological study of autism was Lotter (1966). It finds a prevalence of 4.5 in 10,000. That was in the UK. Wing et al. (1976) finds the same prevalence in the US. Mike Stanton has a  good summary  of historical prevalence studies. I don't think this is the first time I've corrected Handley and others about this.  I happen to have read Lotter (1966). What they called 'autism' back then is very different to, say, what the DSM-IV calls 'autism' today. It's apples and oranges. Here's a excerpt from Lotter (1966) to give you an idea: The two categories of the Creak criteria concerning a \"'pathological preoccupation with particular objects\" and \"an insistence on the preservation of sameness\" were therefore combined. These are similar to criteria C2 and C4 of the DSM-IV, but in the DSM-IV they are basically optional (only 1 item from C is required.) The paper explains they located 666 out of 75,930 ( 88 in 10,000 ) children who had \"certain kinds of behaviour\" that couldn't be simply characterized as \"backwardness.\" They initially excluded 87% from this group, based on the opinions of two judges familiar with the syndrome of autism.  They ended up with 32 autistic children, 22 (68.8%) of whom had IQs under 55, another 5 (15.6%) with IQs between 55 and 79, and the remaining 5 (15.6%) with an IQ of 80 or above. Again, this is quite different to what we call 'autism' today. Moving on: I want to talk about this issue of autism prevalence. It's going to be shocking for parents to learn that the CDC and the AAP don't actually acknowledge that there's been a real rise in autism cases. Larry, the Department of Education in 1992, 16,000 kids were getting autism services. Today 225,000. That means in 1992, they were missing 93 percent of kids with autism. Where are all the adults with autism? They don't exist. Adults with autism don't exist? That's not only insulting and potentially damaging to the quality of life of autistic adults; it's  completely wrong . It becomes embarrassingly wrong every time someone goes and surveys adults to see if autism can be found among them. Again, I doubt this is the first time this has been pointed out to JB Handley. Heck, Handley's Age of Autism has a  token autistic adult  who contributes to that blog from time to time. His Special Education figures are essentially correct, except the year is 1993, not 1992. What he fails to mention is that 489,000 students were receiving services under the mental retardation category in 1993, and only 425,000 as of 2007.  Let's consider Specific Learning Disability and MR together, and let's also consider population growth. The prevalence of both categories combined was 645 in 10,000 in 1993, and 584 in 10,000 as of 2007 for 6 to 17 year olds. That's a drop of 61 in 10,000 \u2013 more than enough to cover the increase in the administrative prevalence of autism. Is it possible that JB Handley has never heard of  diagnostic substitution in IDEA ? Doubtful. Those are all the statements I will address in this post. Readers are welcome to point out other errors, if any.  My impression is that JB Handley is either completely misinformed about some basic facts having to do with autism epidemiology, or he decided to go on Larry King to simply lie with a straight face.  To conclude, here's some advice for Larry King: In the future, if you want to discuss the \"autism epidemic,\" you would do well to invite recognized experts on the matter, such as Roy Richard Grinker or Eric Fombonne.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0904/03/lkl.01.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19234401?ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/08/13/new-phase-autism/", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/4/1028"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/jb-handley-poorly-informed-or-outright.html", "title": "\nJB Handley - Poorly Informed or Outright Liar?\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, March 03, 2009", "body": "\nIn a departure from the more scientific topics I usually write about, my latest post argued that  autistics who actively  oppose  neurodiversity are generally high functioning . Obviously, my intention was to point out the non-rationality of using a similar observation to try to invalidate the views of autistics who actively favor neurodiversity.  That post had over 200 comments. I wasn't aware before then that Blogger starts to page comments at 200. The number of comments is surely the result of a fight that ensued with one troll in particular, but it was impressive nonetheless, considering this is not an active blog. (I've seen posts with more comments outside of Blogger, e.g.  this one about Wakefield  over at LB/RB, with 395 comments; Kev had to close the thread.) Recently I went over to Jon Mitchell's blog to see what he's up to. In his post titled \" Does neurodiversity help autistics with self-esteem? \" we see that he's using exactly the \"high functioning\" argument I had discussed.  I pointed out to Jon Mitchell that he hasn't demonstrated the existence of the group differences between autistics who approve of and disapprove of neurodiversity which he believes exist. The group sizes make this difficult if not impossible.  What he did do is bring attention to a published report titled \" Neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from qualitative research by the BRAINHE project .\" There are many findings of interest in this report, to be sure, but there's one paragraph in particular that I wanted my readers to be aware of. I would like parents of autistic children, specially, to read this paragraph and understand its implications.  13 of the participants viewed their neurodiversity as an entirely negative matter. These participants frequently used negative or medical terminology when talking about their labels which indicated that they felt in some way broken or damaged.  Of the 13 students who had this view, 8 indicated low academic self-esteem and expressed confusion and uncertainty about their future plans.  Participants who viewed their neurodiversity as a difference which included strengths were more likely to have higher academic self-esteem, to have experienced unpleasant epithets from teachers and to have a clear ambitious view of their future. Jon Mitchell, as you might expect, argues that it's not the participants' worldview which causes them to have self-esteem, but something outside of that; more specifically he argues that those with low self-esteem are lower functioning than those with high self-esteem, and that functioning level is also what causes them to either accept or reject the ideals of neurodiversity.  To be sure, the report is not terribly scientific, and there's no discussion of control for confounding. Yes, the report is lacking in that regard. We can't completely reject Jon Mitchell's speculation about a possible confound.  Let me ask the following, however. Which is more plausible? Is worldview more likely to affect self-esteem, or is functioning level more likely to affect self-esteem? Do bright people always have high self-esteem, whereas not so bright people always have low self-esteem? There is a lot of research on cultural influence in self-esteem, which I'm not really familiar with, but you can search for it. Leaving that aside, does it seem plausible that someone with the views of Jon Mitchell could ever have high self-esteem regardless of their personal situation, and still be autistic? So yes, I think there are probably group differences between those autistics who favor and those who oppose neurodiversity. I haven't seen convincing evidence that functioning level is one of those differences. Self-esteem most likely is a difference. To some extent it's possible that self-esteem affects functioning level and achievement too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1849", "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/02/does-neurodiversity-help-autistics-with.html", "http://www.dmu.ac.uk/Images/BDA%20BRAINHE%20proceedings%202008_tcm6-36145.doc"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/03/nevertheless-there-are-differences.html", "title": "\nNevertheless, There Are Differences Between Autistics Who Approve of and Disapprove of Neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 04, 2009", "body": "\nAnti-vaxers have a lot to be upset about lately. First, it turns out that  Wakefield probably falsified his data . Second, they took a beating scientifically and legally at the  Omnibus Autism Proceedings . Third, their  attempt to counter-attack by recycling a weak vaccine injury case from 2007  and acting as if it were new and \"hidden\" did not bear fruit.  To top it off, they've recently come to realize that  neurodiversity  is actually studied by scientists and sociologists. To be clear, neurodiversity is not the opposite of anti-vaccination. One has little or nothing to do with the other. Anti-vaccination has to do with causation, science, autism quackery and public health. Neurodiversity is a social concept, essentially independent of causation, which is not exclusive to autism by any means. Anti-vaxers, nonetheless, see neurodiversity as a threat for various reasons that are beyond the scope of the post. In my last post I wrote about the  BRAINHE Project report on neurodiversity . There's one paragraph in the report that I think is worth quoting again. 13 of the participants viewed their neurodiversity as an entirely negative matter. These participants frequently used negative or medical terminology when talking about their labels which indicated that they felt in some way broken or damaged. Of the 13 students who had this view, 8 indicated low academic self-esteem and expressed confusion and uncertainty about their future plans. Participants who viewed their neurodiversity as a difference which included strengths were more likely to have higher academic self-esteem, to have experienced unpleasant epithets from teachers and to have a clear ambitious view of their future. Jon Mitchell reacted to this report, and I already discussed that. It's not surprising that AoA'ers would also react. To do that, they brought out their token Aspie, one Jake Crosby, who writes for AoA from time to time. I hadn't heard of Jake Crosby previously, but I guess we can add him to the short list of autistics who actively oppose neurodiversity, and who  always happen to be high functioning . Jake Crosby's article, titled \" The Age of Neurodiversity ,\" is filled with errors. I'm saying it's filled with errors because I'm giving Mr. Crosby the benefit of the doubt. I could just as easily have said it's filled with lies and misrepresentations. Any other major blog (or \"internet newspaper\") would be embarrassed to publish an article with these many inaccuracies. Let's go over some of them. [Paul Offit] strangely cites two neurodiversity moms, Kathleen Seidel and Camille Clark for medical evidence, neither of whom have any medical background. I've read  False Prophets  and my instinct was that Mr. Crosby was mistaken. I read it again just now, and at no point are Kathleen or Camille cited as experts who provide  medical evidence . They are in the book simply to show that not all parents of autistic children are anti-vaxers.  He would simultaneously oppose any alternative therapy or pathological theory for autism, however effective or true, even if it is on the basis of what a few ND moms say. I haven't seen any evidence that Dr. Offit would oppose any \"pathological\" theory of autism. Reading  False Prophets  gave me the opposite impression. As most doctors, he most likely sees autism from a purely medical perspective.  As to opposing \"alternative\" therapies that are \"effective and true,\" that's an oxymoron. If a therapy is shown to be \"effective and true,\" it's no longer an \"alternative\" therapy. It's simply a therapy. There's no evidence that Paul Offit would oppose therapies that are \"effective and true.\" In fact, he seems to favor ABA because he's been led to believe it's effective, even though he is, in my view, mistaken in that regard (as high quality evidence on the effectiveness of ABA is lacking.) In his final chapter, \"A Place for Autism,\" Offit continuously touts the views of the five autism parents he dedicates his book to, the majority of whom believe in neurodiversity while the remaining have pharmaceutical industry ties. Other than Kathleen and Camille, Dr. Offit's book features Peter Hotez, Professor of Microbiology and Tropical Medicine at George Washington University School of Medicine; and Dr. Roy Richard Grinker, Professor of Anthropology at George Washington University. I don't know about Dr. Hotez, and doctors are obviously bound to have connections to the pharmaceutical industry (just as, say, the Geiers do) but I seriously doubt Dr. Grinker has such ties. This is strange, as apparent confidence or career ambition does not dictate real success or happiness. This is a perplexing statement. It does not make sense, first of all. If you have zero confidence and zero ambition, it's improbable you will achieve much, regardless of how smart you are.  More importantly, there's a significant body of science on the effects of self-confidence on success, failure and performance. Mr. Crosby might want to read up on that before making statements that are nonsensical.  After a closer look of the study, \u201cStudent experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: insights from the BRAINHE project,\u201d I quickly noticed that not all the people in the study were autistic. For one, it was published not in a journal about autism, but dyslexia. In fact \"Dyslexia\" is the name of the journal. It was not even focused on autism. This discovery is kind of funny. It shows that Mr. Crosby has no idea what neurodiversity is. As the word suggests, neurodiversity is about, you know,  neurological diversity . It's not a concept that is married to autism. The fact that neurodiversity as a term was coined by autistics and is most often discussed in the context of autism is of interest, but ultimately  immaterial. It's good to see that researchers are applying the term broadly, as they should.  This is how the researchers define neurodiversity: Neurodiversity is an umbrella term for many types of learning difference. The study is about neurodiversity, not about autism. I'm not sure what's so hard to get about this.  Furthermore, this study does not contribute to how prevalent the idea of \"Neurodiversity\" is within the autistic community because this study examines six autistic people. So? However prevalent the idea of neurodiversity is among autistics now, what the results of the study tell us is that it's in everyone's best interest for it to be more prevalent among anyone with a learning difference. From the study, it appears that the split on views is about 50/50 among those with learning differences.  Presenting it as if it reported that autistic students and graduates adhere to neurodiversity is a misrepresentation within the article that cited it. The article that cited it  was actually quite critical of neurodiversity. At no point did it make it sound like most autistic students adhere to neurodiversity. That's simply a fabrication. The following is what the article said. According to recent research, people with autism who accept the neurodiversity platform have more self-esteem, and have more academic and career ambition that those who see autism as a medical condition with its array of disadvantages. In one study, students with autism who held the latter view more often applied for special assistance and monetary allowance through disabled students programs. Not surprisingly, most neurodiversity advocates with autism are high functioning, with little to no significant intellectual impairment. I don't know if Mr. Crosby was pressured to produce his critique, and had a hard time coming up with proper arguments to refute the research in question. Either way, his critique is a complete disaster, and frankly, he should be embarrassed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/the-age-of-neurodiversity.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Autisms-False-Prophets-Science-Medicine/dp/0231146361/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236174423&sr=8-1", "http://brainblogger.com/2009/02/23/autism-no-need-for-a-cure/"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/03/aoas-token-aspie-reacts-to-brainhe.html", "title": "\nAoA's Token Aspie Reacts to BRAINHE Study With Error-Filled Article\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 14, 2009", "body": "\nI'm sure many readers must have heard about the case of  Sky Walker , an autistic teenager who has allegedly murdered his mother.  As you might expect, some people are using this case to support their views about autism. Kim Stagliano, for example, apparently argues that treatment is both necessary and effective in preventing this sort of circumstance. Plausible as her argument may sound to many, she has not presented any data to support it that I know of.  Harold Doherty  has written about the case , trying to connect it to awareness of self-injury. Interestingly, Harold Doherty had been recently arguing that Andrew Wakefield should not be considered guilty until he is convicted by a tribunal of some sort. Harold has not expressed the same reservations about the media treatment of the Sky Walker case. I'm not going to talk about the philosophical implications of the case, or possible root causes, etc. Others would be much better at doing that. What I will do is see if we can confirm or reject the hypothesis that autistics commit murder more (or less) often than non-autistics. As you can imagine, there's no published data on the rate of murders committed by autistics. So do we give up and say we just don't know? Let us first determine if autistics are more or less likely to murder than to be murdered. (I realize it's not the same question, but I think it's an important preliminary question we should try to answer.) Consider this. The number of non-autistics who commit murder is roughly the same as the number of non-autistics who are murdered. If you discount mass murders and conspiracy murders, this is roughly correct. Is the same true of autistics? I will assume that both murders of autistics and murders committed by autistics are reported in the media with good and fairly equivalent frequency. I contend this is a reasonable assumption, though I admit I could be wrong.  I carried out a Google News archive search  of \"autism murder\" between 2008 and 2009. I'll just go over the first 3 pages of the search results (as I don't intend to spend days on this.) These are the persons accused of murder mentioned in the stories: Karen McCarron (non-autistic) Flower Nicole Tompson (non-autistic) Robert Napper (autistic) Xuan (Linda) Peng (non-autistic) John Odgren (autistic) A schoolboy  (non-autistic) Allen Grabe (non-autistic) Judith Leekin (non-autistic) Andrew Reid Lackey (autistic) Unnamed boy  (autistic) That's 6 non-autistics and 4 autistics who have been accused of murder according to the set of stories that was examined. It's close. I'd say we can't reject the null hypothesis here, but it's possible that autistics are slightly more likely to be murdered than to murder.  An obvious counter-point is that the carers of autistics might be more prone to murder than non-autistics in the general population, so the comparison does not tell us whether autistics are less violent than non-autistics, only that we are equally or less violent than non-autistic carers of autistics. However, if it is true that the stress related to caring for an autistic person tends to increase the murder rate by carers, wouldn't the same hold true about the stress experienced by the autistic persons who are cared for? Let's try to estimate what the rate of murder by autistics should be in the US, if autistics were just as prone to committing murder as non-autistics. There were 16,929 murders in the US in 2007 [ source ]. Using a conservative estimate of murderers who should be autistic (50 in 10,000), it would seem that about 85 murders should have been committed by autistics in 2007, by chance alone, without assuming autistics are more prone to murder. Clearly, 85 murders by autistics were not reported in the media in 2007, otherwise you'd see daily blog posts about it from people like Harold Doherty, John Best and Kim Stagliano. One probable reason why we don't see those reports is that autism is more than likely  underrecognized in adults . Is it possible autistics are less prone to murder than non-autistics? I wouldn't rule it out, but we just don't have enough evidence to say this.  Conclusion There is simply no evidence that autistics are more prone to committing murder than non-autistics. Such views are only supported by anecdotes and socially constructed  notions of autistic characteristics. A cursory look at available reports in the media does not support the claim that autistics are more violent than non-autistics.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/news_article.aspx?storyid=106831", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/02/autism-self-injury-and-aggression.html", "http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=autism+murder&btnG=Search+Archives&num=10&hl=en&as_user_ldate=2008&as_user_hdate=2009", "http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24260924-421,00.html", "http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Murder-accused-had--.4549602.jp", "http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/02/are-autistics-more-or-less-likely-to.html", "title": "\nAre Autistics More or Less Likely To Commit Murder?\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "body": "\nI've written a  theoretical critique  of H-P et al. and also  looked at the figures from the paper  to see if in fact the artifacts the paper does take into account cannot possibly explain the rise observed (as emphasized in the media by the primary author and other persons associated with the MIND Institute.)  In my first critique I basically skipped the section on Age of Diagnosis. I did not consider it the most important section, and the result (1.2-fold rise for the proportion of diagnoses by age 5) seemed plausible. The more I look at the paper, however, the more I come away thinking it's an exceedingly naive paper that got past peer review who knows how. So I decided it was probably a good idea to have a closer look at the section on Age of Diagnosis. As it turns out, that section is also wrong. Wrong Assumptions What the paper does is compare the proportion of diagnoses before age 5 in the 1990 vs. the 1996 birth year cohorts. It finds that the proportion increased by only 12% in the 1996 cohort. Then it extrapolates from this to 2002. (I'll look at the extrapolation method later.) That seems fine, right? You basically find out to what extent diagnoses by age 5 have changed, relative to  all diagnoses you might expect to have in the cohort .  Except that's not what the paper does, nor would it be able to do that. What the paper looks at is the proportion of diagnoses by age 5  relative to diagnoses by age 10 .  If there are few if any diagnoses after the age of 10, then that would work, correct? Intuitively, it seems reasonable that there wouldn't be too many diagnoses after the age of 10. But intuition and reality don't always agree. I knew that was an incorrect assumption because I've been looking at California DDS data for a number of years. (For example, see my post titled  The Epidemic of Autism... Among 18-21 Year Olds .) I have birth year data that California DDS provides on request (a file named  Job5028.zip .) Let's look at the number of autistic clients born in 1990 as reported at different times. In June, 1995 (approx. age 5): 404 In June, 2000 (approx. age 10): 663 In March, 2007 (approx. age 17): 918 Clearly, there is a non-trivial number of diagnoses after the age of 10. Of all the diagnoses by age 17, about 28% occur after the age of 10. There will no doubt be diagnoses after the age of 17 too.  Suppose things have changed since 1990. Perhaps in the 2002 birth year cohort close to 100% of California autistics are diagnosed before age 10. We can't know this, but if this were the case, I estimate that the impact of age of diagnosis would be about 1.6-fold and not 1.2-fold. With this, the total rise explained would get pushed over a factor of 5.  Of course, diagnoses after age 10 are confounded by changes in criteria. Some issues the paper has sort of compensate for one another, and this obviously makes it difficult or impossible to interpret the paper.  Wrong Math The statistical analysis of age of diagnosis in the paper consists of exactly the following. A shift toward younger age at diagnosis was clear but not huge: 12% more children were diagnosed before age 5 years in the 1996 birth cohort (the most recent with 10 years of follow-up) in comparison with those in the 1990 cohort. Extrapolation into the later birth cohorts (eg, 2002) would suggest a 24% rise in the proportion of diagnoses by age 5. Basically, they do a linear extrapolation: 12% for 1990-1996, then assume it's probably another 12% for 1996-2002, which gives a total of 24%. Is a linear extrapolation reasonable here? What if there's an acceleration in the age of diagnosis after 1996? It would be a good idea to look at the trend, wouldn't it? That's why I made the following graph of the proportion of clients at age 5 vs. those at age 10 for birth years 1990-1997.  You tell me, is a linear extrapolation reasonable there? There are also considerable random fluctuations in the series, so the authors should have calculated a confidence interval on the slope of the linear regression, which is easy to do.  Comment Let me recap. There appear to be major issues throughout the paper.  Age of Diagnosis - As noted, the assumption that there are few if any diagnoses after age 10 is mistaken, plus the statistical analysis is basically non-existent and naive.  Changes in Criteria - It gets its result from a single Finnish epidemiological study of a population of intellectually disabled children. Finland and California are not necessarily equivalent genetically and environmentally. The ascertainment methods are also not equivalent in the least.  Milder Cases - It assumes that only Asperger's and PDD-NOS would have been missed by a study such as the Finnish one. (There also seems to be a contradiction as to what California DDS says in regards to Asperger's and PDD-NOS, and what the authors believe, which probably needs clarification; the contradiction was noted by  Kev .) What's left? Awareness - Not considered at all, but noted in the paper as an artifact that should be evaluated later.  Diagnostic substitution - Not addressed at all. The authors probably assume that diagnostic substitution is subsumed by the other artifacts, but it's non-obvious that this would be the case. Migration - Dismissed in one paragraph as probably not having much of an impact. Access - There's discussion on access, but no statistical analysis of its impact at all. It's unclear why it's included in the paper.  Statistical Analysis - Basically non-existent. No ranges of statistical confidence are provided. The authors seem to be under the impression that because they are looking at whole population numbers, there's no room for uncertainty in their figures.  Claims about results - The paper claims that artifacts account for a 4.26-fold rise, which does not come close to explaining a 6.85-fold rise. How so? Furthermore, if they had used a 3.6-fold figure for the impact of criteria (a figure from a meta-study), the entire rise would have been explained.  OK. I've read papers having to do with autism epidemiology that are quite poor. For example, I've read several papers by the Geiers. Even so, I'm debating whether H-P et al. is the worst such paper I've ever come across.  In my view, the credibility of the MIND Institute and that of the authors has dropped a notch with this paper. Perhaps a big issue has been the way the paper was  described in the media. The language in the paper itself is somewhat skeptical in comparison. I think they need to think about the implications of being associated with something so naive, mistaken, and so poorly communicated to the public. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the authors decide to retract the paper at some point in the future. That's also something the editors of the journal  Epidemilogy  should think about.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SW3l4y3uxBI/AAAAAAAAAHs/6LAD305w4Lw/s1600-h/proportion-age5-diagnoses.JPG", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1771"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/01/age-of-diagnosis-analysis-is-also-wrong.html", "title": "\nThe Age of Diagnosis Analysis is Also Wrong\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 10, 2009", "body": "\nI  recently critiqued H-P et al. , a paper by the MIND Institute that claims the rise in autism cases in California cannot be fully explained by a number of factors like age of diagnosis, changes in diagnostic criteria, etc. What bothered me most about the paper is an apples-to-oranges comparison between California DDS ascertainment and a Finnish epidemiological study.  You wouldn't know it from the conclusions, but the researchers also admit that they didn't consider a factor that ought to be important in a database like that of California DDS: awareness.  What I want to discuss in this post is something else. It's interesting that the researchers don't mention how much of the rise in \"cumulative incidence by 5 years of age\" (prevalence at age 5 really) is explained by the factors they did consider, taken together. You have to do the calculation yourself. Let's take a look at the numbers, shall we? First, what's the extent of the rise? The conclusions of the paper say 7- to 8-fold. But the results from the abstract actually say the following. Cumulative incidence to 5 years of age per 10,000 births rose consistently from 6.2 for 1990 births to 42.5 for 2001 births. That's a 6.85-fold increase. Now, how much of this is explained by the factors the researchers considered? Quantitative analysis of the changes in diagnostic criteria, the inclusion of milder cases, and an earlier age at diagnosis during this period suggests that these factors probably contribute 2.2-, 1.56-, and 1.24-fold increases in autism, respectively, and hence cannot fully explain the magnitude of the rise in autism. If we multiply 2.2, 1.56 and 1.24, we get a 4.26-fold increase. That's not too bad. With all the problems the paper has, it actually explains 62% of the rise. It doesn't admit to that anywhere, but it does.  (If it's unintuitive why you have to multiply the factors, try the following mental exercise. Suppose the rise in \"full syndrome autism\" is 3-fold due to changes in criteria, and there currently are also 3 times as many autistics due to inclusion of Asperger's and PPD-NOS. Obviously, you have a 9-fold increase total.) The interesting aspect of this has to do with the 2.2-fold factor due to changes in diagnostic criteria. I say it's interesting, because the researchers choose this one number, based on a single Finnish study, in favor of the results of a meta-study, Williams et al. (2006).  A meta-analysis of 37 studies of autism prevalence found a 3.6-fold higher risk from DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria versus other criteria, but this figure would have been confounded by the year of study. I'm not sure what they mean by the year-of-study confound; they don't explain it. They could very well be right. I don't know. But just for kicks, let's see what would've happened if the researchers had chosen the 3.6-fold factor instead of the 2.2-fold factor. That is, we multiply 3.6, 1.56 and 1.24.  In this case, the study would explain a 6.96-fold rise. The actual rise was 6.85-fold. In other words, the study would have explained 102% of the rise. Does anyone else find that kind of suspect and hilarious at the same time?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/01/some-facts-of-interest-about-numbers.html", "title": "\nSome Facts of Interest About the Numbers From the MIND Institute Study\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 24, 2009", "body": "\nA common observation about the neurodiversity movement is that its vocal proponents are all \"high functioning.\" This is technically true. Consider the definition of \"high functioning\" used in research. Any individual who does not have mental retardation, i.e. anyone with an IQ of 70 or higher, is considered high functioning. Based on this definition, I believe all of the prominent proponents of neurodiversity or autistic rights are in fact high functioning. Whatever other challenges autistics who are part of the neurodiversity movement might have now or might have had in the past, critics can always fall back to complex written opinion and proclaim \"this person is obviously high functioning, intellectually.\" This observation is usually made as if it were a curious and surprising discovery. \"Of course they don't want a cure! Look at them, they are all high functioning!\" What is never mentioned is that all autistics who are vocal opponents of neurodiversity, and all autistics who write in length about the need for a cure, are also high functioning.  Is that also a curious discovery? Can we infer from this that only high functioning autistics would want a cure? Can we say that these high functioning individuals don't have a right to speak for all autistics? It's true, though. All the vocal pro-cure autistics I know of are clearly high functioning. Let's go through a short list. Jon Mitchell .- He's clearly high functioning, as he himself admits. Sue Rubin .-  She has written  about her being pro-cure. While she calls herself \"low functioning,\" she's mistaken about that. Her IQ is reportedly 133. Intellectually, she functions at a much higher level than most NTs.  Raun Kaufman .- He's so high functioning that he even claims to have turned into a non-autistic. (I realize he works for  his parents  the organization his parents founded  [corrected 2/27/2009]  and is apparently single in his late 30s or early 40s, but he obviously wants to market himself as non-autistic.) Thomas McKean .- I know of him from his article titled  A Danger in Speaking . He's clearly high functioning.  Then I've also heard of Asperger autistics who speak from time to time at rallies organized by the anti-vax autism community. Those autistics are clearly high functioning as well. So there you have it. Prominent anti-cure autistics are high functioning. But so are prominent pro-cure autistics. Is that surprising? Not in the least. Yet, it's used as an argument against anti-cure autistics  exclusively .  Anti-cure autistics, given they are high functioning, are told they should not speak for all autistics (even though there's no evidence that any of them claim to speak for all autistics.) Parents of autistic children, on the other hand, can apparently speak for all autistics (see Autism Speaks), even though the parents themselves are high functioning and non-autistic. That is, unless the parents are also autistic, in which case they again don't have a right to speak for all autistics.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html", "http://www.thomasamckean.com/articles/speaking.htm"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/02/all-autistics-who-oppose-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nAll Autistics Who Oppose Neurodiversity are High Functioning\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 08, 2009", "body": "\nThe MIND Institute has published a new study titled  The Rise in Autism and the Role of Age at Diagnosis  (hereby referred to as H-P et al.) Among its conclusions: \"Younger ages at diagnosis, differential migration, changes in diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases do not fully explain the observed increases.\" As you can imagine, the paper is being cited uncritically in the usual places.  I would like to discuss what it is the paper finds, how it finds it, and whether the findings are accurately characterized. Before I do that, however, I think some background is in order.  Back in 2002, a MIND Institute report to the California Legislature concluded basically the same thing: That a loosening of the criteria had not contributed to the rise in autism diagnoses in California. Back then the MIND Institute report was considered evidence of the \"autism epidemic.\" But it contained a significant error in reasoning, first noted in  Gernsbacher, Dawson & Goldsmith (2005) .  Basically, the 2002 report found that an earlier cohort of children met DSM-IV criteria at about the same rate as a more recent cohort of children. As Gernsbacher et al. patiently explain, it's not surprising that the more recent DSM-IV criteria is met by nearly all the children, the younger ones and the older ones. What would be more relevant to find out is whether the older children meet some narrower criteria that the younger children do not meet. Gernsbacher et al. illustrate the fallacy using a height analogy and call the researchers' conclusions \"imprudent.\"  There are two main areas of the new paper that I want to discuss: Changes in diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases (birth cohorts 1990-2006). The paper looks at other areas, but I'd like to focus on the two that are key.  Changes in diagnostic criteria Finding: Changes in diagnostic criteria have contributed a 2.2-fold increase in the rise of autism incidence in California.  How is this determined? This being the most important area of the paper, my expectation was that I would find new data produced by H-P et al. showing that only a 2.2-fold increase may result from changes in diagnostic criteria. This is not the case at all. H-P et al. rely on prior work. Specifically, they rely on Kielinen et al. (2000), a study out of Finland based on data \"collected from hospital records and the records of the central institutions for the intellectually disabled in the Provinces of Oulu and Lapland in 1996\u20131997.\" The 2.2-fold increase is the difference found by Kielinen et al. when comparing autistics diagnosed with Kanner's criteria vs. those diagnosed with ICD-10 or DSM-IV.  So what's wrong with this result? You need to ask yourself if the results from Kielinen et al. are applicable to changes in the California DDS autism population.  You see, even if we assume that all California autistics from the birth cohort 1990 were diagnosed with Kanner's criteria, why should we assume that all persons matching this criteria were identified and registered with California DDS? Isn't it more likely that only a small minority of such persons were recognized at the time? Furthermore, Kielinen et al. only look at the population with autism or other psychiatric conditions as recorded in known databases. California DDS has a much broader population pool to draw from, which would be more than relevant at the present time. Also note that the DSM-IV prevalence found by Kielinen et al. is low compared to that of other DSM-IV studies: 20.7 in 10,000.  In essence, I do not believe there is any basis for comparison of Finnish ascertainment done in a 2000 study vs. California DDS ascertainment, either in 1990 or in 2006. Inclusion of milder cases Finding: Inclusion of milder cases contributes a 1.5-fold increase in the rise of autism incidence in California.  How is the result determined? H-P et al. again rely on work from a separate study: The Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment study. In this study, 64% of  California cases were confirmed to meet criteria for autism (excluding Asperger's and PDD-NOS) when evaluated using two separate diagnostic instruments. I was initially confused as to why inclusion of \"milder\" cases is necessary to take into account, if the paper already claims to have looked at changes in diagnostic criteria. The reason is probably that Kielinen et al. would not have studied PPD-NOS or Asperger's cases.  So what's wrong with the result? If you're trying to account for cases that Kielinen et al. would have missed, I'm not sure that PDD-NOS and Asperger's are enough. What about high functioning autism in general? That's not the same thing.  There's also the question of why only \"milder\" cases should be considered. Why not more severe cases? Should we assume that Kielinen et al. would've detected all of those? Then there are cases that are neither more severe nor milder but just not diagnosed as autism traditionally. For example, would Kielinen et al. have recorded cases of autism in Down Syndrome or Cerebral Palsy, where California DDS obviously does? In the end, this particular result does not tell us much. What it says is that if you exclude all autistic children who should not be eligible for California DDS services, the impact on the number of cases is not too great. I could've told you that.  Did They Miss Anything? One question that comes to mind is why the researchers did not discuss diagnostic substitution, particularly from mental retardation.  Would this be part of the \"changes in diagnostic criteria\" analysis? Yes and no. To the extent that children previously diagnosed with mental retardation are currently diagnosed with autism because DSM-IV criteria says so, then yes, the analysis by H-P et al. would suffice (assuming that analysis were valid, which I don't believe it was). If there are reasons for the shift that go beyond criteria, then no, it is not enough.  Diagnostic substitution in California is interesting for other reasons. I think there's sufficient data there to do a proper analysis. For example, you can look at cases of mental retardation without autism over time and see if they decline. I have reason to believe such an analysis will be available in the near future.  Comment H-P et al. is a surprisingly poor paper. It does not produce any new data in order to support its two main results. It makes an apples-to-oranges comparison between a Finnish epidemiological study and California DDS ascertainment over time. It tells us the obvious about \"milder\" cases. In the end, I don't think this is an improvement over the 2002 MIND Institute report to the California Legislature. In fact, it could very well be worse.  The way H-P et al. have gone about trying to show there's a real rise in autism incidence over time is not a very good way to go about doing things, in my view. There are other ways. For example, I've suggested trying to replicate Lotter (1967) in detail. This would not be as easily challenged.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.epidem.com/pt/re/epidemiology/abstract.00001648-200901000-00016.htm;jsessionid=JmFQypc4rvZSdrt5c1wzmnzF88zYLzGXpmcn1y5hKpXqxvs96G1L!-482373940!181195629!8091!-1", "http://www.autcom.org/pdf/Epidemic.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/01/mind-institutes-second-attempt-more-of.html", "title": "\nThe MIND Institute's Second Attempt: More of the Same Type of Reasoning\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 11, 2008", "body": "\nBack in September there was some noise about a post by someone I'll call \"Scientist Mom\" (apparently she doesn't use a pseudonym at all) titled  The Correlation that Does Indicate Causation . I didn't want to even read the post back then because I had a feeling I would become involved in analyzing the data and spend way too much time that I was supposed to spend doing something else. The obvious critique of such an analysis, without knowing much about it, is that it was a  pirates vs. global-warming  type of correlation.  Orac slammed Scientist Mom for it , and rightly so.  In my last post on the  (lack of) association between rainfall and autism  I had used birth-year data from California. I thought a natural extension of that work was to apply a detrended cross-correlation analysis to the caseload data and Scientist Mom's vaccine data. Well, to my disappointment, the post doesn't provide any usable vaccine data. It's more of a qualitative analysis, where Scientist Mom just lists vaccines that were recommended  during different time periods.  I noticed a significant error in the analysis, however. It has to do with Scientist Mom's key claim: Most compelling of all, there was no increase in the percentage of autism cases in 2002-2004, when no vaccines were added to the childhood schedule. I wonder if the error is obvious to some of my readers. If I mention \"left censorship\" as a hint, do you see the problem now? What if I mention that in my  last post  I decided to left-censor California birth-year autism caseload such that I only used data up to 2000? You see, autism prevalence by birth year series always have a hook shape on the right hand side of the graph. It doesn't matter if I survey the prevalence in 2004 or 1994. They always do. The following is an IDEA graph representing prevalence by birth year, as reported in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Not only is there a natural decline in prevalence by birth year because some autistics are diagnosed late; it's also the case that prevalence by birth year data is not fixed in time. If we request new data from Califonia DDS next year, the data potentially changes in all birth years, and it likely changes considerably in recent birth years.  This is a common mistake.  Mark Blaxill  has fallen for it.  The Geiers  have as well, assuming they didn't know what they were doing.  One way to solve the issue is to left-censor the data. Basically, you only consider the birth year data that is more likely to remain stable in the future.  I believe a much better way to solve the issue (although this is not always feasible) is to use data on prevalence by a given age in a given year, e.g. prevalence of 3 year olds in the system in a given year. This data shouldn't change with time. This is the type of data that was used when there was a debate over the expected decline in the California DDS 3-5 caseload. And as you may recall, the 3-5 prevalence continued to increase. Since California DDS provides birth year data as reported in different years, we can   estimate the caseload of autistic 3 year olds from, say, 2000 to 2007. You basically look at each of the 32 files (8 years times 4 quarters) for the years we're interested in, and get the birth-year caseload of the report year minus 3. The resulting graph follows.  This is an approximation, of course. Consider that on 03/2002, the number of children born in 1999 will not be as many as you'll have in 12/2002. Hence the seesaw pattern.  The point is that Scientist Mom is mistaken in her finding that the prevalence of autism dropped or was stable after 2002. This completely undermines her analysis, since that was her key claim.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://vaccines-rvb.blogspot.com/2008/09/correlation-that-does-indicate_14.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/what_were_up_against_aluminum_as_the_new.php", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRmyxFePM4I/AAAAAAAAAHc/m78LmgqjdxY/s1600-h/ideabybirthyear.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRnCyvHyWVI/AAAAAAAAAHk/Q0VB_vXI7lw/s1600-h/3yoapproximatecaseload2000-2007.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2008/11/error-in-scientist-moms-vaccine-autism.html", "title": "\nError in Scientist Mom's Vaccine & Autism Data Analysis\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 06, 2008", "body": "\nIn the  last post  I attempted to confirm if there was a naive ecological state-level association between precipitation and IDEA autism prevalence. To my surprise, there wasn't, and there was no need to control for urbanicity.  Technically what the result means is that, just considering this one analysis, we can't reject the null hypothesis. Of course, one could argue that state-level data is poor. The confidence interval is too big, and a real effect could easily hide in it. (In part this is what \"not being able to prove a negative\" means). So I couldn't leave it at that. I wanted to confirm it in some other way. I remembered I had birth-year caseload data from California DDS dating back to 1920 (contiguous since 1930) that David Kirby had originally requested, and a copy of which I had obtained in order to  rebutt one of his posts . This is data from a file called  AUT_200703.xls  contained in  Job5028.zip ,  which may be requested from California DDS. Corresponding  precipitation data  is not difficult to obtain.  The year range I will use is 1930 to 2000. (I'm left-censoring autism caseload starting at 2000). For precipitation we have to assume some sort of a lag. I will use precipitation at 1 year of age. The autism and precipitation time series follow.  The time series in themselves don't look very promising, do they? But I wanted to apply some math to them in order to confirm if there's at least a trend, even if not a statistically significant one.  Whenever you compare two time series, there's always a possibility that you'll end up with a  pirates vs. global-warming  type of association. There are different ways to control for this. One that I particularly like is called  detrended cross-correlation analysis  ( Podobnik & Stanley, 2008 ). Basically, you remove the trends from the series, and then compare them. The reason I like this technique is that it's intuitive, can be illustrated graphically, and is easy for anyone with passing knowledge of Excel formula syntax to reproduce.  Now, one problem is that there isn't something we can call  the trend of the time series . There are many different ways to model trends. What we should ideally do is try many different types of trends, e.g. linear, quadratic, and cubic. For simplicity I will skip the linear and quadratic trends (they don't look adequate) and use cubic trend lines, which you can see in the graph above.  The following graph represents the cubic detrending of the original time series.  At this point we can just put the detrended data points in a scatter chart and see if there's an association.  This is the kind of scatter you'd expect to see if you compare two completely independent random variables. That is, you see a random distribution of dots and a linear regression slope that is almost completely horizontal.  Of course, we're still left with the problem of not being able to prove a negative. The slope of the linear regression is 0.11 (0.11 more California autistics for every extra inch of rain in a year) with 95% confidence interval of -3.896 to 4.133.  But I think the scatter graph is compelling. What we see in it is entirely consistent with a complete lack of association between autism and precipitation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=646", "http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/cag3/ca.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRMaRjccavI/AAAAAAAAAHE/MHkJadEsqLk/s1600-h/autismprecipitation.JPG", "http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=20081611", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRMe8NiOugI/AAAAAAAAAHM/yZktG6R9UFk/s1600-h/cubicdetrendingautismprecipitation.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRMgB6sGV-I/AAAAAAAAAHU/h-pUlyW-o8A/s1600-h/scatterdetrendedautismprecipitation.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2008/11/is-precipitation-associated-with-autism_06.html", "title": "\nIs Precipitation Associated with Autism?

{"date": "Wednesday, November 05, 2008", "body": "\nA while back I wrote a  critique of the TV hypothesis  by Waldman et al. I noted the likely confound is population density, which should not be considered a \"fixed effect\" in Waldman's methodology (an interesting statistical methodology that is apparently used in Economics frequently). When we talk about population density as a confound, we're really using it as a proxy of other confounds that are clearly not fixed in time. These more specific  confounds could be things like awareness, availability of autism specialists, etc.  In general, studies like Waldman's and Palmer's likely suffer from the fundamentally incorrect assumption that regional differences in the administrative prevalence of autism reflect a real difference in actual prevalence. But I do believe it is possible to use administrative data to draw preliminary conclusions, so long as confounding factors are accounted for.  My intention in writing this post was to walk through an analysis of publicly available data, controlling for population density, to see if the rainfall effect remained. I fully expected there to be a naive ecological association between precipitation and autism. To my surprise, the effect didn't appear to exist in the first place at the US level, and there was no need to control for confounding.  The following is a scatter graph of  annual precipitation by state (1971-2000)  vs. the 3-5 IDEA prevalence of autism (estimated for 2006).  There's not even a trend in the expected direction. This is quite the head-scratcher, and it left me wondering what was going on. Why is it unexpected? Let's first look at a population density map of the US.  It would be reasonable to expect that counties with a higher concentration of people will have higher rates of autism diagnoses, due to increased awareness and a greater  availability of autism specialists. Let's now look at a map of precipitation in the US.  The correlation between precipitation and population density is quite clear, isn't it? Why didn't we see an  association trend in the expected direction in the scatter graph then? First, it seems that a few states bring the slope down. These would be states with a low autism prevalence but high precipitation rates, like Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. That's a bit of bad luck for Waldman et al. Additionally, we don't have that many data points. There's unfortunately too much variability in this US-level data, which makes it pretty inadequate. Perhaps using 6-11 IDEA prevalence would be better than 3-5 prevalence. In any case, it's doubtful statistical significance would be achieved, and even if it were, it is doubtful it could withstand controlling for population density.  I think the association needs to be revisited in a different way. But this exercise left me wondering why Waldman et al. decided to only look at counties from certain states, namely, California, Oregon and Washington (with California not showing a clear association).  I'm going to suggest cherry-picking might have occurred when it comes to Oregon and Washington. In order to argue this point, I will simply post population density and precipitation maps of each of these states. You will see that the pattern in these two states is fairly unique. Most people live in the west side of the state, and that's also where it rains.  To summarize: (1) It was not easy to confirm the reported association. (2) Analysis of any such associations should account for population density. (3) Cherry-picking might have occurred in this particular case.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/USclimate/pcp.state.19712000.climo", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRG48BTmBiI/AAAAAAAAAGM/QgjzDl134R4/s1600-h/precipitation-autism-naive.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRG63UX9-vI/AAAAAAAAAGU/yM7Vz4H0mI4/s1600-h/uspopdensitymap.gif", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRG8uDRoWqI/AAAAAAAAAGc/OjL9803A7PY/s1600-h/usprecipitationmap.gif", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRHDdCYXYVI/AAAAAAAAAGk/6InvCDbmteE/s1600-h/oregonpopdensity.png", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRHE0dY29CI/AAAAAAAAAGs/Vu_FYAKi_Ho/s1600-h/oregonprecipitation.gif", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRHFfjrbybI/AAAAAAAAAG0/LUvzAvowMPA/s1600-h/washingtonpopdensity.gif", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SRHG5tnKL9I/AAAAAAAAAG8/JsPetHhCEbQ/s1600-h/washingtonprecipitation.gif"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2008/11/is-precipitation-associated-with-autism.html", "title": "\nIs Precipitation Associated with Autism?

{"date": "Friday, June 20, 2008", "body": "\n[Reposted at  Residual Analysis .] I need to ask for the reader's indulgence, as this post is not about autism, except insofar as determining the merit of correlations has become a perseveration of mine. You see, it is trivial to come up with naive correlations of autism trends vs. practically anything about the modern world. The administrative prevalence of autism has been increasing almost always since records have been kept. Concurrent upward trends of nearly anything, from vaccines to environmental pollution, from trans fats to electromagnetic radiation, and so on,  are easy to come by. In  my latest post at LB/RB  I suggested that instead of correlating trends in a naive manner, we could attempt to correlate the  residuals  of time regression models of each trend. A residual is a  delta  or difference between an observed value and a modeled value. ( Here's a concise explanation ). When modeling real world phenomena, regression models will never (or almost never) be perfect fits. For all sorts of reasons, even if simply random fluctuation, there will be deviations from a modeled trend. If there's a causative relationship between two trends, the residuals of (or deviations from) corresponding close-fitting regression models should correlate with one another as well. By this I don't mean that the residuals should always be in the same direction; but they should be in the same direction more often than not, in average. The nice thing about this technique is that it is completely accessible to anyone with Excel installed. It can also be illustrated graphically, as the reader will see. So it occurred to me to test this idea in a different field of science where there's controversy over correlation vs. causation. I thought global warming would be a great candidate. After all, the spoof about a decrease in the number of pirates correlating with many other arbitrary trends appears to originate in the global warming debate (see  this ). To summarize what I found, there is a strong and statistically significant correlation between cumulative human CO 2  emissions and northern hemisphere temperature anomalies.  Because of the methodology used, I'm quite confident this cannot be explained by coincidence, data collection errors, solar output as a confound, or causation in the opposite direction . Now, I fully recognize that I'm only superficially familiar with the debate over anthropogenic global warming. I am also not versed in climatology. Therefore, I cannot be entirely sure that this type of analysis hasn't been done before. Google and Google Scholar searches didn't seem to turn up anything, and given the importance of the topic, I thought it was not only prudent but necessary to put this evidence out there. As always, scrutiny and discussion are welcome. Northern hemisphere temperature data from 1850 to 2004 was obtained from the  Climatic Research Unit  of the University of East Anglia, UK. Global CO 2  emission data was obtained from  CDIAC . I did not use CO 2  atmospheric concentration data because temperature increases can theoretically cause  this concentration to increase. Human emissions are what we're interested in. More specifically, I calculated  cumulative  CO 2  emissions for every year since 1850. Greenhouse temperature anomalies are presumably caused by the total amount of CO 2  in the atmosphere, not by the emissions in any given year. Since CO 2  stays in the atmosphere for 50 to 200 years ( source )  modeling the cumulative human contribution of CO 2  should be adequate enough. Figure 1 (click to enlarge) is a graph of the general time trends of these two sets of data. It also shows the modeled trend lines we will use to calculate residuals. In this analysis we're using third-order polynomial models. They seem to give a considerably closer fit than second-order polynomial models.  I calculated the residuals and built a scatter graph matching cumulative CO 2  (X axis) and temperature (Y axis) residuals for each year from 1850 to 2004. As expected, the slope of a linear regression of the scatter was positive (1.9x10 -5 ) and statistically significant (95% confidence interval 1.13x10 -5  to 2.66x10 -5 ). [Note: Instructions on how to calculate the slope confidence interval of a linear regression with Excel can be found  here .] I suspected, however, that there should be lag between cumulative CO 2  fluctuations and temperature fluctuations. It presumably takes some time for heat to be trapped. I proceeded to create a moving average trend line of the temperature residuals. It did in fact have a similar shape to the cumulative CO 2  residuals graph, but it appeared to lag it by about 10 years. The reader should be able to roughly see this lag in Figure 1.  So I re-ran the whole analysis by only considering the years 1850 to 1997 and correlating CO 2  residuals with residuals of temperature  10 years later . The correlation between these two sets of data is remarkable. Let's start with a bar graph of both sets of residuals, Figure 2. Figure 2 is a good graph to get a subjective sense of the correlation. Let's see if the math confirms this. Figure 3 is the scatter graph of the residuals.  The slope of a linear regression of the scatter is 2.6x10 -5 , and it is statistically significant (95% confidence interval 1.88x10 -5  to 3.33x10 -5 ). Even the 99.99999999% confidence interval is entirely positive.  Unless anthropogenic global warming is a reality, there is no apparent reason why the residuals of cumulative human CO 2  emissions should correlate so well with the residuals of temperature  10 years later  throughout the last 150 years . The slope of the scatter is actually more steep than expected, if you consider the naive correlation between cumulative CO 2  emissions and temperature. There are probably several reasons for this. The one I believe to be the most likely is that over time CO 2  does get removed from the atmosphere. Adding this consideration to the analysis should produce a more accurate slope. The other potential reasons don't bode so well for our species.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://residualanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/06/anthropogenic-global-warming-is.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=878", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics", "http://mathbits.com/mathbits/tisection/Statistics2/LeastSquares.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Pirates_and_global_warming", "http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/crutem3nh.txt", "http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm", "http://environmentaldefenseblogs.org/climate411/2008/02/26/ghg_lifetimes/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SF0L7SzSjbI/AAAAAAAAABI/B6TLtXJI1Fs/s1600-h/co2-temp-trends.JPG", "http://people.stfx.ca/bliengme/ExcelTips/RegressionSlopeConfidence.htm", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SF0X3q79v4I/AAAAAAAAABQ/XbH6nwH0EGQ/s1600-h/residuals-bar-co2-temp-plus10.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/SF0bkJrixkI/AAAAAAAAABo/r8W06MCSHb0/s1600-h/residuals-scatter-co2-temp-plus10.JPG"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2008/06/anthropogenic-global-warming-is.html", "title": "\nAnthropogenic Global Warming is Absolutely Occurring\n"},

I was reminded of it by a recent  David Kirby post  where he informs us that \"an unusually large proportion of Somali-speaking children in Minnesota have autism.\" I suppose David Kirby is trying to make this about vaccines. The thing is that a link between autism and immigration has been suspected since at least the 1970s, even though it apparently never became an area of research that interested many investigators. Let me just quote from some abstracts, in chronological order.  Harper & Williams (1976) : \"In a survey on the occurrence of infantile autism in New South Wales it was found that 21-9% of children had at least one foreign-born parent whose native language was not English.\" Gillberg et al. (1987) : \"Urban children with autism more often than age-matched children in the general population had immigrant parents from 'exotic' countries.\" Gillberg  et al. (1995) : \"The prevalence for autistic disorder in G\u00f6teborg children born to mothers who were born in Uganda was 15% which is almost 200 times higher than in the general population of children.\" Gillberg & Gillberg (1996) : \"Fifteen of these children (27%) were born to parents, at least one of whom had migrated to Sweden.\" Bernard-Opitz  et al. (2001) : \"Discussion focuses on possible risk factors and psychosocial adversities for autism such as a high frequency of caregivers who are foreign maids, the use of multiple languages and the high level of punitive educational practices.\" Lauritsen  et al. (2005) : \"An increased relative risk of 1.4 was found if the mother was born outside Europe, and in children of parents who were born in different countries.\" Maimburg and Vaeth (2006) : \"The risk of infantile autism was increased for mothers aged >35 years, with foreign citizenship, and mothers who used medicine during pregnancy.\" Kolevzon  et al. (2007) : \"The parental characteristics associated with an increased risk of autism and autism spectrum disorders included advanced maternal age, advanced paternal age, and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America.\" There are reports along these lines  from Canada  as well. In fact, this was discussed in  Interverbal's  discussion of critiques of Fombonne et al. (2006) . Now, the first thing we need to ask ourselves about these findings is whether they document an actual phenomenon or an artifact. Is there a confound that explains the apparent association? But if in fact there's an association, what explains it? We don't really know. You will find some unsubstantiated speculation based on old ideas in the cited abstracts, some speculation that I'm sure many readers will find objectionable. It's not surprising to find these types of explanations in old papers, though. If I may engage in some speculation of my own, based on newer ideas, I would say that maternal stress during gestation \u2013 see  Kinney et al. (2008)  \u2013 cannot be discounted.  Finally, I'd like to bring attention to  Roberts et al. (2007) , a study claiming to associate autism with proximity to agricultural pesticide applications in the California Central Valley. The authors stated that they could not dismiss the possibility that the women studied may be disproportionately employed in agriculture. It just so happens that immigrant women also tend to be  disproportionately employed in agriculture.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/is-autism-an-american-dis_b_114776.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1272099?ordinalpos=8&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3651741?ordinalpos=7&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7787384?ordinalpos=6&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8930054?ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11302459?ordinalpos=17&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16108999?ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968363?ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17404128?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/06/06/autism-immigrants.html", "http://interverbal.blogspot.com/2007/03/review-of-critiques-of-fombonne-et-al.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17619130?ordinalpos=6&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10168/10168.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2008/07/are-children-of-first-generation.html", "title": "\nAre the children of first-generation immigrants more likely to be autistic?\n"},

In the comments section of Orac's post, the question came up as to David Kirby's and Dan Olmsted's source of income. I think this is a legitimate question. After all, they do not appear to be employed by any major media. They are not parents of autistic children. They are not autistic. So are we to assume they write about autism because of their love of journalism? It doesn't seem plausible to me, and unlike Shoemaker's apparent suspicions regarding Kathleen, it's not necessary to invoke major conspiracy theories to conclude that Kirby and Olmsted must be payed by an organization with significant funds. I believe it would be of interest to find out whether, as some have suggested, David Kirby and/or Dan Olmsted are receiving money from parties with a stake in vaccine litigation. Of course, neither Kirby nor Olmsted have an obligation to disclose this. No one is going to drag them to court to force them to disclose how they make a living; at least I sincerely hope not.

METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial was used to evaluate the effects of a six-week strength-training program on self-concept immediately after completion of the program (week six) and at a follow-up session held 18 weeks after the initial assessment. Seventeen children [eight boys, nine girls; mean age 12.1 years (SD 2.5)] with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were recruited. Participants in the experimental group completed a home-based progressive resistance strength-training program using three exercises to strengthen the major support muscles of the lower limb. Participants in the control group undertook their normal daily activities. Self-concept was measured by the Self-Perception Profile for Children. RESULTS: Overall, the self-concept of both groups was positive at baseline and at six and 18 weeks. However, compared with controls, the experimental group showed decreased self-concept in the domain of scholastic competence and a trend for a decrease in social acceptance at six weeks. At follow-up, the experimental group had reduced self-concept in the domains of scholastic competence and social acceptance compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: These unexpected results suggest that participation in a relatively short home-based strength-training program may have an inhibitory effect on the self-concept of children with cerebral palsy. Despite the inhibitory effect, self-concept in the experimental group remained positive after strength training, suggesting that clinicians should not be overly concerned about the psychological effects of the intervention. I believe this study has implications of note on the kinds of outcome measures that should be considered in disability treatment trials. Effectiveness is obviously not the only consideration that matters.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=PubMed&Cmd=Search&Term=%22Dodd%20KJ%22%5BAuthor%5D&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVCitation", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=PubMed&Cmd=Search&Term=%22Taylor%20NF%22%5BAuthor%5D&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVCitation", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=PubMed&Cmd=Search&Term=%22Graham%20HK%22%5BAuthor%5D&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVCitation", "mailto:K.Dodd@latrobe.edu.au"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/11/impact-of-treatment-on-self-concept.html", "title": "\nImpact of Treatment on Self-Concept\n"},

And that is this:  Clifford Shoemaker  is a dick-face. In my opinion, that is. Now let's go over select opinions on the matter around the blogsphere. Pooflingers Anonymous in  Another Day, Another Gasket... For shitbag lawyer Clifford Shoemaker: grow the fuck up and stop being a fucking thug... or eat a big, steaming pile of my favorite dish. I prefer \"grow up\", but it's your damned choice. Letting Off Steam in  We Are  All Kathleen Seidel Obviously the American anti-vaccination brigade cannot abide the fact that their arguments are being countered anywhere at all and are seeking to tie Ms Siedel up in legal knots. Rev. BigDumbChimp in   Anti-Vaccination Parents stoop to new lows As many around the blogosphere have noted, there doesn't seem to be any supportable reason for this subpoena other than being a fishing expedition to try and flush out some paranoid fantasy of the Sykes that Ms. Siedel is an agent of Big Pharma or the government and/or to try and intimidate her into silence. Pharyngula in  Attempted suppression of Seidel My sympathy is limited, however, by the fact that are lashing out seeking to blame someone, have bought into the thimerosal hysteria, have hired a bottom-feeding shyster to sue various pharmaceutical companies, and said unethical ambulance-chaser is now using the power of the subpoena to harrass and intimidate bloggers who aren't at all involved in the case, but have simply written about the absence of a thimerosal-autism link. Whose Planet is it Anyway? in   Clifford J. Shoemaker and Lisa Sykes: Putrid Lawyering The next thing you know, they'll be wanting us to appear personally in court to prove that we don't have green tentacles. (Note to self: after returning from secret meeting aboard flying saucer, inspect blog sidebar picture carefully to make sure all tentacles have been completely edited out.) Popehat in   Vaccine-Litigant Thuggery: Subpoenaed For Blogging Mr. Shoemaker, shame on you. You bullying is contemptible, and if there is any justice in this situation, you will get your critic-intimidating, oversensitive ass handed to you in the motion to quash. The Voyage in  Neurodiversity Blogger Unfairly Subpoenaed Why would they want a judge (or whomever is responsible for deciding on these matters) to read all of Kathleen's work which shows their claim for what it truly is. She also details Sykes' involvement in the Griers IRB which approved their \"research\" on chemical castration agent, Lupron, as one of the cornucopia of supposed treatments foisted on autistic children, among them, the son of Rev. Sykes. Crux of the Matter in  Blogger on autism hit with subpoena Given this incident, however, I would have to say there appears to be more to this whole anti-vaccine matter than meets the eye.  In fact, all the subpoena has done is question the motivation behind the intimidation directed at Seidel personally. I mean, requesting personal bank records is way over the top. While I don\u2019t necessarily agree with Seidel\u2019s point of view on all matters, she does bring up some excellent points and I recommend readers take the time to read some of her writings. Pure Pedantry in  Autism cranks attempt to intimidate blogger by subpoena However, if you are determined to advocate that point of view, let me advise against acting like malicious thugs. That is exactly what this is. It is a flagrant attempt to silence free speech. It is a flagrant attempt to silence the free press. It is a flagrant attempt to silence good science with fear and litigation. GM/WM in  Evidence of Slime Shoemaker and Sykes (if I understand the subpoena correctly) are trying to figure out if Kathleen is being led around by and paid by shadowy figures who feed her information and direct her to persecute Lisa Sykes for her religion and parenting skills or something. Autista in  Rediculous If the judge allows the subpoena, then no one will be able to blog freely on any subject. We will all be afraid that everything from our tax returns to our church attendance will be on trial if someone launches a civil action that has some connection to the topic we are discussing. Law And More in  Olson's Trumpet - Blogosphere Unites Behind Kathleen Seidel This is the most important legal and ethical story in the blogosphere since DrudgeReport.com outed Monicagate. Hourly, we are checking in on the latest developments.  Respectful Insolence in  More legal thuggery, this time against Neurodiversity.com A common characteristic of cranks and denialists, be they antivaccinationists or large corporations or whatever, is an intolerance of criticism for their views. All too frequently, this has taken the form of the abuse of the legal system in order to try to silence their opponents... Mr. Shoemaker is a despicable scum-sucking piece of excrement. Overlawyered in  Vaccine lawyer subpoenas Kathleen Seidel Instead, the first phrase that occurred to me on looking through the subpoena was \"fishing expedition\", and the second was \"intimidation\". Several clauses indicate that Shoemaker is hoping to turn up evidence that Seidel has accepted support from the federal government, or from vaccine makers, which she says she hasn't. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/150/", "http://pooflingers.blogspot.com/2008/04/another-day-another-gasket.html", "http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2008/04/04/we-are-all-kathleen-siedel/", "http://bigdumbchimp.blogspot.com/2008/04/anti-vaccination-parents-stoop-to-new.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/attempted_suppression_of_seide.php", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/04/clifford-j-shoemaker-and-lisa-sykes.html", "http://www.newpopehat.dreamhosters.com/2008/04/04/vaccine-litigant-thuggery-subpoenaed-for-blogging/", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/04/neurodiversity-blogger-unfairly.html", "http://www.crux-of-the-matter.com/2008/04/03/blogger-on-autism-hit-with-subpoena/", "http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/04/autism_cranks_attempt_to_intim.php", "http://gmwm.autistics.org/?p=190", "http://aoskoli.blogspot.com/2008/04/rediculous.html", "http://lawandmore.typepad.com/law_and_more/2008/04/olsons-trumpet.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/more_legal_thuggery_this_time_against_ne.php", "http://www.overlawyered.com/2008/04/vaccine-lawyer-subpoenas-kathl.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2008/04/clifford-shoemaker-what-dick-plus-other.html", "title": "\nClifford Shoemaker, What a Dick, Plus Other Views\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2007", "body": "\nMatthew Israel of the Judge Rotenberg Center has been posting a  link  to his response to Jennifer Gonnerman's article  titled \"School of Shock.\" This is a rebuttal of said response. Every surgical, dental or medical treatment involves discomfort, risks or costs on the one hand, and expected benefits on the other. For most persons a reasonable approach is to weigh the discomfort/risks/costs against the potential benefits in deciding whether to undergo or approve the treatment. There's a clear difference between the JRC's \"treatment\" and surgical, dental or medical treatment. First of all, infliction of pain is not a means to an end in any of the analogies mentioned. Pain is simply a side-effect of the treatment. Furthermore, in each of these cases, measures are taken to reduce discomfort. That's what anasthesia is for! So the analogy is poor.  I'm leaving aside whether the behaviors \"treated\" are true medical conditions in all cases, and whether the \"treatment\" itself is medical. In the case of certain treatments, however, there are some persons who, for religious or philosophical reasons, are unwilling to weigh the negative aspects of those treatments against the potential benefits. These persons view the treatment in question as Wrong with a capital \u201cW\u201d, regardless of the potential benefits the treatment might produce. For example, Christian Scientists oppose the use of medical interventions, and Scientologists oppose the use of psychiatric drugs, regardless of what potential benefits may ensue. What is this irrelevant nonsense? I'm picturing an immate of the JRC objecting to being tortured for \"philosophical reasons.\" Is he serious? Opponents of behavior modification treatment that involves aversives(sometimes referred to as \u201caversive therapy\u201d) are similarly unwilling to weigh the discomfort, risks or costs associated with aversives against the potential benefits\u2014even when those benefits could be lifesaving, life-improving or life-extending. Such persons prefer to brand aversives as \u201cWrong,\u201d refusing to recognize them as part of a relatively new behavior modification treatment procedure2, and many of them sometimes do whatever they can to prevent anyone else from using them. It is clear from Ms. Gonnerman\u2019s article that she is one of those persons. Here I'm going to have to say that Mr. Israel is using \"aversives\" as a euphemism for torture. At a different time we can discuss \"aversives\" as they are used in behavior modification. For example, Lovaas recommends slapping a child on the rear and yelling \"No!\" Many of us find this in itself objectionable, but I don't think this is what we're talking about right now. Torture is defined as \"any act by which  severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,  punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on  discrimination of any kind , when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\" (Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1987). Allowing the Judge Rotenberg Center to exist would appear to be in violation of international law under this definition. If the JRC immates were Al-Qaeda terrorists instead of the developmentally disabled, I'm sure Amnesty International would be on the case sooner than you could say \"Abu Ghraib.\" Ms. Gonnerman is so intent on indicting the Judge Rotenberg Center (\u201cJRC\u201d), the only special needs school in the country that offers this form of therapy, that she violates the normal journalistic ethics of presenting both sides of a controversial issue. Out of a total of 265 column inches that her article occupies, only 15 inches (6% percent of the article) present any of the benefits of JRC\u2019s treatment. Even those few accounts of parents (characterized as \u201cdesperate parents\u201d) or students who speak positively about JRC are presented with snide comments, disparaged by unfavorable observations or reported in the least favorable light possible. Here Mr. Israel is making the common mistake of confusing journalistic balance with \"equal time.\" This is actually a big problem in science reporting, where fringe ideas are often portrayed as being on equal footing with accepted and tested theories ( source ). Summary Matthew Israel's response to \"School of Shock\" contains several false analogies and demonstrates a lack of understanding of certain concepts. Hence, it adds little value to any discussion about the need to stop torturing people. Perhaps if we were to strap one of those JRC backpacks to Mr. Israel, and we were to administer a shock every time he comes up with a response of this quality, such responses might improve in time. (I'm of course not serious about that last part.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2007/10/28/judge-rotenberg-center-close-it-down#comment-26530", "http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2004/6/mooney-science.asp"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/rebuttal-of-israels-response-to-school.html", "title": "\nRebuttal of Israel's Response to \"School of Shock\"\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 03, 2007", "body": "\nThe other day Harold Doherty wrote a post where he proclaimed that science had demonstrated that what are called high functioning and low functioning autism are different entities. I believe this highlights a basic misunderstanding of the criticism of the validity of the low vs. high functioning labels. No one has ever claimed that those classifed as low functioning are biologically exactly the same as those classified as high functioning. In fact, I'm not surprised at all that neurological differences would be found when you make group comparisons of this nature. I would expect the same to be true when you compare almost any two behavioral phenotypes. (I also questioned Harold's view that Jenny McCarthy could yet be proven correct, in light of the neurological findings whose significance he was endorsing, but that's neither here nor there.) I believe a similar misunderstanding occurs when I speak of autism as a  cultural construct . This seems to be taken as \"autism does not exist\" or \"autism is basically the same as normality\" which is not at all what that means. The main technical criticism of the low vs. high functioning classifications, in my view, is that they are inconsistent. Sometimes autistic disoder means \"low functioning\" whereas Asperger's means \"high functioning.\" It's not clear where PDD-NOS is. Other times, high IQ means \"high functioning\" whereas mental retardation means \"low functioning.\" Then again, lack of speech could mean \"low functioning\" while having good speech indicates \"high functioning.\" Some like Harold would seem to want to redefine \"low functioning\" to be associated with behaviors such as self-injury. None of these different ways to separate low from high functioning -  none  - are consistent with one another. There are also critiques of the classification from the perspective of disability rights.  Joel discussed this  recently.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=271"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/11/quick-note-about-low-vs-high.html", "title": "\nQuick Note About Low vs. High Functioning\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 27, 2007", "body": "\nBack in June, 2006, Dateline NBC did a story titled  The unorthodox practice of chelation  which was primarily about a small double-blind trial on chelation therapy that Jim Adams and colleagues had designed. The following is an excerpt of the interview where Dr. Adams is asked about publishing potential negative results of the trial. John Larson : What happens in the end, after all this hard work? If you find that there really is no relation between mercury and autistic behavior. Will you be disappointed? Jim Adams : Disappointed, yes. But whatever way it turns out, we\u2019ll report it. If it doesn\u2019t help, we\u2019ll report it. And if it does, we\u2019re gonna report that, too. When were the results expected? End of 2006. Jim Adams predicts he'll have the final results of his study by the end of the year, and we'll have them first, here on Dateline. Whatever flaws the trial might have had, it is worrisome that this much time has elapsed since the results were supposed to be made available either to the media or in the form of a paper. I don't know the reasons for the delay. Maybe there are valid justifications, maybe there aren't. D'oC over at  Autism Street  already discussed the delay back in June. There are surely ethical questions as to whether such a trial should be done in the first place. But it seems to me that more serious ethical questions are raised by a failure to publish results. Why do I say this? First, there's a general issue of scientific ethics. Imagine what would happen if researchers had the habit of sitting on results they don't like. The literature would be filled with self-selected results and random noise beyond what would be expected by mere chance. Second, suppose the study had found there are therapeutic effects to chelation therapy. It would appear to me that the sooner the results are published, the sooner bigger and better replications of the study could be carried out to identify responders, and the sooner children could be treated. Third, suppose the study determined there are adverse effects to the treatment. Considering the popularity of chelation therapy, it would certainly be wrong to withold this kind of information. Is it plausible that chelation with DMSA was found to have adverse effects? Yes, in fact, a trial of DMSA with rats had found that, in the absense of lead intoxication, it could contribute to cognitive deficits ( source ).  Additionally, even though a paper has not been published, preliminary results from the trial are known because of presentations Jim Adams has done, e.g.  Preliminary Results of 3rd DMSA Study  (2007). Dr. Adams compares a group receiving 7 rounds of DMSA vs. another getting 1 round of DMSA. In a global impression scale, 8% of the children getting 7 rounds are found to be doing slightly worse or worse vs. 0% of the children who got 1 round of DMSA. Of those who got 7 rounds, 87% are found to be doing slightly to much better vs. 84% of those who got 1 round. In the \"No Change\" category we find 17% of children who got 1 round vs. 4% of those who got 7. (You'll note that those percentages don't add up, but that's how they are reported in the presentation.) This brings up a question as to whether about 8% of the children suffered adverse effects after only 7 rounds. Dr. Adams also finds that DMSA increases excretion of potassium and chromium, and that it raised glucose and triglycerides.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13102473/", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=129", "http://bartholomewcubbins.blogspot.com/2006/11/is-dmsasuccimer-use-in-absence-of-high.html", "http://autismone.com/uploads/James%20Adams%20AO%202007%20presentation%20DMSA.ppt"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/dr-adams-is-there-paper-in-horizon.html", "title": "\nDr. Adams: Is there a paper in the horizon?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2007", "body": "\nThere's an interesting discussion over at EOHarm. It started when Lenny Schafer posted the following. Hello, I have inquiries along the lines of this letter from a Schafer Autism Report reader. Most of the explanations I can come up with sound a little weak. Have any EOHarm list participants seen anything new from our side to help explain the question. I am looking for a response to put in the SAR. I am sure many of my 20,000 readers would like to some sort of explanation. Lenny Dear Mr Schafer, Shouldn't we be seeing a downturn by now in the rate of diagnosed autism now that thimerasol has been removed from all childhood vaccines in California for a few years now? Do you know what the proponents of the theory have to say on the matter? I was dismayed to see the news item in today's report about the most recent numbers from the DDS. Puzzled in Mtn View. (EOHarm message #67007) Fellow EOHarmers explained that it's not just thimerosal in vaccines. There are other things going on with the environment. But Lenny countered that the thimerosal hypothesis was supposed to be the strongest hypothesis, not a marginal part of a general environmental hypothesis. The strongest hypothesis we have out there for the cause of autism is the Mercury Hypothesis. This is not the Mercury and Everything and the Kitchen Sink Hypothesis. Nobody every said it was only mercury, only that it's the best suspect. The mercury is mostly out of vaccines and we should have seen some drop, not increase in autism if the Mercury Hypothesis carries weight, I would think. (EOHarm message #67018) It was then explained to him that thimerosal is still in the flu vaccine, that trace amounts are still there, etc. He wouldn't budge. After all, if the \"epidemic\" of autism was supposed to be caused by an increase in the thimerosal dose per child in pediatric vaccines, why wouldn't a substantial decrease in the dosage reverse the epidemic? Yes, yes. But there should still be some drop. (EOHarm message #67034) EOHarmers tried everything. They said that any dose could sustain the epidemic; that perhaps only a decrease in severity would result. Some decided it was time to blame a different type of vaccine; maybe Wakefield was right after all. They talked about the importance of keeping the faith. Finally, someone said, \"how do you know thimerosal has really been removed?\" But it didn't really work. If true, this would be the best explanation of them all, not to mention the biggest travesty. It shouldn't be too hard to test this. Random analysis of vaccines. (EOHarm message #67038) He thought about it further and came back with the kind of whopper that is only ever overheard in skeptical blogs. This is another important missing element in support of the mercury hypothesis: where are the whistle blowers? Even amongst the worst thieves and scoundrels, there are a few who eventually seek to tell the truth and find atonement for their sins. Where are they? (Rhetorical question). (EOHarm message #67113) When asked why the question was rethorical, he answered as follows. The question, \"wherefore art thou whistle blower\" is posed rhetorically because the obvious answers are unsatisfactory to the mercury  hypothesis: 1. They are still in hiding after so long. 2. They don't exist. (EOHarm message #67125) Lenny's a goner I'm afraid. The Illuminati have him now. Well, that or, you know, something called  cognitive dissonance  finally kicked in. Either way, what do you think Lenny Schafer should say to his readers?

{"date": "Monday, October 22, 2007", "body": "\nAs regular readers might have noticed, Natural Variation is, for the most part, what one might call a \"skeptic blog.\" This, however, doesn't mean that I generally bow to scientific authority, and on occasion you will see me question mainstream views, if I feel there are rational arguments that can be advanced to question such views.  This time I will question the view that ABA/EIBI is an evidence-based autism treatment. Let me start by quoting what major mainstream authorities think of it. Behavioral training, including communication development, has been shown to be effective in reducing problem behaviors and improving adaptation. There is a growing body of evidence that intensive early intervention services for children in whom autism is diagnosed before 5 years of age may lead to better overall outcomes. (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001) Thirty years of research demonstrated the efficacy of applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and in increasing communication, learning and appropriate social behavior. (The United States Surgeon General, 1999) Impressive, right? I will summarize reasons why some of us feel these statements were premature and not entirely supported by the data. Most of this has already been noted by  Michelle Dawson  and  Morton Ann Gernsbacher , who have done a remarkable job of advancing science-based criticisms of ABA. There are no randomized trials of ABA (with or without blinded assessments) demonstrating its broad effectiveness against \"eclectic\" management approaches. One randomized trial of ABA ( Smith, Groen & Wynn, 2000 ) was conducted to \"address criticism of previous research and to increase methodological rigor.\" It compared a group treated with Lovaas-style ABA against a group receiving parent-instructed treatment. Only 13% of the children in the experimental group achieved \"best outcome\" (mainstream placement without support). No statistically significant group  differences were found in either of two language scales. The paper reports a difference, but there was an error in the data analysis (Smith, 2001). No differences were found in socioemotional functioning or in adaptive functioning. Marginal differences were found in other measures. There are controlled trials, such as  Howlin et al. (2007) , which have not found EIBI to be effective compared to autism-specific nursery provisions. Adult outcomes of children who had received Lovaas-style ABA have not been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Children from the experimental group of Lovaas (1987) must now be in their 20s and 30s. What would be the point of short-term gains if, hypothetically, adult outcomes do not differ from those of autistics who did not receive intensive interventions? Specific Criticism of Lovaas (1987) It is probably fair to say that the reason ABA gained mainstream acceptance was the widely reported \"recovery\" rate of 47% resulting from Lovaas (1987). In fact, the Surgeon General of the United States makes reference to it. The methodology of this  landmark paper has been widely challenged, however. There was no randomized assignment into groups. Assessments were not blinded. Male-female ratios in the experimental group and control group 1 differed from the ratio normally reported for autism ( Boyd, 1998 ). IQ assessment tools differed between intake and follow-up. It is highly improbable that the reported ranges of intake IQ in Lovaas (1987) match the experimental group average IQ of 63 ( source ). In fact, the ranges are inconsistently reported. Comment There is a substantial body of Level-II-1 and lower quality evidence that suggests EIBI is an effective treatment approach. However, since there exists Level-I, Level-II-1 and other evidence that EIBI is not terribly effective, and also considering the lack of adult outcome studies, the statements by the Surgeon General of the United States and the American Academy of Pediatrics seem premature. Indeed, the trial which appears to be the most methodologically rigorous to date (Smith et al., 2000) was largely unsuccessful. The statements are also unfortunate because lowering standards of evidence could allow quackery in the door, and could result in us having to deal with \"evidence based\" woo.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://www.floortime.org/downloads/behavioral_treatment_autism.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10934569&dopt=Citation", "http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/IMFAR/abst.cfm?abstid=10185", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/g4587m51ru07j228/", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/03/intake-iq-in-lovaas-1987.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/when-mainstream-is-mistaken-case-of-aba.html", "title": "\nWhen the Mainstream is Mistaken: The Case of ABA\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 20, 2007", "body": "\nI believe that accepting autistic people is simply the right thing to do. It's not something you should consider doing just to make a child \"get better\" or any medicalized thing of that nature. That said, in a prior discussion the question came up as to whether acceptance might be beneficial to autistic children, so I decided to research it. There is not a lot of autism-specific research on the issue, but I did find there is a large body of research on acceptance and its effects on general population children as well as disabled children. In the general population it has been found that parental acceptance correlates with better academic performance ( Hahn, 1980 ), optimal self-concept development ( Litovsky & Dusek, 1985 ), self-worth and self-competence ( Ohannessian et al., 1998 ), etc. Self-worth has been found to correlate to perceived competence in domains important to parents ( Killeen, 1993 ). In children with \"disruptive behavior disorders\", parent-child attachment has been found to correlate with lower levels of aggression and social stress ( Ooi, 2006 ). The self-esteem of children with learning disabilities have been found to be associated with parental acceptance ( Morvitz & Motta, 1992 ). On a related note, I've learned there's something called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). In randomized trials it has been found to be as effective as the dominant form of psychotherapy, CBT, in the treatment of depression, anxiety and problems of that nature. Its mechanism of action appears to be different to that of CBT ( Forman et al., 2007 ). There has been a trial of this type of therapy with parents of autistic children ( Blackledge, 2006 ), but it should be stressed this trial was not randomized. There is also a non-randomized trial of this therapy as a treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder ( Dalrymple & Herbert, 2007 ). I don't have any comments beyond that. I just wanted to report what I found, but I'd appreciate any personal experiences, or insight from readers with expertise on the topic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED202949&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED202949", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/b4n303681367u750/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9809121&dopt=Citation", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=8244685&dopt=Citation", "http://spi.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/552", "http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ441366&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=EJ441366", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17932235&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=0083NJRSXBR89GULRB4SAPVD41Q501HE&ID=71743", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17699117&ordinalpos=7&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/importance-of-acceptance.html", "title": "\nThe Importance of Acceptance\n"},

That was over 30 years ago. Isn't that rather early a diagnosis for the time? By the age of 5 he's said to have \"emerged\" from autism. We're in 2007 now; early diagnoses are quite common and have been studied. It turns out that it's not that unusual for children to lose age 2 diagnoses, and there's little data regarding what predicts this. Anywhere from 12% to 19% of children diagnosed at age 2 will be found to not meet ASD criteria some years later ( Turner et al., 2006 ;  Kleinman et al., 2007 ). Sorry Raun, but those are the facts. But maybe he didn't lose his label at 5. He simply \"emerged.\" Still, Raun Kaufman is unusual and generates interest because he's the only adult (that I know of) who inequivocally states he's completely recovered from autism. I've encountered adults who say they might be slightly off the spectrum now, but they tend to be ambiguous about it. How does Raun Kaufman differ from any of Kanner's \"success stories\" as described in  Kanner et al. (1972) ? It can't be that they didn't graduate from college or didn't have jobs.  Does it matter whether we call it \"complete recovery\" or \"success story\"? I think it matters a little. Losing membership in a group is different to being a successful member of the group. For example, it will probably be quite unusual if a woman becomes  president of the US. But I don't think Hilary Clinton will stop being a woman if she achieves this. Don't get me wrong. I think it  is  important for science to study what might have  helped Raun have a successful outcome. Some clues are already there. Although advised to institutionalize Raun, his parents, authors/teachers Samahria and Barry Neil Kaufman, instead created an innovative home-based, child-centered program in an effort to reach their son. I'm convinced this sort of recommendation Raun's parents got is a major cause of poor adult outcomes reported in the literature. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy if you will. I'd like to see stronger warnings against early institutionalization. I believe this is more important than saying \"give me money to recover your child.\" I don't doubt the parallel play, joint attention, presuming competence, and acceptance (even fake acceptance) helped somewhat. However, I don't like a lot of the discourse used by the Autism Treatment Centers of America. It's medicalized. It claims to give \"hope\" but instead misleads with erroneous information, such as suggesting that poor outcomes in autism are basically a given under normal circumstances.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16682397&ordinalpos=128&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17924183&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1972.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/raun-kaufman-completely-recovered-or.html", "title": "\nRaun Kaufman: Completely Recovered or Success Story?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 15, 2007", "body": "\nRaymond W. Gallup & F. Edward Yazbak have posted an analysis titled \" When 1 in 150 is really 1 in 67 .\" As you can imagine, they did not survey children in order to arrive at a new prevalence number of 1 in 67. They estimated it as follows. The CDC has reported that the prevalence of autism among children born in 1994 is 1 in 150. The administrative prevalence of autism among 6 year olds, as reported in IDEA, has increased 124% (factor of 2.24) from 2000 to 2006. Therefore, they argue, the prevalence reported by the CDC must actually be 1 in 67 for children born in 2000, if adjusted accordingly. Anyone see why this methodology does not hold? For this analysis to hold, IDEA ascertainment would have to be at least roughly equivalent to CDC ascertainment. It's not a matter of \"not believing the statistics collected by the U.S. department of education\" as the authors contend. I believe them. I just don't think they are counting all autistic children, by far. But I do think they are getting better at ascertaining autism. In 2000, the prevalence of IDEA autism among 6 year olds was 0.23% ( source , table B2C). This is 2.89 times less than the CDC prevalence reported for children born in 1994. So for every 3 autistic children, IDEA missed 2. Of course, it's unlikely they missed most of them. They were probably served under other categories, as demonstrated by  Shattuck (2006) . Could it also be that the IDEA category can be changed after the age of 6? (Note that in IDEA a child is in one category or another, not multiple ones simultaneously.) The IDEA prevalence of autism among 11 year olds in 2005 was 0.47% (same table), more than double that of 6 year olds in 2000. Obviously, half of the autistic 11 year olds, as recognized in 2005, must have been served in other categories in 2000. So Gallup & Yazbak's analysis is flawed in regards to using the IDEA prevalence of 6 year olds in 2000 to extrapolate the results of a survey done recently on children who are now older. That's just a demonstrable flaw of the analysis. I don't believe the analysis methodology is valid either way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vaproject.org/yazbak/1-in-150-is-really-1-in-67-20071005.htm", "https://www.ideadata.org/docs/PartBTrendData/B2C.html", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/4/1028"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/gallup-yazbak-prevalence-is-1-in-67.html", "title": "\nGallup & Yazbak: \"Prevalence is 1 in 67\"\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2007", "body": "\nIt seems to me that many parents (and even some professionals) in the autism community are unaware of fundamental facts about autism. I cannot help but arrive at this conclusion when I witness factual statements such as \"there is no cure for autism\" twisted into mistaken or unsubstantiated statements like the following. The bastards are telling us that our kids will never get better! Loss of label in autism is so miraculous that some innovative cure must have made little Timmi recover. My child would not have skills X, Y, and Z if it weren't for [insert woo]. My 2 year-old child will never be able to do X. My child will necessarily end up in an institution. When we deal with flawed premises of this nature, rational discussion obviously becomes very difficult. That's why I want to make this post a sort of all-purpose summary of what the science tells us in regards to developmental progress, adult outcomes, loss of label in childhood, speech, institutionalization, and shifts in parental beliefs. I will discuss factors that seem to be predictive of outcome, but don't expect any magical formulas or guarantees from me. I can only speak of possibilities and I will only report what the data tells me. I will not sugar-coat what the research says. As always, if you find that I failed to include some relevant data, or if something I said is inaccurate, feel free to let me know in the comments section. Developmental Progress Recently there was some publicity sorrounding a study by Paul Shattuck which found that autistics \"get better\" in average ( source ). This type of finding is not new, however. Even early papers by Kanner show that autistic children tend to make substantial developmental progress as time goes by. There are several other published findings as well. Findings from  Harris et al. (1991) , for example, \"support the notion that young children with autism can make very significant developmental gains.\" Tager-Flusberg et al. (1990)  found that language acquisition in most autistic children followed the same developmental path as that found in children with Down Syndrome, and that of normal children as reported in the literature.  Harris et al. (1990)  found that all autistic children in the study made normative progress in their rate of language development.   Piven et al. (1996)  reported \"significant change over time in autistic behaviors, generally in the direction of improvement\" in high-IQ autistic adolescents.  Charman et al. (2004)  found that autistic children had \"encouraging developmental progress\" over a 1-year period, although no change in \"symptom severity as measured by the Social Communication Questionnaire.\" Of course, there is such a thing as \"regression\" and there are developmental plateaus, but these are the exception rather than the norm, and they will not necessarily persist indefinitely. Adult Outcomes The first adult outcomes reported in the literature can be found in  Kanner (1971)  and  Kanner et al. (1972) . The 1972 paper details the case histories of 11 (actually 13) of 96 autistic adults Kanner considered \"success stories.\" The paper contains some discussion of predictive factors for a successful outcome, such as the presence of some expressive language before the age of 5, and effort spent to \"compensate for the lack of inherent sociability\" when the individuals were in their middle to late teens. The only environmental factor Kanner found significant was a total lack of institutionalization. I see this as a key factor, and it would be difficult to do it justice with a risk ratio. Lack of institutionalization was practically a requirement for a successful outcome. On the other hand, from Kanner's 1971 paper it would seem that institutionalization from an early age practically ensured a \"dismal\" outcome. There have been other adult outcome studies since then, with varying results. For example,  Howlin et al. (2004)  found that 12% of adults had \"very good outcome\" and another 10% \"good outcome\", with the majority (58%) having \"poor\" or \"very poor\" outcome.  Billstedt et al. (2005)  found that autistics diagnosed in 60s, 70s and 80s had worse outcome than previously reported, with only 3% achieving independence, and 78% having a \"poor outcome.\"  A recent adult outcome study reports that half of the autistic adults had a good or fair outcome, and 46% had poor outcomes ( Eaves & Ho, 2007 ). The authors indicate that \"current young people had more opportunities\" and thus better outcomes were expected. I would venture a guess that one of those opportunities was the opportunity not to be institutionalized. Some factors in outcome, such as baseline IQ or symptom severity, are usually discussed in these types of outcome studies. Szatmari et al. (1989)  studied the outcome of \"non-retarded\" autistic adults, and found that 4 of 16 (25%), a \"surprising number\", had a very good outcome and could be considered \"recovered.\" An interesting finding from this study was that symptom severity was not predictive of outcome. Outcome studies generally use various standard measures to determine if an outcome is good or poor.  Ruble & Dalrymple (1996)  questions the traditional view of outcome and suggests that some good outcomes are sometimes \"invisible\" to traditional measures. It also found that the parents of autistic adults who were doing well had pushed for integration and mainstreaming. You might have heard neurodiversity advocates promote the notion that \"presuming competence\" is beneficial. There is actually some evidentiary support for this if you look at  Donohue et al. (2000) , which is not autism specific, but is referred by  Ivey (2007) , a survey of teacher expectations of outcome in autism. The following is quoted from its summary. Research shows that when the significant people in a child\u2019s life do not believe that he or she has capability to achieve an outcome, it is unlikely that the outcome will be realized. For example, if a teacher feels that a student has social obstacles, then their perceptions may increase the undesirable behavior and the student may see him or herself in that light (Donohue, Weinstein, Cowan, & Cowan, 2000). The environmental factor that seems to be of interest to medical researchers is, of course, treatment. Unfortunately, there are no adult outcome studies that could tell us if modern treatments, particulary early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), are predictive of a good outcome. The evidence is rather ambiguous. To take an example, you have  Howlin (1997)  which tells us that \"appropriately structured programmes for education and management in the early years can play a significant role in enhancing functioning in later life.\" But later the same author, in  Howlin (2003) , states that \"despite claims to the contrary, there is little evidence that very early, intensive interventions can significantly alter the long-term course of the disorder.\" It would be of interest to know, for example, how the experimental group of Lovaas (1987) is doing, now in their 20s and 30s (even if the group was not representative) but unfortunately no one has taken the time to document these adult outcomes in the peer-reviewed literature thus far. Loss of Label in Childhood It seems obvious that the earlier the diagnosis, the harder it is to predict if the diagnosis will hold some years later. There are some studies that support this view, such as  Turner et al. (2006)  which found that only 88% of children with autism or PDD-NOS diagnoses at age 2 were found to be in the spectrum at age 9. See also  Sutera et al. (2006)  and  Charman et al. (2005) . While loss of label in childhood is rare, it's obviously not as miraculous as some claim. A gap in the science is that nothing is known about the adult outcomes of autistic children who lose their label at a young age. Speech Development Turner et al. (2006)  tells us that 88% of children diagnosed with autism or PDD-NOS at age 2 could demonstrate some functional language at age 9. However, only 32% were able to engage in a conversation.  Kobayashi & Murata (1998)  found that 48% of a sample of 187 autistic adults had good or very good speech. Speech delay has been found to be non-significant in autistic children with normal intelligence, i.e. their outcome appears to be no different to those with a diagnosis of Asperger's ( Calhoun, 2001 ). Institutionalization It is important to realize that institutionalization of developmentally disabled persons has been in decline in recent decades, probably in large part due to the  deinstitutionalization movement . Krauss et al. (2005)  reports that 63% of autistic adults did not live at home with their parents. Of those, the majority (73%) lived in a community residential programme. About 17% had a semi-independent living arrangement. Only 3% lived in an institutional setting. This is consistent with the latest data from California DDS, where we find that at least 66% of adults in the system live at home or independently, and no more than 4% live in institutional care facilities ( source ). Currently about 10 in 10,000 persons in California are registered with CDDS and do not live at home or independently. There is a slight downward trend in this proportion. I would estimate that autistic children diagnosed today in California have a relatively small chance (5-10%) of not living at home or independently as adults, due to the trend in institutionalization and the broadening of the spectrum. To put it in perspective, I think they have better odds of \"recovering\" than of being institutionalized. Parental Beliefs According to  King et al. (2006) , expected changes in parental worldviews over time include positive adaptations concerning views on life and disability, \"and an appreciation of the positive contributions made by children to family members and society as a whole.\" I suspect not all parents undergo these worldview adaptations, however. Some will probably oppose acceptance to the bitter end.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news-info.wustl.edu/tips/page/normal/10149.html", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/y26t4518j3v85461/", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/k060vgh78w828774/", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/y64520708wv56026/", "http://www.jaacap.com/pt/re/jaacap/abstract.00004583-199604000-00019.htm;jsessionid=HMnfQvHp8MKLN5TXvydQfDm4drvvP2pQ7hpRsgSdYcBJDnBqBJLx!-1323538283!181195628!8091!-1", "http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/1/89", "http://neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1971.html", "http://neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1972.html", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00215.x", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/m532l35507165426/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17764027&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=2745389&ordinalpos=10&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.starautism.louisville.edu/images/pdf/h.pdf", "http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ633372&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=EJ633372", "http://www.dddcec.org/ETMRDDV/sample/Ivey.pdf", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/v8jx780uu146j643/", "http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/summary/108564952/SUMMARY?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16682397&ordinalpos=128&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/630884p886672g47/", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00377.x", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16682397&ordinalpos=128&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=9766685&query_hl=7&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/5/1/81", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalization", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15634320&query_hl=12&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16634980&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/dose-of-real-autism-reality.html", "title": "\nA Dose Of Real Autism Reality\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 07, 2007", "body": "\n [ ERRATA  10/13/2007: Based on commenter feedback, I have changed the title from the strongly worded \"More Evidence Of The General Ineffectiveness of Biomed\". A few words have been inserted in the post in relation to this clarification. The term \"high functioning\" is sometimes used to indicate that a child would no longer be eligible for developmental disability services.] What I want to do in this post is verify, using actual data, whether claims to the effect that biomed is producing broad results hold water. I think administrative data is adequate to test this belief, as I will explain. So what is it that biomed peddlers are generally claiming? First, they are telling us that biomed is recovering autistic children by the \"thousands.\" They also tell us that those of us who do not experiment with our children using biomed will soon repent, that we're guilty of child abuse, and so forth. They've been saying that for years actually. Regular troll to the  LB/RB blog , 666sigma, tells us that most of the autistic children where he lives have pretty much recovered, and the ones who are now mainstreamed without autistic traits are precisely the ones who are doing biomed ( source ). Let's put aside for a moment 666sigma's confirmation bias, and consider what would happen if what he says is true. Now, keep in mind that about 74% of autistic children in the US are currently subjected to alternative medicine ( Hanson et al., 2007 ). If biomed were generally and broadly effective, it follows that a significant number of autistic children must constantly become high functioning, if not lose their labels altogether. I think any such effect should show up in California data. Suppose a child is born in 2001, is diagnosed with autism in 2004, and enters the CDDS system then. Your average parent in the US will naturally at that point Google their way to the biomed treatments of vogue. I would assume that by 2006 the child should be expected to be high functioning or recovered, right? This means that the child would lose their CDDS eligibility and would no longer appear in the report. It's important to realize that the state of California is very much concerned with CDDS caseload growth, to the point that in August 2003 a law was enacted (CA AB1762, W&IC 4512) with the explicit purpose of supressing this growth ( source ). The law requires the applicant to have three life-functioning deficits instead of just one. In fact, 2003 and 2004 saw more autistic individuals dropped from the system than any year prior, at least since 1999 ( source ).  Note also that CDDS reports are generally on clients with active status, and losing eligibility causes someone's status to become 'Closed' ( source ). Thanks to David Kirby, who brought it to my attention, I happen to have data on caseload by birth year cohort from CDDS, as reported every quarter. We can check what happens to the caseload of autistic children born in 2001, for example. I actually went and made a graph of caseload for birth years 1999 to 2004, as reported each June from 2002 to 2007. This graph shows that with each year that passes, the number of autistic children receiving services from CDDS born in any year between 1999 and 2004 does not drop, but instead continues to increase. The following graph, which might be clearer, illustrates what has occurred to the caseload of children born in 1999 specifically. From these data we can conclude that autistic children born in recent years in California are not dying in significant numbers, are not moving out of the state in significant numbers, and I would also assert they are not recovering in significant numbers. There are some limitations to the data. For example, it could be argued that increasing recognition of autism is so relentless that it overshadows any recoveries, particularly those that occur before the age of 5 or 6.

{"date": "Wednesday, October 03, 2007", "body": "\nThreeLac is an alternative treatment for candida/yeast/fungal infections which seems to be receiving considerable attention as a biomed autism treatment thanks to Jenny McCarthy. I wouldn't be surprised if it soon overshadows other treatments currently in vogue, such as Chelation Therapy or Me-B12 injections. ThreeLac is unproven, of course. There are no published studies on its effectiveness as it relates to any condition, never mind autism. However, there is one \"study\" underway which purports to demonstrate its effectiveness as an autism treatment. I'm not going to link to its web page but it's easy to find if you're interested. It is not a controlled study, as you can imagine. It's reminiscent of the uncontrolled work  Amy Holmes  did in the early days of Chelation Therapy for autism. In any such uncontrolled \"studies\", you will find that the children \"improve\", some markedly. I would go as far as to say, frankly, that non-controlled treatment studies are worse than useless in autism for reasons that should be well known by now. What caught my attention about the ThreeLack \"study\" was the \"existing supplement routine prior to and during the study.\" It's jaw-dropping.

{"date": "Monday, October 01, 2007", "body": "\n [ ERRATA 11/24/2007 : The year 2006 was mistakenly referred to as 1996 in a couple places.] I presume most of my readers are pretty familiar with this sort of claim by now. For example, column writer Evelyn Pringle has proclaimed autism to be the \"worst welfare disater in history\" and further claims that \"as more autistic children reach late adolescence, the need for out-of-home residential services is beginning to have a heavy impact on state budgets\" ( source .) When Mark Geier was interviewed by the conspiracy talk radio program  Radio Liberty , he stated that if \"we end up with one in six of them having brain damage, that\u2019s fifty million Americans, we\u2019re not going to be the number one country in the world anymore.\" He further suggested that \"if we are not careful it\u2019s going to destroy the United States\" ( source .) These scare tactics are, of course, unsubstantiated. Note that it's not sufficient to point to the increasing administrative prevalence of autism, considering the very distinct possibility of diagnostic substitution and increasing recognition of various conditions. It's also not sufficient to point to the high costs of ABA therapy, for example, for the same reasons. To determine if there is any merit to these claims, I think we need to look at some basic metrics, and that's what I intend to do in this post. I will use data going back to 1992 which may be requested from California DDS (CDDS). California population data is obtained from  the California Department of Health Services . Let us first look at trends in cognitive disability as a whole, by analyzing data on an aggregation of moderate, severe and profound mental retardation in the state of California as registered by CDDS. Mental retardation (MR) in CDDS is more of an assessment than a diagnosis. That is, all CDDS clients, including autistic clients, are assigned to a category such as \"No MR\", \"Profound MR\", \"Unknown MR\", etc. This categorization is presumably based on IQ testing. I am choosing moderate, severe and profound MR because I believe these categories would be \"hard to miss\" if you will, and it is unlikely that there's a recent trend of parents deciding to pursue CDDS services for these conditions where they would not have in the past. In other words, many of the caveats that would apply to the autism classification probably do not apply to these categories. The following is a graph of the prevalence change in moderate, severe and profound MR from 1992 to 2006, as reported in July of each year. As we can see, administrative prevalence of moderate, severe and profound mental retardation has been stable since 1992. The aggregated prevalence was 15.4/10,000 in 1992 and 15.5/10,000 in 2006.  Let us now look at a direct measure of residential costs. The following is a graph of the total number of persons, per 10,000 population, registered with CDDS, who do not live either at home (being cared for by a parent or guardian) or independently. This would include residential options such as group homes, as well as institutional care facilities, nursing facilities, etc. As readers can see, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of developmentally disabled persons who do not live at home or independently. The prevalence of this type of living arrangement was 10.7/10,000 in 1992 and 10.3/10,000 in 2006. I think we can all agree this is a positive trend.  Conclusion California data does not support unsubstantiated claims by Evelyn Pringle, Mark Geier and others to the effect that \"epidemics\" of developmental disabilities will result in either an unmanageable fiscal burden or the destruction of the United States.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0604/S00211.htm", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/106/desperation-time", "http://www.applications.dhs.ca.gov/epicdata/content/st_population.htm", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/RwEMn4syZ8I/AAAAAAAAAAc/y1r8VwmZSsc/s1600-h/cddsmr.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__6PO0G1BcJM/RwEROYsyZ9I/AAAAAAAAAAk/1R-f7QxVUdw/s1600-h/cddsinst.jpg"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/does-data-support-claim-that.html", "title": "\nDoes Data Support Claim That Developmental Disabilities Will \"Destroy The US\"?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 27, 2007", "body": "\n Orac  and  Isles  have already commented on the new thimerosal study from the CDC. I just wanted to add a few things. The study, first of all, is methodologically impressive in my view. For example, they didn't look at existing diagnoses, but they actually went and evaluated the children. This in itself takes care of some confounds Verstraeten et al. likely suffered from. The new study is not perfect by any means, but anyone would be hard pressed to do any better. The confounds that remain are non-obvious and their significance unclear. This is not at all like  Generation Rescue's survey , for example, where it's trivial to identify some major and obvious confounds. It would seem that the conclusions of the CDC study are counter-intuitive to some people. After all, the study did find some statistically significant effects, and statistical significance is statistical significance. David Kirby, for instance, seems to be having a lot of trouble figuring this out. The key point to understand is that this study is not your ordinary ecological survey where they give you one or two risk ratios (RRs) and their confidence intervals. If you look at a single RR in isolation, you can be sure (barring any flaws and confounds) that there's only a 5% chance that the actual RR is outside the confidence interval. But suppose you are presented with 100 studies, each with one RR. Obviously, you should expect that, by mere chance, around 5 of those studies will be wrong; i.e. they will have actual RRs that are outside their corresponding confidence intervals. The CDC study looked at 42 different outcomes, and determined multiple confidence intervals in each case, since different levels of exposure were tested. In total, I understand there were over 300 confidence intervals. Consequently, assuming the null hypothesis is correct, you should expect that an RR of 1.0 will be outside the 95% confidence interval in over 15 measures. What the study found was that in 12 measures there was an apparent protective factor, and in 8 measures there was an apparent risk factor. This is completely consistent with the null hypothesis. Therefore, the conclusion of the study, namely that the results of the same do not support a causal association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurological outcomes, is absolutely the correct conclusion.  Let's now discuss Sallie Bernard. The CDC apparently went out of its way to make this study as transparent as possible and to, frankly, appease the mercury militia (which bills itself as the \"autism community\" even though there's absolutely no evidence they are actually representative of the autism community.) Ms. Bernard was given a chance to participate in all stages of the study as a consultant, but when the results came in and they were not what she expected, Ms. Bernard decided to withdraw her support. That's not all. She (or SafeMinds) fired off and email/press-release titled as follows. VACCINE STUDY IN NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE WRONG IN CONCLUDING  MERCURY EXPOSURES ARE HARMLESS , STATES SAFEMINDS (EOHarm message #65356) Is that what the paper said? That mercury exposures are harmless? That would be wrong ane misleading. Let me check. Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years. Wow. That's quite different to \"mercury exposures are harmless.\" Who would say \"mercury exposures are harmless\" anyway? If you were to ingest, say, 1 gram of mercury, you would not become autistic, but you would easily end up at the hospital or dead. Certain doses of mercury are not harmless by any means. Clearly, the CDC study has been misrepresented by SafeMinds. Is that SafeMinds statement an intellectually honest one? Ms. Bernard?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/a_bad_day_for_antivaccinationists.php", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=655"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/sallie-bernard-and-novel-form-of-sour.html", "title": "\nSallie Bernard and a Novel Form of Sour Grapes\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2007", "body": "\nAs widely reported, the president of Iran, Ahmadinejad, has stated that homosexuals do not exist in his country. This doesn't really have to do with autism, but I happen to have researched the history of homosexuality, which went from being criminalized to being a disease and finally depathologized in 1973 when it was removed from the DSM-II. There's something I once read on the topic which probably explains Ahmadinejad's remark. Evidently, homosexuals exist in Iran, probably at about the same rate as they are found to exist in the West (which BTW is not the 10% usually cited.) However, I do not doubt that homosexuals are a \" hidden horde \" in Iran, largely unseen, if you will. They have to hide, and the vast majority of Iranians could easily be unaware of their existence, except when they are reported by the media. You see, homosexuality is criminalized in Iran ( source 1 ,  source 2 ).  Let's find out what it was like in the West when homosexuality was criminalized. The following is a selection of passages about a sodomy trial taken from  The Medical Construction of Homosexuality and its Relation to the Law in Ninteenth-Centry England . Mr Archibald thought it \"fortunate\" that \"there is little learning or knowledge upon this subject in this country; there are other countries in which I am told learned treatises are written as to the appearance to be expected in such cases. Fortunately Doctors in England know very little about these matters\". Mr Archibald could not have made a better summary of the position of forensic knowledge about sodomy and about homosexual practices... Gibson also noted that this was an \"uncommon condition so far as my experience goes\". Gibson had read the two leading Continental authorities on sodomy, August Tardieu and Johann Casper, a fact used by the court to establish a doctor's expertise in detecting sodomical practices... Lord Chief Justice Cockburn brought to the court's attention that \"although this gentleman has not seen an instance of the effect produced by such a crime, yet if his general anatomical and surgical knowledge enables him to form an opinion, and he is able to say that the result of certain acts must be to produce such an effect, that would be legitimate evidence\"... This establishment of ignorance amongst medical practitioners concerning knowledge about sodomy was to become crucial for the conclusion that  sodomy did not exist in England , for unlike their Continental colleagues, credible and respectable English doctors at this trial (not Paul) were on the whole unable to tell if it had occurred or not. If a survey of homosexuality were to be done in Iran, my bet is that the results would indicate there is close to 0% homosexuality in that country. Nevertheless, whether recognized rates of homosexuality in the West are 40-fold or 6000% higher than those of Iran, that does not prove homosexuality is biologically more common in the West, of course. Someone such as David Kirby could very well disagree with that logic, though.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://beirut.indymedia.org/ar/2005/07/2999.shtml", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Iran", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1044698&blobtype=pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/ahmadinejad-no-homosexuals-in-iran.html", "title": "\nAhmadinejad: \"No homosexuals in Iran\"\n"},

After finishing high school, Sally was successfully enrolled in a woman's college, graduating with a B average... For the last few years, he has been working at a government agricultural research station in a \"blue collar capacity.\" Edward does not like this too well preferring to associate with \"educated people.\" He has his own apartment and entertains himself with his Hi-fi set. He has bought a car with money that he has saved. He enjoys an active social life, belonging to hiking clubs and he has led hikes. His knowledge of plants and wild life brings him respect. He has begun to date girls. He comes home on weekends when he has time, and he is very welcome. Clarence graduated from high school in June, [year], with excellent marks and superior achievement test scores. After spending the summer with his parents, he was admitted to a college in Illinois, where he received his B.A. degree in [year]. While there, he \"socialized\" with a girl for a while. Going then to a college in Massachusetts on a scholarship, he felt isolated, and went home to write his thesis. After obtaining his Master's Degree in economics, he studied accounting at his home state university. Clarence got a job with the state planning office and promptly decided to study planning; he did everything required for another Master's Degree except for the thesis... Although he dated a girl, she \"broke off\" after about nine months. Clarence feels that he ought to get married but that he \"can't waste money on a girl who isn't serious.\" He likes driving a car and, as a hobby, collects time tables to maintain his interest in trains. On June 29, [year], at 19 years of age, he entered the armed services. Upon completion of basic training, he was assigned to one of the intelligence services, received a top security clearance, took courses until December 6, [year] (the nature of which he could not disclose because they were of a \"highly confidential nature\"), and received an honorable discharge on January 18, [year]. Then follows a list of various jobs held in California and later in Pennsylvania, (six altogether) mostly as a \"general office worker\"; at present he is \"chief inventory controller in a Motion Picture Laboratory\" where he has received \"several healthy pay increases.\" After drifting around, he feels that \"perhaps at last, I have found a place worthy of my talent for settling down in.\" All six jobs were described in great detail, giving dates, description of responsibilities, names and telephone numbers of supervisors, and reasons for leaving the jobs. Generally speaking, \"I have never been dismissed from any place of employment because of any working habits or lack of working habits.\" ... \"I am in excellent health with no history of any severe illnesses or injuries. I have an automobile and a permanent residence. I am also draft exempt and have no criminal record of any kind.\" George's mother took him out of school when he was in the eleventh grade so that he could concentrate on music. He had played violin in a number of youth orchestras and took courses at a prominent Conservatory. Concerned about not getting a high school diploma, George has, in recent years, spent much of his time subscribing to correspondence courses. He is especially interested in languages, having learned Spanish in school, teaching himself French, and having \"a working knowledge\" of Italian. At present George is employed as a page in a library and is also in charge of mailing books (mostly to foreign countries). Since June [year], he has worked at a small restaurant as a dishwasher and bus boy... He seems to enjoy his work, has pleased his employers, and has never missed a day. He is a handsome young man, takes complete care of himself and of his room, and is neat and clean at all times. There are no behavior problems. He helps with the housework and takes care of the yard, including complete care of the power mower. He hates clothes, drives a car, does best if not pressured and helped his father in the drug store... His chief interest is the streetcar museum. He is a member of a club that goes there on Sundays, laying track, painting cars, etc. They take trips. He used to like history, is up on world politics, and reads the newspapers. When tested at 16 years, he was found to have a full scale WISC IQ of 118 (verbal 126 and performance 104). His arithmetic score was at the ceiling with quick answers on the tests, and comprehension, similarities and rote memory were rated as being of high average... At 23 years of age, Fred is doing well at a university where he has a B plus average and is gifted in mathematics. He has adjusted well in college life and his schoolmates respect his academic prowess... Fred drives a car skillfully, with full knowledge of all the parts, and in his spare time has done some composing and built a telescope. Since receiving his A.B. degree in [year], he has worked in the local bank as a teller. He is satisfied to remain a teller, having no real desire for promotion. He meets the public there real well. His chief hobby is golf, playing four or five times a week at the local country club. While he is no pro, he has six trophies won in local competition. . . . Other interests are Kiwanis Club (served as president one term), Jaycees, Investment Club, Secretary of Presbyterian Sunday School. He is dependable, accurate, shows originality in editing the Jaycee program information, is even-tempered but has a mind of his own.... He owns his second car, likes his independence. His room includes his own TV, record player, and many books. In College his major was French and he showed a particular aptitude for languages.

{"date": "Saturday, September 22, 2007", "body": "\nThis is not a pleasant subject to write about, but I think someone needs to do it. If I try to search for formal data about it on Google, I find  my own prior post on it  where I quote Kanner as he notes a very consistent lack of institutionalization in autistic adults who were doing particularly well in their 20s and 30s. I also find a comment by Michelle Dawson (she has obviously already studied what institutionalization can do to autistics), plus a comment on Autism Diva's blog about Alfred N's fate. That's about it.  The more recent outcome studies, for whatever reason, also do not seem to explore the effects of institutionalization on outcome, as far as I'm aware. The following is from  Kanner (1971) , a follow-up study on 11 autistic children originally reported by Leo Kanner in 1943. Richard M., Barbara K., Virginia S., and Charles N. (Cases 3, 5, 6, and 9), who spent most of their lives in institutional care, have all lost their luster early after their admission. Originally fighting for their aloneness and basking in the contentment that it gave them, originally alert to unwelcome changes and, in their own way, struggling for the status quo, originally astounding the observer with their phenomenal feats of memory, they yielded readily to the uninterrupted self-isolation and soon settled down in a life not too remote from a nirvana-like existence. If at all responsive to psychological testing, their IQ's dropped down to figures usually referred to as low-grade moron or imbecile. The four autistics mentioned in the preceeding paragraph were placed in institutions from an early age.  Kanner lost track of two cases, Paul A. (Case 4) and Alfred N. (Case 8). However, it's notable that Alfred, a child with an IQ of 140, was placed in many different schools and hospitals. At one point he was given Thorazine.  Two other cases, Donald T. (Case 1) and Frederick W. (Case 2), were considered success stories by Kanner. They were  never  placed in institutions.  John F. (Case 10) died suddenly at the age of 29.  The remaining 2 cases were not considered success stories by Kanner. But they did not do poorly. Herbert B. (Case 7) was placed in a home only for a short period of time. He was still mute in adulthood, but he ended up in a farm where he was able to help out with various chores. Elaine C. (Case 11) was apparently first institutionalized in 1950 at the age of 18. As of 1970, she was still at Hudson River State Hospital and was reported to be independent, neat and clean. Kanner comments on the institutionalization factor as follows. One cannot help but gain the impression that State Hospital admission was tantamount to a life sentence, with evanescence of the astounding facts of rote memory, abandonment of the earlier pathological yet active struggle for the maintenance of sameness, and loss of the interest in objects added to the basically poor relation to people; in other words, a total retreat to near-nothingness... The question arises whether these children might have fared better in a different setting or whether Donald and Frederick, the able bank teller and the duplicating machine operator, would have shared the dismal fate of Richard and Charles in a State Hospital environment. Even though an affirmative answer would most likely be correct, one cannot get away from wondering whether another element, not as yet determinable, may have an influence on the future of autistic children... Maybe a life sentence is too dismal. It's not impossible for autistics to manage to come out of institutions and resume their lives. But this is probably extremely rare. Not institutionalizing autistic children when they are young doesn't guarantee independence and employment, of course. But it appears to be practically a requirement if that sort of outcome is to be attained. Note that Kanner reached this conclusion after analyzing 96 cases, not just the 11 mentioned. Now, why is it that strong warnings against institutionalization are not issued by doctors and other professionals? Why is it that instead some autism associations give the impression that institutionalization is indicated unless there's treatment?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1971.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-on-what-institutionalization-does.html", "title": "\nMore on What Institutionalization Does To Autistics\n"},

The following was said by Kanner about 11 of 96 (11%) autistic individuals who, upon follow-up in their 20s and 30s, he described as managing to \"function as self-dependent individuals, mostly well educated and all gainfully employed.\" Not one of them had at any time been subjected to sojourn in a state hospital or institution for the feebleminded. This seems to be significant in view of our experience that such an eventuality has invariably cut short any prospect for improvement (Kanner, 1965). ( source ) If you read the histories of the autistic individuals seen by Kanner, it is clear that this consistent lack of intitutionalization in the good-outcome group cannot be explained by \"less severity\" or anything of the sort. Most of the rest seem to have been institutionalized, judging by Kanner's original 1943 paper and its 1971 follow-up.

{"date": "Friday, September 14, 2007", "body": "\nThe current generation of shot-in-the-dark  cure  approaches to autism (generally referred to as \"biomed\") has been around for a while now. It's not surprising that many parents who have tried those approaches for years are starting to doubt them ( source ). Kev has already documented the lack of predictive succcess of 3 of the most loud proponents of chelation and biomed ( source ). What I want to go over in this post is a more systematic review of recovery outcomes in the larger group of  well-known  parents in the biomed camp; the celebrities if you will. I think it would be interesting to determine if there are indications that a strong cure mindset (placebo effect) and the huge variety of treatments tried by such parents (particularly chelation) have had any discernable effect beyond natural developmental progress. I came up with the following list by considering organizations such as SafeMinds and Generation Rescue, major biomed blogs, and the EOHarm mailing list. Jim Adams Julia Berle Sallie Bernard John Best Jr. Mark Blaxill Jeff Bradstreet JB Handley Amy Holmes Erik Nanstiel Wade Rankin Lynn Redwood Bernie Rimland Rick Rollens Lenny Schafer Kim Stagliano (3) Ginger Taylor Considering that Kim Stagliano has 3 autistic children, we are talking about 18 children total in the group, if I'm not mistaken. I wasn't sure if it was methodologically valid to include Julia Berle and Lynn Redwood, but that would've been a chief complaint if I didn't. Julia Berle, in particular, became well-known only after she showed up with a \"recovered\" child. She's also not that well-known. I'm not sure about Lynn Redwood on that, but her son was diagnosed with PDD-NOS. The outcomes I will discuss refer to classic autism or autistic disorder. (In other words, I'm trying to be as lenient as possible with the analysis). There are 2 claimed recoveries in the group, although both are disputed. Readers can form their own judgements, since videos exist in the case of Redwood ( video ) and Berle ( video ).  The \"recovery\" rate for the group is then 0-11%, which is in line with the natural recovery rate of 10-15% reported in the literature. It should be noted that many of these children are still young and could change further. There are claims of developmental progress, but they are not very impressive. Autistic children do develop ( Pry et al., 2007 ;  Charman et al., 2004 ), despite the impression media accounts might give.   For example, John Best has reported progress in his son's behavior, but it doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary. His son started out being obviously autistic, and after several years of chelation therapy, continues to be obviously autistic. Note that chelation therapy lasts months, not years, when treating severe heavy metal poisoning. Such cases of severe poisoning are normally fatal without hospitalization. Erik Nanstiel reports some progress as well. His account is peculiar in that he claims the biomed approaches he's put his daughter through have caused her eyeglass prescription to be reduced 60%. This claim is probably unprecedented. It's unclear what biological mechanism could force a change in the curvature of the eye. I suspect there was an error in the earlier prescription. It's a good thing the mistake was corrected, though, because good visual acuity alone can help with learning. Jim Adams is very interested in chelation therapy, to the point that he conducted a small double-blind placebo-controlled study on the treatment. Results of the study were expected to be known late last year, but there are no indications that anything will be published ( source ) despite the fact that Jim Adams assured results would be reported regardless of what they were. His daughter has been on the treatment but he found it to be unhelpful. Then we have a situation such as that of Amy Holmes, one of the first major proponents of chelation therapy as a treatment of autism. She had initially reported her son was making excellent progress in the area of communication, but many years later we find that her teenage son is non-verbal ( source ). I understand Jeff Bradstreet's case is similar. Conclusion From this admittedly not very scientific review, I conclude there are no compelling indications that extensive biomed and/or chelation therapy have proven helpful to the major proponents of the same.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=615", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=610", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB_1ohubNMI&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fautismnaturalvariation%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F10%2Fautistic%2Dteens%2Dbeing%2Dtaught%2Dthey%2Dare%2Ehtml", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl14FSSxiFo", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16897385&ordinalpos=7&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15070549&ordinalpos=25&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=129", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/08/dr-amy-holmes-and-mikes-story.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/has-chelation-or-biomed-done-anything.html", "title": "\nHave Chelation or Biomed Done Anything For Their Major Proponents?\n"},

He told police on the night of August 22, 2003 that he had been holding a series of special prayer services, described by some as \"exorcisms\", during the previous three weeks to remove \"evil spirits\" of autism from the boy.  Hemphill described how he would sit or lay on \"Junior's\" chest for up to two hours at a time, whispering into his ear for the \"demons\" to leave his body. Three women -- including the child's mother, Patricia Cooper -- described to police how  they sat on the boy's arms and legs while Hemphill sat on his chest. One woman said she pushed down on Junior's diaphragm several times during the service. At some point during the service, he stopped struggling and breathing.

It's a tested device that works. ( source )  So how does it work? The thought screen helmet blocks telepathic communication between aliens and humans. An abductee who took voltage readings from a second helmet while wearing another one demonstrates that this communication is a form of electromagnetic energy.  Aliens cannot immobilize people wearing thought screens nor can they control their minds or communicate with them using their telepathy. When aliens can't communicate or control humans, they do not take them. An how do they know it works? Testimonials, what else. The thought screen helmet has effectively stopped several types of aliens from abducting or controlling humans. Only two failures from standard thought screen helmets have been reported since 1998. A third failure in 2005 was from a cloth helmet with a smaller square area of Velostat and a Velcro strap which was easily removed by an alien hybrid.

The most compelling one, perhaps, is that it's difficult or impossible to diagnose the dead retrospectively. There are also pretty good arguments against overpromoting autistic traits in famous people. For example, it has been suggested that positive stereotypes are as bad as negative ones. The rest of the arguments are not that good and are themselves based on stereotypes, e.g. autistics don't marry, autistics can't ever be successful, etc.  Then there's this odd one (or is it funny?) that I came across: Einstein was regarded as having a good sense of humour - a trait not seen in people with severe Asperger's. It appears that this argument has caught on, as it has been paraphrased all over the internet (e.g.  here ,  here  and  here ). First off, is this \"Severe Asperger's\" an official classification? How is it defined? Isn't that what one normally calls, you know, \"autism\"? Is the author of the argument saying that Albert Einstein had \"mild\" Asperger's instead? It could be interpreted that way I guess. Now, is the claim true at all? What is the evidence? I did some research. There appears to be limited evidence that autistics don't perform as well as non-autistics in tasks related to  understanding  humor. For example,  Emerich et al. (2003)  found that HFA adolescents had significantly poorer performance than controls in comprehension of cartoons and jokes.  There's always a possibility that these sorts of results can be explained as part of a language comprehension impairment. In fact, let me make a suggestion to autism researchers: If you ever find that autistics don't perform as well as non-autistics in some test, be it a Sally-Ann (ToM) test or a Weschler intelligence test, consider the possibility that it is due to a language comprehension impairment. But I digress. Is there any evidence that autistics cannot produce humor? Very little as far as I can tell. There's only one PubMed-indexed study that I could find that might remotely support that conclusion.  St James & Tager-Flusberg (1994)  is a study involving 6 autistic children and 6 language-matched Down syndrome controls. They found that the only jokes in the study were told by 2 of the children with Down's. That's not much to go on. Now let's see if there's evidence in the opposite direction.  Van Bourgondien & Mesibov (1987)  examined humor used in a group of autistic adults. The study demonstrated that autistics \"enjoy a wide range of jokes and that humor seems to enrich their lives.\" Werth et al. (2001)  is a case report of Grace, an HFA woman who the authors believe is \"unusual\" because she produces a good deal of humorous and creative word play. (Researchers are not immune to stereotypes, obviously). Lyons & Fitzgerald (2004)  also challenges assumptions about lack of humor in autism. At the risk of naming more famous people as examples, consider that comedian Dan Aykroyd has stated he has Asperger's ( source ). Other comedians suspected of being Asperger autistics include Andy Kaufman and Woody Allen. That doesn't seem far-fetched to me. Conclusion While there is not a lot of research on the matter, the claim that humor is not seen in people with \"Severe Asperger's\" is clearly unsubstantiated.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2988647.stm", "http://www.autismdietplan.com/albert-einstein-asperger-syndrome/", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3676.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=12908828&ordinalpos=5&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=7814309&ordinalpos=11&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3654492&ordinalpos=15&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=11706860&ordinalpos=8&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15628606&ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4181931"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/severe-aspergers-quick-note-about-humor.html", "title": "\nSevere Asperger's?

{"date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2007", "body": "\nWhat distinguishes pathology from non-pathology? Note that I'm not asking what distinguishes disability from non-disability, or normalcy from lack of normalcy. These are entirely different questions. Many readers probably assume I am asking a scientific question. But I do not believe it is. I think it's a question of convention, a philosophical question, and ultimately a matter that belongs in the realm of Ethics. Let me elaborate. There are conditions that no one would dispute are pathologies, e.g. various forms of cancer. When cancer is detected in someone, a considerably lowered life expectancy is practically assured. Additionally, treatment of the condition can be demonstrated to improve the survival rate. Continued medical research will no doubt improve the survival rate even further.  Then there are conditions such as ADHD that many people intuitively find dubious. When about 10% of one end of a normally distributed behavioral spectrum are labeled with a brain pathology, and most of those labeled appear unremarkable to the untrained eye, it's not surprising that people are not going to take the condition seriously. In fact, ADHD is often made fun of. Another such example is Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), a psychiatric condition that is diagnosed when a child strongly disagrees with his or her parents much of the time. It seems that the pathology status of conditions defined by conventional medicine is rarely controversial (although some examples exist, such as  hypoglycemia ). On the other hand, the pathology status of conditions defined by Psychiatry is not only often controversial, but it tends to overlap with politics. Some of this could be due to the scientific methodology used in each case, but I think it mostly has to do with the way individuals experience psychiatric conditions and the consequences of their pathology status. Admittedly, I do not understand what distinguishes pathology from non-pathology all that well, but I do not believe the \"experts\" do either. When expert psychiatrists try to apologetically argue that a condition such as ADHD is a pathology, they will invoke a number of arguments that to me appear rather weak under scrutiny. I will go over some of them. ADHD increases the risk of injury. Research shows this to be the case and it's not surprising that an over-active child would have a higher chance of getting injured. It's not clear how this demonstrates pathology, though. I could make up a syndrome on the spot with this characteristic. Extreme Sports Disorder : This is a neurological disorder that causes people to pursue extreme sports. No cause or cure have been identified. If you find this counter-argument far fetched, consider increased risk of trauma and other medical problems in left-handedness ( Canacki et al., 2003 ;  Bryden et al., 2005 ). Is this enough to classify left-handedness as a pathology like it once was believed to be? Making up new syndromes is not just a theoretical exercise. For example, the APA has been considering the inclusion of  video game addiction  in the DSM, a manual that grows considerably with every version that comes out. There are differences between the brains of people with the \"disorder\" and those without. So? Do you seriously expect there to be no differences between the brains of two groups of people who behave differently? The brains of men are different to the brains of women. I would be surprised if the brains of those with  Extreme Sports Disorder  are the same as those of the general population. Another example (that Kassiane brought to my attention) is that alien abductees have abnormal EEGs in the temporal lobe. Alien abduction is not in the DSM-IV, AFAIK. While I don't doubt psychiatrists would be in theory willing to make up a syndrome related to alien abductions, it would be interesting to see how they handle the conspiracist circus that would result. Treatment with neuroleptics controls the symptoms of the \"disorder\" and has effects on outcome. There are drugs that can affect the way people behave and feel; no one disputes that. This does not demonstrate pathology either. How difficult would it be to invent a drug that causes people with  Extreme Sports Disorder  to be afraid of danger, for example? I'm sure it would save lives. The spoof website on the \"anti-effeminate\"  Hetracil  also illustrates this point. The nature of the risk factors demonstrates pathology. I do not buy that it's about causation. Not many deaf people would consider deafness a pathology, even though there are no doubt a huge variety of causes of deafness, including injury, viruses and so on. It could be, though, that people in the general population tend to see deafness as a pathology. In that case, consider the relatively low heritability of  another condition, left-handedness ( Orlebeke et al., 1996 ). Medical correlates demonstrate pathology. Again, it's easy to demonstrate that many ways of being not considered pathologies have medical correlates. Often times the \"medical correlates\" of a made-up disease are other made-up diseases. For example, the \"scientific rationale\" for depathologizing homosexuality was that it didn't correlate with psychiatric disorders. (Incidentally, I think the gay community is asleep at the wheel if they buy this as the proper rationale). Calling something a pathology shouldn't be a big deal. Does it matter to Halle Berry, for example, whether her diabetes is called a disease or not? The short answer is that it  is  problematic when the so-called disease refers to your way of being. If it were no big deal, then shouldn't the gay community be OK with homosexuality being called a pathology?  The reasons why it is a big deal should be self-evident: (1) It redirects efforts and resources into finding an often mythical \"cure\", which many of the individuals with the condition do not want; (2) It discourages accomodation; (3) It provides a justification for discrimination; and (4) If the condition is an important part of someone's way of being, calling the condition a disease is effectively the same as calling the individual a disease. This is the case whether we're talking about a disability or a difference.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=14708648&ordinalpos=13&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16191813&ordinalpos=9&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_addiction", "http://www.hetracil.com/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=8886523&ordinalpos=27&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/emperors-new-pathology.html", "title": "\nThe Emperor's New Pathology\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, September 09, 2007", "body": "\nOver at the Rescue Post, that bastion of critical thinking and deep understanding of everything autism, they are falling over themselves because Jenny McCarthy (1994 Playboy Playmate of the Year) will be appearing in the Oprah Show. You see, McCarthy is TACA's spokeperson, an autism mom, and has written a book titled  Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism . This was known as early as May, when Kev wrote a  post about it . Here's someone who could use her celebrity power to really help the autistic community, but instead will apparently use it to peddle various sorts of unproven biomed quackery and, perhaps worse, ridiculous notions of what autistics are. I have no illusion that Oprah will prevent her from peddling even something as irresponsible as anti-vaccination junk. Reviews of the book say that she found treatments that are the \"key to saving Evan from autism.\" I don't entirely discount the possibility that ABA helped her son be trained into particular skills, but the other stuff is no doubt worthless hooey. I've read some email messages that say McCarthy's son is \"recovered\". I'm pretty sure we're looking at one of those claims about children who are \"recovering\", you know, still very much autistic, but apparently developing. If anything, it's likely to be a Holmes/Bradstreet type of recovery, if you know what I'm referring to. There's no mention of an official loss of label anywhere, but I should note that diagnoses at age 2 are often inaccurate ( Charman et al. 2005 ,  Gillberg et al. 1990 ). The child's autism was discovered at age 2 after a seizure. Some news stories say her son is \"battling autism\". Really? Is that like battling cancer? What happens if he loses? Other stories say her son \"has come a long way.\" Confusing as all that might be, let me get to the crux of the matter. Jenny, who runs IndigoMoms.com, is of the belief that Evan is a 'crystal child,' and she herself is an 'adult indigo.' This belief suggests that 'indigo/crystal phenomenon is the next step in our evolution as a human species.' Proponents also suggest that many indigo and crystal children are wrongly diagnosed with ADD, ADHD, and autism. Starchild has more information, for those interested. ( source ) I've critiqued all sorts of claptrap before, but this one takes the cake. Typical of new-agey mythology, they throw in scientific terms like \"evolution\" to give it some credibility, without even having a basic understanding of the term. That's just the beginning of what could be said about this nonsense. I honestly don't know which is worse, the belief that the New World Order is conspiring to control the world's population by giving kids autism, or this one. But wait, if the child is a highly evolved Indigo, why does he need biomed treatment? What's with the anti-vaccination posture? Has Jenny McCarthy experienced a shift in belief systems from one set of hogwash right into another? That wouldn't be a surprise. Note that IndigoMoms.com appears to have closed down for good. My sense is that Jenny McCarthy is going through a time of confusion in her life. To be fair, that's normal when you have a disabled child. Let's hope she eventually leaves the illusory promises of quackery and new-ageism behind and learns to accept and advocate for her autistic son as he is, mostly for his sake. This is not far fetched. Even someone such as  Amy Holmes  has gotten to such a place, or close to it, even if she hasn't come out publicly and admitted it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Louder-Than-Words-Mothers-Journey/dp/0525950117/ref=sr_1_1/102-4426335-3436914?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189376048&sr=8-1", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=543", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00377.x", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1990.tb00834.x", "http://www.celebrity-babies.com/2007/04/jenny_mccarthy.html", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/08/dr-amy-holmes-and-mikes-story.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/jenny-mccarthy-indigo-children-and.html", "title": "\nJenny McCarthy, Indigo Children and Other Gobbledygook\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 07, 2007", "body": "\nKristina wrote a post titled  Hating  Autism, Hating Hate  back in July, a post which I had missed then. The post is about John Best Jr., evidently, but what caught my attention was something a reader named  BRoBBcins  wrote in the comments section. I for one do hate autism, It controls my entire family. I have a little brother with autism and everything is based on wat he can handle, i cant take it anymore. My mom litterally tells me she loves him more than me. If thats not a reason to HATE the diesese idk wat is. I cannot communicate with my little brother, i cannot touch him, he doesnt even know i exist, yet my entire world is based around him. I dont think he even has feelings, hes just kind of there. Go ahead and send me and email telling me wat an evil person i am, or mabye try and help me make since of all of thise, ive tried talking to my mom about it, and she could care less about how i feel. I feel for this kid, I do. In that particular family the autistic child might be doing OK, but the NT kid is clearly suffering. It seems obvious to me he's not precisely suffering because of autism, though.  The first thing I notice is that there's sibling rivalry in that family. Despite what parents say, let's face it, some children are payed more attention to than  others. Does it matter that the child who the parents pay most attention to is autistic in this case? What would happen if we were talking about two NT kids in the same situation?  It's clear that the autism matters to  BRoBBcins  though. He sees his little brother as less deserving of parental attention than himself. That's what hurts. He feels an injustice has been committed. He also feels entitled, as Kassiane put it. I think it all has to do with the way he views autism, what he's been led to believe.  BRoBBcins  seems to believe that his little brother is less than human. Why should his parents pay so much attention to his younger sibling then? I dont think he even has feelings, hes just kind of there. As long as  BRoBBcins  fails to accept his little brother as a sentient being, as an equal, and as long as he sees autism in this manner, I'm afraid he will continue to suffer. It doesn't have to be this way, and I say this because not all siblings of autistic children feel this way. I know a little bit about this, and I know that many of my readers know about this too. My classically autistic son has an older sister. I'm rather proud of the way she views her little brother. She's very loving in the way she approaches him. They get along in much the same way any brother or sister would, and in fact, if you consider that brothers and sisters often don't get along, their relationship is probably better than most.  My step-daughter has asked about autism, why her little brother is autistic and such. We have discussed difference, disability, human equality and acceptance; as best I could. I think this is key. BTW, she recently started seeing her first \"boyfriend\", who happens to be autistic (OK, \"high functioning\", but diagnosed and everything). I think she's well equipped to be an individual who not only tolerates difference but embraces it, and yes, I take much of the credit :) I don't blame  BRoBBcins 's parents. Who knows why his views have been shaped the way they have. There's a lot of anti-autism propaganda in the media these days. They will even imply that siblings are  supposed  to feel bad about autism. The other day my wife brought home an information sheet about autism that basically said that. I read it over and thought that the reality described there was totally contrary to the reality in our family. See Also My brother or sister is different .

{"date": "Thursday, September 06, 2007", "body": "\nThe following is a bullet-point list of pieces of evidence that strongly suggest the prevalence of ASD in adults is high, at least as high as that found in children. [This evidence was first brought together in  Autism \"Missed\" Often, Even Today .] Nylander & Gillberg (2001)  screened adult outpatients of a psychiatric hospital and found that 89.5% (17/19) of \"definite autistics\" did not have a prior autism diagnosis. The most common existing diagnosis in these adult autistics was found to be schizophrenia, which was considerably more common than the diagnosis of autism itself. Stahlberg et al. (2004)  found that 30% of referred adult patients with ADHD had co-occurring ASD. The prevalence of ADHD in adults is estimated at 4.2% [ source ]. Over 25 years ago,  Shah et al. (1982)  found that 38% of the adult patients at a mental handicap hospital had impairment in two-way social interaction, which was \"very significantly associated with abnormalities of communication and imaginative activities.\" This confirmed an earlier study of mentally retarded children (Wing & Gould, 1979). The prevalence of mental retardation is roughly 1%. Baron-Cohen et al. (2001)  assessed adults with the AQ test. About 2% of those in the group of randomly selected controls scored in the 32+ range. The researchers also interviewed 11 students who scored in the 32+ range and found that all of them met 3 or more DSM-IV criteria. About 60% of the 11 met threshold criteria. The general distribution of AQ test scores was replicated in Japan by  Wakabayashi et al. (2004) . It's possible to propose alternative ways to interpret each piece of evidence, no doubt. But taken together, it's hard to argue with the inescapable no-nonsense conclusion: ASD is common in adults, albeit often undiagnosed. When I first listed this evidence, one response was that perhaps ASD is common in adults, but that it would have to be a \"mild\" form of ASD. This is the \"children are more severe these days\" argument. There's absolutely no evidence that could lead us to believe this is the case, first of all. Second, the world doesn't work like that. In any group of people, there will be a wide range of variation of skills and characteristics. There has to be a distribution of \"severity\" in ASD adults that goes from very obviously autistic to nearly neurotypical. Sure, the shape of the distribution could have shifted, but is there any compelling reason to suspect this is the case? Furthermore, Shah et al. (1982) provides evidence of high prevalence of ASD in adults who are by no means \"mild\" anything. Addendum (11/8/2007) See  Interverbal's post  about Matson et al. (2007). The researchers found that 50% of a group of adults with intellectual disabilities met criteria for PDD. Addendum (04/11/2008) See  Kev's post  about a study by Dorothy Bishop. The researchers found that 31% of a group of adults with developmental language disorder met criteria for ASD. Addendum (10/05/2008) Baron-Cohen has apparently come out with a  new study  of university students. \"In the Cambridge study, seven of 378 maths students were found to be autistic, compared with only one among the 414 students in the control group.\" Clearly, he has found that the prevalence of ASD among the students tested is at least 1.01%. Final Addendum (09/22/2009) A report on phases one and two of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) 2007  has been published .

Roughly speaking they will report that 10% of autistic individuals have \"very good outcome\" and another 10% \"good outcome\", with the remaining 80% having \"fair or poor outcome.\" (There are no indications these proportions have changed significantly after the introduction of early intensive behavioral interventions or any other interventions). The concept of \"good outcome\" is, of course, based on neurotypical values, such as having no difficulties in social interaction, living independently without supports, and so on. There are various standardized tests they use to determine if a person has good or bad outcome. Enter An alternative view of outcome in autism . Ruble & Dalrymple (1996) This is an old paper, although very innovative in my view, and never before discussed on the web as far as I can see. What they do in this paper is try to find an alternative way to define outcome in autism, based on concepts such as 'happiness', 'contributing to the community', 'learning', 'making choices', etc. They start out with a non-representative group of autistics, that is, one with unusually poor standard scores. All of the adults in the group are found to have a \"poor outcome\" based on the traditional metrics of outcome. Nevertheless, the researchers then step outside the traditional framework. Despite their social and communication difficulties, however, many of the adults from the present study were working in valued jobs, participating in family and community activities, learning to make choices, and generally happy. Thus the findings of this review, which indicated poor outcomes, led us to question the utility of traditional definitions of determining outcome and to reconceptualize this concept. The authors characterize good outomes in the group as \"invisible\" to traditional methods of qualifying outcome. They present four \"vignettes\" of adults from the group who were doing well, and then discuss variables that seem to predict good outcome. Note that the predictor variables also differ substantially from the medicalized variables you will usually find in traditional outcome studies. What seemed to be an important predictor of success was that whenever individuals and their families were confronted with challenges, they sought and successfully accessed various supports. For example, when families were told to \"place\" their young children, their parents sought and created alternatives. Some of the families were the first to push for integration in school and used their natural community and family ties to include and support their child. When families needed residential options, they created them. The families maintained monitoring and input into all the programs their children were in and kept in close contact with their children. They still do. These families identified new opportunities and advocated that their children be part of those opportunities. Family advocacy appears to have been a key factor in successful outcomes for Elaine, Ed, Andy, and Ellie. It's an interesting paper.

{"date": "Monday, September 03, 2007", "body": "\nA while back  Kev ,  Prometheus  and  Orac  discussed how underwhelming Generation Rescue's survey results were and some peculiarities of the data that seem to invalidate the survey. What I want to do in this post is go over a model that explains the survey results, including discrepancies between its findings and those of prior phone surveys. Data of this nature can sometimes result in knowledge that wasn't expected, as I will hopefully demonstrate. (I am using data Kev helpfully put into an XLS file  here ). ASD - Both Sexes Strikingly, the survey found that while 3.01% of all vaccinated children had an ASD diagnosis, about 3.73% of all unvaccinated children did. That's right. The survey found autism to be  more common  among the unvaccinated. While this difference is not statistically significant, I think Kev was correct when he characterized it as disastrous for  Generation Rescue's political goals. It also contradicts years of claims by GR itself and Dan Olmstead in regards to the Amish and so on. Later on I will explain how they managed to spin this result. [Note: 'Statistical significance' means that we can assert the survey found a difference, with 95% confidence.] As noted shortly after Kev posted his analysis, both ASD rates are very high relative to the consensus prevalence of autism. Let's compare them to a recent CDC phone survey which found the  diagnosed  prevalence of autism in the US to be 0.57%. What might explain the discrepancy? For that, we need to consider the survey's methodology. This was an automated phone survey. That is, households are contacted at random by a computer with a short recorded introductory message, in this case one that read as follows. This is SurveyUSA calling Sonoma County parents with a private, confidential survey about vaccinations and children's health. If you have a child age 4 to 17, press 1. Otherwise, press 2. ( source ) Most persons answering the phone will hang up at this point. But that would be fine if the introduction weren't so obviously biased. Evidently, parents of autistic children who are familiar with the anti-vaccination debate will be more likely to continue with the survey. In fact, given the results of the survey, it is clear that households with autistic children are about  5 times  more likely to continue with the survey than households in the general population. (We can also conclude something about SurveyUSA's best-case response rates, but that's not important to this analysis). This bias in the introductory message (' introduction bias ' from now on) easily explains the high prevalence of ASD found in the vaccinated population of children. Consider that the vast majority of children are vaccinated.  I do not, however, believe it fully explains the high rate found in the unvaccinated group. I say this because  households with unvaccinated children are no doubt likely to continue with the survey, regardless of the presence of autistic children . This is a key point. In fact, Generation Rescue was somewhat surprised to find 6% of children were completely unvaccinated. Heightened interest in the part of parents of autistic children is not going to be as significant a factor in the unvaccinated group. Therefore, a second bias, in the opposite direction, seems necessary to explain the high prevalence of autism ( 6.5 times  the CDC prevalence) in the unvaccinated population of children. I will call this the ' genetic bias ', one that is well known. That is, parents of autistic children will often not vaccinate subsequent siblings, and such siblings have a considerable higher rate of autism compared to the general population. Even in the relatively small group of parents who blog, I know of two parents who have unvaccinated autistic children: Not Mercury and Kim Stagliano. ASD - Boys vs. Girls In boys, vaccination was found to be a non-significant risk factor relative to ASD (OR = 1.17). In girls, however, vaccination was found to be a statistically significant \"protective\" factor (OR = 0.37). That is, girls are almost 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with ASD if they are  not  vaccinated, according to the survey results. The Generation Rescue leadership must not believe the results of their own survey. Otherwise, I'd expect them to post a warning such as the following on their website. Please Note : We believe vaccines pose a non-significant risk of autism in boys, but they are a protective factor when it comes to girls. We urge parents to vaccinate girls. OK. They might believe only some of their results, or they might have decided that throwing girls under the bus is the politically beneficial course of action. It seems far fetched that something would be a risk factor in boys, but a protective factor in girls. From a quick Google search I conclude this would be unprecedented. Nevertheless, the boy vs. girl discrepancy in the survey is of interest. How might it be explained? I first checked if the introduction bias is the same across boys vs. girls. It turned out to be close. I calculated the CDC prevalence of autism for boys vs. girls given the ratio reported in the press as \"nearly 4:1\". The resulting prevalence was 0.91% for boys and 0.23% for girls. The resulting bias factors (survey prevalence divided by CDC prevalence) were 5.07 and 5.57 respectively. This tells me that parental interest in the anti-vaccination issue is not significantly skewed by the child's sex. It follows that the genetic bias must be skewed, and this does appear to be the case. The bias factors in the unvaccinated group were 4.33 for boys and 15.17 for girls. That's quite surprising. To emphasize,  unvaccinated  girls participating in the survey were found to be diagnosed with ASD  15 times  as often as in the general population of girls. Either  not  vaccinating girls is a significant cause of ASD, or familial autism is more common in the families of autistic girls. (Any other explanations?) I'm inclined to believe the second explanation, though I haven't found much support for this in the literature.  Tsai et al. (2005)  comes close. Either way, this seems to be an interesting direction of future research. \"Like\" Autism and ADHD So far we have noted that the survey did not find vaccines to be a significant risk factor for ASD, either in boys or children in general. It did find vaccines to be a \"protective\" factor in girls. Despite this, Generation Rescue made the following claim. We surveyed over 9,000 boys in California and Oregon and found that vaccinated boys had a 155% greater chance of having a neurological disorder  like ADHD or autism  than unvaccinated boys. ( source ) (Emphasis mine) What they did is aggregate the data for ADHD and autism and made a general claim about \"neurological disorders\". The claim is technically true. I'm sure they could've aggregated asthma and diabetes and made a general claim about health outcomes, but that would've been too transparent. The statement is clearly not a bastion of honesty. (I'm sure readers can tell I'm holding back on my characterization of the statement). Another thing they did in their survey information page is cherry pick the highest risk ratio they found for boys with ASD, the one for plain autism, which is 1.61. They did not mention the ASD risk ratio, 1.17, which not as impressive, or the risk ratios for PDD-NOS or Asperger's in boys. ADHD The survey did find significant risk ratios in the ADHD population, and these deserve to be analyzed in their own right.  About 11.02% of the vaccinated children were reported to have ADHD vs. 5.15% of the unvaccinated children. [Note: What I'm calling ADHD here corresponds to both ADD and ADHD in the survey results. Concensus in Psychiatry is that there's just one condition called ADHD and not two.] The rate of ADHD in the vaccinated group is a bit high, although not by much. A 2003 CDC survey found that 7.8% of all children in the US had an ADHD diagnosis. (It did not vary a lot from state to state). This tells me that the introduction bias exists in ADHD too, but is not as significant as in ASD households, and this makes sense. The vaccine  hypothesis is not as politically hot in the ADHD world. It follows that the genetic bias will also not be significant, because it's unlikely that parents will stop vaccinating subsequent siblings based on an ADHD diagnosis. We're still left with a relatively low prevalence of ADHD in the unvaccinated population. But I think this can be easily explained by a third bias, which I will call the ' healthcare bias '. That is, households where children are not vaccinated are also less likely to seek diagnoses of ADHD. This is quite plausible when it comes to ADHD, given that it's such a subjective and controversial diagnosis. This bias probably exists in ASD as well, but I'd suggest it can't be nearly as common. Partial Vaccination The survey included a category called \"Partially Vaccinated.\" No doubt Generation Rescue's intention was to find some sort of dose-response relationship between ASD and vaccination. But they did not. What they found is that ASD is over-represented among the partially vaccinated, more so than among both the vaccinated or  unvaccinated. This is an obvious finding, in retrospect, considering that many parents will stop vaccinating a child once he or she is diagnosed with ASD. The survey designers must not have considered this problem. Comment and Predictions Given that fairly obvious biases explain the survey results, and given that the risk factors involved are underwhelming, I do not believe that public resources should be spent on a methodologically valid follow-up. Generation Rescue could decide to invest on a follow-up, but I see a couple problems with this: (1) Eliminating the introduction bias will result in a much more expensive survey, as more calls (probably 5 times as many) will need to be made to achieve the same level of statistical significance; (2) Generation Rescue probably realizes that by eliminating the introduction bias, vaccines will be found to be a clear \"protective\" rather than a risk factor for ASD. (Yes, you may consider that a \"dare\"). Generation Rescue has brushed off the introduction bias. I don't know if they realize this bias is only unimportant if it affects both the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations equally. I have explained why it obviously does not. Either way, a phone survey can only tell us about the approximate rates of  diagnosed  ASD in a population. It doesn't tell us much about the  true  prevalence of ASD. For that, we would need a whole-population screening. Even then, other biases, such as the genetic bias, need to be accounted for. The most interesting finding of the survey, in my view, is that unvaccinated girls are 15 times as likely to have ASD than expected based on prior surveys. This is probably not explained by the introduction bias. I believe it would have to be explained by an extraordinary genetic bias or some other bias not considered thus far.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=567", "http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2007/06/survey-says-nothing.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/fun_with_phone_surveys.php", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/grdata.xls", "http://www.generationrescue.org/pdf/questions.pdf", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/nr0x45305p883242/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/survey.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/simple-selection-bias-model-explains.html", "title": "\nA Simple Selection Bias Model Explains Generation Rescue's Survey Results\n"},

See  Lessons from Secretin  (Volkmar, 1999). Secretin was once believed to be a \"cure\" of autism. Bernie Rimland was a fan of Secretin and claimed it had an improvement rate of 70% to 75%. The mom who first noticed her son started to speak after getting Secretin had been referred to as a \"hero\" for discovering the \"cure\". There were even  multiple   case   reports  and at least one  non-controlled study  noting substantial improvement with Secretin. Then the double-blind placebo-contolled studies came. Nearly all of them showed no difference in outcome between Secretin and placebo. Some of them seemed to show that Secretin was, in fact, a little bit worse than placebo. (That's right, something that was believed to be a \"cure\" might have been causing damage instead). The studies generally demonstrated what are now believed to be  robust placebo effects  in autism. Naturally, Bernie Rimland was reluctant to accept the results of the studies, I'm not sure for how long. There's obviously some level of self-deception in discussions about biomed treatments that appear to \"work\". When I bring up Secretin, some parents will say that it's a good point, but then they'll turn around and use what I will call the my-anecdote-is-better-than-everyone-else's gambit. They will say things like \"I've been very careful in my observations of the eye contact improvements\" and so on. They will claim self-deception could never apply to them, and seem to be offended by the suggestion. They also often appear to mistake \"placebo effects\" with \"you are lying\". You see, even if a non-verbal child turns into a great conversationalist at around the same time that you give him [ horseshit  of choice here], this doesn't prove the treatment had any effect. It's not just that correlation does not imply causation, but also that anecdotes of this nature occur all the time in autism. Consider that if 10-15% of all autistic children lose their diagnosis eventually, there must be tens of thousands of such children around the world. One more anecdote of that nature doesn't tell us much.  You will find anecdotes of recovery for nearly anything you can think of: homeopathic remedies (chemical formula: H 2 O), exorcism, holding therapy, removal of TV, juice from an Amazonian fruit, etc. Heck, even Bettleheim had glowing testimonials.

{"date": "Friday, February 23, 2007", "body": "\nIn a prior post I wrote about hysteria surrounding a  \"1 in 6\" stat  that, depending on who's promoting it, includes children with psychiatric diagnoses, or children with a number of physical illnesses such as diabetes and asthma, or simply those with brain damage. The stat is sometimes accompanied by warnings of doom for the United States. Pretty soon they might be running around \"raising awareness\" of the fact that half of all children are below average, as one reader suggested. There's an unstated assumption behind the hysteria: that children used to be completely healthy before the 1990s, or at least early in the 20th century; and that except for the relative few with some known genetic mutations, cognitively disabled children did not exist for the most part. This, of course, is not true. But what's more, hysteria about cognitive disability is not new either. I first realized this when I saw a picture of a  1926 American Eugenics movement exhibit  over at  autistics.org . It reads: Every 48 seconds a person is born in the United States who will never grow up mentally beyond that stage of a normal 8 year old boy or girl. And then: Every 16 seconds a person is born in the United States. Clearly they were claiming that 1 out of 3 persons born in the United States in 1926 had a significant developmental disability. I have reasons to suspect this stat was a fabrication or an exaggeration by the American Eugenics movement. But it's not like modern organizations do not make up stats or repeat unsourced stats in order to push their agendas. There is more reliable data out there. Let's take a  1930 study review by Raymond Barnard  on the prevalence of what he calls \"speech defects\". He reported that careful studies at the time were giving a prevalence of about 5% to 8% of the school population.  This is completely in line with modern studies such as  Silva et al. (1987) ,  Wong et al. (1992) , and   Shriberg et al. (1999) . (A possible caveat is that we might be doing a bit of a comparison of apples to oranges between definitions of speech impairments). There is also some data on institutionalization from the  California State Mental Hygene Survey  of 1930. It tells us that there were 14,451 persons in state hospitals for the insane, with a total institutional population of 25,643. The article also gives us the population of the state in 1925: 4.2 million. So about 61 of 10,000 persons in the state were institutionalized. I haven't found data that could be used for a fair comparison. But let's look at California DDS data from Q4 2006. The total number of CDDS clients who live either in an Institutional Care Facility or a Nursing Facility is 8,777. If we take all clients who do not live independently or with a parent, that comes to a total of 38,216 persons. That is 11.3 of 10,000 persons in the state, or about a fifth of the total institutionalized population in the late 1920s. I should note that not all or even most persons living in mental hospitals or institutions in California are necessarily registered with CDDS, but the data point is interesting nevertheless. Those are some hard numbers I have found. If you instead prefer stories about what friends claim to remember from 20 or 30 years ago, this is definitely not the blog for you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autistics.org/library/thenandnow.html", "http://autistics.org", "http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-5984(193004)30%3A8%3C604%3ATROIAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2444484&query_hl=32&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=1306390&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10599627&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&blobtype=pdf&artid=1657631"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-absurd-notion-that-cognitive.html", "title": "\nOn The Absurd Notion That Cognitive Disability is New\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 08, 2007", "body": "\nThe current consensus prevalence of ASD is roughly 1 in 166 or 60 in 10,000, as widely known. I believe this is still an underestimate. I should clarify that I do not really believe there's a \"right\" number for autism prevalence. It's sort of like asking what is the prevalence of \"short\" or what is the prevalence of \"light skinned\". It depends on the boundary, and the boundary in autism is subjective. I believe it is somewhat subjective even when the best diagnostic tools are used. The standard deviation boundary of mental retardation is an analogous boundary, yet probably a more objective one. Nevertheless, it appears that when ASD is screened thoroughly in a population, or when there's a lot of awareness and good ascertainment, prevalence is found to be closer to 1%. This is not new. The following is what Lorna Wing and David Potter said on the subject as early as 1999. Because we concentrated on the children with learning disabilities (IQ under 70) we saw very few with the pattern described by Asperger. We had to wait for the study by Christopher Gillberg in Gothenberg to find out how many children with IQ of 70 and above were also in the autistic spectrum. As described above, combining the results of these two studies gave an overall prevalence rate for the whole autistic spectrum, including those with the most subtle manifestations, of 91 per 10,000 - nearly 1% of the general population. And then: Kadesj\u00f6 et al (1999) report a study in Karlstad, a Swedish town. Although this was small scale it was very intensive (over 50% of the 7 year old children seen and assessed personally by the first author). The study found a prevalence for all autistic spectrum disorders for all levels of IQ, of 1.21%!!! Children were followed up four years later and had the diagnoses confirmed. ( source ) I believe Kadesj\u00f6's personal assessment of 50% of 7 year olds in Karlstad is key to that finding. More recently,  Baird et al. (2006)  found a prevalence of 1.16% in South Thames, UK. In this study the authors, again, looked for children with a possibly undiagnosed ASD. Note that children in this study were born between 1990 and 1991, before the bulk of what is referred to as the \"autism epidemic\" got started. Finally, we have  Fombonne et al. (2006)  which found a prevalence of 1.076% among Kindergarten children (born in 1998) in Montreal, Canada. While there are fluctuations in the prevalence by birth year cohort in this study, there are no indications that prevalence is about to level off just yet. Additional supporting evidence comes from  Posserud et al. (2006)  out of Bergen, Norway. The authors found that 2.7% of 7-9 year olds were high scorers in the ASSQ.  In adults, prevalence of ASD can also be 1% easily considering that in studies of the properties of the AQ Test about 2-3% of adults score above 32-33, the cut-off at which an ASD is considered possible.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&a=2618", "http://ebmh.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/10/1/28", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/118/1/e139?maxtos", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01462.x"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/02/moving-toward-new-consensus-prevalence.html", "title": "\nMoving Toward a New Consensus Prevalence of 1% or Higher\n"},

The last time I posted, I looked into  David Kirby's claims about drops in some IDEA numbers  and I noted that there were discrepancies in the numbers reported by David Kirby compared to the only source he cited. I posted a request for clarification at HuffingtonPost.com, but my message was never approved apparently. I will try that again, adding a reference to this post. On January 20, David Kirby  reported  (in EOHarm) that he scanned the IDEA data for drops in the autism category between 2004 and 2005. He found 4 states that show drops in the 3-5 administrative prevalence of autism between those two years: Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana and Vermont. He adds: The declines are modest, but noticeable, and the first ever decline in actual numbers that has ever been reported, as far as I can tell. Well, he could not tell very far apparently. I went ahead and looked at  state by state data between 2000 and 2005 . After a quick glance at data for  these four states only , I can see there was a big drop in the Iowa 3-5 caseload between 2000 and 2001; one in Louisiana between 2002 and 2003; and one in Vermont between 2002 and 2003. I am sure other drops can be found in other states, particularly those with small autism caseloads. David Kirby might have been close to realizing that when he said the following: These four states have little in common and a from 4 completely different regions. The only trait they share is a relatively modest population rate. I don't know if that matters or not. You see, the 3-5 caseload in California does not show any big fluctuations because California has thousands of children in that cohort. The four states Kirby found have less than 200 autistic children in that cohort. Fluctuations are expected statistically. I made a graph of caseload in these four states for 3 year olds only. Fluctuations are more obvious in that narrower cohort, but I chose 3 year olds because that would be the most telling cohort in terms of a drop in thimerosal exposure. When you look at that graph, keep in mind that this is not a representative sample of states.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2007", "body": "\nHomosexuality is often cited as an example of how the social construction of a condition can change radically in a relatively short span of time. The modern  gay rights movement  is believed to have started in 1969. Within four years they had accomplished a major feat: Deletion of homosexuality from the DSM-II. (It is disputed whether the gay rights movement had enough political power to achieve this, but it is clear that the social climate was shifting and not necessarily because of new scientific knowledge). Medicalized views of homosexuality have today been relegated to religious extremists for the most part. An objection against the analogy between homosexuality and autism is that homosexuality is not disabling. That's fine. No analogy is ever going to be perfect. Some people think cancer is analogous to autism, despite the fact that cancer does not shape a person's way of being, and despite the fact that cancer gets gradually worse until the sufferer dies. Those same people who think cancer is analogous to autism are usually the ones who think homosexuality is a bad analogy. Go figure. Incidentally, homosexuality has been compared to cancer. Homosexuality is a disorder not in accord with Nature and, like cancer, heart disease or neurosis, is a reaction to circumstances non-existent in Nature but common in man-made circumstances. ( source ) What I was actually interested in researching is whether mainstream psychiatric opinion was that homosexuality is not disabling. I found some interesting parallels while doing so. The following is an excerpt of a 1967 letter to the British Medical Journal, by the authors of a paper on aversion therapy for homosexuality. The argument that it is society that is wrong is very misguided. Which seems more unethical: To treat someone in distress, or to suggest to him that he waits until his practice is as socially acceptable as heterosexuality? The vast majority of our patients have been sad and unhappy individuals seeking help for a problem they see as central in their lives, and pleased with the results when these have been successful. ( source ) That is a familiar argument for sure. What are distress and sadness, except disabling? A similar view was expressed in retrospect by Charles W. Socarides in \"How America Went Gay\". For most of this century, most of us in the helping professions considered this behavior aberrant. Not only was it \"off the track\"; the people caught up in it were suffering, which is why we called it a pathology. We had patients, early in their therapy, who would seek out one sex partner after another-total strangers-on a single night, then come limping into our offices the next day to tell us how they were hurting themselves. Since we were in the business of helping people learn how not to keep hurting themselves, many of us thought we were quietly doing God's work. He then adds: Excuse me. Gay is not good. Gay is not decidedly free. How do I know this? For more than 40 years, I have been in solidarity with hundreds of homosexuals, my patients, and I have spent most of my professional life engaged in exercising a kind of \"pastoral care\" on their behalf. But I do not help them by telling them they are O.K. when they are not O.K. Nor do I endorse their \"new claim to self-definition and self-respect.\" Tell me: Have we dumped the idea that a man's self-esteem comes from something inside himself (sometimes called character) and from having a good education, a good job and a good family-and replaced that notion with this, that he has an affinity to love (and have sex with) other men? ( source ) Charles Socarides and Irving Bieber formed the  Ad Hoc Committee Against the Deletion of Homosexuality from DSM-II in 1973  ( source ). Along with Edmund Bergler, these psychoanalysts were considered the last hold-outs of note against gay rights.  Edmund Bergler wrote a 1956 book whose title \"Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?\" is reminiscent of arguments we hear today portraying the autistic self-advocacy position as one stating that autism is an \"alternative lifestyle\". The book apparently received positive reviews, including one in Time Magazine ( source ). From a review elsewhere we learn of arguments that appear familiar. He again deplores that \"Kinsey's fanstastically exaggerated figures\" have done a disservice by playing into the hands of certain true (compulsive) homosexuals who tend to glorify their disorder as a \"superior way of life.\" And then: The author concludes that \"... to counteract this we must disseminate knowledge that there is nothing glamorous about suffering from the disease known as homosexuality.\" ( source ) I am not sure if there really were gay people with the sort of views Bergler refers to. I suspect the following type of reasoning in Bergler's part probably has to do with it, however:  If you do not think you are inferior, then you must think you are superior . Even some autistic adults seem to reason in this manner, judging by the following passage from \"Send in the Idiots\" by Kamran Nazeer. What I found myself arguing...was that it was arrogant to believe that I was better because I was autistic; perhaps it did equip me well for certain things, perhaps some of these were not trivial, perhaps, for example, something of my intelligence was related to being autistic; however, I had only reached the threshold beyond which I could even have this discussion with them Thanks, surely to professional help... and a lot of consideration, and work, and care. Edmund Bergler was a harsh critic of  Alfred Kinsey , who is considered the father of sexology. To put Kinsey in historical perspective, think of him as the Laurent Mottron or Morton Ann Gernsbacher of that period. (I would mention Michelle Dawson, but it is not clear if Kinsey was gay). Kinsey argued that homosexuality was common, natural and not harmful; and that there was a sort of  sexual orientation spectrum that went from \"exclusively heterosexual\" to \"exclusively homosexual\". He came up with the  Kinsey scale , which attempts to measure sexual orientation. The Kinsey scale reminds me a little of the AQ Test. Alfred Kinsey's views were attacked furiously by Bergler in a 1948 article titled \"The Myth of a New National Disease\". Some excerpts follow. Consciously, these sick persons realize only their \"righteous indignation,\" leading to self-defense and self-pity. They repress completely the fact of their own initial provocation, which began the sequence, as well as the masochistic enjoyment of self-pity. Thus the ego-strengthening illusion of \"aggression\" is maintained, and the dynamically decisive masochistic substructure is hidden. Those neurotics are \"injustice collectors.\" ... Sometimes homosexuals assert that they are completely \"happy,\" the only thing bothering them being the \"unreasonable approach\" of the environment. That is a convenient blind. There are no happy homosexuals; and there would not be, even if the outer world left them in peace. The reason is an internal one: Unconsciously they want to be disappointed, as does every adherent of the \"mechanism of orality.\" A man who unconsciously runs after disappointment cannot be consciously happy. The amount of conflict, of jealousy for instance, between homosexuals surpasses everything known even in bad heterosexual relationships.  ... Strangely enough, Kinsey sees only the antithesis: acceptance of homosexuality as a biologic fact vs. senseless segregation. He speaks disparagingly of treatment of homosexuality (he puts it ironically into quotation marks). The third possibility, namely to declare homosexuality a neurotic disease, does not even occur to him.  ... The fact remains that today homosexuality is a curable neurotic disease, requiring specific therapeutic techniques and prerequisites. ... If these figures are only approximately correct (Kinsey sticks to percentages, and does not translate them into actual numbers), then \"the homosexual outlet\" is the predominant national disease, overshadowing in numbers cancer, tuberculosis, heart failure, infantile paralysis. Of course, Kinsey denies that the \"homosexual outlet\" is a disease in the first place. But psychiatrically, we are dealing with a disease, however you slice it.  ... Last but not least, Kinsey's erroneous psychological conclusions pertaining to homosexuality will be politically and propagandistically used against the United States abroad, stigmatizing the nation as a whole in a whisper campaign, especially since there are no comparative statistics available for other countries.  ( source ) There were voices of relative reason besides Kinsey. See, for example, the work of Herbert Greenspan and John Campbell as early as 1945. Both the psychiatric and social status of the invert is becoming increasingly more clear with the advancement of clinical psychiatry, and it is encouraging to note that society is being weaned away from the fallacy that homosexualism is a crime. We are gradually coming to the realization that the homosexual suffers from a regrettable sexual anomaly, but otherwise is a normal, productive individual, who is neither a burden nor a detriment to society. We hope that the recognition of the true nature of his problem will lead to a more rational and practical therapeutic approach, and that a more humane, understanding attitude will result. ( source ) The popular media began to take notice of social changes sorrounding homosexuality in the 1960s apparently. A 1966 Time Magazine article titled \"The Homosexual in America\" approaches the issue in a way that was probably considered \"balanced\" at the time. That is the crux: most homosexuals apparently do not desire a cure. A generation ago, the view that homosexuality should be treated not as a vice but as a disease was considered progressive. Today in many quarters it is considered reactionary. Homophile opinion rejects the notion that homosexuals are sick, and argues that they simply have different tastes. Kinsey had a lot to do with this, for to him all sexual pleasure was equally valid. \"The only unnatural sex act,\" he said, \"is that which you cannot perform.\" His coauthor, Wardell Pomeroy, also argues that homosexuality should be accepted as a fact of human existence, and claims to have known many happy, well-adjusted homosexual couples. Interestingly, the article includes some shadows of \"epidemic\" talk. Whether the number of homosexuals has actually increased is hard to say. It concludes as follows. As such it deserves fairness, compassion, understanding and, when possible, treatment. But it deserves no encouragement, no glamorization, no rationalization, no fake status as minority martyrdom, no sophistry about simple differences in taste \u2013 and, above all, no pretense that it is anything but a pernicious sickness. ( source ) There's no question that the prevalence of  overt  homosexuality increased considerably at some point. In 19th century England, for example, homosexuality was extremely rare and criminalized ( source ). No doubt there was a \"hidden horde\" of gays and lesbians, if you will. A well known medical similarity is in the type of treatment, which usually involves  behavioral intervention. Some psychoanalysts claimed they could turn around 30% of homosexuals into full heterosexuals. O. Ivar Lovaas co-authored an article about the behavioral treatment of \"deviant sex role behaviors\" in children. The article was published in the Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis ( source ). The historical and political similarities are clearly substantial.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Liberation", "http://www.soilandhealth.org/02/0201hyglibcat/020122horne.21stcentury/020122ch14.html", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&blobtype=pdf&artid=1748803", "http://www.leaderu.com/jhs/socarides.html", "http://rainbowallianceopenfaith.homestead.com/TVC_APA.html", "http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808760,00.html", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&blobtype=pdf&artid=1551224", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale", "http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/bergler.htm", "http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/5/682", "http://shaunsdoodles.blogspot.com/2006/09/shauns-list-261-homosexual-in-america.html", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1044698", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/library_rekers_1974.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/01/is-homosexuality-really-that-different.html", "title": "\nIs Homosexuality Really That Different To Autism?\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 20, 2007", "body": "\nDavid Kirby is now admitting that autistic children can in fact be missed in significant numbers, and that administrative prevalence increase can be attributed to increasing recognition of the condition. This is from his  latest post  at HuffPo: But the national autism rate within IDEA is only 25 per 10,000 among 3-5 year olds, far below the estimated rate of 60 per 10,000. Ohio has only 9 cases per 10,000, Puerto Rico just 7, and Oklahoma just 4 (about 1/20th the rate of Maine). Clearly, we need to let the diagnosing and reporting catch up before drawing any solid conclusions about autism... I think that's a step in the right direction; a far cry from what he said just one month ago (which I won't address in this post): With so many holes shot through their \"five large studies\" defense, the government lawyers will be left to argue that autism is purely genetic, that there is no environmental component, and that the rates of illness have not \"really\" gone up. We are simply better at recognizing and diagnosing the disorder, that's all. My guess is that a month ago David Kirby did not know much about some of the details in IDEA, such as the fact that Maine has a special education autism prevalence of 77 in 10,000 among 3-5 year olds, whereas Oklahoma's prevalence is 4 in 10,000. I'm willing to bet this difference is not due to Maine having more crematoriums. (Oklahoma is catching up quickly too, considering that its autism prevalence has just about doubled between 2004 and 2005). It follows that David Kirby must now also believe in the mechanism of diagnostic substitution, as documented by  Shattuck (2006) . Most children with autistic disorder or PDD-NOS \"missed\" in Oklahoma, for example, are likely in the special education system, except reported as part of other categories. These other categories are probably Mental Retardation, Specific Learning Disability, and  Speech and Language Impairments . As the autism caseload rises, the caseload of some or all of these others categories can drop, and it has. Kirby's look at IDEA comes after his prediction about the California DDS 3-5 cohort failed to materialize (a fact which he, JB Handley and others have failed to acknowledge).  [ ERRATA 01/22 : In his recent debate with Arthur Allen, David Kirby did amit that his prediction failed and that this was in fact a blow to the thimerosal hypotheis] . Administrative prevalence of autism in the 3-5 IDEA cohort, nevertheless, is also on the rise as of the latest report. It went from 22 in 10,000 to 25 in 10,000 between 2004 and 2005. As a result, David Kirby has decided to try something new: Even more extraordinary was the tumbling rate of 3-5 year olds entering school with speech or language impairments, which make up nearly half of ALL disabilities in the IDEA program. In 2003 the rate was 286/10,000. In 2004 it fell to 282/10,000 and in 2005 it was 272/10,000 - a nearly 5% decline in just two years. My readers probably know how I feel about  claims by David Kirby . So I decided it was prudent to verify the claims from his latest post using data provided by  ideadata.org . And I found some information of interest. Some of the numbers are mistaken, but that is not the main problem. What I have found to be wrong and misleading is the implication that these drops are unprecedented and thus possibly explained by a drop in thimerosal exposure. Before I go on, readers should be aware that there is a caveat. Special education data are not reliable for tracking autism prevalence, as  Laidler (2005)  explains. The same should be true to an extent about other categories. I will do my best to cite everything so there's little room for doubt. First, let me get the correct rate drops from the data. In the category \"Speech or language impairments\" (3-5), special education prevalence went from 2.77% ( source ) in 2004 to 2.72% ( source ) in 2005; not as dramatic a drop as Kirby claimed. Either way, there is a drop, and I think it's important to figure out if such a drop is expected or unexpected. So I went and checked if there's earlier data to compare with. I found  table B2A  on disability prevalence for the 6-11 cohort from 1991 to 2005. This data clearly shows that (1) the administrative prevalence of speech and language impairments in the 6-11 cohort has been fairly stable throughout the 1990s and beyond, and that (2) there can be random variations in this prevalence from one year to the next. The prevalence peaked at 1.74% in 1993 and again in 2005. It had a low of 1.65% in 2001. These numbers do not support either an epidemic of speech and language impairments in the 1990s nor do they support David Kirby's claim about small drops meaning something in particular. There is also a  table of population served from 1997 to 2001 , where we can see drops in the whole population prevalence of \"Speech and language impairments\" all throughout that period. It is easy to infer diagnostic substitution from that table, particularly from mental retardation over to autism. But it just so happens that between 2004 and 2005, the 3-5 mental retardation prevalence did not drop. I think the increase in the autism category had to have come from elsewhere. Diagnostic substitution cannot explain the following claim by David Kirby, however: In 2003, the rate of enrollment among 3-5 year olds in the US IDEA program was 587 per 10,000 kids, continuing a rising trend each year for over a decade. In 2004, the rate went up again, to 594/10,000 children. But then, in December, 2005 (last year's data will be out in June) the rate fell, for the first time ever, to 580/10,000: a decline of 2.4%. Again, let me get the correct numbers first. (I suspect whoever helped David Kirby used their own population tables, which is not necessary since the reports give prevalence). The number of 3-5 year olds served by special education system in 2004 was 5.87% of the population ( source ). The number served in 2005 was 5.84% in 2005 ( source ). The difference is 0.03% of the population. Although small, it is a drop, and it does seem to be unprecendented in the 3-5 cohort in recent times. A reasonable explanation for this tiny drop is that the total number of children in the 3-5 cohort is starting to level off, and small fluctuations should be thus expected from one year to the next. How do I know this? Again, let's look at the  1997 to 2001  table. You will note that while the percentage of 3-5 year olds served increased steadily throughout that period, the precentage of 6-21 year olds served was fairly stable. This suggests there is probably an earlier age of diagnosis factor in 3-5 trends. You will also note the percentage of children served does drop from time to time, as it did between 1999 and 2000 in the older cohort. So there's probably no significance to the drop from 5.87% to 5.84% of the population. A more noteworthy change is one that occurred in Maine, as David Kirby explains: In Maine, the Special Ed rate among 3-5 year olds fell from 1,178/10,000 to 1,080/10,000 - down 3.3% in a single year. The numbers are actually correct in this case, and the drop is pretty signicant in my opinion. An expected 1.7% of the state's 3-5 year olds are missing from the IDEA system in 2005. Special education budget cuts are a likely explanation for this drop, but let's determine why Maine might be an unusual state. Remember how David Kirby suggested that the reason autism rates are not dropping is because we need to let diagnosing and reporting catch up to the epidemiology? Well, we don't have that problem with Maine. In 2004, the administrative prevalence of autism in the state was 66 in 10,000. That is even a little higher than the epidemiology. So it must have dropped by 2005, right? Well, no, it increased to 77 in 10,000. That is not a tiny change. Maine is the US state with the highest administrative prevalence of autism. They must diagnose autism liberally compared to other states. But that's not all. They also have the 3rd highest proportion of 3-5 year olds served by the IDEA system in the US (after Wyoming and Kentucky). It would not be surprising if they tried (or had) to move in the direction of the rest of the country. Maine's increase of 0.11% in the \"Autism\" category is matched exactly by a drop of 0.11% in the \"Speech and language impairment\" category. Most of the whole population drop is apparently in the \"Developmental delay\" category. It appears that the definition of \"Developmental delay\" is created by each state ( source ). In conclusion, I do not believe David Kirby's latest post has a leg to stand on. But to his credit, he really does know how to  muddy the waters .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/and-now-for-something-com_b_39075.html", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/4/1028", "http://ideadata.org", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/116/1/e120", "https://www.ideadata.org/tables28th/ar_1-11.htm", "https://www.ideadata.org/tables29th/ar_1-11.htm", "https://www.ideadata.org/docs/PartBTrendData/B2A.html", "https://www.ideadata.org/docs/PartBDataMeetingProfiles/50STATESDC&PR.pdf", "https://www.ideadata.org/tables28th/ar_1-11.htm", "https://www.ideadata.org/tables29th/ar_1-11.htm", "https://www.ideadata.org/docs/PartBDataMeetingProfiles/50STATESDC&PR.pdf", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/law/code_regs/IDEARegs_PartC.htm", "http://vaccinethebook.typepad.com/mt/2007/01/a_story_with_le.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/01/david-kirby-toys-with-idea.html", "title": "\nDavid Kirby Toys With IDEA\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 03, 2007", "body": "\n There has been some buzz lately about California DDS caseloads in older cohorts. See, for example,  this post  by Kev with graphs of  caseload increase in the 62-99 and 52-61 cohorts. Interestingly, in the 1990s there wasn't just a lot of growth in the numbers of autistic little ones in the system, but autistics of all ages apparently. JB Handley noted that the 62-99 caseload is still rather small, however, and he's right of course. Rick Rollens wrote a rant along the same lines, which follows. I for one am really sick and tired of the current stock of \"the world is flat\" thinkers who continue to spew the notion that there has been no real increase in autism, that the prevalence and incidence of autism has remained the same all these years, and in years past we simply over looked thousands of persons with autism, and today we finally found them. Bottom line: they have always been here. I believe that applying a little common sense and facts provided by our California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) we can once and for all drive the spike of fact and truth into the heart of these modern day flat earth society members who may be living in our world, but seem to be far removed from it's obvious realities. Premise : If there has not been a true, dramatic increase in the incidence of autism creating an autism epidemic, then we should have among us a proportional and sizeable number of adults with autism. Since DDS's data only includes those persons with autism who have a professional diagnoses of full syndrome (i.e. worst form) of autism, we can assume that hiding, misplacing, loosing or not recognizing thousands of adults with moderate to severe behavioral issues, extremely apparent bazaar social behaviors, and moderate to severe language deficits would be impossible. We are not talking about a person here who melds into society and is not noticed and/or is not in need of major supports and assistance. They would have to be somewhere, and somewhere for adults likes these in California would either be in the community or in an institution. Now I guess it is possible that some could be homeless, but as far as I know there has never been reports of large numbers of persons with moderate to severe autism running amok through homeless shelters and soup kitchens, if they were there, I am sure we would have heard about it by now. California's developmental services system has been in place since 1969...38 years for adults with autism and their families to find their way into the system. Facts: According to the latest data from DDS, there are 2,809 persons with autism in California's DD system...16% or 5125 are adults over 22 years old. That means for the autism population that 84% are under the age of 22, with 78% under the age of 18. It is a remarkable fact that adults with autism make up only 16% of the autism population, while in the same DD system 55% of the cerebral palsy population, 61% of the mental retardation population, and 63% of the epilepsy population are adults over the age of 22 years old. Using an average of the CP, MR, and epilepsy populations, it is safe to assume that adults over the age of 22 with moderate to severe autism should constitute roughly 60% of the total autism population, not 16% as they do and have for many years. So, rather then having just 5125 adults currently in our system with full syndrome autism, we should have somewhere around 19,685 adults with full syndrome autism if you believe the flat earth folks that there has been no real change in the incidence of autism. We do know that there are a very small number of adults with autism in California's five remaining state institutions... 358 to be precise. So doing the math leads me to these conclusions: Based on the fact that roughly 60% of adults with the three other conditions served by California's DD system (MR, CP, and Epilepsy) are over the age of 22 years old, and recognizing that we have only 5125 (16%) of the autism population over the age 22, add in the 358 who currently reside in state run institutions, we are short 14,202 adults with autism in our system that should be there! That number represents 43% of the entire current autism population in California's DD system. 43% of the population missing? Over 14,000 adults in California suffering with full syndrome autism and no one has seen or heard from them? Is this possible, or is it that they simply do not or ever existed. Is it also a fact that DDS has documented, in two separate Reports, that California's autism epidemic began roughly 22 plus years ago. Believe me when I say....The world is round. I think the flaw in Rick Rollens' argument is obvious: He assumes that CDDS autism counts are a good approximation of the number of autistic persons in the state of California for any age group. This is an incorrect assumption, and not just probably incorrect or a little bit incorrect. I will now provide a numerical argument as to why. The DSM-IV-TR prevalence of PDD in the population with mental retardation is about 16% ( source ). This estimate appears to be conservatively valid in adults, going back at least 24 years ( source ). Let's now take the mental retardation caseload in the 52-61 cohort as of Q4 2006, which is 10,632. We should thus expect that 1,701 CDDS clients have PDD with mental retardation. It seems to me that these 1,701 autistics in the 52-61 cohort could easily have an \"autism\" classification in their records. Instead, we find that only 325 do. CDDS has missed  at least  80.9% of all autistics in that cohort. I emphasize \"at least\" because among young autistic clients, mental retardation is relatively rare. This all comes to show that CDDS ascertainment is nowhere close to accurate, and it is least accurate in older cohorts. In reality all the California DDS report can give us is an approximate lower bound on ASD (not even autistic disorder). Rick Rollens admits his argument is based on the following premise: Since DDS's data only includes those persons with autism who have a professional diagnoses of full syndrome (i.e. worst form) of autism, we can assume that hiding, misplacing, loosing or not recognizing thousands of adults with moderate to severe behavioral issues, extremely apparent bazaar social behaviors, and moderate to severe language deficits would be impossible. He is clearly assuming that (1) if an autistic person is not registered with CDDS, then they were \"missed\"; and that (2) all autistic persons registered with CDDS have \"autism\" in their records. Neither of these assumptions have ever been determined to be factual, which is a fatal flaw in this type of argument. Also,  Autism Diva  discussed the \"full syndrome\" characterization. It's not really the way Rick Rollens would have us believe. So, yeah, the world is not flat; but neither is CDDS autism ascertainment, obviously. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=500", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15755304&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=7149707&query_hl=4&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/02/only-mad-dogs-and-engrishmen.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/02/heres-where-rick-rollens-is-wrong.html", "title": "\nHere's Where Rick Rollens Is Wrong\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 14, 2007", "body": "\nI haven't yet had a chance to watch video of the Kirby-Allen debate, but there have been some informal assessments from people who were there. I hear David Kirby put on a show, albeit a fact-free one, which is not surprising. I have blogged about  David Kirby's intolerable love affair with fabrications and unsubstantiated claims  in the past. While Mr. Allen probably did his outmost to stay within the bounds of scientific fact and rational discourse, David Kirby apparently relied on off-topic speculation, showmanship and made-up excuses. As  widely predicted , mercury militants have not come clean after the California DDS 3-5 caseload failed to drop in 2007. The thimerosal hypothesis is officially pseudo-science, as its proponents continue to shift the  falsifiability  goalposts to increasingly ridiculous lengths. One of the most bewildering excuses I've seen is that the aluminum dose has increased in vaccines as thimerosal was phased out. And it's not just David Kirby who has established goalposts he has later decided to ignore. JB Handley has said the following: Late 2006 should be the first time that rates go down. If they don't, our hypothesis will need to be reexamined. ( Source ) David Kirby does deserve some credit for imagination. He came up with to-date unheard-of excuses that play on people's justified concerns about environmental pollution and climate change. This was in addition to the usual excuses. I will now address the whole list of excuses as recalled by Vera Smith in the EOHarm mailing list on January 13, 2007. 1.  California has a lot of HMOs (50% of population) who probably continued to use mercury vaccines longer than average. This is clearly unfounded speculation. What is the evidence that HMOs used mercury longer than average? How much longer? 2.  We do not know when 25 mcg infant vaccines really made it off the shelves.  When the CDC says the supply was down to 2% in 2003 (I think that was the stat) it was not official.  They called vaccine providers and asked what was in the fridge -- not a definitive answer. The information Arthur Allen provided is from the minutes of a CDC meeting held on February 20-21, 2002 at the Atlanta Marriott North Central Hotel. The following is an excerpt of the minutes: Mr. Dean Mason presented a chart of the thimerosal-containing vaccines/toxoids in the pediatric schedule and under the C.D.C. contract (not all of which are licensed in the U.S.). N.I.P. estimated the amount of thimerosal in provider vaccine inventories in a survey conducted September 20, 2001 to February 20, 2002. The targets were a convenience sample of providers getting  site visits  from public health officials across the country. Inventory counts were done of all refrigerators for D.T.a.P., Hib, and hep B pediatric vaccines. The thimerosal classification was based on the lot number information, which was verified by the manufacturers. In September 2001, 225 sites were canvassed, and 447 by February 2002.  The decline in thimerosal-containing vaccine went from 5.6 percent to 1.9% , from 33,500 doses out of 63,600; to 2,796 doses out of 149,147. These were delineated by D.T.a.P., D.T.P., Hib, hep B-Hib, and hep B. Hep B rose from 4.95 percent to 7.5%; the proportion that is pediatric (10 microgram) versus adolescent versus adult (5 microgram) still requires evaluation. However, the N.I.P. thinks that most of it is pediatric.  (Emphasis mine) I wonder what part of \"site visits\" David Kirby got confused about. In fairness, he probably didn't even get a chance to read the minutes of the meeting. In the  warm-up debate on Fox 6  it was clear that Arthur Allen surprised David Kirby with the information about the sharp decline in thimerosal uptake. Kirby looked like a deer in the headlights, but he had one whole day to make stuff up. Was David Kirby suggesting that physicians lied about what they had in their fridges? Were they supposed to have made up lot numbers? This obviously borders on the preposterous. Besides, it is known that the  lifecycle of vaccines is not too long . Let's move on. 3.  Calif has had horrendous forest fires over the last 5 years (much more so than the previous 20), and pregnant women are breathing the fumes.  Forrest fires release a lot more mercury than even coal fired power plants. Oh my. It is true that forest fires have increased in California, and this is attributed to global warming. The increase is not something that just started to happen in the last 5 years, however; rather, there is an increasing trend that starts in about 1987 ( source ). The forest-fires-cause-autism hypothesis lacks merit, and I suspect most people can see the utter nonsense of Kirby's proposition. For one, a substantial number of the autistic children currently diagnosed would be expected to live around forested areas in California. It is easy to verify that this is not the case. In fact, autistic children tend to be diagnosed more often in areas with high population density. Second, if this new hypothesis were true, a clear season-of-birth trend would have been noticed. 4.  The horrific coal generated mercury pollution from China (as we have been reading) is getting worse and the mercury by-product is brought into CA (particularly So Cal) from the jet stream.  These coal fired power plants have expontially increased since 2000. Interestingly, mercury militants have blamed the US for \"poisoning\" children in China with thimerosal. Now David Kirby is blaming China for sending contaminants to the US. It is true that pollution from China is deposited in the western US, and coal emissions are estimated to increase about 10% per year ( source ). Let's suppose  this is currently a major cause of autism in California, which would need to be for Kirby's excuse to make sense. How would it explain large differences in the prevalence of autism from one regional center to the next? More importantly, how does it explain large differences in the current  pace  of caseload increase between regional centers? (The \"epidemic\" of autism is in full swing in the Central Valley Regional Center, for example, with an annual caseload growth rate of about 24%). 5.  The CDC recommended flu shots for pregnant women and infants.  As Kirby pointed out, that merucry exposure to an in-utero infant from a flu shot could be as devasting (paraphrasing here) as the entire US vaccine schedule of the 1990s given that an in-utero baby is a fraction the size of an infant.  Allen refuted this argument that only 25% of California infants get the flu vaccine and only 13% of pregnant women get it. It should be noted that the flu vaccine is not recommended for infants under 6 months of age. Even if we were to assume that all children get the flu vaccine, thimerosal exposure from this is much lower than pre-epidemic levels of exposure. Regarding vaccination of pregnant women, are we to assume a substantial portion of  autistic children currently diagnosed were born from the small percentage of mothers vaccinated against the flu while pregnant? What is the evidence that this is the case? What is the evidence that the fetus receives a substantial portion of the mercury the mother is injected with? Would this mean that all children who became autistic this way have early-onset autism? To recap, Kirby has provided a list of excuses aimed at obfuscating the evident failure of a bad hypothesis. None of the mechanisms he proposes can be correlated to changes in California autism caseload trends. The excuses are based on far-fetched, easily refuted speculation, stuff he made up that came out of nowhere, and in at least one case, an outright fabrication.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://interverbal.blogspot.com/2007/01/my-newfound-psychic-ability.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability", "http://www.generationrescue.org/pdf/news/timesunion.pdf", "http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/755/2332/1600/672293/Screenshot_5.png", "http://youtube.com/watch?v=Km_YiI91V2c", "http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/109867588/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0", "http://www.uagrad.org/Alumnus/gw/fire.html", "http://healthandenergy.com/china_burning_more_coal.htm"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/01/forget-aluminum-blame-china-and-forest.html", "title": "\nForget Aluminum - Blame China and Forest Fires\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 11, 2007", "body": "\nThe latest  quarterly client characteristics report  out of California DDS is out. As expected, the number of autistic clients in the 3-5 cohort has increased. There were 6,188 such clients in the Q3 2006 report and 6,348 such clients in the Q4 2006 report. Annual caseload growth in the 3-5 cohort is 11.76%, which at the moment is a fairly stable rate and still a lot higher than population growth in the state. Let me now post the obligatory Citizen Cain quote: Understandably, Kirby doesn't seem interested in mucking around in the data with me too extensively, or in answering my detailed questions. But in an e-mail, he did address the key point, and concede that \u201cif the total number of 3-5 year olds in the California DDS system has not declined by 2007, that would deal a severe blow to the autism-thimerosal hypothesis.\u201d He also conceded that total cases among 3-5 year olds, not changes in the rate of increase is the right measure. Citizen Cain also had some interesting things to say about the scientific method: Now we're getting somewhere! Somewhere that's something like science! We now have agreement from someone highly sympathetic to the hypothesis that thimerosal exposure contributes to autism on a means of falsifying that hypothesis. That's right. One of the ways you tell science from pseudo-science is through  falsifiability . For a moment there Kirby proposed falsifiability criteria on a hypothesis, making it potentially scientific. Will this hold up now? Probably not. David Kirby has  shifted goalposts  before. My hunch is that Kirby will not own up to his prediction. From his latest blog post the strategy seems pretty clear. Autism incidence is not going down, so he's now focusing on a new syndrome he made up that he imagines underwent an \"epidemic\" and presumably is or was on an downward trend. On EOHarm he's also been expressing interest in the  environmental pollution hypothesis , which in my opinion is flawed in exactly the same way the  TV hypothesis  is. Here is a recap of other reactions you should expect to see from the mercury militia: Thimerosal in the Flu vaccine is enough to sustain the epidemic on its own. (Unstated: Autism rates are not dose-dependent; there wasn't really an autism epidemic in the 1990s; autism started in 1931 but was recognized much later at current rates). The epidemic was caused by thimerosal in the RhoGAM shot, not that in pediatric vaccines. There is another vaccine ingredient (e.g. aluminum) which is interchangeable with thimerosal as an autism risk factor, and the dose of this ingredient was increased in a precise manner such that removal of thimerosal would not be noticed. Clearly, it will be very difficult for the autism-thimerosal worldview to survive and continue to be one of interest in the autism community.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 09, 2007", "body": "\nIf you visit the website for Talk About Curing Autism (TACA), you will note one of their taglines reads as follows: Some of our families have been told to put their child in an institution. We're hoping for Harvard. There's so much wrong with this tagline that I thought a full blog post was needed to address it. To begin with, we have this common claim about how doctors have recommended institutionalization. This doesn't match my experience, but I've heard this anecdote so many times that I have to conclude some doctors still do this. It is wrong for them to continue to do this, and there are number of different reasons of various types as to why this is wrong. Some people would argue that absolutely no one should be institutionalized under any circumstances. When it comes to autistic children specifically, there is no scientific reason to recommend institutionalization, nor any reason to suppose most autistics end up institutionalized. In fact, most adult classic autistics seem to live either at home with a parent or in community care. Some live independently. The outcome of autistic individuals is rather unpredictable. TACA is helping promote the idea that autistics belong in institutions. I am sure that is not the intent of the parents who manage TACA, but that is effectively what they are doing. The premise in TACA's tagline is that an autistic person must be cured for them to be able to attend a university such as Harvard. There are a number of reasons why this is wrong.  First, this unintentionally promotes the idea that it is acceptable for universities to discriminate on the basis of disability. That is, if an applicant is autistic, they can be rejected on the basis of autism; because, after all, an autistic person must apparently be cured before being able to attend a university. There is also something that seems factually wrong about the premise of the tagline. It assumes that autistics are less likely to go to college than non-autistics. I do not know if this is true. I know that outcome studies have found that some classic autistics do end up going to college. And not all non-autistics go to college. In the US looks like about 24.4% of all people end up getting a Bachelor's degree or higher ( source ). Turning that around, I do not believe autism is less common inside universities than in the general population. (There's not a lot of data on the matter, but I can provide some specific details why I do not believe this). There are non-cured autistics who teach in universities, e.g.  Temple Grandin , Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University. There is at least one non-cured autistic who has won a Nobel Prize in an academic field, Vernon Smith, Professor of Economics and Law at George Manson University. I'm only mentioning diagnosed autistics. Autism organizations would better spend their resources trying to understand how successful autistics got to where they are in the absence of a cure, instead of pursuing dead ends such as the thimerosal hypothesis in the futile and notoriously unsuccessful search for an unlikely cure. That is part of what the  petition to the NIH  is about. Finally, what is it with mentioning Harvard specifically? Hope and positive thinking are good things, for sure. But expecting that the very unlikely will come true is quite another. It's not good for the mental well-being of the person having the expectation, and it cannot be good for the person who is pressured into fulfilling the expectation. Harvard apparently admits just over 1000 students every year, and about 4 million Americans are born every year in the United States. The odds aren't too realistic, either for autistics or non-autistics. Of course, if it turns out that someone really does have a shot at being admitted there, they should definitely give it a try. That's not what I'm arguing against.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2002-06-05-education-census.htm", "http://www.grandin.com/temple.html", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/nih-response/"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/01/about-one-of-tacas-taglines.html", "title": "\nAbout One of TACA's Taglines\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, January 03, 2007", "body": "\nIf you thought David Kirby's \"mercury defenders\" post was odd, wait until you read his latest installment titled  There is no autism epidemic . Already  Kev  and  Kristina  have addressed the arguments and claims in Kirby's post, so what I want to do here is look at the likely intentions and assumptions behind the post. Let's start by noting that this is apparently the first time David Kirby has commented on the neurodiversity movement. He feels neurodiversity advocates are among the most vocal of his critics, who he claims are trying to \"vilify\" him. He must be referring to rebuttals of his arguments, calls for him to source unlikely claims and to come clean on prior predictions. These adults argue passionately that autism is neither a disease nor a disorder, but rather a natural and special variation of the chance genetic imprint left upon human behavior. Perhaps Mr. Kirby is reading this blog. Maybe I should consider renaming it to \"Natural and Special Variation\". He's clearly making some generalizations. For one, the neurodiversity movement includes many non-autistic parents of autistic children. Additionally, while I do believe that various genes must be important factors in autism, there's no denying that the environment and epigenetics must also play a role (as they do in nearly everything about humans). There's also no denying that various environmental causes of autism are known, e.g. congenital rubella.    Certainly, Kirby's 2007 CDDS prediction must be on his mind. He must expect the  community of bloggers who closely follow and are skeptical of the thimerosal hypothesis to be the ones to ask him to come clean on that prediction. And most of that community, surely not all, is made up of neurodiversity advocates. Under these circumstances he's decided to offer a \"truce\" of sorts. The \"truce\" consists of, get this, proposing that he's not been referring to \"autism\" all along, but to a new  disorder he's made up called \"Environmentally-acquired Neuroimmune Disorder\" (END). Of course he's not being serious or candid about this, but let's play along. The criteria for the new disorder he's made up is roughly the following: A. The child begins talking, and then suddenly never says another word. (END must thus be a subset of CDD). B. Child may never learn to read, write, tie their shoes or fall in love. (Not really part of criteria, but an unspecified expectation about the syndrome I'm guessing). C. Child wails in torture (usually at odd hours of the night) because something inside them hurts like a burning coal. D. Child has inflamed, distressed gut, and bowel movements wind up in rivers of diarrhea or swirls of feces spread on a favorite carpet or pet. E. Frequently escapes from home, and is found freezing wandering around.   F. Child spins like fireworks, and may crack head as a result. G. Child stares at nothing and screams at everything. H. Child bites mother. I think he forgot \"breaks mother's arm\". I would suggest comparing notes with Mark Geier. I doubt there's any validity in defining a new syndrome in this manner. But what's clear from Kirby's post is his intention to shock by means of gross descriptions such as \"rivers of diarrhea\". Of course autistic kids have diarrhea. More often than non-autistic kids? Maybe, I don't really know. There are no rigorous studies on the matter as far as I can tell. Has David Kirby never had a diarrhea attack? There are obviously a number of incorrect assumptions that went into Kirby's mental gymnastics, which I think are the following: Autistic self-advocates and children of neurodiversity advocates do not have these characteristics. This has been debated repeatedly. See, for example,  this  and  this . All children of mercury militants do have these characteristics. This is false. There are many mercury parents of kids who aren't too obviously autistic. Furthermore, children of prominent curebie parents are growing up, and some do not seem to agree with curebie-ism, as they are  apparently starting to revolt . There is an epidemic of END. There is no way to know this, as there is no epidemiology on the characteristics Kirby describes. What is the evidence of an increase in the prevalence of these characteristics? END is caused by thimerosal. Those symptoms (rivers of diarrhea, spinning like fireworks) certainly do sound like symptoms reported after instances of mass mercury poisoning from historical reports, right? It's difficult to find any merit in Kirby's latest attempt at arguing who knows what. There's another Geierism in the post which I wanted to address: American kids are in huge trouble. One in six has a learning disability. Is this true? Please provide a source Mr. Kirby. It appears that the prevalence of learning disability in the US is 1.69% ( source ) or 1-2% ( source ), even though approximately 2.5% of the population scores below 70 in IQ tests (which is a stable rate, BTW). If we go back to a  1981 study , it appears that 10% of children were identified as being  at risk  of learning disability. That was long before the \"epidemic\" of neurological disorders. I have found  other studies  with somewhat higher rates, but nothing near 1 in 6 children. I guess it depends on how it's defined. If you make dyslexia a learning disability, and you include every child who is even a little dyslexic, then sure, 1 in 6 is plausible. But perhaps David Kirby is referring to the prevalence of psychiatric conditions among children, and if you consider that the prevalence of ADHD in children is about 10%, I can see how 1 in 6 might be right. But then what does ADHD have to do with the END syndrome of Kirby's post? I fail to see the connection, and in fact, it makes no sense for him to consider ADHD after stating he's only concerned about \"severe\" symptoms. There's a  picture of a 1926 American Eugenics Movement exhibit  over at autistics.org. The exhibit reads: Every 48 seconds a person is born in the United States who will never grow up mentally beyond that stage of a normal 8 year old boy or girl. Every 16 seconds a person is born in the United States. In other words, 1 out of 3 persons born in the United States had a considerable mental handicap in 1926 according to that exhibit. Mistaken and biased? Perhaps, but the type of discourse is very similar to that of David Kirby or Mark Geier, isn't it?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/there-is-no-autism-epidem_b_37647.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=489", "http://www.autismvox.com/david-kirby-on-there-is-no-autism-epidemic-and-autism-vox-on-his-rhetoric/", "http://www.autistics.org/library/ambweintraub.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=404", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=482", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/l/learning_disabilities/prevalence.htm", "http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nnp/teaching/disorders/learning/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=7246720&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=7803034&dopt=Citation", "http://www.autistics.org/library/thenandnow.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/01/kirby-its-about-rivers-of-diarrhea-and.html", "title": "\nKirby: It's About \"Rivers of Diarrhea\" and Kids who \"Spin like Fireworks\"\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2006", "body": "\n Wakefield et al. (1998) , despite having been partially retracted, is the paper considered mostly responsible for an autism-related anti-vaccination scare that started with the MMR vaccine and subsequently evolved to include thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs). The MMR vaccine has been the focus of hype mostly in the UK, whereas TCVs are most often blamed for autism in the US. If you  search the VAERS database  for reports  filed  in all of 1997 on MMR-attributed autism, you will find 16 reports of adverse events. If you do the same search in all of 2002, you will find 120 reports. That gives you an idea of the effect of MMR hype on what parents attribute autism to. Thankfully, the number of such reports appears to be declining in recent years, with only 40 in all of 2005. Lingam et al. (2003)  found that not only did the rate of attribution of regression to the MMR vaccine changed post-Wakefield, but some parents apparently changed their story as well. Widespread public concern about the possible relation between autism and MMR began in August 1997, with the pre-publication release of information about the Wakefield study, which attracted considerable and ongoing media attention. The date at which onset of developmental regression was first recorded in the notes was obtained for the 106 cases. After excluding unvaccinated cases and those vaccinated when aged over 24 months (of whom all but one were children vaccinated in the 1988-89 catch-up campaign), we found MMR was reported as the trigger in 6/30 (20.0%) post-August 1997 compared to 2/46 (4.3%) before August 1997 (p = 0.052).  From August 1997 the reported presence or timing of regression changed in 13 cases. For six of these, regression was mentioned for the first time after August 1997, even though many health professionals had seen these children before this date. In seven cases the recorded timing of onset of regression changed in relation to MMR: six closer, one further away. But there is some other data of interest in Lingam et al. (2003) which I wanted to go into. They survey parents about triggers thought to cause regression. In 44 (42%) of the 106 children with detailed information on regression, a specific trigger was mentioned as a possible cause. The most common (13 children) was a household or social change such as the birth of a sibling, then vaccination (12 cases). Other triggers mentioned were: viral and bacterial infections (n = 7), seizures (n = 7), postsurgery (n = 2), and other causes (n = 3). The MMR vaccine was mentioned specifically in eight of the 12 cases where a vaccine was suspected. Although families would not have been directly asked about this possibility, this finding suggests that very few parents (less than 2% in this cohort) considered that MMR vaccine might have triggered their child's autism. Interestingly, in this post-Wakefield survey, there is one trigger parents seem to attribute regression to more often than vaccination: Household stress, such as the birth of a sibling.  In case there are doubts about this, let's look at another survey on language regression,  Shinnar et al. (2001)  (full HTML text can be temporarily found  here ). The following is what they found. Fifty-two families (29%) reported a trigger to the regression (Table 2). The most common triggers reported included family stresses (n=23), such as the birth of a sibling (n=10) or moving (n=7), seizures (n=13), or infectious/immunologic triggers (n=14). More specifically, they found that only 8% of parents attributed regression to immunization, compared to 19% who blamed the birth of a sibling, and 44% who blamed family issues in general. It is often said that autism researchers would do well to pay attention to parental experiences. There is some definite merit to this idea, of course, as there is merit to the notion that researchers should listen to autistics themselves. It follows that there must be a whole subfield of autism science dedicated to studying the link between family stress and autism/regression, right? Well, I'm unable to find much of anything about this link through Google Scholar. But surely, the potential link must have been mentioned as part of the Combating Autism Act, correct? No, apparently not. At least there must be mailing lists established to discuss this link or blogs where it has been mentioned, right? Not that I know of. I actually believe this is the first blog post where the link between stress and regression is the main topic of the post. Why might this be? I suggest it's because there won't be class-action lawsuits that address the stress caused by the birth of siblings. There aren't specific big corporations that can be blamed for family issues. There is no role for the illuminati to play. And perhaps most importantly, it seems difficult to come up with grandiose promises of cure for stress-induced autistic regression.

{"date": "Friday, December 22, 2006", "body": "\nVia Brett I've learned of an article titled  Study: Most Self-Diagnosed \"Asperger's\" Patients Just Assholes  claiming to report on a study published in The Lancet, no less. After checking out the website where the article is posted, www.ridiculopathy.com, it's clear this is just one of their spoofs. Nevertheless, I think there's a reason why someone came up with the idea of making fun of self-identified adult autistics, and this is something that should be addressed and debated by our community. It surely has to do with the fact that 30 years ago there was no one identified as having Asperger's, yet there is probably nothing biologically new about today's adults. I think most people would prefer to keep the ad-hoc labels of the past (\"asshole\" being one of them) as opposed to having to deal with (and perhaps even accept) the impairments and peculiarities of others. A similar theme was  explored by the TV show House , where the main character was suspected of having Asperger's but was later characterized as having to face the fact that he was merely being a \"jerk\". Much of the importance of the issue rests in the fact that opponents of autism self-advocacy attempt to use the existence of self identification to their advantage. Think Lenny Schafer. Never mind that undiagnosing someone over the internet is obviously less valid than any non-professional self-assessment. The \"explosion\" in adult diagnoses and self-diagnoses of ASD certainly seems to parallel that of diagnoses in children. That is, they started to occur mostly in the 1990s, and really exploded in the late 90s. I first learned about Asperger's in 1998, which is roughly when the internet was experiencing a substantial boom. Doubts about the validity of ASD diagnostic labels are not restricted to adulthood, mind you, as evidenced by an article by one Katie Grant titled  Some 'autistic' children aren't ill, they're just badly behaved  (which was not a spoof, sadly). Before I continue, I think a personal disclaimer is in order. I do have what I consider to be a diagnosis, given to me by my son's psychiatrist. It was a quick diagnosis and it's not in writing, mind you, but I don't really have use for anything beyond that. Plus I have an autistic son, a dad with clear autistic characteristics in early childhood, and my own childhood history which includes hyperlexia. There are many other relevant facts about my family and myself which I won't go into. So I have no doubt I'm autistic, and neither does my wife. My parents seem to be mostly accepting of the fact that I'm autistic at this point. But in many cases a diagnosis of ASD, particularly a self-diagnosis, might leave room for doubt. The matter is complicated by the fact that there are no medical tests for ASD and it's unlikely there will ever be a simple, accurate test.  Whether self-diagnoses are valid or not is primarily a scientific question in my opinion. Intuitively, it seems to me people would be able to determine what they are most of the time. But while it would not make sense for people to be wrecklessly giving themselves false psychiatric labels (consider the potential impact on any employment, for example) error is always a possibility, as is hypochondria. I'm aware that professionals warn against self-diagnoses of ASD. But is there a study which documents the inaccuracy of self-diagnoses of ASD specifically? Not that I know of. I think such warnings are based on educated hunches, nothing more.  While studies on the validity of self-diagnoses of ASD don't appear to exist, I wouldn't say nothing is known about them. Let's look at what I believe are the two most often used instruments involved in self-diagnosis. Aspie Quiz AQ Test The owner of the Aspie Quiz makes some relevant claims about that instrument. For example, that the test has been adjusted over time based on the performance of each question. And that self-diagnosed autistics, surprisingly, tend to score slightly higher than diagnosed autistics. Interesting as these claims are, it's important to note there are no published studies on the validity of the Aspie Quiz. The AQ Test, on the other hand, has been studied on multiple occasions. For example,  Woodbury-Smith et al. (2005)  found the test to have good discriminative validity at a threshold of 26. What this means is that if you score 26 or lower in the AQ Test, it is very unlikely that you are autistic. This only tells us about the screening properties of the tool, not about its potential use as a diagnostic instrument. But let's look at  Baron-Cohen et al. (2001)  where 11 students scoring 32 or higher were interviewed. All of the 11 met 3 or more DSM-IV criteria and 7 of the 11 met \"threshold\" on these criteria. (I believe \"threshold\" means clinical significance). So it appears that the AQ Test has about 64% accuracy at a cut-off of 32. I would conclude that if you score higher than about 33 in the AQ Test, you have the 3 major features of autism (impaired socialization, communication difficulties  and obsessive interests/repetitive activities), and these cause problems in the areas of employment, education or social/family life, then there is little doubt you are autistic. This is just my opinion, which is that of a non-psychiatrist. Do I expect most psychiatrists to disagree with this conclusion? Of course.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ridiculopathy.com/news_detail.php?id=1725", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/09/autism-in-house.html", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2090-2177218,00.html", "http://www.rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php", "http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/v287x3w65416ru16/", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/k872618310261272/"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/12/on-validity-of-self-diagnoses.html", "title": "\nOn The Validity Of Self-Diagnoses\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 21, 2006", "body": "\nI've discussed  fabrications related to autism  before. A much more annoying phenomenon occurs when a single individual goes around making up significant claims that simply cannot be substantiated. I'm talking about David Kirby. An  article  published by Herald Community Newspapers Online has irresponsibly echoed such claims by Kirby. The most outrageous claim in the article is perhaps the following: He pointed to Denmark and Sweden to support his theory that there was a connection between an autism increase and Thimerosal. In 1992, both countries removed the mercury preservative from their vaccinations and have seen a remarkable drop in autism. Not only is there no data to substantiate this claim, but it is known that what actually happened is the opposite of what this claim states. (At least in Sweden that is obvious, and although disputed to an extent in Denmark, there's no reason to think their administrative autism rates have declined at any point in time). I don't know if the paper quoted Kirby correctly, but there are several other direct quotes attributed to David Kirby. For example: There was a huge spike in autism in 1992 when the Hepatitis B vaccine was added to the regular vaccination schedule for babies. If you look at a  graph  of administrative prevalence of autism in the U.S. you will see there is an increase in the prevalence between 1992 and 1993, but it is a very small increase. There is no \"huge spike\" around 1992. There are no \"huge spikes\" at any time, but a gradual increase throughout the 1990s and beyond. The growth in prevalence between 2002 and 2003, for example, is much larger than anything that occurred around 1992. Kirby on historic prevalence: There were 1 in 10,000 children with autism in 1987 in the United States before the addition of Thimerosal. This is absolutely not true, and cannot be substantiated by any epidemiological study. It is not clear where this statistic comes from at all, and I do not believe Kirby can produce an original source, nor can JB Handley, who has been asked to source the same claim previously. The first significant epidemiological study of autism was Lotter et al. (1967) which found a prevalence of 4.5 in 10,000 for Kanner autism as operationalized by Lotter. For a prevalence study around the year Kirby cites, see  Ritvo et al. (1989) , which found a prevalence of 4 in 10,000 in Utah. There is a comment by one Michelle Soodek in the article which I wanted to note as well: She reasoned that if there were just as many people with autism when she was a child, than where are the institutions and facilities to house all of these people that would now be adults? Ms. Soodek is repeating a common mistake in reasoning by those who embrace the autism epidemic concept. She is assuming that most children currently diagnosed with autism would be institutionalized, and that rates of institutionalization for children diagnosed today is the same as that of children diagnosed 20 years ago. As I have shown using CDDS data, the total number of institutionalized developmentally disabled individuals in California has declined a little in the last 14 years. More institutions will not likely be needed in the future. To suggest otherwise is nothing but fear mongering. She is also promoting the idea that autistics naturally belong in institutions, which is a deplorable thing to do even if it was unintentional. That's enough about that article. Let me now look at some of David Kirby's history of dubious claims. They started early on. For example, an infamous claim from his book,  Evidence of Harm , was that Asperger's Syndrome is \"also known as idiot-savant syndrome\". This is clearly false if you consider the history of the terms. What about his promotion of  Evidence of Harm  as the work of an  impartial journalist ? These days he refers to thimerosal hypothesis skeptics as \"mercury defenders\". A more significant example of dishonesty is documented by  Kevin Leitch . In an interview with the New York Times in 2005, David Kirby stated that autism rates should drop by the end of 2005. He later established his current goalpost of 2007 when he discussed the California numbers with Citizen Cain. Kev requested a clarification from Kirby, which was the following: The Times misquoted me. I actually asked for a correction, but did not receive one. What I told the reporter is that \"we should know in the next few years.\" Kev actually apologized to David Kirby before he contacted the New York Times to verify Kirby's account. The Times replied as follows: Prior to publication, we read the entire passage relating to this matter to Mr. Kirby. He approved it. I do not know that Kirby addressed the issue further after Kev caught him lying. I'm sure there are further examples of dishonesty from Mr. Kirby. Readers can provide additional instances if they wish to. There will be a public debate between David Kirby and Arthur Allen on January 13 at 10 a.m. in the Price Center, University of California, San Diego. This debate is sponsored by TACA and Generation Rescue, who will no doubt attempt to stack up the audience against Mr. Allen. It would be nice if members of the skeptical community can attend. I am sure Mr. Kirby will try to introduce some of these \"facts\" of his in the debate. The problem with a spoken debate format is that it allows such fabrications to occur. In that format it is more difficult to call your opponent on dubious claims and successfully show that the claims cannot be sourced. This is likely one reason why you don't see David Kirby debating in blogs, while accepting to debate in a standard spoken format. It has nothing to do with visibility, in my opinion, considering, for example, that Kev's blog has at least twice the readership size of the Autism Speaks website.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17619372&BRD=1601&PAG=461&dept_id=478675&rfi=6", "http://www.fightingautism.org/idea/autism.php", "http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/2/194", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=241", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=321"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/12/david-kirby-plays-fast-and-loose-with.html", "title": "\nDavid Kirby Plays Fast and Loose With Facts\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 28, 2006", "body": "\nIn this post I would like to provide three clear, documentable examples of outright fabrications about autistics. For whatever reason some people seem to be under the impression that autistics are fair game when it comes to making up facts and statistics. 1. Rate of Institutionalization In  Instant Institutionalization , Michelle Dawson informs us of a claim about institutionalization rates from a \"fact sheet\" that is disseminated among Canadian politicians: Without treatment, autism is a lifelong affliction that results in 90% of afflicted individuals placed in institutions and residential facilities, facing an unfulfilling and bleak existence for both the individual and family members. Michelle Dawson notes that the 90% figure cannot be supported by peer-reviewed science, and challenges autism advocates to provide a supporting citation. I wanted to go further than that and verify if the figure can be supported by administrative data. Unless culture in California and Canada are considerably  dissimilar, we should be able to learn something about institutionalization from the California Department of Developmental Services quarterly client characteristics report. Before looking at the data, I should emphasize that, as a rule, only individuals with autistic disorder are eligible for CDDS services. The data is not supposed to include those with PDD-NOS or Asperger's Syndrome. Further, I will look at data for adults, who by and large were probably diagnosed under DSM-III or Kanner's criteria, and who could not have been part of an ABA program in early childhood. Adults who at some point were in the CDDS system and decided they no longer required its services for any reason are obviously not included in the data. From the Q3 2006 report, we learn that 3,089 autistic persons do not live independently or at home with a parent/guardian. The report also says that there are 7,015 autistic adults (18 or older) in the system. So at  most  44% of adult autistics in California do not live with family or independently. The actual figure could be lower depending on the number of children who do not live at home. Of those not living independently or with family, the vast majority live in Community Care. If we only count Institutional Care Facilities as \"institutionalization\", the figure is at most 4.75%. That's correct, less than 5%. It should also be noted that all of these rates are falling rapidly. 2. Severe Behaviors There are people who go around implying that autistic children are, in general, little monsters who pose a danger to themselves and others. For example, Mark Geier  stated  the following in a Radio Liberty interview: A lot of these kids are so severe, you know, they don't say a word, they attack everybody, they break their mothers arm. These are really, really aggressive kids. Break their mother's arm? I wonder how often that really happens. The CDDS report won't tell us that, but it does have a category called \"Severe Behaviors\". From the latest report we learn that 16.31% of autistics in the system are classified as having \"severe behaviors\". That's roughly 1 out of 6.  3. Mental Retardation Professor Meredyth Goldberg Edelson has challenged claimed rates of mental retardation in autism which are found in the scientific literature. This was recently reported in  the press : Goldberg Edelson reviewed 215 studies on autism, dating to  1937, which made 223 claims about the rates of mental retardation in autism. Only 58 of those claims were supported by data, she found, and most researchers stated their results without reporting how they measured intelligence.  Most of the studies that measured intelligence used tests that were inappropriate, Goldberg Edelson found.  \"Many times, if the researchers had a child they couldn't test, they just assumed he or she was retarded and assigned a low IQ score,\" Goldberg Edelson said. In the latest CDDS report we find that 28% of autistics of all ages in the system are classified as having some level of mental retardation. It's not clear how this determination is made. It is probably fair to assume there is some misclassification, and that a different type of testing would yield a different figure. In some cases a child may be presumed to be mentally retarded on the basis that he or she is unable to understand or comply with simple instructions. But the CDDS does have an \"Unknown MR\" category, which currently holds 6.75% of autistics in the system. The issue is not that it is bad for mental retardation to be associated with autism. Mental retardation is a neurological difference which does not in any way invalidate disability rights, neurodiversity or self-advocacy. The issue is how easily facts and statistics are fabricated when it comes to autistic people.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/10/instant-institutionalization.html", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/106/desperation-time", "http://teachers.net/mentors/special_education/topic14817/11.27.06.09.41.23.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/11/fabrications-about-autistics.html", "title": "\nFabrications About Autistics\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 23, 2006", "body": "\nA  press release  came out back in April titled  Autism Has High Costs to U.S. Society , claiming that \"it can cost about $3.2 million to take care of an autistic person over his or her lifetime\" and that \"caring for all people with autism over their lifetimes costs an estimated $35 billion per year.\" This is nothing but bigotry of the highest order. It's no different to  this  as far as I'm concerned.  I'm aware such costs are studied in the context of a medical model of disability. The underlying assumption of this model is that disability is a burden that should be eliminated/cured. That's about the entire scope of the model. Never mind the track record of the model, or how realistic its goals, considering the inescapable reality that every person in the world will experience disability in their lifetimes, unless they die first. What I would like to do in this post, nonetheless, is scrutinize the numbers in the report. Let's start with the $3.2 million figure, assuming a life expectancy of 70 years for an autistic person. This would mean $41,714 is spent annually on the average autistic individual. I don't doubt some parents choose to spend that much in expensive ABA programs and such, but does it seem realistic that this is the  average  annual expenditure for an autistic from the day they are born until the day they die? So how does the author arrive at this number? He first looks at estimated direct costs: Direct costs include direct medical costs, such as physician and outpatient services, prescription medication, and behavioral therapies (estimated to cost, on average, more than $29,000 per person per year) and direct non-medical costs, such as special education, camps, and child care (estimated to annually cost more than $38,000 for those with lower levels of disability and more than $43,000 for those with higher levels). Medical costs are documented in  Croen et al. (2006) . The excess annual medical costs for autistic children relative to controls is $1865, due mostly to the prescription of psychotropic medications. But that's for children. What of the lifetime cost? Let's multiply that number by 20, which gives $37,300. As to therapies, while maybe only 30% of autistic children are put in ABA programs, about 70% seem to undergo speech therapy, which is also pretty expensive. I won't dispute the $29,000 a year figure, but let's see what the lifetime cost might be. How many years are autistic children put through these therapies in average? Let's say 5 years. This gives a lifetime cost of $145,000. I won't consider expenditures in quackery, as this is not a cost of autism, but a cost of ignorance. The author also considers indirect costs: Indirect costs equal the value of lost productivity resulting from a person having autism, for example, the difference in potential income between someone with autism and someone without. It also captures the value of lost productivity for an autistic person's parents. Examples include loss of income due to reduced work hours or not working altogether. Ganz estimates that annual indirect costs for autistic individuals and their parents range from more than $39,000 to nearly $130,000. The average annual income per person in the U.S. is about $30,000, so right there the figures provided in the article do not make sense.  It appears that about 25% of autistic people diagnosed a generation back work and live independently. But the analysis is about autistic people diagnosed today under current criteria. Let me make an assumption here. About 25% happens to be the percentage of autistic people evaluated as not having mental retardation a generation back. Currently, that's more like 70%. I conclude that about 70% of autistics diagnosed today will live independently and work. (No, I'm not saying that only those without mental retardation work, or that none of those without mental retardation are out of a job -- I'm just using this as an artifact to estimate trends). So if we were to assume that the average income of a working autistic person is equivalent to the population average, annual wages lost per autistic person would be $9,000 a year. But that is a big if. Autistics might tend to have very low wage jobs. On the other hand, they might tend to have very technical jobs which are fairly well paid. Either way, let's assume $9,000 x 40 is lost in wages per autistic person over a lifetime, or $360,000. There are intangibles which aren't taken into account. How do we quantify the contributions of someone like Temple Grandin to the food industry? Or the contributions of  Vernon Smith  to, you know, ECONOMICS. Are we allowed to claim Bill Gates? His net worth is $53 billion, a tad more than the purported annual cost of all autistics in the U.S. What I've estimated so far comes to a lifetime excess cost of $542,300 (minus big intangibles) per person. I do not believe it is anywhere near $3.2 million. Trouble is, a figure that is not in the millions won't make for big headlines.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/press/releases/press04252006.html", "http://www.cwfa.org/articles/5149/CFI/papers/", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/118/4/e1203?rss=1", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7030731/"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/11/debunking-costs-of-autism.html", "title": "\nDebunking the Costs of Autism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 20, 2006", "body": "\nIt is common knowledge by now that proponents of the link between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism have been left without any epidemiology to speak of. This is because the credibility of the two and only researchers involved in trying to demonstrate an epidemiological link between TCVs and autism,  Mark and David Geier , has taken a substantial hit, due to the work Kathleen Seidel has single-handedly done to expose dubious activities related to the Lupron Protocol.   As a result, it appears that an old talking point of mercury militants has acquired renewed importance. Roughly, they claim that an early draft of Verstraeten et al. (2003), which I'll refer to as  Verstraeten et al. (2000) , showed there was a link between thimerosal and autism, but this link was later covered up by the CDC. It's of interest to note that Verstraeten et al. (2000) is the same draft that was  plagiarized by Geier & Geier . (No need to dance around the word  plagiarism , as such is patently obvious). In order to verify the claims about Verstraeten et al. (2000) I decided to, you know, go and  read  the draft. Let's analyze the various claims. Is it true that Verstraeten et al. (2000) showed there was a link between autism and thimerosal? Simply put, no. The abstract does not mention autism. To see why that is the reader should look at relative risks for various outcomes after exceeding EPA mercury exposure guidelines at 1 and 3 months of age in Table 4. The relative risks for autism are  1.01  (CI 0.71, 1.48) and  0.94  (CI 0.62, 1.42). In other words, the relative risks found happen to be very close to 1.0 and the range of statistical confidence is broad around 1.0. It's pretty astonishing that many people have claimed and assumed the draft demonstrated such a link. Let's take, for example, Ginger of the Adventures in Autism blog, who  claimed  the following: Verstraten's first draft of the study finds a relative risk above 7 for children who receive the highest dose of thimerosal to develop autism. What is she talking about? Graph 4 shows relative risks at different exposures. At greater than 62.5 micrograms (by 3 months of age) the relative risk is 1.69. But note that 1.0 is well within the confidence interval. There is no way to conclude a relative risk greater than 1.0 is statistically significant in this case given the sample of 28 children. I will also discuss other reasons why these relative risks can't be taken at face value.  Either way, it's not clear where Ginger got the relative risk of 7. Is it true that Verstraeten et al. (2003) covered up the findings of Verstraeten et al. (2000)? From the abstract of Verstraeten et al. (2003): RESULTS: In phase I at HMO A, cumulative exposure at 3 months resulted in a significant positive association with tics (relative risk [RR]: 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-3.38). At HMO B, increased risks of language delay were found for cumulative exposure at 3 months (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01-1.27) and 7 months (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13). In phase II at HMO C, no significant associations were found. In no analyses were significant increased risks found for autism or attention-deficit disorder. These results appear to be similar to some of those in the early draft. The difference is that the 2003 study includes additional HMOs. But maybe Verstraeten et al. are pretty bad at covering up data. There's a whole mythology of conspiracy surrounding Verstraeten, the VSD and, you guessed it, the Geiers. See Kev's post titled  Mark Geier, David Geier and the VSD . What about the risk ratios for outcomes other than autism? That autism is not involved doesn't mean I will just ignore the rest of the findings. The early draft does find statistically significant risk ratios for several outcomes. But is there good reason to take these ratios at face value? Those familiar with vaccine safety studies generally understand that VSD is a much more solid database than VAERS. That is, you can't literally plant data in VSD, and VSD is not likely affected by prevailing  causation  hype or the interests of litigants. This, however, doesn't mean VSD is impervious to confounds beyond random error. VSD still records outcomes based on existing diagnoses, not the results of whole population screenings. In a cohort of children expanding many years, recent diagnoses are not necessarily equivalent to older diagnoses. Surely, things like coincidental trends and left censorship could have an impact on any findings. After looking at graphs in the 2000 draft, I came across a number of peculiar results. I will list some examples, so the reader can get a clear idea of whether risk ratios from the draft can be taken at face value. In Graph 1 we find that if you inject children with more than 62.5 micrograms of mercury by 3 months of age, their risk of developing degenerative neurological disorders is only 40% of what it would be otherwise. And this is a statistically significant finding. In Graph 3 we find something similar about renal disorders. Apparently mercury is good for your kidneys. Graph 15 says about the same about infantile cerebral palsy. In other words, thimerosal prevents brain damage. Graph 8 shows that risk for sleeping disorders increases by a factor of 1.75 with a exposure of 50 micrograms. The solution? Inject more thimerosal. Apparently with a exposure over 62.5 micrograms, the risk drops back down to 1.09. Graph 13 tells us that the risk of developmental speech disorder is only 0.59 at 25 micrograms of exposure, even though the risk is between 1.25 and 1.47 at higher exposures. I guess you have to be careful to choose the right dose if you want to  prevent almost half the cases. Graph 20 is the most peculiar of all. It tells us that premature infants would have about a fifth of their normal risk of developing neurological disorders if only they are injected with 50 micrograms of thimerosal. And this finding is quite statistically significant, as the sample sizes in this graph are considerably larger than in other graphs. It is clear that it would've been irresponsible for Verstraeten et al. to just publish these findings without clearly outlining limitations and potential confounds. This is not only because of the anti-vaccination scare that would result, obviously. So maybe they did think about that and that's why they decided to look at more HMOs. Which is a good thing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/109/lupron-geier-index", "http://safeminds.org/legislation/foia/VSD_VerstraetenJune2000.pdf", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/108/bibliographic-mergers-acquisitions", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/08/beginning-at-beginning.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=447"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/11/verstraeten-et-al-gambit.html", "title": "\nThe Verstraeten et al.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 13, 2006", "body": "\n David Kirby  is well aware that 2007 is right around the corner. You can tell by the rather unusual tone of his  latest post . He's no longer even pretending to be objective. How long before he starts calling anyone who disagrees with him a  Big Pharma Shill ? So what is Kirby so worked up about? It appears that he has learned from Dan Olmstead of a NIH report titled \"Thimerosal Exposure in Pediatric Vaccines\" about potentially serious methodological problems in ecological studies that use the VSD database. I don't know if Kirby read the report, but I did. This is actually a very well thought out report which ideally should have been done 6 years ago. But Kirby seems to think this report is evidence of an association between autism and thimerosal, or at the very least  evidence that undermines lack of evidence  of an association. Something like that. Verstraeten et al. (2003) , the VSD study in question, found statistically significant associations between thimerosal and a couple neurological outcomes in some HMOs, but the associations were not consistently found in other HMOs. Because of these conflicting findings, the study authors called the results \"neutral\", meaning that the study can't tell us if thimerosal is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or not. Now the NIH has come up with a list of methodological problems that put in further doubt any VSD findings by Verstraeten et al. in relation to thimerosal. In other words, the neutrality (or non-informativeness) of the findings has been strengthened. Surprisingly, Kirby's reading of the report conflicts with his other views, because it completely undermines the foundations of the  Simpsonwood conspiracy theory . You see, Verstraeten et al. were supposed to have found significant associations between thimerosal and neurodevelopmental outcomes beyond those that were reported in 2003. But now Kirby is endorsing a NIH report which says that ecological studies on the VSD database, specifically those done by Verstraeten et al., are likely flawed. I'm not sure if Kirby realizes this. If he does, he's being duplicitous. If he does not, he just shot himself in the foot. Furthermore, there is a quote by Thomas Verstraeten which is often used to argue in favor of the thimerosal association: Personally, I have three hypotheses. My first hypothesis is it is parental bias. The children that are more likely to be vaccinated are more likely to be picked up and diagnosed. Second hypothesis, I don't know. There is a bias that I have not yet recognized, and nobody has yet told me about it. Third hypothesis. It's true, it's thimerosal. Those are my hypotheses. ( Source ) Verstraeten was likely being honest in his assessment. What the NIH report has done, effectively, is provide many possible \"Second hypotheses\". Kirby also believes the Verstraeten et al. study is the cornerstone of the case against the thimerosal hypothesis. It's not clear why he believes that is true. I think one of the best studies on the matter is Fombonne's out of Canada. Even if you don't care to analyze those findings, it's enough to consider that thimerosal was fully removed from pediatric vaccines in Canada in 1994, and the prevalence of ASD among Kindergarten children there is currently around 1%. You don't have to be an epidemiologist to realize what the implications of these facts are. Kirby thinks Fombonne's findings are inconclusive, but again, it is not clear what he bases that on. I imagine it's the very weak rebuttal by SafeMinds, an organization that is apparently no longer even putting minimal effort into arguing its case. Kirby makes light of the  Andrews et al. (2004)  study out of the UK. That study found statistically significant negative associations (\"protective\" effects) between thimerosal and autism. Kirby's interpretation of those findings is either naive or desingenuous. If thimerosal is phased out at the same time the incidence of autism increases, it is obvious that the study will find that children not receiving thimerosal tend to become autistic more often than those vaccinated with it. So the finding of a statistically significant negative association is not surprising. It doesn't mean thimerosal protects against autism, but simply that there were coincidentally divergent trends of thimerosal exposure and autism incidence. Incidentally, if a VSD study were done on the birth year cohort expanding, say, 1998 to 2002, it would also find a \"protective effect\" of thimerosal, no doubt. Back to the NIH report. I actually welcome this report, and I'm not just saying this now that it has come out. Back on November 20, I  analyzed claims about early drafts by Verstraeten et al . In that post I mentioned several ridiculous negative associations found between various outcomes and thimerosal. I argued that the findings of Verstraeten et al. cannot be taken at face value, and that while VSD has its merits, \"this doesn't mean VSD is impervious to confounds beyond random error.\" I further stated that \"VSD still records outcomes based on existing diagnoses, not the results of whole population screenings. In a cohort of children expanding many years, recent diagnoses are not necessarily equivalent to older diagnoses. Surely, things like coincidental trends and left censorship could have an impact on any findings.\" What does the NIH report say? The panel identified several serious problems that were judged to reduce the usefulness of an ecologic study design using the VSD to address the potential association between thimerosal and the risk of AD/ASD. These included uncertainties in case ascertainment, heterogeneity of business practices within and across managed care organizations (MCOs) and their  systematic changes over time , misclassification of exposure status using comparisons of before vs. after removal of thimerosal from most childhood vaccines, and the inability to control for  temporal changes in awareness, diagnostic practices and potential confounding factors . (Emphasis mine) I'm glad there are people who think about these things in more professional depth, believe in the self-correcting principle of science, and are willing to criticize existing scientific work, no matter who did it. The NIH panel makes some interesting proposals for future VSD studies and they are apparently taking suggestions from the autism community. I think the biggest potential problem of a VSD study is that of coincidental trends (specifically, thimerosal exposure rising at the same time as administrative incidence of ASD in the early 1990s). That is why I think a VSD study should not look at a cohort expanding many years, but maybe only one year. This is difficult, nonetheless, because the number of children with a given outcome in an HMO is small. An alternative is to look at a cohort where the average thimerosal exposure was roughly constant over time (e.g. 1995 to 1998). Other confounds are not as easy to control for I'd imagine. Either way, more studies would be good to have. Matters that appear unresolved don't help things move along.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=469", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/bad-news-for-mercury-defe_b_36152.html", "http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/08/pharma-shill-gambit.html", "http://notmercury.blogspot.com/2006/12/jb-handley-claiming-absence-of-proof.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=14595043&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/06/robert_f_kenned.html", "http://www.redflagsweekly.com/pdf/simpsonwood.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15342825&query_hl=4&itool=pubmed_docsum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/12/kirby-olmstead-shoot-selves-in-foot.html", "title": "\nKirby, Olmstead Shoot Selves in Foot\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 03, 2006", "body": "\nThis is sure to rattle some sensitivities, but that's just too bad. It is on record that I consider the TV hypothesis to be almost certainly false (see my  analysis  and additional critiques in the comments section). This, nevertheless, does not preclude me from contrasting and comparing this hypothesis with any other hypothesis on their merits. I have been accused of all sorts of things for doing this. One commenter (Erik) even insinuated I must be in the pockets of the CDC or  Big Pharma . The same insinuation has been made about the Cornell researchers who did the TV study, and I have seen that in several blogs and mailing lists. What is the scenario here? Are we to believe that the CDC had a meeting where they decided to pay a group of economists to conduct an epidemiological study involving cable subscriptions and annual precipitation rates? Right! \"Shhh... just don't tell anyone Mr. Economist.\" BTW, did any whistleblowers come forward yet? This type of conspiracist paranoia is suggestive of something. It is apparent that to many the TV hypothesis is not a laughing stock, but actually very serious business. Its impact has been significant among the more anti-vaccination elements of the community. Hundreds of messages have been posted to the EOHarm mailing list about this study, many of them very angry messages. The researchers have been harassed by email, and probably even by phone. (See  Kev's post  on the subject). Well, thimerosal hypothesis proponents  should  be worried. Here are the areas in which I believe the TV hypothesis is actually more sound and plausible than the thimerosal hypothesis: Time Trends .- In the last several decades, there is only one period of time when thimerosal exposure increased consistently and significantly in the US. That is the period between the birth years 1990 and 1994. At other times, thimerosal exposure has been either fairly stable or declining. In contrast, the administrative incidence of autism has been on a smooth upward trend for several decades, most notably in the 1990s. Roughly the same could be said of TV exposure. Regional Epidemiology .- No regional epidemiology exists involving thimerosal and autism, nor is it likely the thimerosal hypothesis could explain both a significant rise in autism incidence over time and the considerable differences in autism prevalence across states and counties. In contrast, the TV study presents a per-county analysis across several states for both cable subscription rates and precipitation rates. The cable subscription analysis even adjusts for time-independent per-county effects. Credibility of Researchers .- The only thimerosal epidemiology which can be found in the scientific literature has been authored by  Mark and David Geier . The scientific conduct of these researchers has come under fire recently amid allegations of  affiliation misrepresentation ,  IRB irregularities ,  use of dual terminology ,  misrepresentation and alteration of cited work ,  apparent plagiarism and use of salami publications ,  potential breaches of confidentiality ,  unreproducibility of results ,  omission of data ,  a suspect \"order of magnitude\" error ,  conspirationism and fear mongering , and  assorted fabrications . Their conflicts of interest include having filed a  patent application  for their \"Lupron Protocol\", and, astonishingly, a  connection to a pharmaceutical company . A quick search reveals nothing comparable about Waldman et al. Extent of Exposure .- The peak thimerosal exposure in the US from all vaccines combined was about 180 micrograms (in 1994). Each vaccine contained as much as 25 micrograms of thimerosal. A conservative estimate (by Sallie Bernard, no less) suggests an average tuna sandwich contains 12 micrograms of methylmercury. However, if we consider that 6 oz. of albacore tuna has 60 micrograms of methylmercury, a tuna sandwich could have over 30 micrograms. Either way, TV exposure appears more significant. Autistic children can watch TV for hours a time, day after day, sometimes asking to watch the same DVD over and over again. Strengths & Impairments .- From the very beginning autistic people were described as having areas of strength and impairment. It seems difficult to come up with a model by which brain poisoning would result in cognitive strengths. But it is not impossible to imagine how television might cause certain impairments over time while enhancing other areas of perceptual functioning. Removal of Thimerosal .- Thimerosal is considered to have been largely removed from vaccines in the US territory by 2001. But it has been removed in other countries too. It was removed in Sweden and Denmark in 1993. It was removed in Canada in 1996. It was removed in the UK (not sure about the year). Yet, no country has ever reported a decline in the incidence of autism, not even anecdotally. No one has ever said, \"hey, wait a minute, there are  less  little ones with autism now\" (well, actually, I know a pair of characters who have claimed just that). The TV hypothesis doesn't have something so obviously damning against it (yet). Anecdotal Evidence .- It's early to draw a controlled comparison, but I'll quote something from  Jennifer : \"By the way, my child did regress at about the same time as she became very interested in watching TV. I've wonderered for years if it wasn't a factor in her gradual social withdrawl. I was so interested that I set up a survey. I asked parents if they had found various therapies helpful (or not). One of the questions was about 'Cutting back on television/video watching'. That received 24 favorable votes, compared to 4 unfavorable, which compared quite respectably to the top therapies which were speech/language therapy which received 38 votes for and 4 votes against, and ABA which received 31 votes for and 3 votes against. Chelation was much less favored, with only 6 postive, and no negative votes.\" Are there areas in which the thimerosal hypothesis looks better than the TV hypothesis? Maybe. But I'll just let readers comment on those.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=455", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/109/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/97/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/98/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/100/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/107/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/108/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/92/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/an_interesting_tidbit_about_ma.php", "http://briandeer.com/wakefield/dtp-garth.htm", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/106/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=447", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/94/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/111/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=455#comment-25409"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/11/is-tv-hypothesis-more-plausible-than.html", "title": "\nIs the TV Hypothesis More Plausible than the Thimerosal Hypothesis?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2006", "body": "\nThe following was overheard in EOHarm recently: However, unless mercury is somehow being slipped into children in greater amounts now than in the 90's, mercury does not seem to be the main cause of autism now. And no, I don't think the mercury in the flu shots is capable of offsetting the mercury infants got at birth, 2, 4 and 6 months in the 90's. Flu shots present smaller doses at later ages, and the big flu shot push for kids didn't get started until 2004 anyway. The message has not had any replies, and it's not clear if the person who posted is still in the list after such a blasphemous remark. This was written by someone who does believe vaccines have \"almost everything to do\" with autism. But this person does take the time to look at the actual CDDS numbers and not just claims about the numbers, and clearly has some skills that allow her to interpret the numbers. For her critical thinking, she should be commended. I should note that she claims to believe in the work of the Geiers, which is actually inconsistent with her analysis of the CDDS numbers. She expresses concern about the \"57% increase in the 3-5 year olds\" (in the last 4 years). And makes a good case about prevalence, which follows. Let's assume the 1 in 166 for ASD (which includes Asperger's and PDD_NOS, not included in these numbers) is going to be close to what you would get based on people that were 3 to 21 in 2002. The US Census Bureaus says that California has approximately 500,000 people of each age in the younger ages \u00c2\u0096 or 57,200 people with ASD. The 2002 full autism numbers for ages 3 to 21 add up to 15,939, or about 27.9% of the ASD population and also about 1 in 600 for the entire age cohort. The 2006 group of 3-5 year olds represents 0.41% of the California population age 3-5. If you assume these number will increase 62% in the next 4 years, as did the 3-5 group from 2002, you get 0.67% of the population, or 1 in 150 -- FOUR TIMES THE CURRENTLY REPORTED RATE!!! I do also share her concern that the current prevalence of 40 in 10,000 for the 3-5 cohort is higher than expected for Autistic Disorder, and this prevalence is still growing at a fast pace. That is, it's not clear when it will level off, and we can't assume there's a magic number it cannot go over. But it's not as bad as she thinks. Anecdotally, some PDD-NOS and Asperger's does get included in the CDDS numbers. Besides, in psychology there's a debate about the existence of Asperger's. Some researchers are saying that DSM-IV Asperger's is impossible to diagnose, and that virtually all children diagnosed with Asperger's actually have Autistic Disorder. If this opinion becomes mainstreamed, what do you think the end result might be in terms of caseload? Additionally, it's unlikely that the 62% increase will be maintained over the next 4 years. Growth expressed as a percentage necessarily decreases over time. She adds: We really [need] to get to the bottom of this. The effects on society are almost too big to contemplate. The fact that more and more children are being labeled with all sorts of cognitive disorders is a valid concern, in my opinion. Sami Timimi, for example, is an outspoken critic of psychiatric over-labeling. He says that we'll end up with a generation of grown-up children who have been unnecessarily convinced that they are defective. But should we be concerned about an increasing number of people becoming disabled? I think we should be really concerned about this if, say, the prevalence of institutionalized developmentally disabled individuals were increasing. (However you look at it, more institutionalization is not a good thing). But it's not increasing. In fact, it has dropped a little in the last 14 years in California, according to the CDDS numbers. If our concerns are not consistent with reality, what is the use of our advocacy?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EOHarm/message/38325"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/10/island-of-rationality.html", "title": "\nAn Island of Rationality\n"},

Obviously autistic teens are being taught essentially that it's bad to be autistic but they shouldn't worry about it because they are \"recovered\" now. Is this good, bad or indifferent, considering these teens are probably able to pass (with an unknown amount of effort)? In a  letter to BMJ , a psychiatrist named Sami Timimi provides an anecdotal account of autistic teens asking to be undiagnosed: In my clinical practice I often come across children and adolescents who are labelled autistic. When I focus on their abilities I often find much about them that does not fit the autistic discourse. Once I reopen the question of diagnosis many adolescents ask me to officially \"undiagnose\" them, which their parents are usually very pleased about. I can see why a teenager might not want the \"autistic\" label.

{"date": "Saturday, October 21, 2006", "body": "\nCriticism of the  autism-TV study out of Cornell  has so far focused on the perceived plausibility of the hypothesis, and on author credentials, for the most part. For example, it has been pointed out that autism is present since birth/conception (or acquired in utero). If only it were that easy to dismiss post-natal environmental trigger theories these days. The study was thought to be a prank at first, due to its peculiar methodology, but it's clear by now that it is not meant as a joke. Apparently, a lot of work went into it. The authors of the study are economists, and this seems to be taken by many as a quick way to dismiss the study altogether. I would note that they are not the first authors of an epidemiological study on autism who are not trained in autism epidemiology. I think the study needs to be considered and critiqued on its merits. Alternative interpretations have been proposed. Perhaps humidity causes autism, through mold and mildew, for example. Maybe spending time outdoors is a preventive measure. And so forth. These alternative interpretations, nonetheless, simply switch one hypothesis with another of equally unknown plausibility. What I'd like to do in this post is propose an interpretation of the results based on a hypothesis known to be plausible, and which has been documented previously. Namely, that the results can be explained by a established correlation between degree of urbanization (or population density) with the administrative prevalence of autism. I already did something similar in a  critique of the environmental pollution hypothesis . That cable subscription rates are correlated with degree of urbanization or population density is a sure bet, and I won't consider that further. A potential correlation between population density and annual precipitation is non-obvious, however, although I had previously suggested that people generally don't build communities in the dessert. I will use the state of Pennsylvania for this post, simply because there's readily available data on administrative prevalence with high regional granularity from that state. The authors analyze California, Oregon and Washington for precipitation. Readers can check if the analysis holds in those states. Fortunately, I didn't have to do much work to get the data I'm about to present, save for a few Google Image searches. Let me first post images modeling annual precipitation in the state of Pennsylvania. Figure 1. Annual precipitation in Pennsylvania (found at usda.gov) Figure 2. Annual precipitation in Pennsylvania (found at orst.edu) Now, let me post an image with modeling of population density, and an image which shows the location of major cities in the state of Pennsylvania. Figure 3. Population density of Pennsylvania counties (found at dep.state.pa.us) Figure 4. Pennsylvania road system, showing major cities (found at smart-traveler.info) Already we can see there is a fairly clear correlation between precipitation and population density in part of the state, perhaps even in 2/3rds of the state taken from East to West. Such a correlation is not at all clear in the West side of the state, but the correlation in the East side is probably enough of a confound.  Let me now post an image modeling autism prevalence across the state of Pennsylvania.  Figure 5. Pennsylvania IDEA autism cases per 10K enrolled (found at fightingautism.org) A correlation with either population density or precipitation is not that clear at first glance, is it? Let's focus on the bluest patches of prevalence, and let's compare with the Pennsylvania road map. You will note that high prevalence tends to coincide with urban areas, namely, Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is particularly interesting, because it's an area with low precipitation. That's on the West side of the state, where I noted that a correlation between precipitation and population density was not clear.  Admittedly, there is an area near Erie (North-West corner) where there is high precipitation and high autism prevalence, but population density does not seem to be exactly where you would expect. This data point throws off my argument a bit, but it's not much to go on. Going forward The correlation between administrative prevalence of autism and population density lends itself to false correlations between autism rates and innumerable proposed contributing factors in autism. It would be extremely easy, for example, to \"prove\" the  autism fries  hypothesis using this type of analysis. In the future, regions with equivalent population density and wealth should be compared. Additionally, studies should be devised to determine if differences in autism prevalence between regions are actual or simply administrative. Note : I plan to email Dr. Waldman and refer him to this post. Addendum I thought I would share a couple of remarkable images modeling annual precipitation and population density in the United States.  Figure 6. Annual precipitation in the U.S. (found at ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov) Figure 7. Population density in the U.S. (found at wikimedia.org) If you've ever wondered why population in the U.S. distributes the way it does, here's a big part of the answer. I have noticed that it's not so much that precipitation positively correlates with high population density, but that lack of precipitation correlates rather well with low population density. This is fairly obvious in retrospect.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/profiles/Waldman/AUTISM-WALDMAN-NICHOLSON-ADILOV.pdf", "http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/images/climate/maps/pa.jpg", "http://www.ocs.orst.edu/pub/maps/Precipitation/Total/States/PA/pa.gif", "http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/subject/advcoun/smallbiz/2003/Figure4.jpg", "http://www.smart-traveler.info/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/map_of_pennsylvania.gif", "http://www.fightingautism.org/idea/maps/pa/PA-Autism-2001.jpg", "http://autismfries.com", "http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/images/climate/annual-precipitation.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/USA_2000_population_density.png/250px-USA_2000_population_density.png"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/10/precipitation-rates-vs-population.html", "title": "\nPrecipitation Rates vs. Population Density in Pennsylvania\n"},

{"date": "Friday, October 13, 2006", "body": "\n Background Back in November, 2005,  David Kirby agreed with blogger Citizen Cain on the following : If the total number of 3-5 year olds in the California DDS system has not declined by 2007, that would deal a severe blow to the autism-thimerosal hypothesis. Let me emphasize that David Kirby also conceded that what matters is the total number of 3-5 year-olds, not changes in caseload growth. As  I have argued , drops in caseload growth should be expected in the long run anyway. Data With one quarter to go before 2007, the  latest quarterly report  is out, as first blogged by  Dad of Cameron . Please check out his graph of the 3-5 cohort caseload for the last 17 quarters. Here's a table with some of the highlights from the last 4 quarters. Table 1: State-wide comparison of Q3 2006 with three prior quarters. Quarter Caseload Growth (False New Cases) Annual Growth (%) 3-5 Cohort Q4 2005 29,424 700 10.72% 5,680 Q1 2006 30,181 757 10.50% 5,827 Q2 2006 31,012 831 10.56% 6,083 Q3 2006 31,853 841 10.89% 6,188 The key information in Table 1 is that the 3-5 caseload continues to grow, and this growth is still rather fast compared to population growth in the state of California. Barring any miracles, in one quarter David Kirby will either need to issue a statement saying that he no longer believes in the autism-thimerosal hypothesis, further  goalpost-shift  the target date for a caseload drop, or claim that there hasn't really been a significant drop in the thimerosal dose per child in California. What do readers predict he will do? It's a bit surprising that caseload growth has increased for at least the last 4 quarters in a row. Even when expressed as an annual percentage, it seems to be in an upward trend. As I've noted before, this might indicate that leveling off of the population (i.e. annual caseload growth matching California population growth of about 1%) is still  very  far away. CDDS autism prevalence for the 3-5 cohort is currently about 40 in 10,000. This is not supposed to include PDD-NOS or Asperger's, but anecdotally it is known that diagnoses are changed in order to force eligibility in some cases. Thimerosal Hypothesis It is important to understand what the \"thimerosal hypothesis\" is. Versions vary slightly, but let's take Mark Blaxill's one, as presented to the IOM in 2001. Blaxill indicated that mercury exposure from vaccines went from about 70 micrograms for the 1991 birth year cohort to about 180 micrograms for the 1994 birth year cohort, which coincided with an increase in the prevalence of autism for birth year cohorts between those years. That is, most or all of the prevalence increase during the \"autism epidemic\" of the 1990s can be attributed to an increase of the thimerosal dose per child, according to Blaxill. Were Blaxill's hypothesis correct, if thimerosal exposure drops to levels below 70 micrograms, the 1990s epidemic of autism should be reversed. Even if you believe there are still traces of thimerosal in vaccines, and that children are still exposed to 25 micrograms of thimerosal from the Flu vaccine, it is clear that thimerosal exposure is no more than it was in 1991 and the entire 1970s and 1980s for that matter.  Note that the 3-5 CDDS autism caseload in Q2 1992 was 462. That is about 13 times less than what it is today. There is no denying such clear numbers. The only way to continue to believe in a hypothesis such as Blaxill's involves suspending reason. At this point we are simply waiting for the main proponents to come clean on that, provided intellectual honesty means something to them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://citizencain.blogspot.com/2005/11/slouching-toward-truth-autism-and_30.html", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=76", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=321"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/10/cdds-q3-2006-thimerosal-hypothesis.html", "title": "\nCDDS Q3 2006: Thimerosal Hypothesis Still Dead\n"},

I think this could be pretty controversial. Breastfeeding, Infant Formula Supplementation, and Autistic Disorder: the Results of a Parent Survey. Schultz ST, Klonoff-Cohen HS, Wingard DL, Akshoomoff NA, Macera CA, Ji M, Bacher C.   ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although autistic disorder is associated with several congenital conditions, the cause for most cases is unknown. The present study was undertaken to determine whether breastfeeding or the use of infant formula supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid is associated with autistic disorder. The hypothesis is that breastfeeding and use of infant formula supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid/arachidonic acid are protective for autistic disorder. METHODS: This is a case-control study using data from the Autism Internet Research Survey, an online parental survey conducted from February to April 2005 with results for 861 children with autistic disorder and 123 control children. The analyses were performed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Absence of breastfeeding when compared to breastfeeding for more than six months was significantly associated with an increase in the odds of having autistic disorder when all cases were considered (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.42, 4.35) and after limiting cases to children with regression in development (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.01, 3.78). Use of infant formula without docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid supplementation versus exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a significant increase in the odds of autistic disorder when all cases were considered (OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.24, 15.7) and after limiting cases to children with regression in development (OR 12.96, 95% CI 1.27, 132). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study indicate that children who were not breastfed or were fed infant formula without docosahexaenoic acid/arachidonic acid supplementation were significantly more likely to have autistic disorder. The methodology looks OK. For anyone interested in environmental factors in autism, there you go. Nutrition and brain development appear to be related (no kidding). It even looks like there's a stronger correlation of lack of EFA supplementation to  regressive  autism. This puts a recent  double-blind study of EFAs  in perspective. So for anyone interested in \"biomed\" interventions, there you go. There are prior studies on lactation supplementation and neurological outcomes in the general population. See, for example,  Birch et al. (1999)  and  Helland et al. (2003) . I would not say that reduced EFA supplementation causes autism, but it probably makes a diagnosis more likely.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16920077&query_hl=11&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2057", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/111/1/e39"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/09/breastfeeding-and-efas.html", "title": "\nBreastfeeding and EFAs\n"},

The DZ twin concordances were 0% and 10% respectively. Given that MZ twin concordance is not 100%, people correctly assume that environmental factors must be involved in the etiology of autism. But some go further than that and speculate that the environmental factors must surely be environmental \"insults\", and that they probably occur post-natally. This would probably be true if there was no random variation in brain development, and no phenotypical variability due to the social environment. No human phenotype is 100% heritable. Only very simple physical phenotypes, such as eye color, approach that level of concordance. Let's take  White et al. (2002) . This study compared the brains of general population MZ twins and found a concordance of over 0.90 for white and grey matter volumes, but only 0.75 for the thalamus, to take one example. Syndromes known to be genetic in nature can have discordant expression.  Kruyer et al. (1994)  reports on two sets of MZ twins discordant for Fragile-X. In one pair of sisters, one has mental retardation and the other does not. In each of the pairs the researchers explained the discordance genetically. A  Google Scholar  search on discordant MZ twins reveals many other such reports. MZ twins can be discordant for homosexuality. But there is no significant effort to try to pin down the environmental factors involved there. (Hint: It's not likely the vaccines). Concordance of intelligence is not 100%. It seems to be about 80% for MZ twins reared together, and slightly lower for MZ twins reared apart. Phenotypical variation for intelligence is probably determined by the neurological variability discussed above, plus life experience. The social environment should not be discounted altogether, as much as people would prefer to. A case in point is that of congenitally blind children, who tend to become autistic. For those who believe ABA (or some other treatment) works, here's something to ponder. Imagine a pair of autistic MZ twins, one given to a family that believes in ABA and the other given to a family which does not. Can the subsequent discordance be blamed on the one set of parents? Note that I'm not saying that autistic children are never subject to environmental insult, or that environmental insult does not result in autism-related phenotypical variability. I am simply saying that environmental insult is not necessary to explain MZ twin discordance, as is often argued.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jcomputertomography.com/pt/re/jcat/abstract.00008354-200205000-00004.htm;jsessionid=FHKJQQxflT4K0bJslhrkqrRZ1RV53jKKHgKns7nG5wzhrwb4j0TT!-210589086!-949856145!8091!-1?nav=forward&basedoc=00004728-199901000-00030&article=4&fullimage=false", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=8116613&dopt=Citation", "http://scholar.google.com"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/09/mz-twin-discordance.html", "title": "\nMZ Twin Discordance\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 09, 2006", "body": "\nIt's no secret that many proponents of now discredited hypotheses are quietly pursuing new causation theories without explicitly admitting so. But more than pursing new causation theories in an effort to improve our understanding of autism, they seem intent in continuing to look exclusively for \"something wicked.\" Dan Olmstead, a journalist of \"no autism among the Amish\" fame, is a case in point, with his three new Age of Autism articles titled  Something Wicked -- 1 ,  Something Wicked -- 2  and  About Those \"Old Dads\" . In them he puts forth the hypothesis that autism may be caused by chemicals parents are exposed to. The mechanism or its plausibility are not clear, but let's leave that aside for the time being. Olmstead cites work by Thomas Felicetti, who had found a higher prevalence of chemists among the parents of autistic children compared to controls. This confirmed prior work by Mary Coleman. He further goes into the case histories of Kanner's 11 autistic patients born in the 1930s. Let me quote from his \"Old Dads\" article: We've also pointed out a possible connection in the very first cases described in the medical literature -- 11 children born in the 1930s -- with new chemical compounds, plausibly including mercury-based fungicides. One of those 11 kids was the son of a plant pathologist, another the son of a forestry professor at a southern university, and a third grew up in an area being heavily planted with seedlings to create a national forest in Mississippi (there's that southern forestry connection again -- in fact, his home town is named Forest).  A fourth was the son of a mining engineer. And the very first case to come to medical attention, at Johns Hopkins University in 1935, was the son of a 30-year-old chemist-attorney at the U.S. Patent Office. A chemist. Anyone with more than a passing interest in autism research will recognize the obvious confound in this hypothesis. I would also point out that these studies are from a different generation, and we might find things have changed. For example, I would wager computing might be a relatively common occupation among parents of autistic children nowadays. (Readers are encouraged to provide anecdotal data in the comments section). A series of articles (e.g.  Baron-Cohen et al. (1998) ) have shown that mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists and engineers are over-represented among the parents of autistic children. Jarrold & Routh (1998) analyzed the data and found that the parents of autistic children were also over-represented in accountancy and science, suggesting that perhaps there's a general professional over-representation.  Wheelwright & Baron-Cohen (2001)  argued that even taking into account a possible over-representation of professionals, engineers were still over-represented. Further evidence of this confound comes from an AQ test assessment by  Baron-Cohen et al. (2004) . The researchers found that \"scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students\" and that \"within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest.\" Further, the group of Mathematics Olympiad winners scored significantly higher than the male Cambridge Humanities students. Dan Olmstead does try to address the confound by pointing out that there is no correlation between social class and autism, which is correct. But social class is clearly not what the confound is about.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20060619-123237-8199r", "http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20060814-040824-3142r", "http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20060906-021517-6776r", "http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/1998_BCetal_Maths.pdf", "http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2001_Wheelwright_BC.pdf", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/k872618310261272/"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/09/dan-olmsteads-new-pet-theory.html", "title": "\nDan Olmstead's New Pet Theory\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 04, 2006", "body": "\nIn a  presentation to the IOM  (July 16, 2001), Mark Blaxill showed the following graph of cumulative mercury exposure (thimerosal dose per child) and the administrative prevalence of autism by birth year cohort: Blaxill's graph was also shown in Figure 1 of  Stehr-Green et al. (2003) . Stehr-Green et al. conclude that there is no consistent relationship between thimerosal and autism, however. The graph also has some similarities to Figure 2 of  Geier & Geier (2004)  which I already  critiqued . The drop in prevalence and thimerosal exposure starts one year earlier in the Geiers' paper. The thimerosal dose per child in the graph is probably correct. The main problem with the graph is that it shows a prevalence drop in the 1995 birth year cohort. This drop is likely due to left-censorship. In other words, children in recent birth-year cohorts are too young to be diagnosed. Graphs by birth year cohort are not fixed. They change as they are revised from one year to the next. The prevalence of autism did not really drop for people born in 1995 and 1996. So the correlation shown there is either a coincidence or you would have to wait for the right year to make the graph. In fact, a  2005 SafeMinds document  by Redwood and Blaxill has a graph (second one down) which clearly shows the prevalence by birth year cohort did not drop in 1995, 1996 or 1997.   The graph from Blaxill's 2001 presentation says children were surveyed 2 years after their birth year. But this simply cannot be right. If you look at the 2005 SafeMinds document, it is clear that prevalence in a birth year cohort stabilizes at about age 8 and it's about half its peak at age 3. The 2001 graph is close to the 2005 graph, except for the 1995 birth year prevalence. The 2001 graph appears to simply show prevalence by birth year cohort, as surveyed around the year 2000. Another problem with the graph is that it doesn't show thimerosal exposure before 1989. If it did, it would likely show a flat bar graph before that year, concurrent with an increasing autism prevalence trend. In other words, graphing thimerosal dose per child before 1989 would tend not to support the desired correlation. Geier & Geier (2004) avoids that problem by simply skipping the 1986-1989 range altogether in their graph. Methodological problems aside, Mark Blaxill is known as a reasonable and knowledgeable individual. He clearly knows about thimerosal dosage and about autism prevalence. He must realize that birth cohorts after 2000 could not have received more than 25 micrograms of thimerosal \u2013 less than 1/3rd of what he shows for 1989. He must also realize autism prevalence is not dropping in the youngest age cohorts data is available for. As Mark Blaxill is respected by proponents of the thimerosal hypothesis, isn't he the most indicated person to put this hypothesis to rest? I think history is calling upon Mark Blaxill to do the right thing. Why is he so quiet about this nowadays?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/7/505/Blaxill.pdf", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/blaxil-graph.jpg", "http://www.pkids.org/pdf/AMJPRMED.pdf#search=%22blaxill%20thimerosal%20birth%20year%22", "http://www.medscimonit.com/pub/vol_10/no_3/3986.pdf", "http://www.safeminds.org/pressroom/press_releases/Response%20to%20CA%20DDA%20Autism%20Case%20Report%2001-18-05.pdf#search=%22california%20dds%20prevalence%20autism%20birth%20year%22"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-about-mark-blaxill.html", "title": "\nMore About Mark Blaxill\n"},

For example, we know how much the proportion of autistic CDDS clients with mental retardation has changed since 1992 to the present time. We know that the rate of institutionalization of developmentally disabled individuals is not on an upward trend. And there is evidence of diagnostic substitution. But we are still left with the question as to why the number of diagnoses has increased so much. Sure, we talk about an increase in awareness and changes in criteria and cultural perceptions. But why did this happen mostly in the 1990s? Lorna Wing coined the term  Asperger's syndrome  in 1981. The DSM-IV was published in 1994, years after the increasing trend in diagnosed cases had started. The trend accelerated after the DSM-IV publication, but there's no noticeable spike. I think there has to be an independent cultural phenomenon that drove changes in awareness and cultural perceptions. I think the key to answering this question comes from parent experiences regarding how a child's diagnosis of autism came about. Usually it goes like this. The pediatrician tells the parents not to worry or gives an assessment completely unrelated to autism. The parents start to do their own research. Then they go to a hospital or find an specialist who is able to diagnose autism. My guess is that when parents visit a psychiatrist they typically already suspect the diagnosis of autism. It is not far fetched to suppose that the internet has made a huge difference in providing parents the ability to carry out extensive research, and enhancing general awareness.  The internet began to take off shortly before the 1990s. At that time there was Usenet. There were mailing lists. It was more of an academic tool rather than a corporate one.  Gopher  was released in 1991 and begun to gain in popularity. By Q2 1994, the world wide web surpassed Gopher and that's when the internet really exploded. Growth in number of internet hosts What the hypothesis predicts Regions with higher internet penetration will tend to have a higher incidence of autism. (This would explain in part the link to degree of urbanization, with another factor being availability of specialists). In populations with no internet access whatsoever, autism will be virtually unheard of.  At time of diagnosis, households with an autistic child are more likely to have internet service than households of a control group matched by age, even after social class is considered. Internet access correlates with reduced elapsed time from concern to diagnosis. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autismtrends.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/internet-growth.gif"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/09/plausible-epidemic-hypothesis.html", "title": "\nA Plausible \"Epidemic\" Hypothesis\n"},

But in this short post I just want to address two statements I found Mark Blaxill has made there, and I would like to invite him to debate the first one. The best estimate for the number of children (aged 4-17) with ASD is about 300,000. That means the total US population, including adults, is unlikely to be over 400,000.  (Aug 4, 2006)   If Mark Blaxill believes that ASD is rare in adults, I hope he can address  Stahlberg et al (2004) ,  Shah et al (1982) ,  Baron-Cohen et al (2001)  and  Wakabayashi et al (2004) .

That's the kind of thing that should give pause to anyone who compares autism to cancer or AIDS. Jasmine also offers practical advise to parents. Olga Holland's book is not bad, and offers practical advise, but she clearly does see autism as a disorder that must be defeated and autistic children as defective in some way. Traits of her child she perceives as negative are considered part of his autism; traits perceived as positive are not considered part of his autism. She uses a variation of the \"social stories\" teaching method throughout the book. In the end she tells how her son tests in the top percentile in some standardized test and enters a gifted program at school. (While being in the top percentile at something is statistically as abnormal as being in the lowest percentile, it is interesting that it is not perceived as such culturally).

The reality is that there is not a single biomed treatment for autism that may be deemed clinically proven \u2013 not a single one. And there are some historical embarrassments in the autism biomed field too. I already discussed  Secretin , which Bernard Rimland had claimed to have a 75% improvement rate. This was before double-blind studies showed Secretin to be, at best, as effective as placebo. Don't be surprised if the exact same thing happens to DMSA, MeB12 and the others. Some readers might be thinking that I'm forgetting Vitamin B6, an old but still popular biomed treatment, which does have some placebo-controlled studies under its belt, many of them showing positive results. But note that  Nye & Brice (2005)  conducted a detailed literature review and concluded that \"due to the small number of studies, the methodological quality of studies, and small sample sizes, no recommendation can be advanced regarding the use of B6-Mg as a treatment for autism.\" Multivitamins and supplements could arguably be of benefit to overall health, and thus appear to be effective in treating autism. That is how I interpret the results of  Adams & Halloway  for example. Readers will note that multivitamins in this study were effective in improving sleep difficulties and gastrointestinal symptoms, but had a non-significant effect (compared to placebo) on autistic features such as language, sociability and behavior. If these results are replicated, it would seem that it is a good idea to use multivitamins with children who have sleeping and gastrointestinal problems. This is probably even the case with non-autistic children. So why is autism so resistant to biomed treatments? Autism biomed is based on a flawed hypothesis. It assumes that autistic children's brains are just about typical, except for a reversible biochemical imbalance or contamination of some kind. Biomed proponents often compare autism to being drunk or stoned. This, of course, is wishful thinking and fails to acknowledge much of what has been found about autistic neurology and cognition. Autistic brains are different to neurotypical brains. Of course, some will be closer to neurotypical brains than others, but in general, it is known that autistic brains have a different distribution of grey and white matter, different neuron density, neuron size, different overall volume and so on. Autistic cognition is different to neurotypical cognition, with different strengths and weaknesses apparently. I contend that there is very little biomed treatments can do to compensate for these differences and force an autistic brain to work like a neurotypical brain.  The autism community should do better than engage in wishful thinking and waste all this time and resources with biomed. I suggest that autistic children should (1) be educated by engaging their strengths, (2) allowed to exercise their interests, (3) respected for the unique individuals they are, not defective medical puzzles to be solved, and (4) have their true (proven) medical issues, if any, addressed as medical issues, not as part of their very being, which is what autism is.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16235322&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.eas.asu.edu/~autism/VitaminPaper.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/08/why-biomed-will-always-have-little-to.html", "title": "\nWhy Biomed Will Always Have Little To Show For Itself\n"},

Mary Grace is a teenager diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, who is herself featured in the article. Mary Grace argued that autism can have \"horrible disadvantages\" and that this justifies a pro-cure position in regards to autism. She further stated that \"there are probably dozens of stories where poor social skills have resulted in people being jailed or worse.\" When I try to discern the merit of an argument such as this, I prefer to think in analogies. So I mentioned that being black can entail \"horrible disadvantages\", particularly if we go back in history, and that being black has resulted in people being jailed or worse. Mary Grace replied to my analogy as follows: You don't have to do anything to be seen as black, it's just there. Social skills are different. They aren't always obvious as present or absent at first, and they can be improved upon. If a person with poor social skills (not necessarily AS, just poor in general) is arrested, aren't they more likely to show the worst of their traits and get themselves in more trouble? Social skills are important for anybody to have, and because of the nature of AS, we have to work extra hard. It's noit fair, but that doesn't change it. And I would like to emphasize that I most certainly do NOT buy into stigmatization of anyone for any reason, but I do acknowledge that stigmatization exists. And it does exist against people with poor social skills, and, as you said, against people of certain races. You can't change your race. But you can improve your social skills. That's where your arguement fails, I'm afraid. And it does suck to have poor social skills, or at least it sucked for me. I'm much happier now. Essentially, Mary Grace argues that autistics are a different type of minority to blacks or gays or women or disabled minorities. If you are black, you can't do anything about that. If you are blind, there's not much you can do about it either in terms of regaining sight. But if you are autistic, and suffer due to your lack of social skills, you can work on improving your social skills.  Certainly, if you want to improve a skill, you can practice it. I'm a big believer in hard work and in that if you want to become better at something, you study it, and you practice, practice, practice. So what's wrong with this argument? First of all, it is necessary to acknowledge that the world is full of physical limitations. I could practice basketball 10 hours a day for years and never become anywhere near as good as Michael Jordan. This is an example taken to the extreme, but it serves to illustrate that practice is not necessarily sufficient, and this applies even when trying to attain a \"normal\" level of skill. To presume that it is possible to achieve just about anything through hard work is wishful thinking. Optimism is a good thing, but unrealistic expectations are unhelpful. Second, Mary Grace seems to suggest that autistic people have a responsibility to work hard on their social skills for their own good and for the common good. But is this the right thing to work for? Mary Grace says that black people cannot become less black, but I don't think this is even true. (Readers might be thinking of Michael Jackson at this point, but that's not what I mean). Couldn't black people \"act white\" so they can be more easily assimilated into white culture? Couldn't gays work hard at being attracted to the opposite sex? (There are behavioral interventions available). Should women who want to succeed in the work place act more like men in order to achieve their aims? The deaf community has had to go through a similar debate, i.e. should deaf people be taught to sign and become part of deaf culture, or be taught oral methods (including lipreading) so that they can participate in the larger culture? My understanding is that deaf people, as a rule, favor manual methods. See  Arguments in favor of Oralism are refuted by Manualists  and  Oral vs. Manual Debate . Mary Grace also says she's happier now that she's learned social skills and is able to pass for normal. It's a good thing that she feels happy with herself and I don't want to imply otherwise. But it's also an experience contrary to that of other autistics, who say that when they stopped trying to fit in and started to accept what they were and no longer saw autism as a horrible thing, they became less depressed and anxious and so on. Finally, while I disagree with Mary Grace, I just want to say that some of the responses she got, questioning her diagnosis, are out of line.

{"date": "Saturday, August 12, 2006", "body": "\nThis is a revision of  a post  I wrote about 5 months back. I will include many new arguments and data I've come across since then. As usual, those who believe that an autism epidemic has definitely occurred are invited and encouraged to debate the evidence presented. Changing characteristics Dr. Eric Fombonne has said that comparing current autism prevalence to a prevalence from studies 30 years ago is like comparing  oranges to sheep . Another way to express this is that the diagnoses are not equivalent. But even with (presumably) the same subjective diagnostic criteria it is possible for diagnosed groups of autistics to be inequivalent as time goes by. This hypothesis (let's call it the  expanding criteria  hypothesis) is verified by looking at client characteristics in the California DDS data. See Table 1. Table 1: Changes in autistic client characteristics over time Quarter Epilepsy Profound MR Severe Behaviors Lack of MR Q2 1992 15.6% 11.2% 22.9% 27.8% Q4 1996 11.8% 7.4% 20.5% 41.2% Q4 2000 8.7% 4.4% 19.2% 52.4% Q4 2004 7.1% 2.6% 17.4% 61.9% Q4 2005 6.7% 2.4% 16.8% 63.6% Every quarter, as caseload rises above what would be expected from changes in the population of the state of California, the proportion of certain characteristics of CDDS autistic clients simultaneously drop. As a group, autistics in California today are quite inequivalent to autistics in California in 1992. Effectively, autism one quarter in California is not equivalent to autism the next quarter. Therefore, it is not possible to say that a real increase in autism prevalence has occurred. The following figure [courtesy of CDDS] also illustrates the point. Notice that the autism curve and the autism without MR curve run almost parallel to one another. Evidence from regional differences The bulk of the \"epidemic\" in the state of California occurred in the Los Angeles area, as illustrated by the following figure [courtesy of CDDS]: Current differences in administrative prevalence between regional centers are substantial. Table 2 shows caseloads of various CDDS categories in the Westside RC and the Central Valley RC, expressed as ratios to the epilepsy caseload. Table 2: Q4 2005 comparison of Westside and Central Valley Regional Center Autism Ratio PMR+SMR Ratio PMR Ratio Epilepsy Ratio Severe Behavior Ratio Central Valley 0.32 0.60 0.36 1.0 0.31 Westside 1.61 0.68 0.31 1.0 0.45 It is telling that despite the 500% difference in administrative prevalence of autism between Westside and Central Valley, there is apparently no difference in the prevalence of mental retardation between these two regional centers. If regional prevalence differences are not real, we can extrapolate and conclude that state-wide prevalence changes over time could also not be real. The hypothesis that regional prevalence differences may be due to environmental factors, such as pollution, appears to be improbable, as I  recently argued . Caseload growth patterns are telling in that regard. Note that the highest annual caseload growth (in percentage terms) in California occurred in the 2002-2003 timeframe. It was about 20%. Currently, the Central Valley regional center, which has the lowest prevalence of autism in the state, has an annual caseload growth of 24%. Autism in Central Valley is currently undergoing what might be described as staggering growth. In contrast, the Westside regional center, with the highest prevalence in the state, has an annual caseload growth of just over 8%. It is not far fetched to suppose that, eventually, Central Valley will catch up to Westside, and that it was simply behind in its recognition of autism. Evidence of diagnostic substitution Shattuck (2006)  found that as the prevalence of autism has risen in the United States, the prevalence of idiopathic mental retardation and learning disability has undergone a corresponding decline. California was one of a handful of states that does not clearly follow this pattern, according to Shattuck. But as noted, expanding criteria is what apparently drives most of the autism caseload growth in California. We also know that the recognition of autism in the population with mental retardation in California was around 3.5% in 1992, whereas it is about 7% today. This recognition varies considerably from one regional center to the next. Typically, but not always, regional centers with lower autism prevalence have a lower proportion of clients with autism in the mental retardation category. Note that  de Bildt et al (2005)  states that the most reliable and well-founded estimate for the prevalence of PDD in children and adolescents with mental retardation is the DSM-IV-TR prevalence of 16.7%. So the California recognition of autism in this population still has considerable room for additional growth, and it is not far fetched to conclude that improving recognition (i.e. diagnostic substitution) has occurred in California over time, even though this is not the most significant factor driving caseload growth in that state. High prevalence in adults Stahlberg et al (2004)  found that 30% of consecutively referred adult patients with ADHD had \"comorbid\" ASD. If we consider that the prevalence of ADHD in adults is estimated at about 4.2% as of 2006, it would appear that the prevalence of ASD in adults can be at least 126 in 10,000. Granted, Stahlberg's ADHD patients could be more \"severe\" than usual, but his findings are notable considering the limited screening of a specific population. Nylander & Gillberg (2001)  found that 89.5% of adult psychiatric outpatients with \"definite ASD\" had previously been missed. They had received other psychiatric diagnoses, such as schizophrenia. Baron-Cohen et al (2001)  found that 2% of randomly selected adult controls scored 32 or higher in the AQ test. Further, 7 of 11 interviewed students who were high-scorers met threshold criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis. It would appear then that the prevalence of ASD in adults can be as high as 127 in 10,000 if screened thoroughly. This does not even consider those autistics who are missed by an AQ score threshold of 32. Mark Blaxill's \"hidden horde\" appears to not be hiding very well, because it has been found repeatedly. Evidence from prevalence studies Mike Stanton has posted a  detailed analysis of autism prevalence studies  as part of a rebuttal of Richard Lathe's book \"Autism, Brain and Environment\". When we compare apples with apples, the huge increases of autism prevalence often claimed to have occurred seem to vanish.  Williams et al. (2005)  provides a systematic review of prevalence studies. The researchers conclude that 61% of the variation among prevalence studies may be explained by a model that includes diagnostic criteria used, age of children screened, and study location. Note that this model does not even consider awareness or cultural factors. What went on in the past Lorna Wing was there and  explains it  well: One of us (LW) was involved in the planning of the study by Vic Lotter [1966] of 78,000 children aged 8, 9, and 10 years living in the former English county of Middlesex. This was the study in which the 4-5 in 10,000 prevalence rate was first found. I (LW) know what sorts of children were included as classically autistic because I was one of the small group (Neil O'Connor, John Wing, Vic Lotter and myself) who decided on the criteria. In those days we were interested only in really classic Kanner's syndrome and Vic was determined to keep the criteria as narrow as possible. Later, in the Camberwell study described above, Vic was shown case histories of the children Judy Gould and I thought fitted Kanner's descriptions - to our surprise, Vic said we ought to exclude some because they were not classic enough! I think it is fair to say that, when Vic specified narrow criteria, they were NARROW. When Judy Gould and I started the Camberwell study, we still thought that Kanner's autism could easily be differentiated from other developmental disorders.. By the end of the study our ideas had been turned upside down. We had learnt from direct experience that the psychological dysfunctions underlying autism were manifested in many different ways, far beyond the boundaries of Kanner's syndrome. We developed the hypothesis of an autistic spectrum based on the triad of impairments of social interaction, communication and imagination. Because we concentrated on the children with learning disabilities (IQ under 70) we saw very few with the pattern described by Asperger. We had to wait for the study by Christopher Gillberg in Gothenberg to find out how many children with IQ of 70 and above were also in the autistic spectrum. As described above, combining the results of these two studies gave an overall prevalence rate for the whole autistic spectrum, including those with the most subtle manifestations, of 91 per 10,000 - nearly 1% of the general population. The epilepsy argument Autism has been linked to a seizure liability, and the CDDS data itself shows that the prevalence of epilepsy among autistics is considerably higher to that of the general population. It follows that an environmental trigger capable of producing an epidemic of autism might also result in an epidemic of epilepsy. Surprisingly, we find in the data that the epilepsy caseload grows at about the same pace as the population in the state of California. Additionally, the prevalence of epilepsy does not appear to depend on degree of urbanization. The mental retardation argument An epidemic-causing environmental trigger that results in brain injury should be expected to increase the probability that an individual will have mental retardation, and thus result in an epidemic of all levels of mental retardation. But again, there is no evidence of an increase in the prevalence of mental retardation. In California, the mental retardation caseload increases at about the rate that should be expected from population growth. Furthermore, it is known that the average IQ score has actually risen over time and IQ tests have to be re-normalized periodically (see  Flyyn effect ). While this does not necessarily say anything about autism, it should at least put to rest fears that an epidemic of neurological disorders will \"destroy the United States.\" The institutionalization argument Proponents of an autism epidemic generally not only refer to autism, but to an increase in the prevalence of all sorts of neurological disorders. They also often refer to the increased fiscal burden that will presumably result from this epidemic. While increased awareness can result in increased service expenses, I contend that there are certain types of services that are not likely to be significantly affected by increased awareness. Let's look at institutionalization of developmentally disabled individuals in the state of California. In Q2 1992, the total number of institutionalized individuals registered with CDDS was 32,943. In Q2 2005, the number was 36,869. Adjusting for population growth, we get 10.6 per 10,000 persons institutionalized in 1992 vs. 9.97 per 10,000 in 2005. There appears to be a decrease in the prevalence of institutionalized individuals with developmental disabilities, which is a positive trend. Granted, very young children would not tend to be institutionalized, but even in the younger age cohorts the CDDS data shows a decreasing trend in number of institutionalized clients. At the very least, this should lay to rest fears that a generation from now institutions will be overflowing with adult autistics. The speech delay argument Speech delay is perhaps the most characteristic feature of autism. If there has truly been an epidemic of autism resulting from an environmental trigger which is not necessarily autism specific, one might expect to find an increase in the prevalence of speech delay. There is no evidence of such an increase. Epidemiological data is hard to compare due to differences in methodology and criteria, but let's look at some studies over time.  Stevenson & Richman (1976)  found a prevalence of 3.1% for delayed language development and 5-7% for specific language delay.  Silva et al (1987)  reported a prevalence of 4.6% for expressive language delay.  Wong et al (1992)  found a prevalence of 6.1% for expressive language delay.  Shriberg et al (1999)  found that he prevalence of speech delay in 6-year-old children was 3.8%. There are no indications of an increase in the prevalence of speech delay concurrent with the \"autism epidemic\". Refutation of a common argument A study by the MIND Institute (2002) determined that there was \"no evidence that a loosening in the diagnostic criteria has contributed to the increased number of autism clients served by the Regional Centers.\" These findings have often been cited in favor of the epidemic argument. The study assesed an earlier cohort and a more recent cohort of clients using the DSM-IV criteria. Since both cohorts met the criteria at the same rate, the researchers concluded that a losening of the criteria cannot account for an increase in autism prevalence.  Gernsbacher et al  document the obvious reasoning flaw, using a height analogy. Briefly, while both cohorts meet DSM-IV criteria, they are not necessarily equivalent. It is possible the earlier cohort meets a more restrictive criteria than DSM-IV which the more recent cohort might not. Conclusion The state of the evidence is not simply sufficient to allow suspending the belief that an epidemic of autism has occurred. It is my opinion that there is enough evidence to assert that said epidemic did not occur.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2005/12/dr-eric-fombonne-at-mind.html", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autism-no-mr.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autism%20by%20rc.jpg", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/4/1028", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15755304&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15206005&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0447.2001.00175.x/abs/", "http://www.springerlink.com/(1fzglf450qhsyybalak5zpe3)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,2,14;journal,36,170;linkingpublicationresults,1:104757,1", "http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/08/13/new-phase-autism/", "http://adc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/91/1/8", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&a=2618", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=955307&query_hl=74&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2444484&query_hl=32&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=1306390&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10599627&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.autcom.org/Epidemic.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/08/no-autism-epidemic-update.html", "title": "\nNo Autism Epidemic: An Update\n"},

Neuroanatomical differences between men and women would be cited as evidence of pathology. Low employment wages and education rates (which would be worse than in our reality) would be cited as evidence of poor long-term outcome. Some researchers would speculate that differences in hair and blood mineral concentrations between men and women might give clues on the etiology of femaleness, and could even lead to a cure. Twin studies would find a very high concordance of femaleness among monozygotic twins (near 100%) and not so high among dizygotic twins (around 50%). Researchers would thus conclude that a single gene must be involved in the etiology of femaleness. Giving birth would be considered a \"splinter skill\". Instead of gynecologists, there would be DFN! doctors. Some ethically-challenged doctors would recommend hormone agonists to try to cure femaleness, and some parents would go along with such recommendations despite well known adverse effects. Parents would lament that their female children will never become engineers or athletes. Whenever females do become engineers or athletes, people would wonder if that means they are men now. Some parents would declare their female children \"recovered\" after they start playing with toy cars. People would speculate that, curiously, women appear to be more attractive than men. Men would tell of horror stories of women who became hysterical and \"had to\" be drugged/committed. Thomas Szasz would claim that \"female\" does not exist, but is simply an expedient label given to those without penises so they can be marginalized. Others would argue endlessly over whether femaleness is a disease, a disability, or simply a difference. Some would also argue that person-first language (\"she has femaleness\") is more value-free than person-second language (\"she is female\"). Claims that gender roles are a cultural construct or that \"female\" is a type of person would be scoffed at. Feminists would be called anti-cure advocates. The feminist movement would be dismissed as being comprised mostly of mildly feminine females, and a few mildly masculine males. Females with an anti-cure view would be asked for proof of gender, including pictures of genitalia. Females with a pro-cure view would not.

{"date": "Sunday, July 23, 2006", "body": "\nAn argument that has come up often as of late is an appeal to acknowledgment of anecdote: \"You refuse to look at all the cured kids.\" Let me be clear that I'd be happy to read any case reports of autistic kids who have been deemed recovered. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find such reports, particularly as they relate to biomedical interventions. The reports that do exist relate either to behavioral interventions or to no specified intervention. It is important to acknowledge that loss of label does happen in autism, although not very frequently. For example,  Szatmari et al. (1989)  found that 25% of \"nonretarded autistic children\" had a very good long-term outcome and could be considered recovered. Note that the study was published in 1989, before ABA was available, and before any of the modern biomedical interventions became popular. Note also that in California, about 60% of all autistics (of all ages) registered with CDDS are \"nonretarded\". (Clients of CDDS classified as having autism are not supposed to be PDD-NOS or Asperger, but maybe some are). Therefore, we should expect that  at least  15% of all California autistic children currently in the system will eventually be considered recovered. That's a lot of children. And certainly these days most of them will have undergone some kind of intervention. It is not surprising then to hear of many anecdotes of children who have recovered thanks to some intervention. My favorite case in point is Secretin. There was a  Dateline show  back in 1998 that told the story of Parker Beck, who was believed to have improved substantially after receiving a small amount of Secretin. I will quote a passage from the segment. \"In my book, Victoria Beck is a veritable hero,\" says Dr. Woody McGinnis, a general practitioner from Phoenix, Arizona. He was one of the first doctors to take Victoria and her discovery seriously. He now specializes in treating autistic children. He says that in his medical opinion, it's possible that a mother in New Hampshire has discovered a miracle treatment, maybe even a cure. Dr. Bernard Rimland was one of the most enthusiastic promoters of Secretin as an autism treatment. I will  quote him  below. Efforts are underway to increase the supply. The good news is that confirmatory evidence of the power of secretin keeps coming. A national newspaper told of Florida paediatrician Jeff Bradstreet's own four-year-old son, Matthew, shocking his parents by holding his first normal conversation with them the day after his first secretin infusion. And Virginia paediatrician Lawrence Leichtman told me of his \"miracle case:\" a five-year-old who had previously said only two words amazed all in the office by saying, 15 minutes after his infusion, \"I am hungry. I want to eat.\" Most cases are much less dramatic, but the autism world is excited, and for good reason... The use of secretin appears to be the most promising treatment yet discovered for the treatment of autism... Judging from what we hear from physicians who have infused many cases (not from our SOS data) at least 75% (!) of their patients on the autistic spectrum show benefits from secretin, but we cannot yet identify a subgroup that does notably better or worse than the total group... So what happened to Secretin? Many double-blind studies were done, as they should, and they consistently found no benefit from Secretin compared to placebo. In fact, some studies appeared to show a non-significant negative effect. The studies also documented for the first time how strong placebo effects are in autism. While some biomed researchers such as Bradstreet (and perhaps Dr. Rimland himself) still believe it is useful as an autism treatment, Secretin has fallen out of favor almost completely. Research should go on, of course. But I suggest expectations should be managed, and claims of recovery rates should only be made after the double-blind placebo-controlled studies (preferably with independent replications) come back with results.

{"date": "Friday, July 14, 2006", "body": "\nBack in November, 2005, David Kirby had a discussion with Citizen Cain about the correct interpretation of the California DDS numbers. Citizen Cain explained that 'entries' or 'new cases' and 'net gain' are not the same thing. To avoid confusion, Citizen Cain proposed using the 3-5 cohort caseload as a gauge of incidence. Clearly, any incidence drops should reflect quickly in that cohort. David Kirby apparently understood Citizen Cain's analysis and finally  agreed to the following : If the total number of 3-5 year olds in the California DDS system has not declined by 2007, that would deal a severe blow to the autism-thimerosal hypothesis. Note that what David Kirby is expecting to see is a drop in the total number of 3-5 year olds. He might now claim that gradual drops in caseload  growth  are significant (without explaining why) but clearly that's not what he agreed to. Let's see what the California DDS  Quarterly Client Characteristics Report  says, with only two quarters to go before 2007. Table 1: State-wide comparison of Q2 2006 with two prior quarters. Quarter Caseload Growth (False New Cases) Annual Growth (%) 3-5 Cohort Q4 2005 29,424 700 10.72% 5,680 Q1 2006 30,181 757 10.50% 5,827 Q2 2006 31,012 831 10.56% 6,083 The key information in Table 1 is that the 3-5 caseload continues to grow, and this growth is still rather fast (11.70% annually). Barring any miracles, in two quarters David Kirby will either need to issue a statement saying that he no longer believes in the autism-thimerosal hypothesis, further  goalpost-shift  the target date for a caseload drop, or claim that there hasn't really been a significant drop in the thimerosal dose per child in California. What do readers predict he will do? It's surprising that caseload growth has increased for the second or third consecutive quarter. The prior tendency was for caseload growth to drop gradually, which should be expected, as  I've argued repeatedly . It would seem that it will be a while before annual caseload growth goes down to population growth in the state, about 1.3%. I can only speculate about the implications of this turn of events, but for the time being I'm having doubts that prevalence will level off in 10 years, as I had previously estimated. Addendum Dad of Cameron  has sent me the following graph of the 3-5 caseload for the last 16 quarters. I noted that this line is not showing any signs of leveling off. Annual growth has remained consistently over 10%. To contrast, imagine what the line should look like if it had leveled off. At 1.3% annual growth, in 4 years it should have gone from about 4,000 to about 4,212 (i.e. nearly horizontal).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://citizencain.blogspot.com/2005/11/slouching-toward-truth-autism-and_30.html", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=321", "http://autismstreet.com", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/CalTrend.jpg"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/07/cdds-q2-2006-what-will-david-kirby-do.html", "title": "\nCDDS Q2 2006: What Will David Kirby Do?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 02, 2006", "body": "\nA couple of studies have been published claiming to document a correlation between autism and environmental pollutants. It is not surprising that such studies would come out as the thimerosal hypothesis of autism is phased out. It is also not surprising considering that it is now well known that the \"epidemic\" of autism was geographically isolated for the most part.  Palmer et al. (2006)  did a correlation analysis in Texas, focusing on mercury emissions.  Windham et al. (2006)  is a more methodologically sound study, not married to mercury, that looked at the relation between autism and \"hazardous air pollutants\" (HAPs) in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Lewandowski  commented on Palmer et al. and noted several important considerations that invalidate it: Mercury deposits in the western U.S. (including Texas) come mainly from Asia. Texas emissions are deposited in the eastern U.S. The primary source of mercury exposure in humans is fish, and fish are also exposed to mercury elsewhere. Autism incidence was already known to be linked to degree of urbanization. A correlation with many factors, including other chemicals, is thus expected. The  response  by Palmer et al. to Lewandowski was unsatisfactory and essentially conceded that the correlation was inconclusive and should be studied further. Another point is that a major source of environmental mercury exposure is coal burning, which is not as much an issue as it used to be.  The rough link to degree of urbanization needs to be emphasized. Because of this link, if a researcher were to look for a correlation between, say, consumption of French fries and the administrative incidence of autism, they could very well find a correlation, giving credence to the  autism fries  hypothesis. So it's not sufficient to document these types of correlations. Windham et al. admit that there could be \"uncontrolled confounding\" in their study. This confounding may or may not be environmental in nature. The California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) provides sufficient information to determine if regional differences in autism prevalence are real. I will try to use this data to show that one should be skeptical of the correlations found by Windham et al. and any correlations where degree of urbanization acts as a proxy. Data I will use data provided to me by CDDS. Readers can obtain this data by emailing  datax at dds.ca.gov  and asking for the file named  CDER Qrt Data.XLS  with autistic client characteristics for each regional center (or post your email address in the comments section). Readers may also find the  regional center map  useful to follow the analysis. Lack of Equivalence In order to make a valid claim that there is correlation between autism and something else, a researcher should make sure they are comparing apples with apples. If what \"autism\" is in one region differs from what \"autism\" is in another region, then the correlation analysis has no merit. One way to tell if \"autism\" is equivalent across regions is to compare the characteristics of those diagnosed with autism. Table 1 lists autistic client characteristics in regional centers across the Bay Area. Table 1: Q4 2005 Autistic Client Characteristics By Regional Center Regional Center Autism-Epilepsy Ratio Epilepsy MR Severe Behaviors In MR Population Golden Gate 0.56 8.26% 39.11% 36.2% 6.70% North Bay 0.59 6.90% 31.60% 17.84% 5.92% East Bay 0.76 6.30% 22.05% 13.97% 5.99% The autism-epilepsy ratio turns out to be a good indicator of prevalence for a region. (This could also be autism-cerebral palsy ratio, or the reader could determine the total population served by a regional center if so inclined). The last column of Table 1 represents the recognition of autism in the population with mental retardation. I have found that differences in this rate of recognition throw off the other proportions. So in this case we're fortunate that differences in this proportion in Table 1 are small. Table 1 shows that there is inequivalence between regional centers. But it is also of interest that in regional centers with higher autism prevalence, the proportion of autistic clients with mental retardation, epilepsy and severe behaviors is lower. A more dramatic example of this phenomenon can be observed in Table 2. Table 2: Q4 2005 Autistic Client Characteristics By Regional Center Regional Center Autism-Epilepsy Ratio Epilepsy MR Severe Behaviors In MR Population San Diego 0.62 6.82% 54.73% 23.42% 9.26% North LA 1.50 6.06% 22.56% 21.11% 9.59% We can see that North LA has an autism prevalence about 2.4 times that of San Diego, but proportionally, about 2.4 times as many autistics have mental retardation in San Diego as they do in North LA. (I chose these two regional centers because, again, their recognition of autism in the mental retardation population is similar, which allows for a fair comparison). Evidence of Catch-Up The differences in autism prevalence that exist today across regional centers were widened considerably during the \"autism epidemic\" of the 1990s. In fact, the \"epidemic\" was mostly confined to the Los Angeles area. These observations are illustrated in the following figure [courtesy of CDDS]: Presumably, something unusual happened in the 1990s in LA that did not happen nearly as much elsewhere, e.g. there was a significant upsurge of environmental pollution. Whatever it was, it's apparently leveling off now. What's strange is that the regional center with the lowest prevalence of autism in the state, Central Valley, currently has an annual autism caseload growth of 23.94%, whereas the regional center with highest prevalence in the state, Westside, has an annual autism caseload growth of 8.7%. (Note that annual caseload growth is 10.5% for the state as a whole). One would have to assume that there has been a very significant shift in emissions of environmental pollution, with Central Valley all of the sudden surpassing Westside in emissions and growing much faster. It is far more likely that Central Valley was behind in its recognition of autism and is now simply catching up. Why Only the Bay Area? It is unfortunate that Windham et al. decided to only look at the Bay Area. It would have been interesting to see their take on why the prevalence of autism in the Far Northern regional center (apparently a very sparsely populated area) is about 1.7 times that of the Central Valley regional center (which has a city, Fresno, population 400,000). Or why the prevalence of autism in East LA is slightly lower than that of Westside. Or why the South Central regional center has a considerably lower prevalence than all of the surrounding regional centers in the LA area. Recommendations Before we can move forward with regional prevalence differences and whether they correlate to various environmental triggers, it is necessary to determine that these differences exist in reality. Recognition of autism in the population with mental retardation is the key variable, because once this proportion is adjusted, it appears that the rest of the variation can be explained through differences in the definition of \"autism\". So I would recommend carrying out the following pilot study. Random groups of clients with mental retardation from Central Valley and Westside should be selected (at least 100 each). An evaluator blind to region and to pre-existing diagnoses would evaluate the clients for DSM-IV autism. This would tell us if it is true that Westside has significantly more autism than Central Valley in reality.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://familymed.uthscsa.edu/news/PalmerAutismArticle.pdf", "http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/9120/9120.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16337825&dopt=Citation", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16318919&dopt=Citation", "http://autismfries.com", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/pdf/rcdcmap2.pdf", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autism%20by%20rc.jpg"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/07/on-relation-to-environmental.html", "title": "\nOn The Relation To Environmental Pollutants\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 25, 2006", "body": "\n Incidence In California Not Dropping - A Recap Since 2001 all vaccines routinely recommended in the U.S. have contained only trace amounts ( Nevertheless, thimerosal hypothesis proponents came up with the notion that substracting the caseload one quarter minus that of the previous quarter is equivalent to the number of clients entering the system. This naive understanding of population dynamics led to claims that the incidence (\"rate\") of autism was beginning to show modest drops in California. These claims were quickly picked up by the press, which repeated the error verbatim. The net difference in the numbers between quarters was dubed \"New Cases\", implying that this is roughly the number of children diagnosed in a quarter. Unfortunately, caseload numbers in the quarterly report represent only clients with active status. As CDDS itself explains in a document titled  Data Interpretation Considerations and Limitations , differences in the numbers from quarter to quarter represent the net changes between newly reported clients and drop-outs. The significance of drop-outs should not be understated. Drop-outs include clients who have died, who have moved out of the state, who have been found to no longer be eligible for services, who have decided to no longer pursue eligibility, or who have had a change in their CDER category. In fact, there is a report titled  Active Status Population: Growth Analysis  by California State University, Sacramento. It documents number of \"New\" clients and number of those who \"Leave\", from 1999 to 2004 (see page 7). The report shows that the number of clients who leave the system is not insignificant and was growing as of 2004. There is a small drop of 2.7% in new clients between 2002 and 2003, but this number grows again by 3.6% in 2004. The small drop in 2003 corresponds to a California law change (CA AB1762, W&IC 4512) specifically crafted to depress autism caseload growth. (Many children likely lost their CDDS eligibility after this law passed). A good analogy for \"New Cases\" is \"Number of Births\" defined as the difference in the population one year minus that of the previous year. If \"Number of Births\" is defined this way, imagine what the \"Number of Births\" per year might be in a country with a constant population size. We also know that the autism caseload in California is currently growing at a rate of about 10% annually, whereas the California population grows at a rate of 1.3% or so annually. It is unlikely that autism incidence is dropping given this fast caseload growth rate. Nevertheless, caseload growth (what thimerosal hypothesis proponents call \"New Cases\") must drop necessarily. Let us imagine that annual caseload growth remains at around 2,500 indefinitely. Given population growth in the state of California, autism caseload would stabilize at about 192,000 in 64 years, which is highly unlikely. It is more probable that autism caseload will stabilize in about a decade at 40,000 to 50,000 with an annual caseload growth of 520 to 650 (130 to 162 quarterly). Another way to tell that incidence is not dropping is to look at the 3-5 cohort caseload. Numbers in this cohort should change quickly in response to incidence changes. Consider that 5 year olds in the cohort will no longer be in the cohort next year. So it is necessary for many children to enter the cohort every year to maintain the caseload. We can see in the CDDS data that annual caseload growth in this cohort is about 10%. So it is highly unlikely that incidence is dropping. Now that we have established that the incidence of autism is almost certainly not dropping in California, and that gradual drops in caseload growth are expected and not remarkable, let's see what thimerosal hypothesis proponents have said and continue to say about this issue. David Kirby  On August 11, 2005,  Citizen Cain attempted to inform David Kirby  on the difference between 'entries' and 'net gain'. The post is long already, so let's just say David Kirby finally agreed to  the following : If the total number of 3-5 year olds in the California DDS system has not declined by 2007, that would deal a severe blow to the autism-thimerosal hypothesis. Note that Kirby accepts it should be a drop in the total number of 3-5 year olds, not a drop in the growth, or a drop in the growth of the growth, or any such nonsense. Yet, right after the Q1 2006 CDDS report came out, Kirby decided to grasp at straws and claimed in EOHarm that \"yearly trends for 3-5 year olds are down\" based on gradual drops in caseload growth in the 3-5 cohort. Again, he agreed there should be drops in the caseload. Drops in caseload  growth  are not meaningful. And as  Kevin Leitch points out , at the latest Autism One conference David Kirby apparently forgot what he told Citizen Cain. I have to wonder if this is honest forgetfulness or something Kirby feels he needs to do as the author of Evidence of Harm. Geier & Geier  Epidemiological studies generally discuss prevalence or incidence. It was thus surprising that the journal JPANDS, a purportedly peer-reviewed journal, accepted a paper by Geier & Geier where they used the flawed \"New Cases\" terminology instead. After I pointed out the significance of this error to the Editor-In-Chief of JPANDS, and my comments were forwarded to the authors, Mr. David Geier requested data on \"new consumers with autism\" (true new cases) from CDDS, in what appeared to be a frantic move. I was excited CDDS would release this data after it was funded, because this data would settle the issue (and would've been great blogging data). Unfortunately, months passed, and CDDS could not complete the work because it was not funded. Clearly, Geier & Geier either could not make the payment (which was probably less than what they charge a single client of theirs) or they were not interested in having this data become public. A  response to a commentary in JPANDS  shows that Geier & Geier had decided instead to try a new party line. They would now tacitly admit to the error but claim that the \"New Cases\" calculation is an acceptable approximation on the basis that drop-outs are probably not significant: Note than once a patient officially enters into the CDDS program, he is entitled to benefits for life. This method of analysis does not adjust for potential increases or decreases in the number of persons with the diagnosis of autism owing to factors other than a new diagnosis, such as population migration or death. While such events occur, it is highly unlikely that their frequency is changing from year to year in a manner that would account for the observed trends. Geier & Geier must not be aware of the University of California  active status population report , where we can see that drop-outs are significant and do change significantly from year to year. Further, Geier & Geier fail to note changes in eligibility and diagnostic category. Of course, if they had gone ahead and funded the work they requested CDDS to do for them, we could discuss this issue with better facts at our disposal. Rick Rollens  Rick Rollens is perhaps the anti-thimerosal activist who has more often used the flawed \"New Cases\" terminology to claim that autism rates are dropping in California. To his credit, this is probably just honest ignorance. I do not believe he has strayed from this script, and has used this terminology up until the very last report from CDDS.  Wade Rankin  I don't know for sure what Wade Rankin thinks of the \"New Cases\" issue but he has said  the following : On a policy note, Rick Rollens addressed the California numbers and, more importantly, the California response to those numbers. The California DSS numbers are undeniably controversial and subject to various interpretations. But a sensible look at them indicates that something is indeed going on, and Californians should be grateful that people like Mr. Rollens are there to see that society doesn't simply bury its collective head in the sand. For this to be about something that is \"going on\" in the present tense, he must be referring to claims of an incidence drop. Sensible things can usually be explained. I hope Wade can come by and explain the sensible reasoning by which we can arrive at the conclusion that \"something is indeed going on\" in California. Summary  Thimerosal hypothesis proponents tend to use a flawed \"New Cases\" terminology to claim that the incidence of autism is dropping in California, when in fact we don't have data on incidence at our disposal, at least not after 2004 (when incidence was on an upward trend still). Some of them are aware of the flaw, but do not appear to mind repeating it. This raises some questions about the intellectual honesty of certain proponents of the thimerosal hypothesis. One might hope \u2013 but not expect \u2013 these people to come forward, explain their position and openly debate the issue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/pdf/CDER_QtrlyReport_Consideration_Limitations.pdf", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/pdf/Active_StatusPop_GrowthAnalysis.pdf", "http://citizencain.blogspot.com/2005/08/questions-for-david-kirby-dataphobes.html", "http://citizencain.blogspot.com/2005/11/slouching-toward-truth-autism-and_30.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=377", "http://www.jpands.org/vol11no2/correspondence.pdf", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/pdf/Active_StatusPop_GrowthAnalysis.pdf", "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/06/rolling-snowballs-with-friends.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/06/one-more-time-on-new-cases-for-david.html", "title": "\nOne More Time on \"New Cases\" for David Kirby and Others\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 18, 2006", "body": "\nToday is  Autistic Pride Day . I understand 2006 is only the second year for this celebration. Not surprisingly, I get the feeling that we have not come to terms with what \"autistic pride\" should be about. I sense some caution in the part of the autistic community, as if the appropriateness of autistics being proud of ourselves is unclear. Some debate has already occurred.  Joel Smith  made some good points regarding what autistic pride should  not  be, and suggested appropriate ways to celebrate it.  Ballastexistenz  explained that autistics.org did not snub Autistic Pride Day in 2005, and also echoed Joel's points in the broader context of disability pride. To try to conceptualize the issue, I have looked up what \"pride\" means to other movements.  Gay Pride .- \"The gay pride or simply pride campaign of the gay rights movement has three main premises: that people should be proud of what they are, that sexual diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent and cannot be intentionally altered.\" (Wikipedia) Black Pride .- \"Black pride is a slogan used interchangeably to depict both the movement of and concept within politically active black communities, especially African-Americans in the United States. The slogan has been used by African-Americans to denote a feeling of self-respect, celebrating ones heritage, and being proud of one's personal worth. Black pride as a national movement is closely linked with the developments of the American Civil Rights Movement, during which noted figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, A. Philip Randolph, Stokely Carmichael, and others protested the conditions of the United States' segregated society, and lobbied for better treatment for people of all races... A related movement in the 70s to dispel the notion that black people's natural features, skin color and hair was inherently 'ugly.' The movement asked that men and women stop straightening their hair attempting to lighten or bleach their skin to 'look more white.'\" (Wikipedia) Disability Pride .- \"Fundamentally, Disability Pride represents a rejection of the notion that our difference from the non-disabled community is wrong or bad in any way and is a statement of our self-acceptance, dignity and pride. It signifies that we are coming out of the closet and are claiming our legitimate identity. It's a public expression of our belief that our disability and identity are normal, healthy and right for us and is a validation of our experience.\" (Disabledandproud.com) Deaf Pride .- \"My own definition is that: *deafness is a disability which is so unique, its very nature causes a culture to emerge from it.* Participation in this culture is voluntary (I enlisted in 1989). Being a part of this culture has given me a sense of pride. I am no longer alone. I share a language, ASL, with many other people in the Deaf community. I share a history of struggle which is well-documented; not only are stories related to growing up deaf passed along within the Deaf community, but there are countless books as well (my personal favorite is Jack Gannon's Deaf Heritage). I enjoy ASL poetry and Deaf puns/jokes which cannot be translated into written English; they are unique in that they can only be understood within the framework of ASL. I enjoy attending plays and community events which focus on many Deaf issues. I also share many of the mannerisms of other Deaf people: the \"deaf applause\" cheer, a repertoire of visual expressions and signs which relay concepts far quicker than mere words ever could, a tendency to be more physically-oriented (i.e. tapping my foot, tapping someone's shoulder, blinking lights, etc, to get someone's attention), and so on. Last but not least, I bask in pride when I see Deaf people becoming more and more successful in the world...\" (Ldpride.net) I find the parallels with all these other communities remarkable. In this context, let me try to define what I believe autistic pride is: Autistic Pride is a movement based on the following premises: (1) That autistics should be proud, not ashamed of who they are; (2) That neurological diversity a gift and a necessary part of human nature; (3) That autism is inherent and pervasive, and cannot be removed without also destroying the autistic person; (4) That autistics have worth and are valuable members of society; (5) That autistics should not be forced to act \"normal\"; (6) That efforts aimed at curing, defeating and exterminating autistics are inherently misguided. I also sense there is some doubt as to whether it's appropriate to feel proud of autistics who have done well for themselves, because not all autistics reach this level of achievement. But I don't see anything wrong with  celebrating  Nobel-prize winner  Vernon Smith , for example. Or even someone like Bill Gates (if he were to come out of the closet). This is no more wrong than it would be wrong for the Black community to celebrate Martin Luther King on the basis that not every black person gets to be like Martin Luther King. And we should be proud of our strengths and talents, which are unique to each autistic individual. There is nothing wrong with this either. Finally, I want to emphasize that pride is the opposite of shame. We should not be ashamed of who we are. We should not be ashamed of what others perceive as quirks or shortcomings. There is no reason to be ashamed of hand-flapping, fidgeting, rocking and so on.

{"date": "Saturday, June 10, 2006", "body": "\n[Before I start, let me congratulate Kathleen Seidel on some excellent investigative work. She uncovered a \"fallacious\" affiliation claim by David Geier in a paper that was recently accepted by Hormone Research. After the journal learned of the affiliation claim error, the paper was removed from the electronic version of the journal, and its PubMed abstract also disappeared. You can read all about it in  Significant Misrepresentations: Mark Geier, David Geier & the Evolution of the Lupron Protocol (Part One) . Bartholomew Cubbins has  video of the Geier paper when it was on PubMed .] Because autism is a medicalized way of being at the moment, it's not surprising that much of autism advocacy consists of debating science, debunking junk science, and investigating the motivations and conduct of autism researchers. The formal mechanism for dealing with scientific criticism consists of submitting commentary to medical journals, i.e. rebuttals. This mechanism forms much of the basis of the scientific principle of self-correction. Even with criticism posted on science blogs, it's usually possible to post a comment, or at least a rebuttal on a different blog.  What if researchers decided to use defamation lawsuits instead or in addition to rebuttals in order to deal with scientific criticism? Clearly, this would be anti-scientific in principle, and scientific criticism is speech that should have the utmost protection under the law. Such lawsuits would not have the slightest chance of being won either way. But what might their impact be on autism advocates, and on scientific criticism in general? This is not just a theoretical question. Enter  Geier et al v. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) . [Thanks to Kathleen for finding and posting this information, which I should note is part of the public record.] Geier & Geier's complaint against DHHS cited \" (1) defamation, (2) interference with contract, (3) interference with prospective business advantage, (4) review of adverse agency action, and (5) interference with and deprivation of Constitutional rights arising from publication by Defendants of article falsely accusing Plaintiffs of fabricating scientific data.\" The paper in question is \" Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Critical Review of Published Original Data \" (Pediatrics, 2004) by Parker et al. The \"accusations\" claimed to exist in the paper can be found in the following paragraph: Substantial questions regarding the accuracy of the denominator data for the incidence calculation also exist. The denominator requires the total number of children in the United States who received thimerosal-containing DTaP (exposed) and the total number who received thimerosal-free DTaP (unexposed). The authors indicated the source of these data as the \"Biological Surveillance Summaries of the CDC.\" However, CDC reports only aggregate doses distributed for DTaP and other vaccines and provides no manufacturer-specific data. It is unclear how the authors estimated manufacturer-specific data because, on the basis of agreements with manufacturers, CDC does not release these data. No source is cited in the publication. The authors provided no details on how total DTaP doses distributed were translated into number of children vaccinated with specific thimerosal-containing or thimerosal-free vaccines, which is particularly problematic for a vaccine administered in a 5-dose schedule over a 4- to 5-year period. In other words, saying that \"it is unclear\" how authors obtained data was construed as a defamatory accusation. It should be noted that the Geiers had explained how they obtained the data, and Parker et al published a retraction of the statement in question. Geier & Geier, nevertheless, saw it necessary to bring about this lawsuit in spite of the retraction. This paper is one that has been repeatedly used to refute Geier & Geier in court proceedings. Clearly, this paper must have been hurting them financially, as the complaint explains: 20. Given the expertise they have attained on vaccine injury and given the demand for their services as expert witnesses, the Geiers dedicate a substantial amount of their time and resources to their role as expert witnesses. Dr. Mark Geier has appeared in approximately 100 cases and has participated in the review of approximately 1,000 claims. The stakes involved are also made clear by the complaint: 35. It has been estimated that if thimerosal was determined to be a cause of the various neurological disorders, civil damages for the injury to hundreds of thousands of children could reach in to the multiple billions of dollars, either paid for under the NVICP or in private civil litigation. The case was initially  dismissed with prejudice  following a motion from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and \"no opposition having been timely filed by the plaintiffs.\" Geier & Geier subsequently filed a  motion to dismiss without prejudice  after \"being unable to find qualified counsel to represent them in this matter.\" DHHS  opposed the motion  stating that the \"case borders on the frivolous\" but this opposing motion was later stricken from the record. In the end, the judge granted the order to dismiss without prejudice. Without much legal expertise, it's not hard to see that a case like this would be very difficult to win. Is it likely that Geier & Geier expected to win this case? If not, why bring it about? Upon learning about this case, autism advocates might react with caution, and might consider toning down criticism of Geier & Geier and other researchers. This would be an unfortunate outcome, as it would play into the hands of those who would rather keep us quiet. Prior advocacy movements have had to deal with much worse than silly lawsuits, and these movements did not retreat in the least bit. We need to continue pursuing these matters, now more than ever. Of course, there is no need to expose ourselves unnecessarily. Protect yourselves as best you can. And most of all, we need to back each other up when bad things do happen. Let me now restate what others and myself have said about Geier & Geier: It is unclear how the  errors in Geier & Geier (2004)  might have come about. It is unclear why, after learning of the \"new cases\" issue in Geier & Geier (2006), the authors  requested data on \"new consumers with autism\" from CDDS  only to later leave CDDS hanging. It is unclear why  David Geier misrepresented his GWU affiliation  in a Hormone Research article which has been withdrawn. The autism community demands answers to these questions. The appropriate way to answer these questions is not to bring about frivolous lawsuits. It is simply to answer them. And I want to make clear that I invite Geier & Geier to defend themselves in the comments section of any of my posts or elsewhere.

Jim Adams, a professor of chemistry at Arizona State University and parent of an autistic daughter, is conducting the first double blind, placebo controlled study on chelation. It's expected to be completed by the winter of 2006. The study was featured by  Dateline  on Sunday June 4, 2006. Jim Adams is a DAN! doctor. But I trust that Dr. Adams will conduct this research in a proper manner, following all the rules required of a double-blind study. He's got a  prior study  on vitamin supplements, where he documents some significant improvement in gastrointestinal and sleep problems, but negligible improvement in autistic symptoms. [Note: I just finished watching the Dateline segment. They used the \"devastating\" word and showed some kids who were said to be recovered from autism. It wasn't at all obvious that they were no longer autistic. And it wasn't at all obvious that they were severely affected before chelation. After watching Jim Adams, I'm sure many bloggers at Autism Hub would easily imagine why his daughter is autistic. I immediately thought of the fictional researcher from  Apology from an autism researcher . His daughter is verbal and I wouldn't say she's \"low functioning\" from what little was shown. At this point it appears that Jim Adams is pretty close to the acceptance phase regarding his daughter. He's one of those parents who'd been told that he would have to institutionalize his daughter. Dateline did mention the CDC thimerosal studies, chelation deaths, and interviewed a researcher who said chelation is useless in autism.] What should we expect of the chelation study? Probably nothing remarkable. In the past, Chelation Therapy has been touted as beneficial for a number of conditions, but placebo-controlled studies have failed to substantiate anecdotal accounts. I will list some studies below. I'm only including studies that have a control group on placebo. Feel free to list any studies I've missed in the comments section. Neurological & Behavioral Problems Dietrich et al (2004)  - Lead Exposure - Succimer \"Chelation therapy with succimer lowered average blood lead levels for 6 months but resulted in no benefit in cognitive, behavioral, and neuromotor endpoints... Chelation therapy with succimer cannot be recommended for children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 \u00b5g/dL (0.96-2.12 \u00b5mol/L).\" Rogan et al (2001)  - Lead Exposure - Succimer \"Treatment with succimer lowered blood lead levels but did not improve scores on tests of cognition, behavior, or neuropsychological function in children with blood lead levels below 45 microg per deciliter. Since succimer is as effective as any lead chelator currently available, chelation therapy is not indicated for children with these blood lead levels.\" Liu et al (2002)  - Lead Exposure - Succimer \"The improvement in scores in the placebo group only implies that factors other than declining blood lead levels per se are responsible for cognitive improvement; it is possible but less likely that succimer, the active drug, impairs cognition.\" Arthur et al (1997)  - Cerebral vasospasm in rabbits - Deferiprone \"The present study demonstrates that deferiprone is effective in attenuating experimental cerebral vasospasm. Because of its stability, lipophilicity, and ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, deferiprone represents an attractive candidate for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.\" Gordeuk et al (1992)  - Coma due to cerebral malaria - Deferoxamine  \"Iron chelation therapy may hasten the clearance of parasitemia and enhance recovery from deep coma in cerebral malaria.\" McLachlan et al (1993)  - Alzheimer's - Desferrioxamine \"The trivalent chelating agent desferrioxamine (DFO), 125 mg i.m. twice daily five days per week, was used in a randomized single-blind, oral lecithin, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 48 patients with AD... Analysis showed that the treatment and no-treatment groups were closely matched at entry into the trial but that the rate of decline, as measured by the VHB over 2 years of observation, was twice as rapid in the no-treatment group compared with the DFO-treated group.\" Ziegler et al (2004)  - Diabetic Polyneuropathy - ALA \"The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence that treatment with alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg/day i.v.) over 3 weeks is safe and significantly improves both positive neuropathic symptoms and neuropathic deficits to a clinically meaningful degree in diabetic patients with symptomatic polyneuropathy.\" Growth Peterson et al (2004)  - Growth - Succimer \"Although succimer lowers blood lead in moderately lead-poisoned children, it does not have a beneficial effect on growth and may have an adverse effect.\" Lasky et al (2001)  - Growth in Reshus Monkeys - Succimer \"Growth in weight, length, and head circumference did not vary significantly as a function of blood lead levels. Succimer chelation therapy did not significantly affect weight, length, or head circumference through 2 years of age.\" Hearing Lasky et al (2001)  - Auditory Function in Reshus Monkeys - Succimer \"Finally, the auditory evoked response at levels from the auditory nerve to the cerebral cortex did not significantly differ as a function of succimer treatment.\" Apparent Heavy Metal Toxicity Grandjean et al (1997)  - Symptoms Attributed to Amalgam Fillings - Succimer \"Immediately after the treatment and 5 to 6 weeks later, most distress dimensions had improved considerably, but there was no difference between the succimer and placebo groups. These findings suggest that some patients with environmental illness may substantially benefit from placebo.\" Sandborgh Englund et al (1994)  - Alleged Mercury Poisoning - Succimer \"No treatment effect of DMSA was apparent on subjective symptoms and mood state. One statistically significant treatment effect was noted - a decrease in fatigue-inertia in the DMSA-group - but there was no demonstrable correlation with increased urinary excretion or decreased blood concentration of mercury. Three subjects showed hypersensitive reactions, probably DMSA-specific, at the end of the treatment period. This placebo-controlled study provides no scientific support for diagnostic or therapeutic administration of DMSA for symptoms allegedly associated with chronic mercury exposition from dental amalgam fillings.\" True Heavy Metal Toxicity O'Connor & Rich (1999)  - Lead Poisoning - Succimer \"All children with BPb, in the range studied here, should receive environmental evaluation and remediation; DMSA does not improve long-term blood lead levels.\" Mazumder et al (2001)  - Arsenic Poisoning - 2,3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate \"3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate treatment caused significant improvement in the clinical score of patients suffering from chronic arsenic toxicity. Increased urinary excretion of arsenic during the period of therapy is the possible cause of this improvement.\" Cardiovascular Disease van Rij et al (1994)  - Intermittent claudication - EDTA \"Multiple reports of excellent results in large numbers of patients have encouraged the use of this regimen... CONCLUSIONS: Chelation therapy has no significant beneficial effects over placebo in patients with intermittent claudication.\" Knudtson et al (2002)  - Ischemic Heart Disease - EDTA \"There is no evidence to support a beneficial effect of chelation therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease, stable angina, and a positive treadmill test for ischemia.\" Chen et al (2006)  - Blood Pressure - Succimer \"Overall, there is no association between blood lead and blood pressure in these children with moderately high lead exposure, nor does chelation with succimer change blood pressure.\" Summary Chelation therapy is somewhat effective in the treatment of true heavy metal toxicity, but does not appear to have discernible effects in cases of minor exposure (as would be the case with  Pica ) or after significant time passes following exposure.  Iron chelation (with agents specific for this purpose) seems to be beneficial in Cerebral vasospasm and in Coma due to cerebral malaria. But these conditions result in severe neurological damage that can ultimately cause death, and they are not caused by iron poisoning.  Padhye (2003)  hypothesizes that \"excess dietary iron is the root cause for increase in childhood autism and allergies.\" But this hypothesis appears to be falsified by  Latif et al (2002)  which found a high prevalence of iron deficiency in autistic children. Chelating iron out of autistic children does not seem advisable. There's a finding of interest about Alzheimer's and chelation of aluminum, but it was a  single-blind  study that apparently has not been replicated. Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), an anti-oxidant which is also used as a mercury chelating agent, appears to be helpful in diabetic neuropathy. This leads me to wonder if ALA could be treating peripheral neuropathy induced by excessive vitamin B6 supplementation. In general, prior chelation studies in combination with prior placebo-controlled autism studies suggest that anecdotal accounts of improvement need to be taken with a grain of salt. There is no good reason to suppose that Dr. Adams will find anything of significance regarding chelation therapy and autism, particularly given what is known about autism in regards to heritability, neurobiology and cognition. Even if Dr. Adams does find a positive correlation, this would not necessarily implicate mercury, thimerosal or poisoning for that matter. It does not appear advisable to try chelation at the moment \"just in case\" considering its potential adverse effects. And I do hope Dr. Adams documents negative placebo effects and adverse effects in his study. Further Reading - Green, Saul.  Chelation Therapy: Unproven Claims and Unsound Theories .

It's always possible for murderers to find some kind of justification for their crime. Maybe they were experiencing economic hardship. Maybe they were abused as children. Maybe they had some kind of \"mental illness\". Maybe they did not receive enough support and services. But the role of society in making murder more likely does not constitute a justification for murder. Murderers do not deserve our sympathy and should be punished regardless of circumstances. And people realize this for the most part. When parents murder their non-disabled children, there's seldom any sympathy for the murderers. This is true regardless of any hardships the murderers might have been experiencing. Sentences are generally harsh. And there's little to no outcry about such sentences. But it's different with disabled children. And I can't help but conclude this is because the disabled victim is considered to be less than human - perhaps better dead than disabled. And make no mistake. It's not autism which caused Karen McCarron (reputedly a curebie mom) to snap. It was the negative discourse about autism which contributed to her state of mind. It's organizations like Autism Speaks with videos such as Autism Every Day. They have sent a message (and continue to do so as I write this) to the effect that it's unremarkable for parents of autistics to be thinking about killing their autistic children. Things don't have to be this way, as evidenced by all the parents writing about acceptance at  Autism Hub , and by the parents of  Rett girls , who apparently don't spend their time whining about services and the mostly self-imposed difficulties of raising autistic children. I'm not one to believe in fate or purpose. But I'm willing to consider that Katie's death might have fulfilled a purpose in a sense.

{"date": "Thursday, May 18, 2006", "body": "\nAllow me to list the terms that should be used to properly refer to prenatal testing of autism and other genotypes. Genocide .- \"The systematic killing of substantial numbers of people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, political opinion, social status, or other particularity.\" (Wiktionary) Eugenics .- \"A social philosophy which advocates the improvement of human hereditary qualities through selective breeding. See natural selection.\" (Wiktionary) Eugenicists prefer to dance around these terms in favor of euphemisms such as \"reproductive choice\". But this debate is not about a woman's right to choose to give birth. It's about the potential to choose which types of children are born based on their genetic makeup. Breeding humans in this manner is no one's right, and should never have become an option. This is a moral issue primarily, but it is also a pragmatic issue. Let's think about the practical implications of artificially selecting human beings. I don't just mean that it would be a bad idea to  abort a potential Bill Gates . This example is easy to grasp, but it only represents the tip of the iceberg. And eugenicists will no doubt try to work around this problem by choosing specific characteristics that make people like Bill Gates successful (e.g. abort only those who are \"low functioning\" - for the time being). The main problem with eugenics is that it's a potentially catastrophic experiment involving the entire human race. It presumes that humans are capable (without any prior experience) of replacing nature in its task of natural selection and evolution. It presumes that we know which traits are desirable and which aren't. It presumes that we can anticipate our future needs, and that we can ensure the survival of the species under varying environmental circumstances. Human diversity is not a politically correct description of human deficiencies. It's a necessary part of our species. A civilization where everyone is a talented salesperson could not possibly function; nor could a civilization where everyone is a scientist or an engineer. There is a term from evolutionary theory for this equilibrium. It's called  balanced polymorphism  or  disruptive selection . This is the mechanism that ensures the existence of genetic diversity within a species, and naturally leads to the existence of \"fringe\" phenotypes. Autism is particularly problematic in regards to eugenics. It is likely that autism results from the combination of multiple alleles, perhaps 3, perhaps 100. Phenotypes such as autism and homosexuality have a reproductive disadvantage, but it is clear that the individual alleles that make up the corresponding genotypes cannot be reproductively disadvantageous. If parents start to abort babies with specific allele combinations, then the frequency of each individual allele will likely increase, as parents attempt to reproduce again. It will be increasingly difficult to conceive children who are  not  autistic. The debate over the ethics of eugenics relates also to the debate over the ethics of cloning. Imagine a future where parents prefer to clone celebrities instead of conceiving their own biological children. It would lead to the same outcome: catastrophic collapse of the species. Finally, I must point out that while they may try to exterminate our kind, we will not just disappear quietly into the night. Think about the pragmatics of that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7899821/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversifying_selection"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/05/pragmatic-case-against-eugenics.html", "title": "\nThe Pragmatic Case Against Eugenics\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 29, 2006", "body": "\nReaders might see this entry as entirely theoretical. Well, I find concepts and ideas fascinating and that's why I'm writing about this, so bare with me. Also, I think this particular concept is in fact useful. I get the feeling there are several misconceptions about the notion of autism as a  cultural construct , and I hope to address them with a list of points and a follow-up example. Some of these misconceptions are aspects of the theory that I have been confused about myself. Saying that autism is a cultural construct is simply an ideology. Actually, a cultural construct or social construct theory about an entity is a scientific theory that is falsifiable. It should not be confused with Neurodiversity, which is an ideology. Claiming that autism is a cultural construct is equivalent to claiming that autism is not \"real\" - that it does not exist, or that it's not useful. No. Cultural constructs are very real and useful. Language is a cultural construct. Countries are a cultural construct. Money is a cultural construct. Believe me, I'm not about to cash all my savings and throw them away because money is a cultural construct. The purpose of cultural constructionism is to understand the usefulness of cultural constructs. It means that people cannot identify as autistic. That's not correct. See the Example section below. It means there are no differences between autistics and non-autistics. The fact that differences between autistics and non-autistics can be found is not surprising. Differences can probably be found across any behavioral spectrum, regardless of where the spectrum is divided. Differences can be found between men and women; between races; between any two groups of people, in fact. These differences are often found to occur 'in average' (i.e. they can't be generalized), but this is not a requirement of cultural construct theory. It means autism does not have a cause or a treatment. Again, this is not correct. Cultural constructs may have underlying mechanisms which are not only cultural, including but not limited to genetic mechanisms. See the Example section below. Cultural construct theory only applies to 'mild' cases of autism. There is no such limit imposed by cultural construct theory, and there is no non-cultural way to define such a boundary. Cultural construct theory does not have a practical application. I think cultural construct theory can help explain the \"autism epidemic\" and help decipher some of the causes of autism. Current thinking of autism as an identifiable \"brain disease\" is leading nowhere. The example below provides a model which could be helpful in this regard. Example A straightforward cultural construct is  short stature . Consider how short stature is defined. Should only the bottom percentile of the population in height be considered short? How about the bottom 5%? 10%? Is it real? Of course. Does it have causes? Yes, it probably has many causes, including genetics. Is it pathological? In some cases it probably is. Is pathology determined by severity? Not necessarily. Is it treatable? Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can help - whether it's advisable to use it is debatable. Can people identify as short? Evidently. Is it absolute? \"Short\" surely has a different meaning in different cultures. Can it be a burden and lead to suffering? I'm sure it can. A more relevant example of a cultural construct is  mental retardation . Consider how the questions above are answered in regards to this construct. Further Reading - Timimi, S. Taylor, E.

{"date": "Thursday, May 11, 2006", "body": "\n Background . According to the FDA, \u201csince 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children  Methods . Three groups of websites were compared using Alexa.com web traffic data. Group 1 (the control group) consisted of 3 top autism websites found through a Google search on the search phrase \u201cautism\u201d and verification of reach through Alexa.com. Group 2 consisted of 3 autism websites well-known for their focus on neurodiversity and/or acceptance. Group 3 consisted of 3 autism websites well-known for their focus on the thimerosal hypothesis. Results . The following tables summarize our findings. Data was obtained on 05/10/2006. Reach refers to number of unique visitors. Total reach change is calculated as a weighed average.   Table 1: Traffic trends of top \"autism\" sites.

Thimerosal-autism web traffic is quickly imploding into oblivion, whereas autism acceptance traffic is clearly thriving. A surprising finding is that top neurodiversity related sites currently have more web presence, in average, than top autism sites that can be easily found by typing \u201cautism\u201d in Google. And the gap will continue to widen.  Kevin Leitch  is credited with driving most of the current traffic. The largest portion of traffic growth is currently experienced by  Neurodiversity.com . This is indicative of a rapid paradigm shift away from the disease construct of autism. Researchers and the media would do well to take note of this. We also found that  Autism-hub.co.uk  has a reach of 11 with a 3-month reach change of +4,300%, but we have excluded it from the analysis because it\u2019s a new website. We were unable to verify a prior  claim  by Handley that neurodiversity parents are \u201cthe minority of a minority of a minority\u201d. Best Jr. had previously asked \u201cHow many parents do you think are that stoned that they would buy into something so absurd?\u201d Evidently, many do, without being \u201cstoned\u201d. We further hypothesize that \u201cRescue Angel\u201d Best Jr. has inadvertently contributed to the collapse of the thimerosal-autism worldview with his  many writings . Geier & Geier (2006) attempted to argue that a correlation between autism incidence and thimerosal existed after removal of the same. Unfortunately, several fatal errors were pointed out to Geier & Geier, who subsequently requested data from California DDS to see if they could still substantiate their findings. They later backed down for reasons we can only speculate about. Shattuck (2006) was published shortly afterwards, showing that a good portion of the increase in diagnoses of autism can be attributed to diagnostic substitution. A prior paper by Geier & Geier on the link between thimerosal dose per child and autism prevalence has been shown to have  unusual flaws . Geier & Geier are also known for their promotion of a chemical castration agent as a treatment for autism. In addition to this, a full retraction from David Kirby is expected by early 2007. Not surprisingly, the web presence of Evidenceofharm.com has all but disappeared. As we write this, the Amazon.com sales rank of \u201cEvidence of Harm\u201d is in free fall, dropping at a rate of 7-29% every day. A much publicized new website by Handley, Putchildrenfirst.org, was already noted by  Abfh  to be \u201cless popular than vampire hobbit porn\u201d.

Autism is known to be extremely heritable. It is perhaps the most heritable of all psychiatric disorders. It is about as heritable as intelligence and a lot more heritable than personality. Even though autism is  not 100% heritable , no behavior or skill is known to be 100% heritable or anything close to that. Given the low concordance of autism in siblings and fraternal twins compared to the concordance in identical twins, it is likely that autism results from the combination of a number of alleles, 3 to 15 or even more according to researchers. Since the prevalence of ASD is somewhat high (and I'd argue the current prevalence is still an underestimate) it follows that the frequency of most of the alleles that result in autism must be relatively high. Ian Parker asks why the frequency of these alleles remains high. Even if only 1% of individuals with one of these alleles became autistic, and assuming that autistics procreate much less often than the average person (which I believe is an undisputed assumption), then the frequency of the allele in question should gradually drop until it is close to zero (or whatever can be maintained through new mutations and limited inheritance), unless non-autistic individuals with the allele reproduce more often than the average individual. The alleles that result in autism must therefore have a slight reproductive advantage by themselves, and be reproductively disadvantageous when combined.  A follow-up question is why alleles that are reproductively advantageous don't have a frequency that gradually increases until it reaches 100%. Obviously, if all autism alleles reached a frequency of 100%, then nearly every person in the planet would be autistic. So there has to be a sort of frequency equilibrium for each autism allele. It also follows from the above that the frequency of slightly disadvantageous alleles can be high and stable. I hypothesize that frequency equilibrium applies to alleles associated with most other spectrum disorders in the field of psychiatry. It also contributes significantly to the huge diversity of human behavior, and explains seemingly paradoxical combinations of creativity, intelligence and neurological impairment. There are ways to test this hypothesis. The alleles associated with autism can be mapped, and reproduction rates of non-autistic individuals with these alleles can be measured. For the time being, let us consider the reproduction rates in the families of autistics, taking into account that parents of autistics are usually non-autistic. I will use data from Table 2 of the  US Census Report for 2003 . This gives 0.89 children per family, 1.82 children per family with at least one child, and 2.46 children per family with at least two children. (I assume the number of children per family with at least 4 children is 4.25, and I have verified that variations in this number don't produce large errors). Note that these numbers do not vary a lot from state to state, according to  a 2000 Census table . It also seems these proportions have not changed much since  1994 . Now consider  Ghaziuddin (2005)  which examined 58 subjects with AS, and found that they had a total of 64 siblings. This gives a proportion of 2.1 children per family with at least one AS child. See also  Deykin et al (1979)  which is a somewhat older paper. It finds a proportion of 3.18 children per family with at least 2 children. Based on the 1980 data found in the  1994 Census report , I estimate the proportion of children in households with at least 2 children at 2.81 in 1980. Piven et al (1990)  results in a proportion of 2.81 children per family, but it is unclear if the sample is complete, and the authors only looked at adult autistics and their siblings. By themselves, these findings are not statistically significant, but taken together they might be indicative of a trend. Unfortunately, no studies have looked at this question specifically, so there is little to go on. (I have contacted some authors of such studies but they have not been able to provide any additional useful info so far). There are some additional caveats: Census data looks at all children under 18. Autism studies look at children diagnosed with autism, which rules out very young children, but at the same time could result in a youth bias. Research specifically looking into this question would find control probands matched by age. The autistic child in a family likely reduces the 2nd generation reproduction rates in that family. This is not relevant to the analysis, however, as the number of families with autistic alleles is probably much larger than the number of families that have an autistic child. There could easily be sociological reasons to explain a higher number of children in families where one child has been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. But this could also work in the opposite direction. It is not necessary for non-autistics with autistic alleles to have a preference to procreate. It might be sufficient that they form families more often. Conclusions Autism alleles are likely advantageous by themselves, but reproductively disadvantageous when combined. This results in a frequency equilibrium for each of the alleles. The frequency of most autism alleles is likely high and relatively stable. Most autism alleles should thus not be described as \"disease genes\". This has some implications on how researchers should look for autism loci. There is an open question as to whether autistic families reproduce more often than average. Additionally, research on the reproduction rates of individuals with specific alleles could be carried out. Finally, this analysis shows that eugenics is pragmatically misguided. If combinations of alleles that have a high likelihood of resulting in autism are identified, and parents abort pregnancies based on this information, it is likely that the frequency of all autism alleles will increase (as parents may simply attempt to procreate again).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://a-shade-of-grey.blogspot.com/2006/04/autism-genetics-and-evolution_19.html", "http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=15203355&postID=114601836828122482", "http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-553.pdf", "http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/hh-fam/tabST-F1-2000.pdf", "http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p20-483.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15909404&query_hl=23&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/6/628", "http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p20-483.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2324058&query_hl=28&itool=pubmed_DocSum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/05/preliminary-evidence-of-higher.html", "title": "\nPreliminary Evidence Of Higher Reproduction Rates in Autistic Families\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 05, 2006", "body": "\n Blaxill (2002)  introduced the notion that there is no \"hidden horde\" of adult autistics. Blaxill's letter was already dissected by Kathleen Seidel in  Reflections on the \"Hidden Horde\" . Autism bloggers might also recall Mike Stanton's possible  finding  of a \"hidden horde\" in the UK. What I want to focus on here is a specific type of claim put forth by Blaxill: Nylander and Gillberg screened adult psychiatric outpatients for evidence of undiagnosed autistic spectrum disorders. This population had not been screened for autism previously. The authors hypothesized that they would find high rates of undiagnosed autism. The screening procedure located 19 adults with autistic spectrum disorders who had not received a prior diagnosis. However, the prevalence in this group was only 2.7 per 10000, a finding that provides little support for a hidden horde hypothesis. The authors note this point reluctantly, claiming that the observed prevalences \"should be regarded as an absolute minimum.\" Blaxill refers to  Nylander & Gillberg (2001) . The authors correctly qualify the \"absolute minimum prevalence\". Every autistic adult would not be expected to be a psychiatric out-patient, as defined in this study. But we can extrapolate. The authors find that 1.44% of these patients had \"definite ASD\". Now consider that the prevalence of psychiatric disorder in adults varies considerably between 10% and 20%. This would seem to result in a prevalence of  14 to 29 in 10,000 , from this population alone. Note also how Blaxill fails to mention that 89.5% of all autistics found by Nylander & Gillberg were previously \"missed\". Scharin & Hellstrom (2004)  have found that adult psychiatry does not recognize disorders in the patient population by the frequency the disorders presumably appear. Consider also  Stahlberg et al (2004) , which finds that 30% of adult patients with ADHD had comorbid ASD. As of 2006, the prevalence of ADHD in adults in the US is 4.2% [ ref ]. If Stahlberg's sample is representative, the resulting prevalence of ASD is  126 in 10,000 , from this population alone. This is clearly a scandalous result. Bajerot et al (2001)  found that 20% of OCD subjects had \"autistic traits\" and suggested that OCD is related to HFA and Asperger's. The prevalence of OCD in adults is around 4% [ ref ]. Putting these numbers together we come up with an ASD prevalence of around  80 in 10,000 , from this population alone. So far we have not even considered the institutionalized population. An early finding by  Shah et al (1982)  was that 38% of the adult population in a mental handicap hospital had behaviors consistent with autism. A similar result was obtained by  La Malfa et al (2004)  in an Italian population with intellectual disabilities. Before the study, only 7.8% were recognized as having PDD. Prevalence in the population with intellectual disabilities varies widely from 3% to 50%, according to  de Bildt et al (2005) . Considering that the prevalence of mental retardation is about 1%, a 38% proportion of ASD in this population would result in an ASD-MR prevalence of  38 in 10,000 . Autism is missed frequently in many populations. For example, among those with bipolar disorder, the prevalence of ASD is anywhere from 8% to 62% [ ref ]. It is about 32% in the population with epilepsy [ ref ]. (The prevalence of epilepsy is 0.5% to 1%). ASD affects about two thirds of people with Tourette Disorder [ ref ]. It is found in anywhere from 10% to 14% of the population with learning disabilities [ ref ][ ref ]. (The prevalence of learning disability is around 5% or 6%). To contrast, note that the current California DDS recognition of autism in the population with epilepsy is about 4%, and 7% in the population with mental retardation. In other words, the prevalence of autism in California has nowhere to go but up. No studies to date have looked at the total population prevalence of ASD in adults, but one comes close.  Baron-Cohen et al (2001)  assessed a control group with the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). It found that 2% scored higher than 32. The study mentions that after an interview, 7 of 11 previously undiagnosed high-scorers met threshold criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis. It is also known that 20% of autistics are missed by the AQ. Putting these numbers together we come up with a prevalence of  159 in 10,000  for the non-institutionalized population of adults. The 2% finding should be taken with a grain of salt, as the control group size is only 174. But note the study was replicated in Japan by  Kurita et al (2005)  who found the proportion of high scorers to be 3% in a control group of 215 individuals. [ Errata : The best replication of Baron-Cohen et al (2001) is actually  Wakabayashi et al (2004) , with a control group of \"normal adults\" of size 194 and another control group of university students of size 1050. They found that 3% of individuals in both control groups scored more than 33.] Baron-Cohen et al (2001) also found that scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than controls, as did the group of Mathematics Olympiad winners. I wonder if these qualify as \"geeks who got lucky\", which is the other theory Blaxill is fond of. If these prevalence numbers in adults seem high, consider  Posserud et al (2006)  who found that 2.7% of children in the 7-9 cohort were high scorers in the ASSQ. This study also documents what I interpret as parent unwillingness to have a child labeled autistic. So what is the  true  prevalence of ASD, after all relevant populations are screened? Is it 200 in 10,000 perhaps? Frankly, this question in unanswerable. A diagnosis of autism, to date, is inherently subjective. It's not only the criteria that matters, but also how the evaluator understands and interprets the criteria. Even when more systematic instruments are used, scoring each item is a subjective exercise, and threshold scores are either arbitrary or selected from a prior subjective basis. To take an example, Posserud el al (2006) finds that 2.7% of children score in the 97.3 percentile of the ASSQ. He could very well find that 5% of children are in the 95 percentile. Why is one boundary better than the other? Timimi (2004)  makes a good case about the subjectivity of an autism diagnosis. Other parents might also find some of Timimi's remarks encouraging: In my clinical practice I often come across children and adolescents who are labeled autistic. When I focus on their abilities I often find much about them that does not fit the autistic discourse. Once I reopen the question of diagnosis many adolescents ask me to officially \"undiagnose\" them, which their parents are usually very pleased about. Summary Blaxill should recognize that his \"hidden horde\" device is of little value at this point. The prevalence of autism in adults is likely about as high as that found in children. Autism is apparently often \"missed\" in many populations and is only identified after exhaustive screening. Finally, it is important to realize that a diagnosis of autism is not medical, but subjective.

{"date": "Sunday, April 23, 2006", "body": "\nAfter my  second open letter  to Dr. Huntoon, the Editor-In-Chief of JPANDS, he responded in a way that was totally inconsistent with a prior communication: Dear [Joseph]:   Thank you for your commentary regarding the Geiers' manuscript.   As I said before, you are welcome to enter into scientific debate regarding the paper by submitting a letter to the editor (conforming to the attached guidelines).   You are also welcome to communicate with the authors directly do discuss the paper.   L.R. Huntoon, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.A.N. Editor-in-Chief Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons [Email removed] As I have explained, Dr. Huntoon had already said that he would allow the authors to respond. He is aware of the error, and he must be aware of the tacit admission of this error by Mark Geier, the request of new data from CDDS, and so on. Now Dr. Huntoon is acting as if nothing had transpired. This leads me to believe that JPANDS is not likely to print a retraction, however obvious and serious the error might be. I imagine the editors of JPANDS figure that a retraction would be more damaging to their type of journal than whatever damage to their already diminished credibility might result from not printing a retraction.  I know, I know. Many people had told me this, and they might have been right. I was naive to think that some intellectual honesty and integrity might exist in JPANDS and in the paper authors. Given that I no longer believe a retraction is inevitable, I decided to drop the politeness, and just let them have it. Dear Dr. Huntoon: The last time we communicated I was under the impression that you were prepared to take some action regarding Geier & Geier (2006) and you stated that you were forwarding my comments to the authors so they would have a chance to respond, in the interest of fairness. Now you appear to be avoiding the issue altogether. I do not mind if you print my comments as letters to the editor, even though this is not why I have contacted you. (Regarding conflicts of interest as defined by the guidelines you sent me, I submit that I have none. However, I do have more subjective conflicts of interest given that I am the parent of an autistic child and I am on the autism spectrum myself, so I object to the broad labeling of autistics as brain damaged or mercury poisoned). I am confident Geier & Geier (2006) will be addressed formally in the scientific literature in due time. I understand the MIND Institute might be preparing a formal rebuttal, and blogger Interverbal has already posted a detailed  rebuttal  of this paper, which I understand has been submitted to your journal for publication as a commentary. Nevertheless, regarding the particular error I have brought to your attention, no further \"debate\" is necessary. The error was well-known even before the paper was written. Given that the author has tacitly admitted to the error, and given that you must be well aware of this, I fail to understand why your editorial board would not be considering a retraction at this point. To illustrate the significance of this error, if the autism caseload in 2010 and 2011, for example, were to be stable at 40,000, the authors would claim that the number of diagnosed cases of autism between those two years is zero. This is the kind of error JPANDS is knowingly allowing to remain published without a retraction, and this is public knowledge now. I get the impression that JPANDS does not publish retractions or errata. I do not see a retraction policy in your guidelines. Can you confirm this? According to Atlas (2004) , only 18% of biomedical journals publish a retraction policy. This is unfortunate because journal retractions are the foundation of the scientific principle of self-correction. There are people on the internet who say that JPANDS is not a reliable journal and that its peer-review process is non-existent. I have preferred to give JPANDS the benefit of the doubt. But at no point in our exchange has it been apparent that peer-reviewers are involved in the revision process, so I am now inclined to believe that what your critics claim is correct. In Huntoon (2006) you criticize what you refer to as \"sham peer review\", which you claim is a process \"cloaked in secrecy, so as to protect the accusers\". I hope this does not mean you believe peer-review in general, and anonymous peer-review in particular, is unnecessary.  In the interest of scientific integrity, intellectual honesty, and your journal's credibility, I urge you, Dr. Huntoon, to take some action regarding Geier & Geier (2006). Sincerely, [Joseph] The JPANDS process has become a bit more clear as a result of this exchange. This is positive, and is public knowledge now. The tacit admission of a fatal flaw in the paper by Mark Geier is something else that has been achieved. Will JPANDS still publish a retraction? Maybe not now, but as the topic is dealt with in the formal literature in the months and years to follow, the pressure to do so might be considerably greater.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://interverbal.blogspot.com/2006/03/review-of-early-downward-trends-in_15.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/jpands-will-apparently-avoid.html", "title": "\nJPANDS Will Apparently Avoid Retraction\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 22, 2006", "body": "\nFor readers who haven't been following the  Geier & Geier (2006)  retraction controversy, here's a recap: - On March 12, 2006, I sent a  retraction request  to the editor of JPANDS, indicating that there is an unsalvageable flaw in the author's use of the \"New Cases\" terminology. - I received a  response  from Dr. Huntoon asking if this was a letter to the editor. I replied indicating that it was not a letter to the editor, but a request for a response from the peer reviewers. I further explained the magnitude of the error with an analogy. Dr. Huntoon subsequently agreed to forward my comments to the authors as it was fair to allow them to respond. - On March 15, CDDS  informed me  that David Geier had requested data on \"new consumers with autism\", thus admitting to the error, and probably hoping to salvage the conclusions of the paper by means of new supporting data. - On March 24, I asked CDDS what the status on the requested data was. Paul Choate  informed me  that the dataset was basically ready, pending payment from the authors. Paul Choate also outlined a number of other known facts about the CDDS which invalidate Geier & Geier (2006). It had been almost a month since my last contact with CDDS, so yesterday I asked Paul Choate again about the requested dataset. He tells me that the final steps of the job are on hold because payment has not been completed yet. It appears to be unclear at this point if this transaction will go through.  Paul Choate also informs me that he believes members of the CHARGE study at the MIND Institute are preparing a formal rebuttal to Geier & Geier (2006) to be published in the AMA Journal. A formal rebuttal will be great, and it's not surprising that many rebuttals might be published challenging a paper as flawed as this one. But I think it is still important to hold JPANDS to account and test their integrity. They need to recognize that a full retraction is a necessity in this case. So I contacted Dr. Huntoon once again. Dear Dr. Huntoon: On March 12 and 13, 2006 we discussed a serious error in the use of the \u201cNew Cases\u201d terminology found in Geier & Geier (2006). Subsequently, you agreed to forward my concerns to the authors in order to allow them to respond. Mr. Geier (the senior author) tacitly admitted to this error when he requested data on \u201cnew consumers with autism\u201d from the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS). I understand CDDS has completed the requested work, but is awaiting payment from the authors. At this point it is unclear when and if this transaction will be completed. While it would be informative to review data on newly reported autistic clients in order to have a more accurate picture of the administrative incidence of autism in the state of California, I believe it is necessary to point out that this is immaterial to the validity of the paper, as published in your journal. Terms such as \u201cNew Cases\u201d and \u201cNewly Diagnosed Cases\u201d referring to CDDS quarterly differences and caseload differences in general, invalidate Geier & Geier (2006) in its entirety, regardless of what the new data shows. Even if the new data were to be consistent with downward trends in the incidence of autism, which is unlikely as I argue below, much of the paper would need to be rewritten. Publishing errata is insufficient due to the magnitude of the error. Graphs would have to be redone and figures changed in many parts of the paper. Without the new data, it is impossible to do this. The new data is unlikely to be consistent with the current conclusions of the paper, for well-known reasons. Any valid rewrite would practically need to argue the opposing hypothesis. This is because CDDS caseloads in the 3-5 and 6-9 cohorts continue to grow at a pace that is considerably faster than general population growth in the state. This alone is inconsistent with an ongoing incidence drop.  The flaws in the paper are substantial, and they go beyond what I\u2019ve outlined.  Under the circumstances, I'd like to urge JPANDS to publish a full retraction of the paper. If the authors are able to write a different paper, based on new data, the new paper would have to be considered a new submission and should be freshly reviewed.  I would appreciate being informed of the actions your editorial board is planning to take regarding this matter. Sincerely, [Joseph] P.S. I am blogging this communication, and copying CDDS.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2006", "body": "\nWhile researching the literature for my previous post I found an interesting study, which in turn has led to even more information of relevance. Shah et al (1982)  screened mentally retarded adults and found that 38% of the individuals in this population had social impairments consistent with those of autism.  Consider that about 2.5% of the general population scores in the mentally retarded range (IQ below 70). Granted, only 0.9% can be assumed to be truly retarded according to Baroff (1991). Still, if the 38% proportion holds (confirmed below) then the prevalence of autism, from this population alone, would have to be at least  34.2 in 10,000 . This prevalence would essentially be the prevalence of autism with mental retardation in adults, back in 1982. This is  not  \"high functioning\" autism, if you buy the IQ score criteria for dividing functioning levels. Shah et al (1982) refers back to an earlier study by  Wing & Gould (1979)  which also addresses the issue of identification of autism in the populations with and without mental retardation. It would appear that Lorna Wing, who co-authored the 1982 study, should have been aware that increasing recognition of autism in the population with mental retardation could easily lead to the appearance of an \"autism epidemic\". The abstract of a recent paper,  Wing & Potter (2002) , does not mention this specifically, but says the following: The evidence suggests that the majority, if not all, of the reported rise in incidence and prevalence is due to changes in diagnostic criteria and increasing awareness and recognition of autistic spectrum disorders. Whether there is also a genuine rise in incidence remains an open question. Shah's proportion is confirmed by a very recent study.  La Malfa et al (2004)  screened an Italian population with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) for PDD-MRS (PDD with Mental Retardation). This raised the prevalence of PDD in this population from 7.8% to 39.2%. Shah et al (1982) and La Malfa et al (2004) provide substantial support for  my assertion  that a contributing factor in administrative autism caseload growth is increasing recognition of autism in the population that tests in the mentally retarded range. (This is basically the same as diagnostic substitution from mental retardation to autism). That is, time-dependent differences and regional differences in the proportion of identified autism in this population are simply administrative, not real. As I have noted previously, recognition of autism in the mentally retarded population in the CDDS was about 3.5% in 1992. It stands at about 7% currently. As of 2006, the recognized proportion is 2.48% in Central Valley (Fresno), and 10.73% in Westside (West LA). Clearly, there still is a lot of room for prevalence growth in this population. And there is, of course, a lot of room for prevalence growth in the population without mental retardation (IQ of 70 or above). Consider  Posserud et al (2006)  who found that 2.7% of the total population of 7-9 year olds were high scorers in the ASSQ (Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire). This is the prevalence of \"geek\" if you will. A generation from now we might be talking about an ASD prevalence of 290 in 10,000. Or maybe not.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7149707&query_hl=73&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=155684&query_hl=69&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12216059&query_hl=69&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15025669&query_hl=73&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01462.x"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/hidden-horde-partly-identified-in-1982.html", "title": "\n\"Hidden Horde\" Partly Identified in 1982\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 18, 2006", "body": "\nGiven all the hype about the \"autism epidemic\" we are supposed to be experiencing, you would think there must be some evidence of it outside special education and administrative disability caseloads. Surprisingly, a review of epidemiological studies does not appear to support the existence of said epidemic. I will list my findings below, trying to compare apples to apples. This is difficult because different studies don't use the same methodology, criteria and cohorts. Furthermore, while prevalence numbers from these studies are not as unreliable as those derived from administrative caseloads, their results are likely still affected by awareness, perceptions, willingness to diagnose, willingness to seek a diagnosis and willingness to accept a diagnosis. Classic Autism Table 1 lists what different studies have found regarding the prevalence of what I will call \"classic autism\". This is not intended to include other PDDs or \"high functioning\" autism. Not all studies use the same criteria to determine what \"classic autism\" is, however, but we will assume there is reasonable approximation between them. Table 1: Studies on Prevalence of \"Classic Autism\". Study Where Criteria Cohort Prevalence Per 10,000 Wing (1976) England, Wales, U.S. and Denmark ? 0-14 4-5 Hoshino (1982) Fukushima-ken, Japan ? 8-16 4.96 Gillberg (1984) Gothenburg, Nebraska ? 4-18 2 Steffenburg (1986) Swedish rural/urban ? 0-10 4.4 Matsuishi (1987) Kurume City, Japan ? 4-12 15.5 Bryson (1988) Nova Scotia, Canada Three characteristic symptoms ? 10 Tanohue (1988) Ibaraki, Japan DSM-III 10-16 13.9 Cialdella (1989) Rhone, France DSM-III 5-9 5.1 Sugiyama (1989) Nagoya, Japan ? ? 13 Fombonne (1992) Four regions, France ? 12-16 4.9 Wignyosumarto (1992) Yogyakarta, Indonesia Bryson's scale plus CARS 1-8 12 Sponheim (1998) Norway ICD-10 3-14 4-5 Irie (1999) Higashi-Osaka City, Japan ? 7-12 10.4 Davidovitch (2001) Haifa, Israel ? 8-12 10 Bertrand (2001) Brick Township, New Jersey DSM-IV 3-10 40 Lauritsen (2004) Denmark ? 0-9 11.8 Williams (2005) Two Australian States DSM-IV, ICD-10 0-14 4.3-5.5 Zhang (2006) Tianjin, China ? 2-6 11 I fail to see anything in Table 1 that should be cause for alarm, and that cannot be explained by differences in criteria and diagnostic practices.  It is also unclear where GenerationRescue got their 1 in 10,000 prevalence number for ASD in the 1970s. The concept of a broad autism spectrum did not even exist in the 1970s, which obviously means that no studies can corroborate that number. There is a notable anomaly, however. The Brick Township study indicates there's a very high prevalence of Autistic Disorder in that area, at least 4 times what should be expected. This excludes other PDDs and Asperger's Syndrome. I believe this study needs to be replicated independently, and equivalence with other regional studies must be documented. It's quite possible researchers in this case had a bias for broader criteria. Use of DSM-IV might also be of significance. Some forms of \"high functioning\" autism are easily included in that definition. The prevalence for all other PDDs and Asperger's syndrome in Brick Township was 27 per 10,000. This seems rather low and might be a reason for the discrepancy. The numbers could also be affected by increasing recognition of autism in the population classified as having mental retardation.  Shah (1982)  indicated that 38% of the adult population with mental retardation had social impairments consistent with those of autism. Since about 0.9% of the general population is considered mentally retarded, labeling 38% of them as autistic would result in an autism prevalence of 34 per 10,000 from this population alone. As a point of reference, the current California DDS average for recognition of autism in the population with mental retardation is 7%. Asperger's Syndrome Asperger's syndrome was not recognized as a diagnosis until the early 1990s, so we don't have prevalence data before that.  Table 2: Studies on Prevalence of Asperger's Syndrome. Study Where Criteria Cohort Prevalence Per 10,000 Ehlers (1993) Goteborg, Sweden ? 7-16 36 Lauritsen (2004) Denmark ? 0-9 4.7 Gillberg (2006) Goteborg, Sweden ? 7-24 9.2 Even though there aren't many studies looking specifically at the prevalence of Asperger's syndrome, again, there's no good reason to suppose that it has increased in an alarming way. The great variability in results suggests that Asperger's syndrome is often undiagnosed or diagnosed as autism. Full Spectrum The idea of autism as a broad spectrum is fairly new as well. This means there are no studies on the prevalence of a full ASD spectrum before the 1990s. Table 3 lists most of the existing studies. Note that we are comparing apples and oranges to some extent because of differences in methodology. It's not clear which studies include Asperger's syndrome, for example. Table 3: Studies on Prevalence of ASD. Study Where Criteria Cohort Prevalence Per 10,000 Honda (1996) Yokohama, Japan ICD-10 5 21 Kielinen (2000) Finland DSM-IV, ICD-10 5-7 20.7 Bertrand (2001) Brick Township, New Jersey DSM-IV 3-10 67 Scott (2002) Cambridgeshire, UK ? 5-11 57 Webb (2003) Cardiff, UK ICD-10 8-12 20.2 Lingam (2003) North East London ICD-9, ICD-10 5-14 26 Yeargin-Allsopp (2003) Atlanta, Georgia DSM-IV 3-10 34 Icasiano (2004) Barwon, Australia ? 2-17 39.2 Lauritsen (2004) Denmark ? 0-9 34.4 Chakrabarti (2005) Midlands, UK ? 4-6 58.7 Gillberg (2006) Goteborg, Sweden ? 7-24 53.4 Again, there is nothing alarming in Table 3. Discrepancies could be explained by differences in criteria and diagnostic practices. The Brick Township study stands out, but not by much. The autism spectrum could easily be expanded beyond where it currently stands, resulting in an apparent prevalence increase. Summary A review of epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Classic Autism, Asperger's Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders fails to show that an \"epidemic\" has occurred, despite all the hype. The Brick Township study is anomalous and should be replicated independently. In general, I would qualify these studies as messy since they make it very difficult to compare apples to apples. Methodologies that permit equivalence comparisons should be proposed and applied.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=935299&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7129258&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=6607262&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=3779317&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=3498744&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=3265136&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=3410807&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2784446&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2708306&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=1411750&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=1495268&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=9656133&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10025132&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11303376&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/108/5/1155", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15697060&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/182_03_070205/wil10326_fm.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16370317&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7149707&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=8294522&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15697060&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16568356&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=8871801&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11095038&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/108/5/1155", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12212915&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12785438&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://adc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/88/8/666", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12503976&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15569287&query_hl=83&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15697060&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15930062&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16568356&query_hl=26&itool=pubmed_DocSum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/no-evidence-of-epidemic-from.html", "title": "\nNo Evidence of \"Epidemic\" from Prevalence Studies\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 25, 2006", "body": "\nIn light of the Geier & Geier (2006) debacle, I\u2019ve reviewed earlier autism papers by these same authors in order to determine if similarly significant errors can be found. Let me introduce a paper titled \" A comparative evaluation of the effects of MMR immunization and mercury doses from thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines on the population prevalence of autism \" (Geier & Geier, 2004). The conclusions of this paper cannot be sustained any longer, of course, but I would like to bring the reader\u2019s attention to the pattern of errors found in Geier & Geier (2004). Prevalence By Birth Year Cohort The paper claims to show that there is a correlation between the thimerosal dose per child and the \u201cprevalence of autism from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.\u201d Upon closer examination, this is not what the paper shows at all. The paper finds a dubious correlation of thimerosal dose per child and the administrative prevalence of autism  by birth year cohort . This is a non-trivial difference as I will explain. The first sign that something is wrong is the prevalence line in Figure 2 of the paper, which shows a downward trend in prevalence starting in 1994 and continuing through 1996. As we all know, there was no decline in the prevalence of autism during those years, in any age cohort. The problem is that the authors use an autism prevalence line that always has a downward pattern in recent years (a hook shape if you will) as illustrated by the following figure. This is because autistic children are seldom diagnosed before the age of 18 months, some \u201cregress\u201d some time after that, and there must also be a late diagnosis factor. This is why this prevalence line keeps changing as the report is updated year after year. The authors should have analyzed the prevalence trend of an age cohort, e.g. the 3-5 cohort. Instead, they attempted to draw conclusions from differences in the prevalence of autism in different age cohorts (birth year cohorts), which is clearly an invalid analysis. I challenge the authors to demonstrate a correlation using autism prevalence in the vaccination age cohort. In the figure above, the blue line (2002) is perhaps the one that happens to be the best fit for the mercury dose graph in Figure 2 of the paper. The authors produce their own trend line using the DOE Annual Report to Congress for the 2001-2002 school year, and the CDC\u2019s yearly live birth data. (The latter is also used to calculate the dose of thimerosal per child). The trend line the authors chose (perhaps coincidentally) is a much better fit than any of the trend lines from the figure above. I challenge the authors to demonstrate the correlation holds using prevalence data by birth year cohort from the most recent report available. Omission of 1986-1989 Table 1 as well as Figure 2 of the paper omit data for the 4 year range 1986 to 1989. This, of course, is not the proper way to do an annual graph, even if data is unavailable for those years. It is unclear if the authors are aware that if data for those years had been included, it would likely be much more difficult to argue that Figure 2 illustrates a pattern of correlation. Additionally, there would likely be several dots outside of the trend line in Figure 1. It is possible this error of omission is unintentional. The authors state they \u201cselected birth cohorts that had complete information from all the necessary sources.\u201d Regardless, I challenge the authors to obtain the data for the missing years and produce new versions of Figure 1 and Figure 2. Conclusion Geier & Geier (2004) contains significant flaws, the pattern of which warrants further investigation. I will send a short note to Medical Science Monitor with a reference to this post. A full retraction appears necessary in this case but is not expected, based on prior experience with similarly invalid papers.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.medscimonit.com/pub/vol_10/no_3/3986.pdf", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autism%20byc.jpg"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/curious-errors-in-earlier-geier-paper.html", "title": "\nCurious Errors in Earlier Geier Paper\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 11, 2006", "body": "\nThe California DDS  Quarterly Client Characteristics Report  for the quarter ending March 2006 was posted some time today. Let's compare this quarter to Q4 2005: Table 1: State-Wide Comparison of Q4 2005 with Q1 2006. Quarter Caseload Growth (False\u00a0New\u00a0Cases) Annual Growth 3-5 Age Range Q4 2005 29,424 700 10.72% 5,680 Q1 2006 30,181 757 10.50% 5,827 As we can see, CDDS autism caseload continues to have strong growth. There's an unexpected increase in the caseload growth this quarter (what's usually referred to as \"New Cases\" by mistake). The prior tendency was for population growth to stabilize. Annual growth (calculated against the corresponding quarter the year before) has dropped a bit, but it still has a long way to go before it matches population growth in the state of California, about 1%, as would be expected in the long run. There is strong growth in the 3-5 age range, which suggests there is no drop in administrative incidence. Central Valley The regional center with lowest administrative prevalence of autism is Central Valley (Fresno). They are basically at the beginning of the 'epidemic'. Let's see what's going on there. Table 2: Comparison of Q4 2005 with Q1 2006 in Fresno. Quarter Caseload Growth (False\u00a0New\u00a0Cases) Annual Growth Q4 2005 829 33 23.00% Q1 2006 880 51 23.94% Looks like Fresno, not surprisingly, is experiencing very strong caseload growth; more than twice that of the state. Fresno has a long way to go to catch up with other regional centers, however. Westside The regional center with the highest administrative prevalence of autism is Westside (West Los Angeles). In fact, it's well known that most of the 'epidemic' in California has occurred in the LA area so far. Let's see what's going on in this regional center. Table 3: Comparison of Q4 2005 with Q1 2006 in Westside. Quarter Caseload Growth (False\u00a0New\u00a0Cases) Annual Growth Q4 2005 1,653 19 8.32% Q1 2006 1,687 34 8.70% Caseload growth in Westside is not as high as that of the state, but it's still considerably higher than population growth in the LA area. A bit of a surprise is that caseload growth is increasing in Westside at the moment, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything when comparing two quarters. This regional center is the one we'd expect to stabilize first.  Has Thimerosal Removal Done Anything? Despite law changes (Lanterman Act, 2003) specifically aimed at decreasing caseload growth, it's clear administrative prevalence will continue to increase for a long time to come, perhaps one more decade. Trends in the 3-5 age range do not support an incidence drop following removal of thimerosal from vaccines. I recommend Dr. Geier's paper be renamed to  \"Upward Trends in Neurological Disorders Remain Strong Following Removal of Thimerosal from Vaccines\"  if the paper is to be salvaged in any way. David Kirby had said that if the caseload in the 3-5 age range was not declining by 2007, he'd admit he was wrong. I'd point out to Kirby that 3 quarters are not going to make a difference. Not only is the caseload in that age range not declining, but it's still showing strong growth. Additionally, if you understand the reasons why caseload grows (which I have explained in detail) the only way there could be a substantial decline in administrative incidence is either by magic, massive genocide, or through extremely strict law changes. It's time for a concesion from our opponents in this debate. If they had a modicum of intellectual honesty, they should admit being mistaken.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/cdds-q1-2006-no-nonsense-details.html", "title": "\nCDDS Q1 2006: No Nonsense Details\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 10, 2006", "body": "\n Autism Diva  has a posting on the latest research by Dr. Mottron's team. Michelle Dawson is a new member of this team, as I'm sure most readers are aware. She has made significant contributions to autism research already. Cognitive mechanisms, specificity and neural underpinnings of visuospatial peaks in autism . Caron MJ, Mottron L, Berthiaume C, Dawson M. Clinique Specialisee de l'Autisme, Hopital Riviere-des-Prairies, Montreal, Canada; Departement de Psychologie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Canada. In order to explain the cognitive and cerebral mechanisms responsible for the visuospatial peak in autism, and to document its specificity to this condition, a group of eight high-functioning individuals with autism and a visuospatial peak (HFA-P) performed a modified block-design task (BDT; subtest from Wechsler scales) at various levels of perceptual cohesiveness, as well as tasks tapping visuomotor speed, global perception, visual memory, visual search and speed of visual encoding. Their performance was compared with that of 8 autistics without a visuospatial peak (HFA-NP), 10 typically developing individuals (TD) and 8 gifted comparison participants with a visuospatial peak (TD-P). Both HFA-P and HFA-NP groups presented with diminished detrimental influence of increasing perceptual coherence compared with their BDT-matched comparison groups. Neither autistic group displayed a deficit in construction of global representations. The HFA-P group showed no differences in performance level or profile in comparison with the gifted BDT-matched [i.e. higher full-scale IQ (FSIQ)] group, apart from locally oriented perception. Diminished detrimental influence of perceptual coherence on BDT performance is both sensitive and specific to autism, and superior low-level processing interacts with locally oriented bias to produce outstanding BDT performance in a subgroup of autistic individuals. Locally oriented processing, enhanced performance in multiple tasks relying on detection of simple visual material and enhanced discrimination of first-order gratings converge towards an enhanced functioning and role of the primary visual cortex (V1) in autism. In contrast, superior or typical performance of autistics in tasks requiring global processing is inconsistent with the global-deficit-driven Weak Central Coherence hypothesis and its neurobiological magnocellular deficit counterpart. This is just the latest of this team's work, which in my opinion represents a paradigm shift; a departure from cognitive research that has traditionally attempted (in convoluted ways) to explain away cognitive differences in autistics as the result of brain damage or dysfunction. Most of this team's findings describe, in a non-demeaning manner, how autistic cognition is different, not inferior, to that of the general population. Other examples of Dr. Mottron's work follow: Impaired Face Processing in Autism: Fact or Artifact? Face perception in high-functioning autistic adults: evidence for superior processing of face parts, not for a configural face-processing deficit. Enhanced Perceptual Functioning in Autism: An Update, and Eight Principles of Autistic Perception. Non-Algorithmic Access to Calendar Information in a Calendar Calculator with Autism. Global-Local Visual Processing in High Functioning Children with Autism: Structural vs. Implicit Task Biases. Can Spectro-Temporal Complexity Explain the Autistic Pattern of Performance on Auditory Tasks? Atypical visual orienting to gaze- and arrow-cues in adults with high functioning autism. Eyes are special but not for everyone: the case of autism. Enhanced and diminished visuo-spatial information processing in autism depends on stimulus complexity. Quantification judgement in high functioning autism: superior or different? Do high functioning persons with autism present superior spatial abilities? Locally oriented perception with intact global processing among adolescents with high-functioning autism: evidence from multiple paradigms. A study of memory functioning in individuals with autism. Local and global processing of music in high-functioning persons with autism: beyond central coherence? The research I find most intriguing is that of the gap in Weschler and Raven (RPM) IQ scores in autistics. (See  The Nature of Autistic Intelligence ). It would appear that the gap widens the more autistic the individual is. This contradicts the old assumption that Asperger autistics have normal or superior intellectual functioning compared to classic autistics. They even have a case study of a non-verbal 15 year old autistic adolescent who scores in the 0.1 percentile in the Weschler and in the 95 percentile in the RPM. In other words, the kid is profoundly retarded according to one test and close to gifted according to the other.

{"date": "Friday, April 07, 2006", "body": "\nAccording to a common argument, autism is a pathology resulting from an environmental trigger (a virus, poison or injury) because its identical twin concordance is not 100%. I do not believe it is reasonable to expect concordance of any subjectively evaluated behavior to be 100%, and I will try to support this claim by comparing various behavioral and physical phenotypes.  (There's also an argument to be made about phenocopies caused by environmental triggers, but I won't discuss that in this particular post). Autism The first identical twin study on autism was Folstein & Rutter (1977). It found a  concordance of 36% in identical twins. This seems low, but note that they found a concordance of 82% for \"cognitive abnormalities\". This is a key to how conceptions of autism have changed since that time. Folstein & Rutter probably used a very narrow definition of autism. Other studies since have indicated that narrower definitions give lower concordance, which is not surprising. Folstein & Rutter (1977) also found a 0% concordance for fraternal twins. This needs to be taken with a grain of salt, because they only had 10 fraternal twin pairs. In other words, this only says it's lower than 10%, with a significant margin of error. The highest concordance to date was found by Ritvo et al (1985). It was 95.7% for identical twins, and 23.5% for fraternal. They probably used a broad definition of autism in this case. A positive aspect of this study is that they had 23 identical twin pairs, many more than usual. The twin study considered to be the best one methodologically speaking is Bailey et al (1995). It found a 60% concordance of autism in identical twins and 0% in fraternal. It also found a 92% concordance for a broader autism spectrum in identical twins and 10% in fraternal. It might be of interest to compare fraternal twin concordance with sibling concordance to try to determine environmental influence. But again, small sample sizes make this impossible within a comfortable margin of error. Sibling concordance is anywhere between 2%-4% for classic autism and 10%-20% for a broader spectrum, which is not inconsistent with fraternal twin data. Homosexuality Kallman (1952) was the first twin study on homosexuality. It found a 100% concordance in identical twins, and 42.23% in fraternal.  This study has been contradicted by more recent ones.  Heston & Shields (1968) found a concordance of 20% in identical twins. The study sample of 5 pairs limits its conclusions, however. Bailey & Pillard (1991) found a concordance of 52% in 56 pairs of identical twins, and a concordance of 22% in fraternal twins. Left-handedness A commonly cited number for concordance of left-handedness is 12% in identical twins, compared to a background of 8%. If this is correct (not much literature on the subject) then left-handedness is not very heritable. Intelligence The number usually cited for concordance of intelligence in identical twins is 80%. This, of course, must depend on the IQ range used to determine concordance. Aggregating various studies, there's about 87% concordance in identical twins reared together, 76% in identical twins reared apart, and 56% in fraternal twins reared together [ ref ]. Heritability estimates seem to range between 0.4 and 0.8. Personality Across many personality traits the average concordance in identical twins is 50% and 30% in fraternal, per Bouchard & McGue (1990) and Loehlin & Nichols (1976). Heritability estimates range from 0.40 to 0.50. Eye Color Let's now look at a physical characteristic that can be evaluated fairly objectively. Bito et al (1997) found a concordance of 98% for eye color in identical twins and 49% in fraternal. These results are not surprising. Concluding Remarks Autism concordance in identical twins is not 100%, which suggests there is likely some kind of environmental  influence  in autism etiology. The assumption that this influence must be in the form of an environmental  insult  (a poison, virus or injury) is simply a reflection of expectation bias in the part of researchers and parents. Autism is extremely heritable even when compared to personality and intelligence. It is not far-fetched to suppose that the kind of subtle environmental influence that results in discordant personality and intelligence in identical twins also plays a role in autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wilderdom.com/personality/L4-1IntelligenceNatureVsNurture.html#EvidenceNature"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/twin-concordance-not-100.html", "title": "\nTwin Concordance Not 100%\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 04, 2006", "body": "\nAt this juncture I feel it is necessary to emphasize that the burden of proof on the 'autism epidemic' has clearly shifted. The strength of the findings that support the conclusion that no epidemic has occurred is undeniable: 1) The characteristics of the autistic population have changed over time. Severity indicators are dropping consistently as apparent prevalence rises. Comparing numbers from one year to the next is like comparing apples and oranges. 2) The 'epidemic' is geographically isolated. There is evidence of a catch-up factor between regions, as well as evidence of group inequivalence between regions. 3) There is no evidence that objectively diagnosed co-morbidities of autism have been on the rise. Existing data show that this is not the case at least for epilepsy and mental retardation. 4) There is evidence of diagnostic substitution, in particular from mental retardation and learning disability.  5) There is evidence of increasing recognition of autism within the population with mental retardation.  6) There is no evidence of incidence drops which may be correlated to removal of possible environmental triggers. Some of these observations have already been made in the mainstream literature. See for example: Laidler,  US Department of Education Data on \"Autism\" Are Not Reliable for Tracking Autism Prevalence  (2005). Shattuck,  The Contribution of Diagnostic Substitution to the Growing Administrative Prevalence of Autism in US Special Education  (2006). The staff of California DDS Data Extraction itself is well aware of many of these facts and of the misuse of caseload data to determine prevalence and incidence numbers. This is clear from communications I have received from CDDS: Latest on Geier Retraction . Geiers Retraction a Done Deal IMHO . I have argued many of these points myself in several blog entries. Although some bloggers have disagreed with my conclusions, no real rebuttals have been posted. No Autism Epidemic: Summary of the Numerical Evidence . CDDS Data 101 . \"Like Missing a Train Wreck\" - By The Numbers . Regional Differences and Quarterly Growth Due to Two Factors .

{"date": "Sunday, April 02, 2006", "body": "\nI previously argued that apparent differences in the prevalence of autism across regions in the state of California must be due to group inequivalence. Given that there is a clear  broadening of criteria  component as time goes by, I suggested that some Regional Centers are simply behind in their knowledge of autism and catching up. But after looking at client characteristics per Regional Center, I have found that the reality is a bit more complex. Quarterly caseload growth and regional caseload differences seem to be affected by two factors that act largely independently. Table 1: Q4 2005 Autistic Client Characteristics By Regional Center Regional Center Autism-Epilepsy Ratio Epilepsy MR Severe Behaviors In MR Population CVRC 0.32 5.31% 25.6% 20.99% 2.48% SDRC 0.62 6.82% 54.73% 23.42% 9.26% SARC 0.85 5.45% 17.70% 14.67% 5.31% ELARC 1.34 6.06% 21.19% 17.67% 8.49% WRC 1.61 5.51% 22.38% 13.25% 10.73% Table 1 shows that there is inequivalence between Regional Centers, but it is not as straight forward as the inequivalence observed in the state-wide quarterly data. A pattern emerges, however, if you look at the proportion of autistics in the population with mental retardation. Except for San Diego (SDRC), which does appear to be behind in criteria, it would seem that differences in autism rates can be explained by how many clients evaluated as having mental retardation are also determined to be autistic. In order to test this hypothesis, let us adjust the autism caseload by assuming that 7% of all clients with mental retardation are also classified as autistic (as this is roughly the state-wide average). We will then see what the proportion of MR and lack of it among autistics might be given this assumption. Table 2: Q4 2005 Adjusted Characteristics (Theoretical) Regional Center Autism-Epilepsy Ratio MR No MR CVRC 0.47 49.21% 47.90% SDRC 0.54 47.74% 46.83% SARC 0.89 22.10% 60.96% ELARC 1.32 17.82% 77.29% WRC 1.48 15.81% 77.69% Table 2 looks more like the state-wide time-based data, as we would expect. The consistency of these results does two things: - It suggests that our assumption is probably valid. That is, the proportion of autistics in the MR population throws off the numbers, and differences in this proportion are apparent, not actual. - It suggests that the proportion of autism in the non-MR population varies from region to region simply due to inequivalence, i.e. differences in criteria between regions. New Model These findings lead me to come up with a more specific model to explain both the explosion in diagnoses since the early 1990s and regional differences in apparent prevalence. The model involves two factors: 1) There is increasing recognition of autism in the population with MR. [This was already noted in  \"Like Missing a Train Wreck\" - By The Numbers ]. 2) There is increasing recognition of autism in the population without MR. These two factors act somewhat independently. As time goes by, both occur simultaneously. But they may vary independently from region to region. For example, San Diego (SDRC) is considerably behind the average Regional Center in Factor # 2, but is considerably ahead in Factor # 1. Fresno (CVRC) is considerably behind in both factors. West LA (WRC) is considerably ahead in both. In retrospect, these two factors are obvious. But note that a common error is to assume that 'broadening criteria' includes only Factor # 2.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/04/regional-differences-and-quarterly.html", "title": "\nRegional Differences And Quarterly Growth Due To Two Factors\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 31, 2006", "body": "\nTolerance is not about letting kids do whatever they want. Being anti-cure is not the same as being someone who does not want children to be helped. Neurodiversity is not an ideology that fails to recognize the liabilities of different neurological wiring. Many misconceptions about neurodiversity and the anti-cure position have come up in blogs recently, and I've found myself addressing them.  Ballastexistenz  also dealt with a similar issue in a recent post. Some people wonder if the neurodiversity concept applies only to so-called \"high functioning\" autistics. Some non-autistic researchers seem to think so [ ref ]. Even a famous autistic, Temple Grandin, appears to have opinions consistent with this view [ ref ]. This view, nonetheless, is one I happen to be against. For one, no one seems to agree on how the boundary between low-functioning and high-functioning is established. This is an inherently subjective and error-prone boundary, as is the boundary between autism and \"normalcy\". But more importantly, it does not make sense to speak of the need to accept human diversity while at the same time denying the diversity of those who are more different than ourselves. Others believe that the neurodiversity concept is inconsistent with any possible medical liabilities which are relatively more common in autistics. I have addressed this view before in a posting titled  Do Co-Morbidities Prove Pathology? Saying that autism cannot be cured is sometimes interpreted as a claim that autistic people cannot move outside of the diagnostic threshold. It is clear autistics develop throughout their lifes. It is not impossible for a small portion of autistics to appear to \"grow out of it\". As I have noted, autism diagnostic criteria has moved up the spectrum considerably in recent times, so it is not surprising to hear more and more anecdotes of \"full recovery\". There are those who argue that such children were never autistic to begin with, but this kind of claim is not verifiable considering there is no medical test for autism. I should caution that I am not saying this to give false hope to parents who would much rather have non-autistic children. I'm just pointing out something that needs to be recognized. Anti-cure and anti-treatment are often confused with one another. I think it is important to spell out the meaning of  cure  in relation to autism. To cure autism (based on the generally accepted meaning of the term  cure ) would entail turning an autistic person into a neurotypical person, and not just helping the person work around some of the liabilities of autism. Because of this, autistics feel that being cured would entail being transformed into a different person, with different dreams, talents and interests. Being cured of autism is therefore akin to ceasing to exist. When autistic advocates express their opposition to the latest autism treatment, it is often assumed that they do so because they are anti-cure. This is a misunderstanding. None of the autism treatments currently popular are anywhere near a cure as defined above, so being anti-cure has little or nothing to do with opposition to treatment. For example, Michelle Dawson has clearly explained her opposition to ABA on ethical grounds in her essay titled  The Misbehavior of Behaviorists . Treatments are generally opposed because of their unproven effectiveness and potential adverse effects. In their desperation to recover the normal child that they believe is hidden inside the autistic child, parents try many different kinds of treatments, one after the other. These treatments may or may not be harmful in the short- or long-term. They are relied upon based on \"thousands of anecdotal accounts\". These anecdotal accounts need to be taken with skepticism, as I've argued in a prior post titled  Placebo Effects in Autism . I can't make generalizations about which management approaches are approved or disapproved by autistic advocates. Some might like ABA and others might not, for example. In the table below I summarize what my personal opinion on some of the most popular treatments is. Treatment Effectiveness Adverse Effects ABA There is a semi-experimental result by Lovaas which supports its effectiveness. The study has been criticized on methodological grounds, as the control group was not randomized, and the evaluators were not blind to treatment. The study also relied on aversives, which are often said not to be in use today. The Lovaas approach is a conditioning technique that is inherently coercive. There are some reports of PTSD following treatment. There are no follow-up studies into adulthood. The only follow-up study that exists was on the same Lovaas group, so the same methodological flaws apply. Son-Rise No clinical trials to determine its effectiveness have been conducted. The approach is a form of acceptance therapy. Given it's non-coercive nature, it is unlikely to have any adverse effects on the child. Parents, however, might be affected due to the false hope this program appears to promote. GFCF Diet There is no effectiveness data on the GFCF diet as an autism treatment. To the extent that autistic people are more prone to allergies or to having Celiac Disease, it could be helpful, but it is doubtful that it treats autism itself. It appears to have no adverse effects. Supplementation with calcium would seem to be warranted, however. Multivitamins There are some placebo-controlled double-blind studies which appear to show that multivitamins (particularly Vitamin B6 with Magnesium) result in certain improvements. Some studies seem to show that they don't. It is unclear if they only help a subset of children who suffer from malnutrition or a Vitamin B6 deficiency. Natural is not necessarily the same as safe. Vitamins are drugs. In particular, high doses of Vitamin B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy. L-Carnosine There is one double-blind placebo-controlled study which seems to show it is effective, but this study has not been replicated. There are anecdotal accounts from adult autistics who have found it helpful. There appears to be no data on adverse effects at this point. Some parents report increased hyperactivity. Again, because something is natural, this doesn't mean it is safe, particularly at high doses. Chelation There are no studies on the effectiveness of chelation therapy as a treatment for autism. Additionally, there are good reasons to believe that it is generally useless in that regard. A chelating agent can chelate minerals and nutrients in addition to heavy metals. Deaths due to hypocalcemia induced by certain types of agents have been reported. Long-term effects might include kidney damage. There is little data on possible long-term effects particularly given that parents are often told to keep chelating indefinitely. A final issue I would like to address is that of the effect the pro-cure perspective might have on an autistic child. I believe this is a non-trivial issue. Suppose you are told that your personality is not really a personality, but instead the result of an injury, a virus or a poison. What kind of effect do you think this might have on your self-worth?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ballastexistenz.blogspot.com/2006/01/neurodiversity-is-not-opposite-of.html", "http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/7138/lobby/disability.htm", "http://ballastexistenz.blogspot.com/2006/01/temple-grandin-displaying-near.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/on-tolerance-cures-and-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nOn Tolerance, Cures and Neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2006", "body": "\nIn  prior posts  I argued that the California data is totally consistent with the absence of any noticeable autism epidemic between 1992 and the present time. This, however, does not preclude the possibility that the frequency of certain key alleles has changed slowly over decades or centuries.  This hypothesis is of course very speculative, and it would be impossible to test it in the short term. At best, it might be possible to carry out genetic studies of certain populations that have been isolated for a long time, such as the Amish.  What I want to do in this post is explore a number of genetic mini-epidemic theories. Note that these theories had been proposed to try to explain the explosion of autism diagnoses that started in the early 1990s. At this point we know the most likely explanation for the 'autism epidemic' is that of 'broadening criteria/awareness' \u2013 based on the changing characteristics of the autistic population and regional peculiarities. Nevertheless, these genetic theories do propose mechanisms by which the frequency of alleles might change in human populations over long periods of time, which could have intriguing implications on human evolutionary theory. The Geek Syndrome Theory This theory is often attributed to an article from Wired Magazine titled  The Geek Syndrome  (2001).  What the Geek Syndrome Theory proposes is that the success of the computer industry has helped geek types get better employment, marry and procreate in higher proportion than would have been possible in the past.  In another age, these men would have been monks, developing new ink for printing presses. Suddenly, they're reproducing at a much higher rate. The article claims that autism \"is surging among the children of Silicon Valley.\" It further notes that \"the picture in California is particularly bleak in Santa Clara County.\" This specifically refers to the caseload of the San Andreas Regional Center. The statement is rather inaccurate (plus you might guess what I think about the \"bleak\" wording). The ratio to epilepsy in that Regional Center was 0.53 in December 2002. The same ratio in the Westside Regional Center was 1.19. As we know, the bulk of the 'epidemic' occurred in the Los Angeles area. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if San Andreas was slightly different to other parts of California, because of inequivalence. There is some plausibility for this theory despite lack of supporting data. This is because a relatively high proportion of engineers and scientists can be found in the families of autistics [ ref ][ ref ]. Also, have you seen the  video of Bill Gates rocking  autistically? The Assortative Mating Theory I'm intrigued by the assortative mating theory because my father-in-law appears to be quite the Aspie, although undiagnosed. In a different time perhaps my wife and I would not have met. Today people are very mobile and are able to meet a variety of different potential partners. This theory is proposed by Simon Baron-Cohen [ ref ], and it connects with his extreme male brain theory which proposes that males are good at  systemizing . Baron-Cohen suggests that two parents who are systemizers might have a greater probability of having an autistic child. He further proposes that it has become easier for geeky types to meet each other because of better job opportunities, and more women working in technical fields. Again, this theory is plausible but it counts with no supporting prevalence data. The Genetic Drift Theory This theory is not formally proposed anywhere that I could find but it is straight forward. In evolution theory the best known mechanism of change is natural selection. But there is another mechanism, called genetic drift. Basically what this means is that the frequency of alleles is not reproduced exactly from one generation to the next, even absent any selection pressures. In particular, if a liability suddenly becomes less of a liability, it has a greater chance of being passed down. A good example of this phenomenon is the evolution of blindness and albinism in cave-dwelling fish [ ref ]. In the past, autistics with immune system dysfunctions might have had reduced odds of survival. Similarly, a future where most human interaction will be carried out online might not require advanced speech or social skills. There is some evidence that the human brain is still evolving and becoming bigger as time goes by [ ref ]. This could also be an effect of genetic drift. Note that a bigger brain is not necessarily free of liabilities. It implies that humans will require longer to develop. Neanderthals, who had 13% bigger brain capacity, did not have speech as advanced as that of Homo Sapiens. Other Factors None of these theories have any predictive relevance if pre-natal testing for autism becomes available in the near future as part of eugenics program aimed at eliminating the autism phenotype. If this comes to pass, it will likely not be without a fight. I also believe that such an event will not only be genocidal, but at the same time suicidal for the human race to carry out.

I also mentioned to him that there's already a  report  that analyses new clients vs. drop-outs, but it only goes to 2004. Paul says this is a report by the local state college. The basic part of the job is done, pending an administrative matter, he tells me. He goes on to explain that cases entering the system are leveling off, which is not surprising. There is a recent flattening of autism cases, but it\u2019s not necessarily supporting evidence for the downward thimerosal-based trend for at least five reasons.   1. There was a large artificial population spike in 9/2002 due to a system fix, and all caseload records counts grew proportionally, not just autism.  Geier did not adjust for that quarter\u2019s change data.  2. There was a change in state law in 8/2003 (CA AB1762, W&IC 4512) where the requirements for DD services was increased from one substantial life-functioning deficit to three substantial deficits.  This law was specifically crafted to depress autism caseload growth, and it has had a flattening effect on the higher functioning caseload\u2019s growth, which are Autism, CP, and Epilepsy.  Geier did not adjust for that effect.   3. The autism population served by DDS is self-selecting, and has not been shown a constant and direct proportion of the true incidence in the general population.  4. The growth in Autism caseload has been geographically isolated.     5. The diagnostic characteristics of the population have changed dramatically, less MR and younger age among other things.  I wasn't aware of the 2002 spike, but the drop in 2003 coincides with changes in the Lanterman Act, as explained by  Interverbal . There's an increase in newly reported clients (true new cases) in 2004. In 2005 Paul appears to be saying there's a \"flattening\". I interpret this as the population growth leveling off. Basically, what the law changes achieved was a short-lived drop in the number of cases entering the system, but it also resulted in lower caseload growth, perhaps leading to a leveling off of the autistic population served by CDDS in upcoming years. There's no sign of a drop apparently. In any case, the new data will show that Dr. Geier's paper is unsalvageable, containing large shifting errors. His conclusions are invalid due to the methodological flaws mentioned, such as the cofounding factors due to changes in the law. However, the fact that what he claims are \"New Cases\" actually are not by itself renders the paper useless.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/pdf/Active_StatusPop_GrowthAnalysis.pdf", "http://interverbal.blogspot.com/2006/03/review-of-early-downward-trends-in_15.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/latest-on-geier-retraction.html", "title": "\nLatest on Geier Retraction\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 27, 2006", "body": "\n Note: This post is about John Best Jr. from Hew Hampshire, owner of the Hating Autism blog, AKA Fore Sam. The name John Best is a fairly common name, evidently. Let me introduce you to  John Best Jr . I actually started blogging shortly after I stumbled upon his blog. I thought it was necessary to address the sort of nonsense he likes to spout. This guy, perhaps the most vocal representative of the other side of the debate, hates autism, autistics and other minorities. He loathes the neurodiversity ideology and at the same time is obviously obsessed by it. Whenever he is unable to refute an argument, he either (1) explains it away as coming from a brain damaged by mercury, (2) claims that it is all just part of a vast conspiracy led by the CDC, the government and the drug companies, or (3) claims that the person making the argument does not exist. John will likely claim the following quotes are taken out of context. But believe me, there is no context that can explain these away. I'll just let his own words speak for themselves. Enjoy. John on homosexuality... - Some \"brilliant\" goofball coined the term \"Homophobia\" in a pathetic attempt to bring some small measure of respectability to a perversion. Fortunately for me, I grew up in an era when people were not subjected to public acceptance of sexual perversion. I never \"stomped\" a queer and I don't approve of that behavior. I also don't want to have to hear about this nonsense portrayed as anything near normalcy. It has nothing to do with fear which means there is no phobia.  - You can use any term you want regarding homosexuality. I really don't care. I'd just like to see it back in the closet where it belongs along with wackos who want to send pictures of their groins to people. - The insanity of agreeing with those who poisoned our kids goes hand in hand with stating that homosexuality is not a perversion. It just shows how screwed up all of you are.  - The normal people who find that stuff disgusting aren't homophobes. They're what sane people call normal. - The Neurodiverse tribe seems to be in basic agreement that homosexuality is a difference that should be tolerated. - Claiming homosexuality is not a perversion shows how out of touch you are, Kev. Acceptability doesn't make it normal. John on women... - You seem fairly intelligent for a girl but you've been misguided. - I'd suggest sending a nice letter to shut the dumb broad up. - Read this post again so you can understand why the dumb broad received an apology.  - I guess she's proud to say that she got a letter that, to me, said \"Shut up and don't bother me, dumb broad\".  - That's interesting. I always thought you were female. I guess you just write like a woman. John on tolerance... - When a kid is already dead mentally due to mercury poisoning, there is no choice. You either try to cure him or you torture everyone in your family with autism until the day arrives that the kid has to be sent away... If he dies young, I will rejoice for him that he has excaped the nightmare that was his life. - Celebrate their differences, LOL. How many parents do you think are that stoned that they would buy into something so absurd?  - This nut thinks it is demeaning to autistic people to refer to them as train wrecks. - \"Train Wrecks\" is not a slur on the person but a comment about the effects of mercury. - Mr Rollens was accurate in his use of the term \"Train Wreck\". - The \"Train Wreck\" comment did not offend a LOT of people. I don't think it offended anyone. The dumb broad just wanted to use it in her deranged quest to discredit those who help poisoned kids. It has nothing to do with respect, bonehead. - Were you offended by the \"Train Wreck\" comment? Give me your address so I can send you a crying towel.  - Get that address to me soon. My wife bought too many bananas so I'll send some for your daughter when I send the crying towel.  - It doesn't matter to them that that \"different wiring\" will cost taxpayers in the neighborhood of $5 million per person for these people who will never be able to hold a job. - This sort of Neurodiverse philosophy sounds eerily similar to the philosophy that begets welfare recipients. - As for spending money on the military, you will change your tune in a hurry if some crazed muslim shows up at your front door with a bomb strapped to his torso. - As to what I'll do if my son isn't cured by his teens, I probably won't have a choice in the matter. He may have to go away for his safety, the safety of my other kids and my wife. - I almost forgot your \"tossed in the trash\" comment. How do you suggest society care for those who can not care for themselves? - You're right, name calling doesn't help arguments but it does make me feel good. - Having to resort to insults doesn't say much for your side of the debate.  - You can teach a monkey to do some of the things that ABA does but you can't ever teach the monkey to think. That's why some of these Asperger's adults can repeat the crap they swallow from neurodiversity but they can't figure out that neurodiversity is based on obsolete principles which makes the whole philosophy invalid. - Any decent father teaches his sons how to fight. Otherwise, they might grow up to be pussies. - Why don't you just hook up with one of the guys from AutAdvo and have your own kid? That psychobollox guy's divorced. Clay is single and he's old enough that he'll probably croak before you get sick of him. Then you might have an autistic kid and, if not, you can always shoot it up with thimerosal and change it into an autistic kid. - I'll assume you consider my position to be one of bigotry. Nothing could be further from the truth. John on freedom of expression... - In the age of the internet where any wacko with a computer can publish lunacy, I suppose the wackos are more difficult to ignore than they were in the past when no decent newspaper would publish their drivel. John's profound insights... - Mr Ed wasn't autistic. Neither was Flipper. In fact, Flipper may have cured some autistic people. I once had a very affectionate cat so it couldn't have been autistic although it didn't talk much. I don't think Hornig's mice were autistic until after she gave them mercury and they became violent like \"Hands\" from Boston Legal. So, there goes your \"all animals are autistic\" theory. - I'm guessing Rett's would've been called a birth defect or brain damage... Autism could not have been called anything because, as Kanner told us, it didn't exist. It was something that had never been seen before. - Since we didn't have any adult autistics until the 50's, I think we'd be fine without them. Maybe without them, we could start making good cars again. - I'm just pointing out facts. If there was no diminished capacity, there would be no need for a label. - If you can cure all autism without using any chelation, you'll convince me.  - The premiss that anyone is autistic to begin with is absurd since autism didn't exist until doctors started shooting mercury into us.  - There is no such thing as neurodiversity. There is only mercury poisoning. - If you're right and lots of autistics were missed in 1992, then it must be true that autism is decreasing more than the Geier's could see. Or, it was rising faster than we thought in 1992. You're not claiming that we missed the \"Train Wreck\" types of autism, are you? - Einstein was not autistic. Autism had not yet been invented when he was born.  - The whole world recognizes that autism is not a normal existence except for a few freaks from Neurodiversity. That makes it abnormal. - [Geier's] training in genetics makes him the perfect man for the job. Autism isn't genetic and he knows that. You should listen to him.  - Actually, it's your reaction that looks silly. Most people never heard of VAERS. It makes sense that lawyers would know about it and file the reports.  - If you don't want to cure him, why do you bother discussing autism? - If your uncle wasn't diagnosed until the 1960's, it was probably early Alzheimer's from the mercury he had accumulated. - If [Temple Grandin] is such a genius at talking to animals, why isn't she at the racetrack talking to the horses and picking up some easy cash? - I could grasp the science if I wanted to but I'd nuch rather grasp a golf club or a Racing Form. The Racing Form is more of an intellectual challenge. - If there was more hype and every parent bothered to notify the CDC, the [VAERS] data might be accurate. - Both [prevalence going up and prevalence going down] can be true. John's version of reality... - It is not really a Government within the Government but an organization of wealthy individuals who literally rule the world.  This organization has a name but I can't remember what it is.  I learned of it in school a long time ago.  It is made up of people with names like Getty, Rockefeller, Kennedy, etc..  They decide what rotten things must take place for the good of the world as a whole.  They are probably the ones who told China, years ago, to limit families to one child. They probably ordered up AIDS to cut down the homosexual population and the African population.  They, most assuredly, allowed Bush to attack Iraq.  Yes, this organization exists and it is made up of old money worldwide.  Whatever they have done will always be conjecture since they don't advertise their projects. - I don't believe for a second that Not Mercury is telling the truth and used to be one of us.  - I don't believe Maria Lujan is real, nor do I beleive Not Mercury is real. I think they are just identities that your side conjured up. - Autism was invented in 1931 by Eli Lilly.  - Your placebo effect may have a point but it's mostly another futile attempt to expect parents to hurt their kids by letting them rot in the abyss. - I have not lost an argument to any of you wack jobs. - The Geier's are trying to help children.  - What you consider peer reviewed research is actually drug company propaganda that is reviewed by drug company shills who are engaged in a coverup. It's pure bullshit and you know it.  - The people who want to disprove the fact that thimerosal caused the autism epidemic went into the history books and dug up stuff that they claim was autism. - Playing horses is much more of an intellectual challenge then playing the stock market and is also more profitable and more exciting.  - Chimps are not related to humans. Darwin was wrong. - The money and politics are much more important than the science here. - You call good science junk science and fail to realize that the junk you call good science is actually corrupt science. That is why the science can't give you the answer. The answer is in the politics so you have to follow the money. - Science doesn't use the word \"probably\". Chemical reactions either take place or they don't. Good science says that methyl B-12 helps 90% of autistic kids by giving them that substance that mercury prevents their bodies from manufacturing. The kids prove what the science states.  - My son has emerged from the APPARENT vegetative state. If I had not used chelation, he would not have progressed. - I wouldn't be surprised if neurodiversity was just a sham concocted by the drug companies to make it seem that sane people agreed with them.  - The fact that mercury caused the autism epidemic is old news and only those involved in the coverup and damage control are still trying to deny it. - I don't think all of these ND's are real people. I don't think some of the others who write blogs are real pepople. There's just too much opposition to curing kids and that makes zero sense unless you're a high functioning autistic who doesn't know any better. For any parent to buy into this crap requires either abject stupidity or an ulterior motive. - That's the facts. Zero autism in my state in 1993 among school age kids. It did not exist. 1,600 autistic kids in 2005.  John and his knowledge of autism... - Since the only things proven to cause autism are mercury and fragile X and fragile X is extremely rare, I'll just stick with saying autism is mercury poisoning for simplicity.  - If autism has always been with us as some of you claim, it certainly was nothing like what kids today are presenting like.  - While some Asperger's people claim high IQ's and seem to do well in areas that only require ROTE learning, they are sorely lacking in the ability put two and two together. - No person with autism could possibly write the pseudo-intellectual musings that come forth from the pens of this batch of lunatics. - You have not proven there was any autism prior to 1931 and you have also not shown there was more than a few rare cases of autism in China. - What we do know is that Kanner described autism as something that had NEVER been seen before in 1943.  - The only difference between a profoundly autistic kid and a normal kid is the inability to rid the body and brain of mercury. There is no \"wiring\".  - The ONLY thing genetic about autism, aside from fragile x, is an inability to get rid of mercury. John on autism treatments... - I don't have all the facts about Lupron and have not tried it myself. I'd like to know more about possible side effects. It seems that references to chemical castration are far-fetched since it is suggested that Lupron should only be used on kids who have not yet reached puberty. - I don't think it would matter if you're studying treatments for autism and the size [of two inequivalent groups] is large enough. John on proper medical procedure... - I had him checked for genetics and that wasn't it. The improvement I have proves it's mercury. - We just did what we were told by Easter Seals to start, play, occupational, physical and speech therapy, bled him with leeches and checked with a priest about an exorcism. - I saw no need to test for mercury. The improvement from chelation was all the proof I needed. - I didn't test him. I didn't bother with chelation challenge tests because I thought it was too much DMSA to give him at one time. - I did use tests. I ruled out genetics. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://hatingautism.blogspot.com"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/john-bests-greatest-hits.html", "title": "\nJohn (ForeSam) Best's Greatest Hits\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 19, 2006", "body": "\n[ Note : For an updated analysis, see  No Autism Epidemic: An Update ] In prior posts I have argued in favor of the idea that an autism epidemic has not occurred at all. In this post I will put everything in one place, include additional data, and clarify a few points. As always, readers are invited to scrutinize the data, my interpretations of the same, and post comments and/or rebuttals. In particular, all epidemic-causing-trigger proponents are explicitly invited to do so. Proponents of the idea of an autism epidemic often rely on data from the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS). But as you will see, this same data contains a wealth of information that can be used to disprove that such an epidemic ever took place. Changing Characteristics There is a problem of  group inequivalence  in equating number of diagnosed cases with actual prevalence and number of  new  diagnosed cases with actual incidence. What this means is that the characteristics of diagnosed autistics over time have changed, so comparing the number of diagnosed individuals from one quarter to the next is like comparing apples and oranges (or  oranges to sheep ). Table 1: Changes in autistic client characteristics over time Quarter Epilepsy Profound MR Severe Behaviors Lack of MR Q2 1992 15.6% 11.2% 22.9% 27.8% Q4 1996 11.8% 7.4% 20.5% 41.2% Q4 2000 8.7% 4.4% 19.2% 52.4% Q4 2004 7.1% 2.6% 17.4% 61.9% Q4 2005 6.7% 2.4% 16.8% 63.6% Table 1 not only shows that it is not possible to make an accurate determination about prevalence and incidence changes, it also shows that a significant 'broadening criteria/awareness' phenomenon must be in effect. This is undeniable given this data. The following figure [courtesy of CDDS] also illustrates the point. Notice that the autism curve and the autism without MR curve run almost parallel to one another. Broadening criteria does not imply that autistics diagnosed today who would not have been diagnosed in prior years are completely neurotypical. It simply means that the proportion of certain characteristics must be closer to those of the general population. Judging from the size of the autistic population and drops in these numbers it would appear that newly diagnosed autistics today are, in average, considerably less autistic than those at the beginning of the 'epidemic'. This completely undermines any epidemic-causing trigger theory. Regional evidence [ Note : For an updated regional analysis, see  Regional Differences and Quarterly Growth Due to Two Factors .] In a previous post on  regional differences  I argued that they cannot be explained by environmental factors because of group inequivalence. In particular, the Central Valley (Fresno) Regional Center has the lowest prevalence of diagnosed cases of autism, whereas the Westside (West LA) Regional Center has the highest prevalence. Even so, there is no difference in the prevalence of mental retardation in these Regional Centers (using epilepsy as a baseline, as it is assumed to be uniformly diagnosed). This is illustrated in Table 2. Table 2: Q4 2005 comparison of Westside and Central Valley Regional Center Autism Index PMR+SMR Index PMR Index Epilepsy Index Severe Behavior Index Central Valley 0.32 0.60 0.36 1.0 0.31 Westside 1.61 0.68 0.31 1.0 0.45 [Note: A diagnosis of 'severe behaviors' likely suffers from subjectivity as well, and is probably not, by itself, sufficient to fulfill CDDS eligibility criteria. In any case, a purely behavioral mini-epidemic could be ruled out by separating a Central Valley-equivalent group in Westside and evaluating differences in behavior.] Group inequivalence is clear, but it is also clear that there is probably no difference in  actual  prevalence or incidence of autism between these two Regional Centers, whereas the difference in  apparent  prevalence is about 500%. This difference is equivalent to the state-wide difference between Q4 1993 and Q4 2004 (almost the entire 'autism epidemic'). As Paul Choate of CDDS Data Extraction notes, most of the 'epidemic' is confined to several Regional Centers in the greater Los Angeles area, as illustrated by the following figure [courtesy of CDDS]: The epilepsy argument Autism has been linked to a seizure liability, and the CDDS data itself shows that the prevalence of epilepsy among autistics is considerably higher to that of the general population. It follows that an environmental trigger capable of producing an epidemic of autism would also result in an epidemic of epilepsy. Surprisingly, we find in the data that the prevalence of epilepsy moves upward at about the same pace as the population in the state of California. Currently, annual growth in number of clients with epilepsy is about 0.6%. The mental retardation argument An environmental trigger that results in brain injury or insult should be expected to increase the probability of mental retardation, and thus result in an epidemic of all types of mental retardation. Instead we find that the number of clients with mental retardation is growing at a pace slower than that of the population in the state of California. Cases of profound mental retardation are actually on the decline. (This is explained by misdiagnoses of autism as mental retardation). Conclusions The numerical evidence in favor of the notion that an autism epidemic has not occurred at all is clearly overwhelming. Those who claim an epidemic has occurred are apparently not aware of the problem of group inequivalence. This is compounded by fundamental errors in the use of concepts such as  incidence  and  prevalence . In light of these observations, I recommend that all scientific papers that claim to show an epidemic has occurred be retracted immediately.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2005/12/dr-eric-fombonne-at-mind.html", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autism-no-mr.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/755/2332/1600/autism%20by%20rc.jpg"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/no-autism-epidemic-summary-of.html", "title": "\nNo Autism Epidemic: Summary of the Numerical Evidence\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 18, 2006", "body": "\nEven though the  Neanderthal Theory of Autism  does not appear in the formal autism literature, it is intriguing and I believe it should be addressed and studied as any other autism theory. I will provide an overview of the theory, some evidence in favor, and finally I will list significant problems I've found this theory suffers from. Overview This theory is proposed by Leif Ekblad, a self-described Aspie, author of the well known Aspie Quiz and the Rdos operating system, and also the parent of children somewhere on the autism spectrum. The theory basically says that behaviors classified as spectrum disorders in the field of psychiatry could be explained by genetic introgression from another species, namely the Homo Neanderthalis. Therefore, the author concludes, psychiatric disorders are not dysfunctions but rather differences, and psychiatric patients are, in general, functional. The author points out that even though a Neanderthal ancestry for Homo Sapiens has been ruled out through mitochondrial DNA (mother line), hybridization is still possible. Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens coexisted in Europe for a long time. Evidence and possible predictions The DRD4-7R allele has been linked to ADHD and to a behavior known as  novelty seeking  (presumably more common in migratory humans) and has been found to be considerably more prevalent in Europe than in other parts of the world. The diet of Homo Neanderthalis consisted almost exclusively of meat [ ref ]. If autistics have Neanderthal physiology, this would mean a high-carbohydrate diet is not the proper diet for an autistic individual as it might result in GI tract problems. The digestive system of Homo Neanderthalis was probably not adapted for diets high in gluten and casein. In the modern world, a more appropriate diet would be a Ketogenic or Atkins diet. A Neanderthal child in the modern world would probably suffer from a deficit of L-carnosine. The Neanderthal skull had a volume about 13% larger than that of Homo Sapiens. This likely resulted in certain cognitive advantages but also liabilities. Bigger head circumference in a subset of autistic children has been documented. (It is not clear if this difference is maintained as they grow, however). This also explains labor complications. Combined with a normal-size skull, a bigger brain could also result in a number of medical complications. Some researchers believe Neanderthal's language was simple, with limited vocabulary and grammar. Neanderthals were expert tool-markers. Their tools were extremely prevalent and the tool-making appears to have required some level of perseveration. Some believe Neanderthals were actually smarter than Homo Sapiens (due to their bigger brain capacity)  but failed to survive because of their relative inability to communicate well. This is consistent with Dawson-Mottron (2005). Intonation and voice pitch were likely different in Neanderthals. This is a common problem faced by Asperger autistics. Although nothing is known about Neanderthal eye contact, lack of it is common in other primate species. Neanderthals had \"rodeo-type\" injuries, which might suggest they had different sensitivity to pain. Problems with the theory Based on the Occam's Razor principle, I would conclude this theory is not necessary to explain autistic behavior. It is not surprising that great diversity in socio-linguistic skills exists in human beings, and that the bottom 1% (or some other arbitrary boundary) is established as the disorder boundary in the behavioral spectrum. Some behavioral spectrums have different disorder boundaries. For example, in the hyperactivity spectrum, the boundary is situated at the top 5% to 10% of the population. This probably results from the desires of school officials to control hyperactive children by means of medication. If this theory is correct, we would expect autism and ADHD to be disorders almost exclusive of European populations. They would be unheard of in Asia or Africa. It is known that the prevalence of autism does not have any significant ethnic dependency. (The author cites the prevalence of online sites from different parts of the world, but this observation clearly suffers from a serious methodological flaw). No evidence exists suggesting that any hybridization with Homo Neanderthalis occurred. Autistics have been described as having low sex drive and an inability to resolve romantic relationships. Assuming these are innate characteristics which do not result from psychological factors or cultural incompatibility, then the Neanderthal Theory does not seem to hold water. It is unlikely Neanderthal would have survived as long as they did if members of the species had these characteristics in a significant proportion. We might expect autistics to have a characteristic look. Instead we find that autistics look unremarkable, and are often even described as attractive. (It is possible Neanderthals were attractive, but we can't draw any conclusions either way. Some adult autistics report a brow ridge, but this is purely anecdotal). It is unclear how this theory explains some of the more severe symptoms of psychiatric disorders, such as self-injury. It is unclear if autistics socialize better with other autistics than with non-autistics. The author's contention that small skull combined with a large brain might result in low-functioning autism is not necessarily consistent with known findings and cannot explain Dawson-Mottron (2005). \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdos.net/eng/asperger.htm", "http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/13/7663"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/review-neanderthal-theory-of-autism.html", "title": "\n"},

Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and see how they handle this matter. In response to  my last communication  sent to the Editor-in-Chief of JPANDS, Dr. Huntoon, he replied indicating that he would forward my concerns to the authors as it is fair to allow them to respond. Meanwhile, I had received a reply from CDDS: Thanks Joseph \u2013 let us know if you need supporting statements or other information.      Paul Choate DDS Data Extraction [phone removed] I took them up on that and asked if they have data on newly reported clients (true new cases) and whether they could confirm if these numbers are dropping in reality. I got a reply from Paul Choate containing an Excel file with numbers going back to 1992. This is still the conventionally available data, but it will be very helpful in posts I plan for the future. I must say that the staff at CDDS Data Extraction obviously do a great job and are very responsive. Paul's reply follows: Joseph \u2013    Right now we are in contact with David, (not Mark) Geier.  He has requested a two datasets, one showing \u201cnew consumers with autism\u201d by quarter and the other showing number autistic consumers by quarter of their assessment date.  Once they are produced and released our policy is that we will release it again to other requesters if asked.  The only caveat is that if there is confidential information we must either encrypt or delete the confidential parts, or require Human Subjects review through our Agency, CA Health and Human Services. All of our information is subject to HIPPA requirements, and any new requests outside other state entities are charged at around $80 per hour necessary to produce.    Allow me to make a few points:   CA DDS has client evaluations (CDERs) on all clients over age three in our service delivery system.  There is no requirement for California residents with autism or other developmental disabilities to be served by our system, participation is voluntary.  Thus we do not have information on the prevalence of autism in the general population, we only have information on those who come to us for our services.  It is unknown how our population reflects trends in the larger population, as the number of clients seeking our services is a function of a number of internal and external factors. You may surmise that as our services to a certain population become more widely known there may be a change in population of those requesting services.  We pay service providers to provide services to eligible consumers, so service systems may have incentive to promote who comes to us for services.  We are an entitlement system, so there is no other requirement, such as income level, only that a person meet our disability requirements:     http://www.dds.ca.gov/statutes/ laws_main.cfm   Lanterman Act California Welfare and Institutions Code Division 4.5. Services for the Developmentally Disabled Chapter 1. General Provisions 4512.  As used in this division:    (a) \"Developmental disability\" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual.  As defined by the Director of Developmental Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, this term shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.  This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.      (l) \"Substantial disability\" means the existence of significant functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity, as determined by a regional center, and as appropriate to the age of the person:    (1) Self-care.    (2) Receptive and expressive language.    (3) Learning.    (4) Mobility.    (5) Self-direction.    (6) Capacity for independent living.    (7) Economic self-sufficiency.   This was changed from \u201cat least one\u201d of the major areas of life activity about two years ago in an effort to stem some of the rapid population growth to those with the highest need for service.      As for those who do come to us for service we have a date of determination of autism, there is such a date on over 98% of the autism consumer records. See page three of the CDER: http://www.dds.ca.gov/FactsStats/pdf/ DS3753_CDER.pdf   I\u2019m sure you have seen the \u201climitations\u201d document http://www.dds.ca.gov/factsStats/pdf/ CDER_QtrlyReport_Consideration_ Limitations.pdf   As to whether a client is on active caseload we have a Client Master File that has a status type.  We maintain monthly copies of all CMF and CDER records back to 1992.   '0'= 'Diag and Evaluation' '1'= 'High-Risk Infant' '2'= 'Active Client' '3'= 'at Risk Person (parents of potential clients)' '4'= 'Inactive' '5'= 'Closed Transfer' '6'= 'Closed not DD' '7'= 'Closed Deceased' '8'= 'Dev Center Client' '9'= 'Closed Other' 'S'= 'Closed - Out of State' 'D'= 'Closed - Not Determined'   So we have the status of every client by month from 1992 forward.   The majority of our clients come to us in age 0-2 through our High-Risk Infant program (Early Start), but autism diagnoses are usually made in the clients 3-5th year. Thus clients come to us often before they are assessed as autistic. This creates a problem with saying how the current population is growing; on the quarterly report we calculate net change of consumers with autism assessments.   The numbers in our quarterly report reflect changes in active population who are assessed, so it is a mix of net inflow and outflow, combined with change in assessment with age.    Two interesting facts that have been documented are that 1) the nature of the served autistic population as reflected in the CDER has changed, and 2) that much of the growth is localized geographically, chiefly in a handful of Los Angeles area centers. It used to be that MR was highly co-morbid with Autism, but the rate of MR in the newer population is dropping.  In LA area centers the Autistic population has grown to around 25% of the caseload, in central and Northern California the proportion averages around 10%.  I\u2019ll attach a chart showing the rate at the centers.  This information is the same as what is presented in the quarterly report.  The quarterly report is available online for the past few years, but is available in hard copy back to the early 90\u2019s.  We maintain a dataset that has the data from the quarterly report table 1 \u201cStatewide\u201d and table 34 \u201cAutism\u201d from 7/92 forward.  I\u2019ll attach the data and the MR proportion and geographic charts.   To summarize, we don\u2019t serve the full population and client assessments change over time.  When we send Geier the next round of information we would be willing to also send it to you.   Paul Choate DDS Data Extraction [phone removed] At this point it is clear that Dr. Geier is aware of the terminology error, and is requesting the data on true new cases in order to at least be able to claim that even though the paper is mistaken, the conclusions are still valid. I replied to CDDS with the following: Thank you Paul. I'd certainly like to have a look at that data myself. Will it include number of drop-outs per quarter as well? Are there limitations on the use of that data? For example, could I post a table on a website with that data? I have been analyzing some of the publicly available CDDS data, and I have noticed the declines in autistic characteristics over time that you mention, particularly mental retardation (all types), epilepsy and severe behaviors. At the same time, the proportion of lack of mental retardation is increasing every quarter. Additionally, prevalence in the Westside (West LA) regional center is about 500% higher than that of the Central Valley (Fresno) regional center, using epilepsy as a baseline, whereas prevalence of mental retardation is the same. This is all consistent with a 'broadening criteria/awarness' theory and I have written about it online. I appreciate that CDDS data should not be used to make inferences about the prevalence of autism in the general population, but it is clearly used by others in this manner, and I mostly analyze it in this manner in response to that. In any case, given the data that Dr. Geier does have, would it be possible in your opinion to conclude what he concludes in the title of the paper? Early Downward Trends in Neurodevelopmental Disorders Following Removal of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines  This suggests to me and I suppose to any reader that the number of diagnoses of autism are currently dropping in California.  Even if the data does confirm that there is some drop in the number of real new cases (which is highly unlikely IMHO) much of the paper is still wrong in its use of terminology as are its conclussions from the data it does present, and some kind of errata will need to be published. I'm sure Mr. Huntoon agrees. Thanks again, Joseph I should emphasize that there is no question there is a terminology mistake in the Geiers paper which invalidates the entire paper. This is true regardless of whether the new data shows there is a drop in the number of true new cases in the last few quarters. This is why I claim that some kind of retraction is a done deal, provided JPANDS has some scientific integrity as I'm trusting it does. Now, based on trends in the 3-5 age range, I do not expect the numbers to show there is a drop in true new cases. I suspect it will show numbers are either stable or going up. If at least 3 of 4 quarters in 2005 as well as the entire year of 2005 do not show a drop in true new cases, I will definitely have a word with Dr. Huntoon.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/geiers-retraction-done-deal-imho.html", "title": "\nGeiers Retraction a Done Deal IMHO\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2006", "body": "\nI've been thinking about why we do what we do. I can't speak for all pro-neurodiversity parents and autistics out there, but I imagine they have similar concerns. I feel we need to fight for our right and our children's right to not be labeled \"inferior\", \"diseased\", \"brain damaged\", or \"mercury poisoned\". I don't do this for myself, though that's an added bonus. And it helps to have the facts on our side. It may seem surprising that mercury parents must share some of these goals, except their approach is substantially different. Unfortunately, it's an approach based on a fantasy: That their children are perfectly typical in reality, were it not for a poison put in them by a malevolent entity; once the poison is removed, an autistic child regains perfect normality, and none of the issues I listed will be issues anymore. They will just be someone else's issues. These parents validate one another in order to cling to this fantasy with all they've got, even if that means concocting conspiracy theories to explain away a flood of facts and information that make their position untenable at best. This is not that different to a fantasy from a different generation: That an autistic child is perfectly typical in reality, were it not for uncaring parents, particularly mothers who have not bonded properly with their children. Once the parents are removed, the child is able to recover, resolving all the issues I listed. I wonder, though, what the relative merit of the mercury theory vs. the refrigerator mother theory is. Neither of these theories have any solid scientific grounding, and neither has been conclusively shown to be false (though I'd disagree on that about mercury). Refrigerator mother fell out of favor when it was discovered that autism is very heritable. But then why did the mercury theory take its place, considering that both are environmentally-based theories? What are their similarities? They are both environmental theories. They both rely on the notion that someone is to blame. They both largely deny heritiability, which incidentally is the only well known aspect of autism causality. They are largely incompatible with neurobiological differences in autistics. They are largely incompatible with any cognitive advantages of autism. They lack any real scientific backing. They are supported by scientists of dubious integrity. They both assume that autism can't be anything but pathological. And last but not least, both theories are simply wrong. More importantly, what is the impact of each of these theories? In the generation that preceded us, it was the mothers of autistic children who were impacted the most. It is hard to imagine what they must have gone through. But this generation is telling autistic children that their brains have been poisoned, and in some notable cases they are being told that their brains are literally \"rotting\". There are some who call them \"diseased\", \"train wrecks\", \"mad child\", \"a plague\", \"worse than cancer\", and so on. I seldom hear of mercury parents who are appalled by their children being referred to in this manner. I can only assume they don't mind and probably agree. And don't think for a moment that because a child can't speak, that child is unable to grasp what's going on. Imagine what it is like to grow up thinking that your brain does not and  cannot  function properly because it's broken and poisoned; that whatever gifts you do have occur in spite of who you are, not because of it; that you are a burden to civilization, despite the fact that without your traits there would be no civilization to consider; that you are not worthy of being considered human; that if it were possible to eliminate all people like you, this would be done without a second thought. Ten or twenty years from now, the mercury hypothesis will be remembered as the Refrigerator Mother of our generation, tossed in the garbage can of discarded theories along with so many others in the field of autism. Let's just hope that the pseudo-experts of the next generation can do better when they come up with new environmental theories that try to deny heritability, because at the moment the quality of such theories appears to be in decline.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/mercury-this-generations-refrigerator.html", "title": "\nMercury: This Generation's Refrigerator Mother\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, March 11, 2006", "body": "\nDear Editor: I recently had the opportunity to review the paper titled  Early Downward Trends in Neurodevelopmental Disorders Following Removal of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines  published in your Journal in the Spring of 2006. The purpose of this communication is not to point out methodological flaws in the paper's findings and conclusions. The flaws are already well known, and this will likely be addressed in the scientific literature in due time. I am writing to point out that there exist significant factual errors presented in the paper, due mostly to demonstrably misleading use of certain terminology. The magnitude of these errors is such that I have no choice but to urge you to retract this paper at your earliest convenience. In particular, the following statements referring to CDDS trends are at issue: Significant decreasing trends in  newly diagnosed NDs ... Trends in  New Cases  of Autism entered into the CDDS...through Oct. 4, 2005 is significantly decreasing... It is not clear how the authors define or calculate \"newly diagnosed NDs\" and \"New Cases\" given that no terminology section is provided in the paper. Nevertheless, Figure 3 in combination with a quick look at the publicly available CDDS data shows how the authors calculate \"New Cases\". Evidently, it is defined by the authors as the difference between the number of autistic clients in one quarter and the number of autistic clients in the previous quarter.  The terms \"newly diagnosed NDs\" and \"New Cases\" clearly can only be interpreted by your readers as meaning \"individuals who have just been diagnosed\". This terminology is erroneous at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. The number of clients with a new diagnosis cannot be determined by substracting the numbers from one quarter minus the numbers from the previous quarter, as explained by CDDS itself in its document titled  Data Interpretation Considerations and Limitations : Differences in the numbers from quarter to quarter reflect the  net  changes between individuals who are  newly reported  (i.e., included in the later report but not included in the earlier report) and individuals who  dropped out  (i.e., included in the earlier report but no longer included in the later report). The error of assuming that quarterly differences represent \"new cases\" is so common that the CDDS has obviously gone out of its way to clarify it. This is not a minor error that can be brushed aside. CDDS clients can go from a status of active to a status of inactive or closed when they move out of the state, die, are no longer found to be eligible, or choose to discontinue pursuing eligibility. Given the increasing population of autistic clients in the CDDS, the importance of these considerations cannot be overstated. Additionally, the fact that the population of autistic clients in the CDDS continues to grow at an annual rate of 10.7% as of Dec. 2005 (a rate much higher than the general population growth in the state of California) shows that an actual decrease in the number of newly diagnosed cases is not likely occurring. The population is simply starting to level off. Once again, given the magnitude of this error and the fact that CDDS itself has tried to prevent this exact error from occurring, I believe the only appropriate course of action is to retract this paper immediately. I trust that given your reputation as a peer-reviewed Journal, you will agree. If you have any doubts about the facts I have presented, I suggest you contact CDDS directly and discuss the issue with them. Sincerely, Joseph P.S.

{"date": "Sunday, March 12, 2006", "body": "\nMar\u00eda Luj\u00e1n has written up answers to many of the questions in the  Mercury FABNAQ . Mar\u00eda notes, however, that she does not believe \"autism=mercury poisoning\" so she is not responding in that capacity. Her position is known to be moderate, i.e. she apparently believes genetics are involved, as well as 'broadening criteria', in addition to possibly many environmental triggers including mercury from vaccines and the environment. Her responses are discussed. Considering that the prevalence of epilepsy among autistics is known to be an order of magnitude higher that that of the general population, why is the CDDS-based prevalence of autism rising at a rate of 10% annually (and even higher in the past), whereas the prevalence of epilepsy has always remained at population growth levels? [Mar\u00eda: Well, I think that the idea of a new kind of ASD without the clinical presentation of epilepsy-but subclinical perhaps- is a possible explanation of this.] Mar\u00eda accepts that there's a correlation between autism and seizures per various studies. She proposes that the reason epilepsy is stable while autism is undergoing an 'epidemic' is that an epidemic-producing environmental trigger results in a type of autism with no epilepsy liability but only a subclinical seizure liability, but still one considerably more prevalent than that of the general population. Note that this new type of autism resulting from an environmental trigger allows for all levels of severity in other autistic traits, but not in regards to the seizure liability. Further analysis can be found below. Why is the prevalence of CDDS clients without mental retardation (presumably based on IQ testing) going up quickly? [Mar\u00eda: I think that this is related to diagnosis criteria , so your broader awareness theory is applicable, at least partially.] Why is the proportion of autistics with epilepsy going down at an annual rate of -5.5%? [Mar\u00eda: This seems a confirmation of the answer of 1, as you mentioned in your post about.] Mar\u00eda's answer regarding epilepsy seems to contradict her admission that a drop in mental retardation is consistent with broadening criteria. I should note that mental retardation among CDDS autistics is dropping even faster than epilepsy. Profound mental retardation, for example, is dropping at a rate of about -9% annually. This suggests that, as the criteria is broadened, mental retardation drops a lot in average, but epilepsy does not drop as much. If an environmental trigger is involved, this would mean that the trigger has a  higher  epilepsy liability than is normal for autism. This would seem to contradict her theory on the first question. Furthermore, I would argue this makes any epidemic-causing trigger theory impossible. In reality mental retardation is probably not an accurate  equivalence  marker for autism. This is because there's probably a large 'shifting misdiagnosis' component that explains much of the drop. But we could come up with other markers in the data and find that it's hard to reconcile drop in those markers due to broadening criteria to drop in epilepsy due to an environmental trigger. Considering that close to no thimerosal is going into vaccines nowadays, shouldn't the following be true? (1) The number of autistic clients in the CDDS 3-5 age range should be crashing towards zero. (2) All newly diagnosed autistic children would be those vaccinated with thimerosal (via the Flu vaccine, as Sue likes to point out). [Mar\u00eda: Only if thimerosal is considered a CAUSE. I would wonder if the symptomatic presentation in severity is the same if I consider as a comorbility . Unfortunately the severity if measured by IQ measurements of verbal skills and I think this is wrong. I am wondering in severity in terms of clinical presentation (GI issues, immune/autoimmune, lack of speech, etc) Because the clinical information is scarce, even if now the tests are going to begin to be done, there would be no enough data to compare, only behavioral symptoms. [Regarding flu vaccine:] Not for me. If thimerosal is removed and thinking in the sum up of a lot of individual presentations with multicausal nature of A+B+C+\u00c2\u0085Z we only erased one insult ( an important one for me) but only one. If we consider that the combination is the key and we maintain all the components of the combination-except one-, I think that a decrease \u00c2\u0096 BUT a little one in TOTAL numbers- would be seen. I wonder about the severity of symptomatology.] Fair enough. Let's assume that thimerosal simply worsens symptoms in average or is only causal in a small portion of cases. I'd propose we should still see an anomaly in the numbers. The trends are shifting without any obvious jumps however.  Also, it's clear broadening criteria is involved. I don't see the need for a second theory that coincidentally happened to also play a simultaneous role. By what mechanism does mercury poisoning result in savant skills? [Mar\u00eda: No known mechanism and very improbable cause for me.] How does mercury poisoning explain the results of Dawson and Mottron? That is, autistics score higher than the norm in the Raven IQ test. But not only this, the gap between the Weschler and Raven tests is totally the inverse (in the other direction) of what it would be in NTs. [Mar\u00eda: As I told you in other post, I think that there is a component of visual impairment in the analysis of this.] How does it explain findings by Happe (2001) that parents of autistics have a \"cognitive style\" (weak central coherence) that can confer information-processing advantages? [Mar\u00eda: Well, this idea is in conflict with those from Dawson and Mottron, of the enhanced general perception. I think that the idea of implicit learning and enhanced general perception fits more in the findings in ASD. If think that a combination of genetics + adaptative behavior to overcome sensory integration problems can be part of the explanation of the proposed ideas.] Sure. The interpretations are in conflict. The question is more about the test results themselves, not about the interpretations of the authors. How does mercury poisoning produce significant grey and white matter volume differences in infancy? [Mar\u00eda: From Martha Herbert White matter is 28 % of total brain volume but contributes 65 % to the volume increase in autism. White matter enlargement is radiate, not deep or sagital. The increased WM volume is in areas that myelinate later. Radiate white matter myelinates late in first year and into second year. Characteristics. Cortical assymetry and model of disordered information processing. There is no enough information to discard some mechanism of environmental insult+genetics in this case.] Correct. This question is not meant to discount all possible environmental triggers, just vaccines. How does mercury poisoning produce increased neuron density and smaller neurons? [Mar\u00eda: I do not include the link because is long and did not work when I tried. Please let me know if you want the full abstract.] Sure. But it would be similar to the question above. Why do you start chelation therapy without first testing for heavy metal poisoning? [Mar\u00eda: This is not true for me. Unfortunately, the way I discovered my son\u00c2\u00b4s poisoning has not been studied/reported to be discussed based on scientific reports. There are no reported studies about so it is anecdotic ( although I know of many other children from my country,( from different cities and labs)) that showed the same. I agree that only after careful, safe and adequate testing a procedure of chelation can be evaluated, not as treatment of ASD, but of HM poisoning and not more than this.] If you have tested your child, did you use a local reputable lab or an internet lab? Did you send a control sample to verify their tests are valid? [Mar\u00eda: Local reputable lab. 2 control samples- and repeated] Mar\u00eda obviously does her homework, unlike other known bloggers. She's probably the exception. It would be of interest to know what the results were if she does not mind. I am also curious if the child had symptoms atypical of autism. Is there controlled evidence that chelation therapy is an effective treatment for autism? [Mar\u00eda: Chelation for me is treatment for HM poisoning. To propose other thing does not seem ethic for me.] Is there controlled evidence that chelation therapy is a safe treatment for the duration you're planning to follow it? [Mar\u00eda: For the particular I choose, there is enough evidence of safe use, at my criteria.] Are you following medical guidelines as to the proper duration of chelation therapy? [Mar\u00eda: Totally. Several doctors involved.] What is the mercury-based genetic model that explains a 60% concordance for  classic autism  in identical twins, but a much lower concordance (2%-4%) in siblings and fraternal twins? [Mar\u00eda: This is a strong point to genetics.] How does mercury poisoning explain a higher proportion of scientists and engineers as close relatives of autistics? [Mar\u00eda: Again, genetics.] How does mercury poisoning explain some of the alleles which have been linked to autism? GABA, SERT, etc. [Mar\u00eda: Genetics/epigenetics/ is very important for me in autism.] Given that autism is more heritable than personality, intelligence, homosexuality and left-handedness, would you say these other variations in human behavior are, too, caused by pathological environmental triggers such as mercury poisoning?  [Mar\u00eda: Absolutely no.] I'd suggest studying them as if they were. That's what's done with autism. If you believe that autism did not exist before the 1940s, do you also believe that Down's Syndrome did not exist before 1862, that Fragile-X syndrome did not exist before 1943, and that Rett Syndrome did not exist before 1966? [Mar\u00eda: No. I think that ASD has been with us in genetics terms from long time ago, the same with the other conditions you mentioned. In the case of ASD, I think that before the introduction of vaccines and other potential problems for susceptible children (antibiotics, chemicals, additives, HM) the genetics and immune/autoimmune presentation based on herpes/strep/bacterian/ viruses infections (combined) was the more common. After the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics, etc, to the burden of the immune system, the burden of HM and other allergens was sum up and then the number of ASD and the severity of symptoms in many of them increase in time. Also the increase of chemical burden, environmental pollution and stress in mother/health of mother during pregnacy has impact.] So you don't believe autism can occur naturally at current prevalence levels? Why not? What are the limits of natural behavioral variation in humans? Do you realize that a prevalence of 1 in 166 today (which includes Asperger's syndrome) cannot be compared to a 1970s or 1980s prevalence? [Mar\u00eda: Yes, diagnosis criteria were different.] Do you understand why anecdotal accounts do not prove an argument? [Mar\u00eda: Yes, but the fact that my son is anecdote for science does not imply nothing at his individual level. I have the duty and the right to give him the best treatment I can get. I can not present HIS case as an argument, what is different, or extrapolate situations.] Absolutely. You are correct to believe that generalizations may not apply at the individual level, and that's why it's advisable to carry out medical tests. In particular, generalizing \"autism=mercury poisoning\" is not only erroneous, but dangerous. (Per Jennifer I believe:) If autistics are unable to excrete mercury, wouldn't regular intake of mercury from the environment be enough to kill autistics over time? [Mar\u00eda: Well, I think that we must diferentiate the kind and road of exposure-ingestion, inhalation and injection and the kind of compound-in fish, metallic or as thimerosal in the case of mercury. Let\u00c2\u00b4s go to accept for a moment that SOME asd children can not excrete heavy metals ( and others). So they bioaccumulate Hg. Some mercury is breathen so we can suppose is metallic- Hg is ubiquous in air and ingresed at 0,3 to 1,5 ug/day for an adult and 0,1 to 0,5 per day for a child (and excreted, given in stool for example for a child 0,01 to 0,05 (maximum, considering a very industrialized zone)-from a report of air quality. However, there can be other routes of exposure that you must check to have a real baseline. First, from when? One question about from me is which is the mechanism of hindering of excretion. Since birth? If we imagine that vaccines are a trigger of this hindering- a possibility- then the situation can be present since HepB vaccine -depending on individual. From fish consumption, is considered to be Hg bonded to proteins in fish. Hg ingested. From vaccines, injected as thimerosal. Therefore there is the problem of increased bolus amount with vaccines and after this the lower daily amount breathened and the occasional amount ingested as fish-if any. Development brings change in all the systems, even in altered systems like in ASD-and it is known that development in many cases involves improvement in autism. How do we know if, depending of the child and the burden to the detox/immune system, IF he /she is HM poisoned, time brings natural excretion? Beyond the Hg from vaccines, how do we know at an individual level the impact in different organs and system of the bioaccumulation not only of Hg but also of Pb, Al, Cd etc? How do we know how each child can manage in time the supposed toxic load he/she can have?] This is more of an issue with thimerosal. You might have a point with other types of exposure. With vaccines, I think you get a total of 130 micrograms of mercury. From your numbers, you'd get 130 micrograms in 1-4 years just from a normal environment, assuming you can't excrete. So you either can't excrete, and your body is always accumulating mercury making you more and more sick. Or you can excrete, and your body easily gets rid of all the mercury from the thimerosal in short order. People with dental amalgams are able to excrete about 30 micrograms per day I believe. Why are the following symptoms of heavy metal poisoning not characteristic of autism? Headaches, cold hands and feet, vertigo, inability to focus vision, joint and muscle pains, weak pulse, hard pulse, bleeding gums, blisters, tooth ache, jaw inflammation, metallic taste in mouth, loosening of teeth, persistent cough, irregular breathing, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, subnormal temperature, excessive perspiration, chest pain, changes in blood pressure, etc. [Mar\u00eda: My question is how a child that is not verbal /low comunication skills can communicate many of this kind of symptoms-except the obvious for the arent:loosening of teeth, cold hands and feet and excessive perspiration? Inability to focus vision? Can not be related to lack of eye contact? Joint and muscle pains? Can not be related to hypotonia? Irregular breathing? Has been reported in autism-Dental problems have been reported in ASD children. What defines the characteristics of autism?DSMIV does not include anything about other things than behavior.] The reason I listed those is that I don't believe they are characteristic in autistic adults. The characteristics of mercury poisoning are such that the person would not appear healthy. This cannot be generalized to autistics. And no, lack of eye contact is not related to inability to focus - trust me. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/mara-replies-to-mercury-fabnaq.html", "title": "\nMar\u00eda Replies to Mercury FABNAQ\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 10, 2006", "body": "\nWe've all heard the argument posted at GenerationRescue's site which is often repeated by those who claim there's an autism epidemic: The incidence of autism has increased from 1 in 10,000 in the 1970s to 1 in 150 today, an increase of over 6,000%. Many more children have been diagnosed with other neurodevelopmental disorders all considered to be on the same spectrum including Asperger's, ADHD/ADD, speech delay, and many other developmental delays and learning disabilities. The refutation of this argument is well-known and straight forward: The prevalence of 1 in 150 includes Asperger's syndrome (no speech delay) whereas the definition of autism in the 1970s did not. Another important point is that these numbers represent  prevalence , not incidence. In general, a formal way to refute it is to point out that  the groups are not equivalent . Pointing out that  the groups are not equivalent  means that the prevalence of traits in one group is not comparable to that of the other group. For example, in one group, prevalence of speech delay is much higher than in the other. Prevalence of mental retardation (according to Weschler) is probably much higher in the 1970s group. In simpler terms, you can't compare the prevalence of apples to the prevalence of oranges, and then claim that the incidence of fruits has changed. General application of this principle I believe it's possible to make this argument from quarter to quarter, and from year to year. For example, the group of autistics in the CDDS in December 2002 is  not equivalent  to the group of autistics in the CDDS in December 2003. And this is demonstrably true. I'll list four groups below indicating trait proportions; namely, incidence of epilepsy and profound mental retardation (PMR) among autistics: Group 1 - Dec. 2002 : Epilepsy: 7.80%, PMR: 3.23% Group 2 - Dec. 2003 : Epilepsy: 7.42%, PMR: 2.86% Group 3 - Dec. 2004 : Epilepsy: 7.10%, PMR: 2.59% Group 4 - Dec. 2005 : Epilepsy: 6.73%, PMR: 2.35% Not only is it crystal clear that  these 4 groups are not equivalent , it would appear that autistics in the CDDS keep getting higher and higher functioning with every year that passes, with no end in sight. If this continues indefinitely, the CDDS will have to rename the 'Autism' category to 'NT'. Conclusion Claiming that the incidence of autism is increasing based on CDDS prevalence data suffers from a critical flaw. No such conclusion can be derived from the data, given that the group of autistics in one quarter is not equivalent to the group of autistics the next quarter.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/new-way-to-explain-why-epidemic-cannot.html", "title": "\nNew Way to Explain Why an Epidemic Cannot be Inferred\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 09, 2006", "body": "\nIn a posting titled  CDDS Data 101  I previously argued that differences in prevalence across Regional Centers in California may be explained by a 'broadening criteria' theory, i.e. differences in pediatrician and psychiatrist culture, different levels of awareness in the part of parents and school officials, misdiagnoses, etc. I cited evidence showing that some regional centers with low autism prevalence have a higher rate of increase of autistic clients over time than other regional centers that already have a high prevalence of autism. That is, prevalence in some regional centers is catching up to that of regional centers typically located in areas with high degrees of urbanization. In this posting I will analyze the data in a different way. I will show that while autism rates vary widely from region to region, and are typically well correlated with degree of urbanization, the same cannot be said of mental retardation. As usual, the analysis will be as non-technical as possible. The reader is encouraged to  download the data , verify my claims, and inform me of any errors in the comments section of this post. The importance of this analysis rests in testing the hypothesis that neurodevelopmental disorders may be correlated to factors such as environmental pollution, including exposure to environmental lead and mercury. To carry out the analysis, I will use epilepsy as a baseline. This is because, as I've noted, diagnoses of epilepsy appear to be stable in the CDDS data. Their growth pattern closely matches population growth in the state of California. This suggests that diagnoses of epilepsy are more objective and thus not subject to error such as 'broadening criteria' or 'shifting misdiagnoses'.  So a couple basic assumptions of this analysis are the following: (1) Epilepsy is not undergoing an epidemic, per CDDS data; (2) Epilepsy is uniformly diagnosed across regions, and differences in awareness in relation to epilepsy are negligible. Terminology Allow me to define a couple of terms before proceeding: Autism Index .- Number of autistic clients divided by number of clients with epilepsy. MR Index .- Number of clients with  severe or profound  mental retardation divided by number of clients with epilepsy. I will use these two indexes as an indication of the prevalence of autism and mental retardation in a Regional Center. (It would be much more difficult to gather data on the population served by each Regional Center, and that's why I use this method). Locations & Map The CDDS has a  Directory of Regional Centers  which gives the address of each Regional Center. Additionally, they provide a  map  of the areas served by each regional center. Data I have compiled data on Autism Index and MR Index for all regional centers. This data is calculated from numbers published in the CDDS Quarterly Client Characteristics Report for December, 2005. Regional Center Autism Index MR Index Alta California 0.59 0.57 Central Valley 0.32 0.60 East Bay 0.76 0.64 East LA 1.34 0.73 Frank D. Lanterman 1.37 0.83 Golden Gate 0.57 0.81 Harbor 1.46 0.85 Inland 0.54 0.76 Kern 0.49 0.70 North Bay 0.59 0.73 North LA 1.50 0.61 Orange County 0.84 0.75 San Andreas 0.85 0.62 San Diego 0.62 0.72 Redwood Coast 0.40 0.45 San Gabriel-Pomona 0.72 0.85 South Central LA 0.81 0.80 Tri-Counties 0.88 0.56 Valley Mountain 0.62 0.64 Westside 1.61 0.68 Far Northern 0.54 0.56 You will notice that the range of variance of MR Index is 0.45-0.85 (a factor of 1.89), whereas the range of variance of Autism Index is 0.32-1.61 (a factor of 5.03). The difference in autism rates between Central Valley and Westside is remarkable. To put it in perspective, this gap is equivalent to the 'autism epidemic' in U.S. schools between 1995 and 2003. Interestingly, the MR Indexes in Westide and Central Valley are very similar. Is there a correlation between autism and MR? Some areas with a low Autism Index also have a low MR Index. This is the case of Alta California, Redwood Coast and Far Northern. But the pattern breaks if you look at Golden Gate, Inland, Kern and North Bay, all centers with a low Autism Index but moderate to high MR Index. Some centers with a high Autism Index also have a relatively high MR Index. This is the case of East LA, Frank D. Lanterman and Harbor. But again, the pattern breaks if you look at North LA or Westside, which have the two highest Autism Indexes, but appear to have below-average MR Indexes. In general, it's hard to discern a pattern of correlation between Autism Index and MR Index. I'll leave it for the reader to graph the table and look for a pattern. Shouldn't we expect to see an inverse correlation? To some extent, yes. In the time-based state-wide data, you will see an inverse correlation, but it varies little (about -0.2% MR Index variation for every 1% increase in number of autistic clients). So this shouldn't throw off the data too much. You do see some of it in the two Regional Centers with the highest Autism Indexes: Westside and North LA. But there appear to be various random and conflicting factors pulling the numbers in different directions, such as socio-economics and cultural differences (e.g. how severe a condition must be to use the services of a Regional Center for something such as autism or MR, compared to something more objectively diagnosed such as epilepsy). Is there a correlation between MR and degree of urbanization? In the MR Index range of 0.4-0.59, we find Alta California (Sacramento area), Redwood Coast, Tri-Counties (Santa Barbara) and Far Northern. One is a densely populated area, one is a moderately populated area, and two are sparsely populated. This can easily be explained as a difference in awareness/culture/resources. If an urbanization-dependent environmental factor is at play, one would have to wonder why it's not in effect in Sacramento. In the MR Index range of 0.6-0.69 range we find Central Valley, East Bay, North LA, San Andreas, Valley Mountain and West Side. Central Valley (Fresno) and San Andreas (Santa Cruz) are moderately populated areas. The same is likely true of Valley Mountain. East Bay (Silicon Valley) is heavily populated as are Westside (Culver City in LA) and North LA.  In the MR Index range of 0.7-0.85 and above, we find most of the Regional Centers. They tend to be heavily populated, but we find a couple of anomalies. For example, Inland appears to be very sparsely populated. Kern would also appear to be much less densely populated that the nearby LA area, where many locations have a lower MR Index. In general, there's no clear-cut correlation between degree of urbanization and MR Index. Differences are small and may be easily explained by various random regional factors. Most of the Regional Centers have an MR Index in the range of 0.7-0.85, a very small range of variance. Conclusions [ Note : For an updated regional analysis, see  Regional Differences and Quarterly Growth Due to Two Factors .] If we compare Autism Index in Westside (LA area) vs. Central Valley (Fresno), we see that there's a difference in prevalence of about 500%. But we can also conclude from the data that autistics in Westside have a much lower prevalence of epilepsy and MR than do those in Central Valley. In other words, the  groups are not equivalent . If we assume that MR and epilepsy are good equivalence baselines, given that MR Indexes are the same in both areas, I'd like to point out, alarmingly, that Central Valley (Fresno) has \"missed\" about 80% of its \"train wrecks\" compared to Westside (using the wording of a known foe of autistics everywhere). What causes the groups not to be equivalent? The main cause, evidently, is that autism is a spectrum and there is no objective medical test for autism. Other possibilities: Awareness, misdiagnoses, financial resources, psychiatrist and pediatrician culture, etc. At this point it should be clear to the reader that autism diagnostic frequency is region-dependent, but that the diagnostic threshold is not equivalent across regions. This in itself does not prove that an environmental factor is not involved at all. MR is fairly stable in relation to epilepsy, but this could be explained by pointing out that an environmental factor might increase the prevalence of all 3 conditions (epilepsy, MR and autism), and act in conjunction with autism criteria discrepancies. I propose we can discount this hypothesis, however, based on the stability of diagnoses of epilepsy in the state-wide time-based data. Furthermore, one Italian study has shown that status epilepticus is not correlated to degree of urbanization [ ref ]. Showing that MR varies little from region to region and is not correlated in any significant way with degree of urbanization completely undermines the observation that autism is. That is, if actual autism  incidence  depended on degree of urbanization, you would expect MR and epilepsy to have a clear dependency on degree of urbanization as well. In other words, once we take into account the fact that it is the definition of autism which changes from region to region, and not the actual  incidence  of equally severe cases, then the correlation to degree of urbanization is better explained (or only explained) by other types of factors: Better knowledge, more financial resources, etc. While it is possible to pretty much discount any urbanization-dependent environmental factors with this analysis, we have not ruled out random region-dependent factors that may affect prevalence or incidence, such as socio-economics, ethnicity and genetic homogeneity. They would appear to have little effect, however. Factors that are not region-dependent are not within the scope of this analysis but they have been addressed before.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/rclist.cfm", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/pdf/rcdcmap2.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16241980&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/regional-differences-not-explained-by.html", "title": "\nRegional Differences Not Explained By Environmental Factors\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 07, 2006", "body": "\nI've compiled a list of  Frequently Asked But Never Answered Questions (FABNAQ)  about the \"autism=mercury poisoning\" hypothesis. The following questions don't have a logical, scientifically sound, consistent answer from the mercury camp. Prevalence data Considering that the prevalence of epilepsy among autistics is known to be an order of magnitude higher that that of the general population, why is the CDDS-based prevalence of autism rising at a rate of 10% annually (and even higher in the past), whereas the prevalence of epilepsy has always remained at population growth levels?   [John Best Jr. has answered that perhaps epilepsy is not being diagnosed in autistics who have epilepsy. But it's clear in the CDDS data that dual diagnoses are common. He then suggested that mercury does not have a seizure liablity. This, of course, is not consistent with what is known about autism. Plus I've also argued before that an environmental trigger without a seizure liability does not match the numbers. Finally, John asserted that autism and epilepsy are totally unrelated.] Why is the prevalence of CDDS clients without mental retardation (presumably based on IQ testing) going up quickly? Why is the proportion of autistics with epilepsy going down at an annual rate of -5.5%? Why is the proportion of autistics with mental retardation going down at a comparable rate? Why do you continue to claim that the number of \"new cases\" or \"newly diagnosed cases\" of autism is dropping in California, considering that the CDDS says that  they don't provide data on new cases ? Isn't it intellectually dishonest to continue to do so? [I'm not aware of any proponent of the mercury hypothesis having addressed this crucial objection. If you know what the rebuttal consists of, please post it in the comments section.] Considering that close to no thimerosal is going into vaccines nowadays, shouldn't the following be true? (1) The number of autistic clients in the CDDS 3-5 age range should be crashing towards zero. (2) All newly diagnosed autistic children would be those vaccinated with thimerosal (via the Flu vaccine, as Sue likes to point out). Use of thimerosal has been eliminated or drastically reduced in several countries, including Canada, Denmark and Sweden. Why has no country reported a decrease in he prevalence of autism following these actions? Cognitive findings By what mechanism does mercury poisoning result in savant skills? How does mercury poisoning explain the results of Dawson and Mottron? That is, autistics score higher than the norm in the Raven IQ test. But not only this, the gap between the Weschler and Raven tests is totally the inverse (in the other direction) of what it would be in NTs.  [John Best Jr. proposes that the same gene that results in a mercury excretion liability also produces high IQ. This of course would mean that the mercury spares certain types of cognition. While JB Jr. concedes that genetics could account for cognitive advantages, he does not concede that it's enough to account for socio-linguistic deficits.] How does it explain findings by Happe (2001) that parents of autistics have a \"cognitive style\" (weak central coherence) that can confer information-processing advantages? Neurobiological findings How does mercury poisoning produce significant grey and white matter volume differences in infancy? [The usual answer to these kinds of questions is that \"corrupt scientists\" are in on the conspiracy led by the CDC.] How does mercury poisoning produce larger brain mass and size? How does mercury poisoning produce increased neuron density and smaller neurons? Chelation therapy Why do you start chelation therapy without first testing for heavy metal poisoning? If you have tested your child, did you use a local reputable lab or an internet lab? Did you send a control sample to verify their tests are valid? Is there controlled evidence that chelation therapy is an effective treatment for autism? Is there controlled evidence that chelation therapy is a safe treatment for the duration you're planning to follow it? Are you following medical guidelines as to the proper duration of chelation therapy? Genetics What is the mercury-based genetic model that explains a 60% concordance for  classic autism  in identical twins, but a much lower concordance (2%-4%) in siblings and fraternal twins? How does mercury poisoning explain a higher proportion of scientists and engineers as close relatives of autistics? Why do you propose that autism just cannot be simply genetic, while autism-like conditions such as Fragile-X, Rett Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis obviously can? How does mercury poisoning explain some of the alleles which have been linked to autism? GABA, SERT, etc. Given that autism is more heritable than personality, intelligence, homosexuality and left-handedness, would you say these other variations in human behavior are, too, caused by pathological environmental triggers such as mercury poisoning?  Flawed logic If you believe that autism did not exist before the 1940s, do you also believe that Down's Syndrome did not exist before 1862, that Fragile-X syndrome did not exist before 1943, and that Rett Syndrome did not exist before 1966? [JB Jr. admits that Rett Syndrome was likely misdiagnosed as autism before 1966. He further admits that Rett Syndrome might have been called brain damage or birth defect before the 1940s. But when asked if autism could also have been called brain damage or birth defect before the 1940s, he proclaims this is impossible. Why? Because autism did not exist, as Kanner was the first to see it.] Do you realize that a prevalence of 1 in 166 today (which includes Asperger's syndrome) cannot be compared to a 1970s or 1980s prevalence? Do you understand why anecdotal accounts do not prove an argument? Characteristics of true heavy metal toxicity (Per Jennifer I believe:) If autistics are unable to excrete mercury, wouldn't regular intake of mercury from the environment be enough to kill autistics over time? Why are the following symptoms of heavy metal poisoning not characteristic of autism? Headaches, cold hands and feet, vertigo, inability to focus vision, joint and muscle pains, weak pulse, hard pulse, bleeding gums, blisters, tooth ache, jaw inflammation, metallic taste in mouth, loosening of teeth, persistent cough, irregular breathing, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, subnormal temperature, excessive perspiration, chest pain, changes in blood pressure, etc. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/FactsStats/pdf/CDER_QtrlyReport_Consideration_Limitations.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/mercury-fabnaq.html", "title": "\nMercury FABNAQ\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 05, 2006", "body": "\n Kevin Leitch  recently posted a comment he had seen in the EOHarm list indicating the following:  \"Which physical symptoms should be ignored in children with [alleged] mercury-induced autism, so that their parents can \u201ccelebrate their neurodiversity\u201d?\"  This is followed by a list of co-morbidities, some recognized as commonly occuring with autism, most of them inconclussive or questionable. It was of course pointed out that this was an intellectually dishonest misrepresentation of what the neurodiversity philosophy is about. The trivial flaw in the question has been noted repeatedly: Evidently, you ought not to ignore these co-morbidities. Let me provide a less disputed list of co-morbidities of autism. That is, while we can't generalize and say that all autistics have these medical liabilities, it would appear that they are far more prevalent among autistics than in the general population: Allergies Gastro-intestinal problems Seizures and epilepsy Sleep problems Self-injury (SIB) Upper-respiratory problems It's not entirely clear what the thought process that led to this argument looks like, but I've done my best to attempt to generalize it below: If a phenotype (an appearance or behavior pattern) is associated with a relatively high prevalence of recognized medical liabilities, then the phenotype should not be characterized as a 'way of being'. The phenotype must then be considered a disease that must be erradicated and cured as a whole. Treating only the co-morbidities is insufficient. Note that it's not just one person who makes an argument along these lines. Other mercury parents apparently jumped on the bandwagon according to Kevin. So while I shouldn't generalize, for the purposes of narration, I'm going to assume that \"mercury parents\" have this position. In order to determine the viability of this argument, which appears reasonable on the surface, I have decided to test its plausibility on genotypes or phenotypes other than autism. The Ashkenazi Jewish Population A number of significant (usually deadly) diseases are considerably more prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish Population: Bloom's Syndrome Canavan Disease Familial Dysautonomia Fanconia Anemia Gaucher Disease Mucolipidosis IV Niemann-Pick Disease Tay-Sachs Disease Torsion Dystonia Crohn's Disease Of these, Tay-Sachs is the best known. Death usually occurs by three to five years of life due to pneumonia or other infections. Interestingly, there's some controversial research which links Tay-Sachs and other genetic diseases to higher IQ in Ashkenazi Jews [ ref ]. So is being Jewish a disease that must be erradicated and cured? Unless the reader is a Neo-Nazi, I'd expect the reader to disagree. But I think it's important to illustrate the correct use of the terminology with a couple of examples: Correct : This child suffers from Crohn's Disease. He ought to be treated. Incorrect : This child suffers from being Jewish. Let's remove his Judaism. And while we're at it, let's device a genetic test to prevent Jewish people from being born. Historical sociologist Shelley Reuter says that the notion of a Jewish disease is flawed since \u201cthere is no DNA sequence common and exclusive to all Jews.\u201d Guess what? Neither is there one for all autistics. Homosexuality I anticipated that some readers might question the last analogy on the grounds that we should not compare autism to a race. (I might someday argue why that is totally valid in a different post). Homosexuality is the natural choice for a follow-up analogy, given that it has been described as a mental disorder. Homosexuality used to be listed in the DSM-II, which was modified in 1973 to exclude it. This action resulted from the protests of gay activits who believed that homosexuality was not a disorder at all, but simply a 'way of being' to be tolerated and respected as any other way of being. Similar activism in relation to other phenotypes classified as disorders has occurred since. In a similar fashion to the mercury parents, some die-hard psychiatrists and semi-professionals still argue that homosexuality should be considered a disorder and treated on the basis of its medical liabilities [ ref ]: Classical STDs Enteric diseases (Gay bowel disease, Hepatatis, etc.) Trauma to various body parts And of course, AIDS Some of these are quite serious. But even so, it is not correct to say that an AIDS sufferer is a person who suffers from homosexuality. Others argue that the cost of homosexuality is alarming, both in monetary terms and social terms [ ref ]. What does that remind me of? As to curing homosexuality, there are a number of behavioral approaches still in use today. Reparative therapy claims a success rate of 30% to 70%, apparently even better to that of ABA. And as you might expect, there exist people called \"ex-gay\" who claim to be recovered from homosexuality. You will also find some talk on the internet to the effect that homosexuality might be caused by a 'chemical imbalance' (a favorite of the drug industry) and thus may be treated with drugs. One of the pioneers of behavioral interventions for homosexuality and transexuality was, you guessed it, O. Ivar Lovaas [ ref ]. That's not surprising. After all, he says children \"don't have the right to act bizarrely\". Left-handedness I know there's at least one mercury parent,  John Best Jr. , who actually does believe that homosexuality is a disorder that must be cured. For him and others like him here is a less controversial condition: left-handedness. Some of the liabilities of left-handedness (and I must warn that these are controversial) are: Higher incidence of sexual offenses Accident proneness Proneness to alcoholism Allergies Immune disorders Lower life expectancy Still, left-handed people are proud of their genetic heritage, are opposed to continued efforts to make them switch hands, widely reject the 'person with left-handedness' terminology, and even believe that left-handedness provides them with cognitive advantages. All they ask is for a bit of accomodation so they are able to use their left hand in various social and educational settings. Giftedness Here's a strange type of \"abnormal\" which many people would like to be. It's a lot like the  tall stature  phenotype or the  really low body fat  phenotype. We all know that giftedness must have some advantages, in some cases including savantism. Genetically, of course, given its low prevalence, it's not surprising that it comes with a number of liabilities: Allergies Myopia Clinical depression Perfectionism Isolation/Introversion Underachievement Hypersensitivity (Sensory overload) Is giftedness a disorder? It's not considered as such at present. But psychiatrists and school officials, in their never ending quest to label every single person in the planet as brain diseased, appear to be on the brink of classifying it as such [ ref ][ ref ].

Don't treat the autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=332", "http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4032638", "http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/narth/medconsequences.html", "http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/s_homo_cost.htm", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/library_rekers_1974.pdf", "http://hatingautism.blogspot.com", "http://ericec.org/fact/asperger.pdf", "http://www.onlineparadigm.com/archives/230-SP03_MH.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/do-co-morbidities-prove-pathology.html", "title": "\nDo Co-morbidities Prove Pathology?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 02, 2006", "body": "\nRecently there have been many reports indicating that the number of autism cases is dropping [ ref ]. I will show that this conclusion results from a haphazard interpretation of the data and misleading terminology. I will base this simple non-technical analysis on the California DDS (CDDS) data, readily  available online . The reader is encouraged to download the data and verify my claims. The numbers are quite clear and you don't need to be a mathematician to interpret them. Caveat: The CDDS does not recommend using this data to determine prevalence trends, but I will use it to point out flaws in interpretations that have used this data for such a purpose in the past. Let's agree on some terminology first: Number of autistic clients .- This is the number of persons with a diagnosis of autism in the CDDS system in any given quarter. It could be taken as a very rough indication of the autistic population in the state of California below the age of 18.  [ Errata : The CDDS does keep clients older than 18, so this could be taken as a reflection of the autistic population in the state]. Rate of increase .- This is obtained by subtracting the number of autistic clients in one quarter minus the number of autistic clients in the previous quarter. This is equivalent to the number of autistic clients who enter the CDDS system minus the number of autistic clients who leave the CDDS system in any given quarter. (I also sometimes refer to the  annual  rate of increase). New cases .- This is the number of autistic clients who enter the CDDS system in any given quarter. Note that the  CDDS does not provide data on new cases as defined here . The term \"new cases\" has often been used to describe \"rate of increase\" (defined above) and this is where much of the confusion stems from. So has there been a drop in cases of autism based on CDDS data? Let's see. There were 28,724 autistic clients in Sep. 2005 and 29,424 autistic clients in Dec. 2005. Does it look like a drop? There were even less a year before (Dec. 2004): 26,576. That is, in the last year, the autistic population in the CDDS has increased by 2,848. This is an increase of 10.72%. Is 10.72% a big increase in the autistic population? Absolutely. Annual population growth in the state of California is roughly 1%. Any growth in number of clients above that level is indicative of an increase in prevalence.  Don't buy that? Let's see if it works with epilepsy. There were 37,301 clients with epilepsy in Dec. 2005, and 37,076 clients with epilepsy in Dec. 2004. That's a rate of increase of 225 clients, or 0.6%. This is even somewhat lower than annual population growth. (BTW, a true increase in autism prevalence would be expected to be matched by an increase in the prevalence of epilepsy). Can the rate of increase remain at 10.72% indefinitely? This is impossible. If it did, the autistic population would double every 7 years and would reach 20 million (the total population of the state) in about a century and a half. This rate needs to go down to about 1% eventually, and there are indications that it is already starting to go down. It will be obvious when it reaches this level, as you will hear many reports to the effect that autism prevalence has finally  leveled off . So what do people mean when they say that the number of new cases is dropping? What they mean is precisely this: The rate of increase is dropping, which is totally unremarkable as explained above. The problem is that they say \"new cases\" instead of \"rate of increase\" and this is completely misleading. But don't take my word for it. Go and check  the data  against this common claim: \"The number of new cases of professionally diagnosed full syndrome DSM IV autism entering California's developmental services system declined from 734 new cases during the second quarter of 2005 (April through June) to 678 new cases during the just completed third quarter of 2005 (July through September), a 7 1/2% decline in one quarter\" [ ref ]. Predictions of Thimerosal Theory Some proponents of the Thimerosal Theory of Autism maintain that autism did not exist before the 1930s. If their theory is correct, when thimerosal is completely removed from vaccines the quarterly rate of increase  should become negative immediately . And in about 18 years, the number of autistic clients in the CDDS  should become zero .  [ Errata : Only the number of autistic minors in the system should become zero after that time. A quicker prediction is that the number of autistic clients in the 3-5 age range should become zero within 4 years of thimerosal removal. It is clear this is not happening.] . Even those who are not so forceful about this theory do maintain that the \"autism epidemic\" is largely attributable to Thimerosal. Still, the quarterly rate of increase should become negative, and the number of autistic clients in the CDDS should drop to early 90s or 80s levels in about 18 years. Predictions of the Broader Criteria Theory This theory says that our conception of what autism is has been broadening and that parent and pediatrician awareness about autism is increasing. Awareness and criteria will have to stop broadening at some point, since clearly not everyone is autistic. So according to this theory, the quarterly rate of increase  should gradually drop until it matches population growth in the state of California . And the number of autistic clients should remain at high levels but only grow slowly. Based on the trend I can see on graphs now, I would predict the autistic population in California will level off in about 2016. Evidence in favor of the Broader Criteria Theory In the movie Rain Man (1988), Raymond Bobbit is referred to as \"high functioning\" a couple times. Today, it's common for Rain Man to be referred to as a \"relatively severe case\". It is clear that our conception of what autism is has changed. If a movie doesn't do it for you, consider twin studies. In twin studies, it's obvious that higher concordance will be found the broader the definition of autism is. (That is, the more identical you expect twins to be, the less concordance you will report). In the first twin study on autism by Folstein-Rutter (1977), concordance for autism was found to be 36% for identical twins (0% for fraternal). But they also found that concordance for \"cognitive disorder\" was 82% in identical twins (10% for fraternal). Now consider that at least 3 modern studies have found a \"classic autism\" concordance of 60%-95.7% for identical twins. This is fairly good evidence that researchers' conceptions of what autism is have broadened - never mind parent and pediatrician awareness. Isn't it also remarkable that as the dosage of thimerosal has increased, autism has become more and more heritable? Further evidence can be found in the California data itself. As I noted, the rate of increase in epilepsy is 0.6% whereas the current rate of increase in autism is 10.7%. It is known that a certain portion of autistics suffer from epilepsy. (Epilepsy is also a favorite of the Thimerosal camp when they argue that autism is pathological). So if there is a real increase in the prevalence of autism, you would expect to see a matching increase in the prevalence of epilepsy.  The CDDS does provide data on autistics with epilepsy. There were 1,886 in Dec. 2004 and 1,979 in Dec. 2005. This is an increase of 93 clients, or 4.9% in the last year. This is a lot lower than the 10.7% rate of increase for autism. (Why isn't it around 1%? Probably because more and more clients with epilepsy are recognized as also being autistic). The number of autistic clients with no mental retardation was 16,448 in Dec. 2004, and 18,708 in Dec. 2005. So the annual rate of increase of autistics with no MR is 2260 or  13.74% . This is considerably higher than the 10.7% annual rate of increase for all autistic clients. So there you have it. More and more autistics are not mentally retarded (presumably based on IQ testing - which incidentally is likely flawed). And less and less autistics suffer from a co-morbidity of epilepsy. Need more evidence? The regional data is also interesting. We would expect to find that in places of high prevalence, awareness and broadening criteria is leveling off more quickly than in the state as a whole. The Westside regional center appears to be a place of high prevalence (over 30% of all clients are autistic). You will find that the annual rate of increase is about 8.3% there, lower than the 10.7% for the state. In contrast, some places (not all) where prevalence hasn't caught up should have a higher rate of increase. You will find that the Inland regional center, for example, has an annual rate of increase of 15.17%, much higher than the 10.7%. It's as if Inland is catching up to Westside - like going back in time. (Professional's conceptions of autism will probably always differ a little from region to region, however). In conclusion, it's not correct to say that we just don't know whether thimerosal causes autism. The truth is that the weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly on the side of the broadening criteria theory. Summary The \"new cases\" terminology is misleading, as it assumes that the rate of increase in the number of clients is the same as the number of clients who enter the system. Current annual increase in the number of autistic clients in the CDDS is 10.7%, which is much higher than population growth in the state of California. The Broadening Criteria theory predicts that the rate of increase should drop gradually to around 1%. The Thimerosal theory predicts that the rate of increase should become negative, and the number of autistic clients drop every quarter until it becomes zero (or at least very low). The data is overwhelmingly in favor of the Broadening Criteria theory. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sacunion.com/pages/california/articles/5424", "http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm", "http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/new-california-autism-cases-continue.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/cdds-data-101.html", "title": "\nCDDS Data 101\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 01, 2006", "body": "\nAnecdotes of benefit from the latest \"miracle cure\" for autism abound. Early on I realized these anecdotes need to be taken with some skepticism. Parents desperate to cure their children attempt all kinds of therapies all the time; naturally, when their children cross some developmental milestone, the improvement is attributed to the latest of the therapies that was attempted.  The issue is not just one of unproven effectiveness, but also one of unknown adverse effects. Even some treatments whose effectiveness may be backed up by placebo-controlled double-blind studies (B6/Magnesium, L-carnosine, Risperidone, etc.) may have short- or long-term adverse effects which are not well understood. The case of Ritalin should be taken into account as an example: There are now reasons to believe it may have cardiovascular adverse effects, psychiatric adverse effects, and is possibly a carcinogenic. Certain treatments are just believed to be effective and touted as \"evidence based\" when in fact the evidence is somewhat questionable. This is the case of ABA, a very popular treatment whose effectiveness is taken for granted. But the initial study by Lovaas did not use a randomized control group, and evaluators were not blind to treatment. Follow-up studies on the same group of children of course suffer from the same methodological flaws introduced early on and new results may have been affected by parent perceptions following the initial treatment. The Lovaas findings have been criticized on methodological grounds on several occasions [ ref ][ ref ][ ref ]. If similar evidence were to be presented to support, say, the GFCF diet, it would be immediately qualified as nearly useless. Michelle Dawson has, as everyone knows, criticized ABA on ethical grounds [ ref ]. Other adult autistics have expressed concerns (I'm being gentle) about ABA, such as the treatment of children as if they were trained seals [ ref ][ ref ]. Aversives are often criticized, but the usual response is that they are no longer used. (The early Lovaas study did rely on aversives, BTW). Some cases of PTSD have been reported following treatment [ ref ][ ref ]. One of my own concerns is that effects on late adolescence and adulthood are unknown. I do believe there's probably an ideal educational approach that will work great for autistic children, a different approach to that used on NT children, but it's not at all clear ABA is that approach. Parents often do indicate they see some improvement in their children while they undergo ABA. But you will probably find as many parents touting the GFCF diet or chelation therapy, both unproven treatment methods. It is necessary to recognize that autistic children developing is not surprising. They just don't do it in the expected time frame. Autism is not a degenerative disease like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, which ultimately end up killing the affected individual. When a neurotypical child learns to walk, do you believe the child \"recovered\" from a disability? To put everything in perspective, I think it's helpful to look at what some placebo-controlled studies have found in relation to the placebo effect in autism. Sandler AD, et al.  Lack of Benefit of a Single Dose of Synthetic Human Secretin in the Treatment of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder  (1999). This study used standard behavioral measures, including the  Autism Behavior Checklist , to evaluate children before and after administration of Secretin or Placebo. The initial score of the Placebo group was 63.2 (higher score means \"more autistic\"). After only 4 weeks, the score on the Placebo group was  reduced by 17.8 points  (compared to 8.9 in the Secretin group). But what's most surprising,  69% of the parents of the children in this study said they remained interested in Secretin  as a treatment for their children. I should emphasize that a large number of controlled studies have shown that Secretin is about as beneficial in the treatment of autism as drinking bottled water. Coplan J, et al.  Children with autistic spectrum disorders. II: parents are unable to distinguish secretin from placebo under double-blind conditions.  (2003) This study demonstrated that parents were unable to distinguish the effects of Placebo from those of Secretin, using a swapping technique. But the surprising thing is that  77% of families reported the treatment was beneficial , only 6% saw no improvement, and 6% offered no guess. Adams J, et al.  Vitamin, mineral supplements benefit people with autism . This online paper is in preparation of a study that looks at the effectiveness of a multivitamin supplement compared to a Placebo. Parents are asked to rate their children's improvement after 3 months as follows: On a scale of 1-7, 1=much worse; 2=worse; 3=slightly worse; 4=same; 5=slightly better; 6=better; 7=much better. On the \"Sociability\" category, parents reported scores of 5.1 for Placebo and 5.3 for the supplement. On the \"Expressive language\" scale it was 5.6 for Placebo and 5.9 for the supplement. That is, from \"slightly better\" to \"better\" on both measures, and not much difference with the supplement. (Side note: The study does show some statistically significant improvements on other measures, but it's not clear if the supplement only helps children who are \"fussy eaters\" - as always, caution is warranted given that vitamins are drugs). I've come up with the following possible explanations for these results: A) A regular placebo effect is at play, i.e. children realize they are undergoing treatment and improve as a result. B) There's a placebo effect on the parents, i.e. they become optimistic and this positively reflects on the outcome of their children. C) Parents and researchers are biased in their final evaluation, as they expect a positive outcome following treatment. D) Autistic children, like any other children, are constantly developing and changing. I think we can all agree that explanation  A  is impossible and may be discarded. Explanation  B  seems a bit far-fetched, but if true, it would bode well for the notion that optimism and enthusiasm are beneficial to children (something doctors and researchers are not very helpful with). Explanation  C  is quite plausible. Nevertheless, note that the Sandler (1999) study used a less subjective evaluation method carried out by researchers, not parents. And consider that researchers are notoriously pessimistic about autism and its outcome. Furthermore, in the Adams study, parents rate certain physiological outcomes (e.g. intestinal problems) as \"no change\" on Placebo. This is not surprising, but shows that parents might not be too biased on their expectations. This leaves explanation  D  as the most likely one: Autistic children do develop on their own, except parents usually only notice when they expect it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2925968&query_hl=40&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=9546297&query_hl=43&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=9656132&query_hl=45&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html", "http://home.att.net/~ascaris1/ABA.html", "http://www.autistics.us/library/time.html", "http://www.astraeasweb.net/politics/aba.html", "http://community-2.webtv.net/CIBRA/AVERSIVESPROMPTS/index.html", "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pdpatel/DSM%20files/ABC_checklist.pdf"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/placebo-effects-in-autism.html", "title": "\nPlacebo Effects In Autism\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 24, 2006", "body": "\nCertainly, autism exists, otherwise why write about it and why label myself autistic or Aspie? But the question is: does it actually exist as a distinct natural entity or only as a cultural/social/psychiatric construct?  In a paper titled  ADHD is best understood as a cultural construct  (2004), Sami Timimi explains that there's no objective test that may be used to diagnose ADHD and that reported prevalence rates of the disorder vary widely. This theory (remarkable as you will see) can actually be applied to any spectrum disorder in the field of psychiatry and it fits autism quite nicely. What the theory points out is that the characteristic behaviors of a spectrum disorder occur to a lesser degree in the general population. So the question arises as to how you distinguish someone who is disordered from someone who isn't. More specifically, how do you distinguish those who are \"only a little autistic\" vs. those who are \"not quite autistic\"? Psychiatrists have rules of thumb that guide them in making the distinction; usually this simply means that the affected person or a relative is looking for help. But evaluations by affected persons, relatives and psychiatrists are all subjective. There is no medical test that will determine that someone is autistic, nor is there one that will rule out a psychiatric diagnosis of autism. Furthermore, different psychiatrists will invariably have different opinions as to where the boundary lies. But surely some people who are severely autistic are truly afflicted by something objective, right? Social construct theory is not concerned with severity. The reasoning continues to apply regardless of where the boundary between normal and abnormal is situated. Many conditions which are not social constructs themselves are often diagnosed as autism. Such is the case of Fragile-X Syndrome and Rett Syndrome, both objectively diagnosable conditions. And we should also expect that many other objective conditions yet to be identified may also look a lot like autism. In this sense, autism should be seen as both a blanket term and a social construct. A possible objection is to point out that autism could simply be a blanket term for many objective conditions, and not a social construct. Some would even propose those objective conditions are: Asperger syndrome, classic autism, and so on. The problem with this reasoning is that since the characteristic symptoms of autism blend into behaviors of the general population, the boundary between normal and abnormal is always inherently arbitrary, and the same may apply to the boundary between arbitrarily defined sub-conditions. (The boundary between autism and Asperger's is notoriously problematic as it is [ ref ]). Some readers might be thinking that a genetic test for autism will render this theory useless. But this is actually where the predictive beauty of this theory can be appreciated. Scientists are currently expecting to find 3 or 4 or 15 genes that will define a person as autistic. The more genes you have, the lower in the spectrum you are. What social construct theory predicts is that no set of genes that accurately mirror a diagnosis will be found. Genes will only increase the likelihood of autism, but not cause it. And an absence of genes will not rule out a diagnosis. Genome scans to date are quite consistent with this prediction (in addition to being consistent with a blanket term view). Based on current knowledge about the heritability of autism, it could be argued that the best possible genetic test will only be able to make a prediction of classic autism with 60% accuracy and a very broad spectrum with 90% accuracy \u2013 and this would be a extremely sophisticated and complex test.  Falsifiability Social construct theory is clearly not simply an ideology or a view. It is a scientific theory that could be falsified in principle (with an objective medical test), is useful and makes predictions. A common misconception is that finding differences between autistics and non-autistics falsifies this theory. For example, pointing out the differences in grey and white matter volumes which have been documented might be thought by some readers to undermine this theory. But this is not sufficient, because (1) The differences observed are 'in average', i.e. the findings cannot be generalized to all autistics, and (2) Such differences would be expected in any behavioral spectrum regardless of where the comparison boundary is situated. Comparing any two arbitrarily selected groups would probably yield neurological differences in average. For example, you could compare classic autistics vs. non-classic autistics, or Aspies vs. those with ADHD, or men vs. women \u2013 finding neurological differences is not surprising but generalizing them is basically a stereotype. Usefulness At this point some readers might point out that the theory that autism is a social construct is, in turn, a useless intellectual artifact. The usefulness of this theory lies in the kinds of problems it explains and in that it provides a new framework to think about issues related to autism. For example: 1) Social construct theory explains the \"autism epidemic\". Any subjective boundary can shift through time. This should also be true of differences in regional prevalence. 2) Social construct theory explains the emergence of Asperger's syndrome as a form of autism. 3) This theory suggests that the psychiatry profession is, perhaps unintentionally, gradually broadening the conception of  brain disorder . There appear to be no controls on how much longer this trend will be allowed to continue. 4) Based on this theory it can be inferred that many individuals labeled as having a  brain disorder  (and labeling perhaps has consequences of its own) in fact do not.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/184/1/8", "http://www.autistics.us/library/aspieautie.html"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/02/does-autism-exist.html", "title": "\nDoes Autism Exist?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 27, 2006", "body": "\n A controversial blog ( autismhysteria.blogpot.com ) documents the claimed recovery of Steve Colville's daughter from autism. Steve makes the following claims: 1) The definition of autism has broadened over time to the point where it's no longer meaningful. This explains, in part, the \"autism epidemic\". 2) Many children labeled autistic are not autistic (and Thomas Sowell, author of  The Einstein Syndrome , is right about a similar assessment). 3) Even though his daughter showed behaviors consistent with some of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for autism, she is not autistic, and never actually was autistic. (She was actually diagnosed PDD-NOS). 4) Autistic behavior may be caused by a lack of bonding between a child and his/her mother. This also explains, in part, the \"autism epidemic\". 5) There exists  real autism  which is truly life-long (apparently meaning that no development of speech or social skills is possible when afflicted by it). Claim #1 above overlaps with some of my own views. (See  Does Autism Exist? ). I mostly object to the labeling of an increasing number of children as  brain disordered . I don't mind the recognition that a good number of people are autistic - people who in the past would've been labeled weird, stupid, retarded, nutty or even gifted. When used as an identity label, it can be very useful. Claim #2 is meaningless, as autism is a social construct. There is no objective test for autism, so it's possible to claim that a given person is autistic or not really autistic, or to say that she used to be autistic, etc. The only formal convention is the DSM-IV, and that is still pretty subjective. This is why it's possible for researchers to speculate and disagree as to whether Einstein was autistic. The same applies to claim #3, i.e. whether his daughter was really autistic or not. This reminds me of  Raun Kaufman , who is claimed to have gone from being autistic to being someone \"without a trace\" of autism. Given the common but unsubstantiated belief that autistic children don't develop fully, this has become quite controversial. Naturally there are those who say Raun Kaufman was not really autistic, and those who say he's now a very high-functioning autistic. The key here is that Raun Kaufman does not believe he's autistic, and that's really the assessment that matters. I should note that some evidence presented in favor of the view that Raun Kaufman is recovered is based on stereotypes. For example, it is often mentioned that he has a University degree, as if autistics could never have a University degree. (I have a Master's degree myself, BTW). A diminishing number of researchers still believe that autistics never develop speech, and those who do develop speech are described as 'not truly autistic'. This clearly makes no sense. Some autistics who develop speech still have substantial deficits. At the very least psychiatrists would have to come up with a new label for those who truly never develop speech, but the big problem would be that it is impossible to predict which young child falls into which category. Again, medical tests for autism or kinds of autism don't exist. Refrigerator Mother Claim #4 could be seen as a variation on the refrigerator mother theory. This has been the most controversial claim of all. For example, Xian Diaz said: I'm curious to hear how your wife feels about this whole situation, and how she felt when she was blamed for her daughter's affliction. It is clear mothers feel offended when such theories are proposed. My wife gets pretty rattled. The recognition of my autism and its strong genetic component are seen as a vindication of her parenting skills. But frankly, being offended by a theory has no bearing on the theory's scientific merit. Furthermore, it would be foolish to claim that parenting is irrelevant with autistic children, or any children for that matter. I do believe Political Correctness was one of the reasons why the Refrigerator Mother theory was no longer studied by researchers. (There's very little research on it in the last couple of decades). When autism began to be recognized as a highly heritable condition, Refrigerator Mother began to be phased out. But if you think about it, today many researchers continue to look for other environmental triggers. Except, this time, they aren't looking for environmental triggers that have to do with childhood experiences or psychological influence. They are only looking for environmental accidents, i.e. physical causes. There is no good reason for this focus, except fashionable belief systems, and the unpopularity of certain views. Autism is highly heritable, but it is not 100% heritable. Note, however, that nothing that is evaluated subjectively is ever 100% heritable. Personality and intelligence are probably even less heritable than autism. Homosexuality is less heritable than autism. There must be something that makes one identical twin have one personality type and the other twin have a different personality type. The cause of this is not likely going to be level of mercury in the brain. It's probably something a lot more subtle that has to do with the unique experiences of each twin. (Or perhaps it's something that occurs in the womb - we just don't know). There are a couple case reports that indicated a higher proportion of autistic behavior in children who had experienced profound institutional privation at an orphanage. This was not nutritional privation, BTW. This seems to suggest, in principle, that some psychological factors could amplify the perceived severity of someone's autism. The Anecdote At first I was inclined to dismiss Steve's anecdote as yet another anecdote of sudden development that coincided with the latest treatment attempted by desperate parents who are always trying something new. After reading his account, however, it was clear that this was unusual.  Then suddenly [the headmaster] leaned over, picked up my daughter and held her tightly to his chest... And screamed for the best part of an hour as the headmaster walked about... Then when she'd calmed down a little he put her down, placed a chair in her hand and pushed her into a semi-circle of children having a music lesson. My daughter sat down and looked about for a few seconds as though waking from a sleep. Then her eyes focused on the teacher. And then my daughter (and remember at this point she was making no eye contact and was almost completely non-verbal) simply began to copy the teacher's hand actions and mouth the words to the song... And then three months later she began to talk... The best moment came when, during one of the hugging sessions, she tried to escape and said: \"Daddy, you shouldn't be doing things now that you should have done when I was a baby!\" This is just a summary. The whole description is pretty lengthy. But essentially, it seems far-fetched to say such an improvement is coincidental. The part about beginning to speak in sentences all of the sudden is not surprising. Speech develops that way - it's not a gradual process but an explosion. But the sudden improvement seen right at the beginning of this therapy appears notable. Some people dismiss this as a kind of ABA. This is nonsense. ABA involves intensive training up to 40 hours per week for several years. It's not just hugging for 3 months. Some key information to understand what went on here is found at the beginning of the account: She began to say single words at about 12 months, and by 18 months had begun to make sentences. At 18 months she had a development test and seemed fine. It is clear this little girl understood spoken language and could also speak in sentences before 18 months. Then suddenly she stopped speaking. This is what most parents refer to as a \"regression\". It appears that true regression can occur due to conditions such as Landau-Kleffner Syndrome. In other cases, it's not clear if the child forgets some skills or simply stops using certain skills.  Some additional information seems relevant: Then when she was two years old we moved house... At about this time our second child was born... my wife went back to her own country for a while, during which time Denise's behavior became intolerable. So it seems she experienced considerable stress around the time of her \"regressions\". It is possible she simply withdrew and had constant anxiety, not so much that she forgot to speak in sentences. Social withdrawal due to depression and stress has been reported. See  Autistic devices in small children in mourning  (2000). It should be noted that not all children are affected this way. Clearly, there needs to be some kind of genetic predisposition. There is some evidence that autistic children react differently to stress. Incidentally, my mother says I was the happiest child before my brother (who is 4 years younger) was born. I believe I experienced a sort of regression at the time. I have seen how stress has affected my son, particularly when we first enrolled him in a preschool, when I've been out of town and when my wife has been out of town. But my son has never really spoken in sentences. A regression per se has not been obvious with him. Additionally, my son is quite loving and likes hugging. These are some of the reasons I don't believe this approach or outcome could apply to my son, even though the profile of hyperactivity and so on appear to be very similar. In trying to understand the sudden improvement observed at the beginning of the therapy, I'm reminded of some anecdotes retold by Thomas Sowell (who Steve has read as well). He tells, for example, of a family sitting in a living room, very worried, discussing how to deal with their late talking child. Realizing this, the child approaches his relatives and says \"I'm sorry\". He also tells of children who don't speak in public but who are caught practicing speech when they are alone. Steve's daughter did know how to speak and so on. When the headmaster forcefully hugged her for half an hour, I'd hypothesize she realized her parents were very worried for her, that this was going to become a major problem for her, and much like the child who said \"I'm sorry\", started to behave in a way more in line with the expectations of the parents. The hugging, in fact, might have worked like an aversive. I could be wrong, but without evidence for this or the opposing hypothesis, who's to say which is right. Holding Therapy It's true what they say: There's nothing new under the sun. After a bit of research, it's clear Steve's miracle cure is exactly the same as  Holding Therapy . This is an old therapy invented by Dr. Martha Welch in the 1970s. She hypothesized that autism was caused by the lack of bonding between mother and child. The therapy involves forcefully hugging a child despite any distress experienced by the child.  As with ABA, holding therapy has been described by people on the spectrum as a form of abuse [ ref ]. Others are not so forceful. This is what Temple Grandin has had to say about Holding Therapy: During my travels to many autism conferences several parents have reported to me that holding therapy was beneficial. It is not the \"cure\" that some of its proponents tout, but it had a beneficial effect on some children. In my opinion, the benefits of holding therapy could be obtained by less stressful methods. I cringed when I watched the BBC show The Visit and I am glad I did not have to endure forced holding. Fisher (1989) describes a gentler approach to holding that worked with her daughter.  I should note that Temple Grandin is one of the few people on the spectrum who still sees autism as a disorder that needs to be defeated through various means, including drugs. Proponents of Holding Therapy contend that it forges a bond between mother and child. But there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support this assertion. As I noted, my own hypothesis is that it works as a kind of aversive, i.e. the child is forced to act more in accordance with expectations in order to avoid further hugging. This will probably appear to work well with children such as Steve's daughter, who have the skills necessary to pretend to be NT (which, BTW, requires considerable energy expenditure). With children who are simply incapable of emulating expected behavior, I'm thinking forceful hugging could easily lead to PTSD. I have learned that Donna Williams has criticized Holding/Hug Therapy in her book  Autism - An Inside-Out Approach  on much the same grounds.  Don't get me wrong. I do think it is advisable to hug children as much as possible. I not only hug my son constantly. I tell him how special and unique he is. I just wouldn't recommend hugging children against their will, and particularly not until they are screaming with pain. Further Issues I have some problems with what Steve has to say. For example, at one point he says something like \"she was bad, bad bad... now she's bad, but in a good way if you know what I mean.\" I'm not sure if he realizes this insults all autistics, including my son and myself. He's basically saying \"autistics are bad, bad, bad, and in a bad way.\" He has also implied that autistics don't get excited and so on - perpetuating estereotypes that should not exist anymore. Steve doesn't like the word \"neurotypical\" and prefers to speak plainly by using the word \"normal\". I wonder if he thinks his daughter's development and reaction to psychological stress was \"abnormal\", and whether he thinks it will never be \"abnormal\" again. I'd obviously prefer if Steve did not imply that my son or myself are \"abnormal\".\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismhysteria.blogspot.com", "http://www.option.org/srtmc/ch00a.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11109576&query_hl=12&itool=pubmed_docsum", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&a=2179"], "link": "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/02/autism-hysteria-unusual-recovery.html", "title": "\nAutism Hysteria - An Unusual \"Recovery\" Anecdote\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 23, 2006", "body": "\nI'll start this blog with some criticism of the hypothesis that mercury poisoning is responsible for autism across the board. Some parents who propose this hypothesis appear to be quite belligerent and eager to demonstrate their hate for autism and autistics (see hatingautism.blogspot.com). Anyone who disagrees is labeled \"mercury poisoned\" as well, and presumed to be inferior (just as I can only assume they see their own children). Disagreements are thus explained away as a lack of reasoning skills. As appalling as this is, it is not the basis of my criticism. I could analyze in detail the studies that demonstrate a link and those that don't, comparing their methodology. But this has been done [ ref ][ ref ][ ref ]. What I intend to do is point out a number of well known facts about autism and mercury toxicity which are totally inconsistent with the hypothesis. At the very least, there are no mercury toxicity-based theories that attempt to explain them. There's no mechanism by which mercury could cause savant skills to emerge. The most severe symptoms of mercury poisoning include such things as kidney damage, burning mouth, and perspiration. These are not symptoms of autism, even in a minority of cases. Mercury poisoning cannot account for neuroanatomical differences observed in early childhood, such as white and grey matter volume differences, increased head circumference, and differences in neuron size and density. Mercury poisoning cannot account for increased false memory discrimination, information processing advantages, and other cognitive differences that have been documented. It has been hypothesized that autistic children have a genetic liability in their body's mercury metabolism, having to do with the APO-E4 protein. This, however, would mean that a good portion of the siblings and parents of autistic children who had been themselves vaccinated with thimerosal should also be autistic. This is not the case. In fact, twin and sibling studies suggest that a single genetic variation is not sufficient to cause autism. Additionally, several different alleles have been linked to autism, and these are prevalent in the general population. None of the alleles that have come up in genome-wide scans are related to mercury disposal in any way.  Objectively diagnosable conditions which look like autism have a purely genetic etiology. These include Fragile-X, Tuberous Sclerosis, and Rett Syndrome. There are no reports of adult autistics running to get chelated, and some of them are OK with their autism, which would seem to be a strange way to experience being poisoned. This, of course, does not mean that the symptoms of autism couldn't be amplified by a small amount of mercury poisoning, or that some diagnosed cases may be caused by mercury poisoning. But it is unethical and scientifically ludicrous to say that autism and mercury poisoning are the same thing. It is also silly to suggest that chelation is an autism treatment, as it does nothing other than treat heavy metal toxicity.
