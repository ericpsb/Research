{"date": "July 1, 2014", "body": "It\u2019s a warm and beautiful evening and my daughter\u2019s whole body displays her efforts to navigate the day. She\u2019s rocking the Medusa-meets-Afro Puffs look, her hair is uneven due to the fact that she pulls it out when she\u2019s upset. There are large dark circles under her eyes \u2013 attributed to allergies or the fact that she\u2019s had trouble sleeping the past several nights. She has hiked her pants up Steve Urkel style \u2013 she\u2019s never quite comfortable \u2013 and wiped them down in ketchup, popsicle juice, cheese curls. Her darkened arms still healing from the last round of self-biting, her hands still stained green from the marker she colored with at 3 am. Her eyelids are heavy now, the sleep med I gave her beginning to take effect. I\u2019ve stared at her nearly every day for ten years and I still can\u2019t take my eyes off her. A week ago we had escaped to a quiet room during church. She scribbled all over her paper and then wrote  U\u2764 I . Before she could scribble over it, I grabbed the paper and held it to my heart. Later when I eagerly showed it to Hope she casually said, \u201cOh I write that all the time when I color with Rhema. She did it independently, huh?\u201d Indeed it was exciting that she mimicked Hope, but the air wheezed slowly out of my balloon. I reminded myself that these things, most things, for Rhema only come after long periods of focused effort and repetition. And the breakthroughs \u2013 as sweet and earth-shattering as they as are \u2013 can be here today, gone tomorrow, if not continuously practiced and reinforced.  U\u2764 I . Symbols on a page, not yet meaningful. I walk her through the bedtime routine. As I do every night I say her verse, Romans 10:8,9 \u2013\u00a0 The Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\u2026  If I push her, get in her face, hold her hands and say \u201cnight night\u201d several times she will eventually repeat the words. But at the end of the day I don\u2019t want to put any more demands on her. We have made peace with the silence. I tell her goodnight, she glances in my direction and says clearly, intentionally, \u201cNigh nigh.\u201d There\u2019s a hush as if the whole world stops to listen. Tomorrow I will go back to wondering about how she thinks and feels about everything she experiences and what she understands, but tonight she will give me words and help me understand. \u201cLove you.\u201d \u201cLo ew.\u201d \u201cLove you.\u201d \u201cLo ew.\u201d \u201cThank you, Rhema.\u201d She pulls the covers over her head. And I stand there for a long time at her window as the last sun fades like a great symphony quieting down, so beautiful you never forget the sound. By day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life. ~Psalm 42:8 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/heart1.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/u-3-i/", "title": "U heart I"},
{"date": "November 12, 2014", "body": "I used to ask Hope how her day was or how her dinner tasted she would very enthusiastically spell her response: \u201cG-O-D!\u201d I\u2019d laugh and tell her she forgot an O. But no matter how often I corrected her, she\u2019d always forget the extra O. So it became a thing, her response now is always G-O-D. I am reminded of how important it is to tell the story of God\u2019s goodness to my children. To anyone who will listen, really. In my Bible class we\u2019ve been studying the books of Joshua and Judges. It\u2019s a hard journey, but there are miracles galore from the waters parting to time standing still to great battles won. Then, just a bit of time passes and, \u201c\u2026another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the Lord or remember the mighty things he had done\u2026\u201d (Judges 2:10) Recently one of Rhema\u2019s teacher wrote on the Facebook page that she is thankful to enjoy the gift of Rhema every day. You can imagine how it touched my heart. And I thought, were it not for autism, we would never have known the beautiful and creative teachers who love and give and teach and sacrifice day after day for her/us, and then say it\u2019s their joy to do it. So good. For me, I hope I will be found  naming the good . Seeing it, digging for it, no matter. Because these two little girls? There\u2019s so much good to tell. I don\u2019t want them to forget.  I  don\u2019t want to forget. In Judges, the prophetess Deborah sings a victory song to remember. My girl Cha says I got skillz (haha), so I wrote a rap to remember. And it goes something like this. Hey yo. It\u2019s Jeneilly J \nGot a lil\u2019 song, got somethin\u2019 to say Had my fly guy, sweet babe of mine \nIt was goin\u2019 great, yeah life was a shine \nSuddenly the world lost focus \nMy precious girl got the diagnosis \nFaith and dreams and hearts were broken \nTrials and tears and words unspoken The pain and sad, yo, I was feelin\u2019 it \nBut hold up wait a minute \nHe be using that girl to teach my spirit \nChillin\u2019 it, willin\u2019 it, fillin\u2019 it, heart-healin\u2019 it.

{"date": "February 12, 2015", "body": "Mothering Rhema causes me to hold tightly to small moments. Things that may seem inconsequential at first blush I treasure and think on long after the moment has passed. There\u2019s this thing she does when she\u2019s gone on ahead of me\u2026 or Brandon is taking her to school or she\u2019s being called out of a room. She stops and looks back for me. And since words are not at her disposal, she comes and takes my hand. There was a time I wanted her to demonstrate that she set me apart as her momma. I know she did, but she did not show it in a way that I understood. No calling my name. No trouble separating from me. No greeting when I picked her up after a day at school, no change of expression on her face. No running to me when she skinned her knee. It\u2019s been ten years in the making, but now she looks back for me. \u201c C\u2019mon, Mommy.\u201d That\u2019s what my heart hears. I am thrilled that she wants me to go and a little scared, too, in the way that special needs moms get scared. Because it\u2019s me she needs. She needs me! I want her to know she always has me. That my hand will be there when she reaches. I caught a snippet of Beyonce singing \u201cTake My Hand, Precious Lord\u201d at the Grammys the other night. I grew up listening to my mother sing that song with visions in my head of a weary Rosa Parks getting on that bus. And old Mother Whatley used to sing it in church with more heart than Beyonce ever could, in my humble opinion. But it reminded me of the need for the abiding presence of God in our every moment. I confess I am helpless without Him. I need His hand to hold me, His voice to guide me, His grace to heal me. Even still I am \u201cprone to wander, prone to leave the God I love\u2026\u201d without so much as a look back. But He never fails. He waits for us to return, to set Him apart as Father truly. To say, I will go, but only if you go with me. \u00a0 So teach my song to rise to You \nWhen temptation comes my way \nAnd when I cannot stand I\u2019ll fall on You \nJesus, You\u2019re my hope and stay \nLord, I need You, oh, I need You \nEvery hour I need You \nMy one defense, my righteousness \nOh God, how I need You \n~\u201dLord, I Need You\u201d Matt Maher ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/socksandals.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/go-with-me/", "title": "Go with me"},
{"date": "January 26, 2015", "body": "For us, autism means that life is a series of workarounds. The grandparents are in town and we wanted to take them to the Museum of Science. It\u2019s one of Hope\u2019s favorite places\u2026 and something akin to torture for Rhema. I suppose leaving Rhema home with a sitter was an option but it\u2019s not one she or I could stomach. I never want her to feel that she\u2019s been left behind. So we took the train because Rhema  and  Hope love the train. We split up at North Station in the middle of a snowstorm: Brandon, Hope and the grandparents went to the museum and Rhema and I went off in search of the best chicken lo mein and cookies in the city. I was happy to spend the day holding her hand on a\u00a0snowy adventure, just the two of us. One thing I know about my girl: she\u2019s not so interested in the destination but she very much enjoys the  going,  the process of getting there, wherever there is. (So it goes with opening presents. I was thrilled when she finally got into unwrapping gifts. Nowadays she\u2019s happy to rip off the paper, but once that\u2019s done the thrill is gone. She tosses the gift aside without so much as a glance!) We settled on a food court in a small mall and ordered her favorite chicken lo mein. I was contentedly watching her eat when she reached into my bag, brought out her iPad and tapped the \u201cI want\u201d symbol and then the \u201cketchup\u201d symbol. \u201cI want ketchup.\u201d So simple. So earth shaking. Of course! Of course she wants ketchup. My girl wants ketchup! I cannot put into words how powerful it is when she communicates with me in this way. I want to leap and dance and kiss her face and trip over myself to get her what she wants.  Just because she asked. I grabbed her hand and we went over to McDonalds and asked the kid at the counter\u00a0for\u00a0ketchup. And he did. He gave us\u00a0ten ketchup packets.\u00a0Just because she asked. After the ketchup-with-a-little-lo-mein lunch, we trudged through snow and ice to get to a Boston bakery selling Deflate-gate football cookies. We waited in a long line only to discover that they had sold out of the cookies making fun of the deflated football scandal. We got some Patriots jersey cookie instead. Of which I ate two. To show my support. Yeah. Then we rode the subway to the end of the line and back. I think she would have been content doing that all afternoon, rocking in her seat and humming softly. We caught the train home and as glorious creation sped by and we stared at icy rain on the windows I got to remind myself of this:  \u201cWhich of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?  If you then, imperfect as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him!\u201d And this, something  Brandon once wrote  when he was deployed to Iraq and wanted more than anything just to be able to take Rhema swimming:  \u201c I\u2019m\u00a0comforted because I know with all that this life has for us in terms\u00a0of challenges or desires or whatever, I WANT Rhema to go swimming\u2026 as her father, I WANT nothing more than to take her myself.\u00a0Our heavenly Father sees us looking through the window at life,\u00a0and WANTS good things for us.\u00a0Just like I see Rhema looking and innocently desiring to jump in that water, so too He watches us\u00a0and CARES\u00a0about our desires.\u00a0I have to TRUST Him that He will give us what we need and, when it is\u00a0good for us,\u00a0He truly wants us to have what\u00a0we desire.\u201d And this:  \u201cNow to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think\u2026\u201d Eph. 3:20 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2720.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2722.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_0496.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/because-she-asked/", "title": "Because she asked"},
{"date": "November 21, 2014", "body": "\u201cChurch is the one place where we should always feel love and accepted, yet it is one of the most intimidating places of all.\u201d \n~Jennifer J. Holt, Homelife Magazine, 2011 This past weekend I attended a Disability Ministry conference with two dear friends. The aim of the conference was to help churches learn practical ways to serve people and families with special needs. It was good to be in the company of others who shared a desire to see churches implement creative ways to reach special needs communities. I came away inspired, armed with notes and a new book (Autism and Your Church, by Barbara Newman), and my head swimming with ideas. I love this excerpt from the book: It was time in the worship service for the pastor to give the message. As the pastor began to speak, an individual started making noise in the back of the church. Without missing a beat the pastor calmly said, \u201cSome of you might be hearing my friend Marie. Marie\u2019s mom and dad have asked me to tell you that she has Autism Spectrum Disorder. Sometimes the tags in her clothes or a sound she hears really bother her. I appreciate that Marie is my cheering section today.\u201d A workshop I attended included a panel of 4 adults with special needs sharing about their involvement in church. This was the best part of the conference for me, and I found myself actually whispering prayers to God on their behalf (and Rhema, too) throughout. The panel was asked about positive experiences they\u2019ve had in church, and I noticed that each response had something to do with friendship. It was clear that  community  and the relationships they\u2019d formed in church were so significant to them. When the panel was asked about negative experiences in church, a young woman spoke about how she struggled with the music being too loud for her. She said it actually physically hurt, and she often experienced guilt over needing to leave. For years she thought it was her fault. (And at this point I wanted to put my arms around her). She said that now she understands that it\u2019s ok to leave the sanctuary if she needs to and she is learning not to\u00a0be so quick to blame herself. Another young woman, with a speech delay, also answered the question about her struggles in church. Each precious word she spoke took effort and I cannot ever forget what she said: \u201cThere\u2019s no other kind of me.\u201d I thought of my Rhema. In our church right now there is no other little girl like her. And I don\u2019t know all that she feels, but I know she enjoys being a part of things even if she\u2019s doing her own thing \u2013   that is her part.  And I\u2019ve no doubt she desires friends and meaningful relationships, as we all do, even though she may not show that longing in a way we might expect. Oh, how I pray that she will experience true friendship in her life. There\u2019s no other kind of me.  Sweet girl, it\u2019s a burden and it\u2019s a gift. Another question for the panel was, \u201cWhat can people in church do to make it more welcoming to people with disabilities?\u201d One answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t like to ask for things, we are not being picky, we are not expecting everything to be perfect. Just know that it\u2019s a big deal to ask for help.\u201d A young man with Asperger\u2019s said that he wanted people to know that he has what he has and is what he is forever, and that it\u2019s hard. As I listened, I was suddenly filled with an odd dream, a desperate prayer and an even bigger hope.  God, one day can my Rhema sit on a panel like this? Can we hear from her? \u2013 what she thinks and how she feels, the good and the hard, anything she wants to share. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s her own speaking voice or an automated voice or pictures on an iPad, please please help her find a way. Please just let me hear what\u2019s inside.  The panel did a great job, and I hope there will be many more conversations like it in many churches. An oft-referenced Bible passage is Luke 14 where Jesus instructs, \u201cBut when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Make them come in, so that my house will be full.\u201d The ones who require extra help, the ones who are too loud, the ones who don\u2019t speak, the ones who are lonely or bullied or overlooked, the ones who cannot seem to reciprocate \u2013 God says they will bring blessings! And they are to be given special honor. Do not let fear or your child\u2019s challenges (or your own challenges) deter you from finding a church home. I have found that many churches have a heart for the special needs community \u2013 from putting trampolines in Sunday school classrooms to setting up buddy programs to hosting \u201cMom\u2019s Morning Out\u201d for women who have children impacted by disability. Two years ago this happened: So there\u2019s another thing about church. We always sit in a small pew, in the second to last row, near the door so that we can make a fast getaway when the need arises. I think it can be overwhelming for Rhema still \u2013 all the people, the sights and sounds \u2013 but her seat, her pew, is predictable and comforting. In the past, if we\u2019ve arrived and people were already sitting in \u201cour\u201d pew, Rhema has attempted to sit  on  them. When we re-direct her to another pew, she\u2019s completely thrown. She\u2019s even cried. \n This morning before church, B and I had a brief conversation about where we\u2019d go if the pew was already occupied. We had a plan. \n But when we arrived at church we found this in our pew: \n (I \u201cwhited-out\u201d our last name for the blog). \n No one said anything to us about it. They just noticed our struggle on Sundays and wanted to make it easier. We often worry that we\u2019re disrupting the service. But that little sign spoke volumes to me \u2013 that we are loved as we are, that we belong, that we are family.* Ed Note:  If you are visiting a church for the first time, call the church office a week ahead and let them know about your particular needs.

{"date": "January 23, 2015", "body": "Life has been full, good, busy and unexpected and I did not mean to\u00a0be away from here so long. Many times I\u2019ve sat down\u00a0to blog and only stared at a blank screen wondering where to begin. So I\u2019ll just start small and share a little update on the family. Brandon will officially retire from the Army next week! I met him almost 20 years ago and I\u2019ve only always known him as a soldier. This is a big change for us, but a welcome one. He already has a new job lined up with a great company, and we are excited for this next chapter. Thinking back over the past years, gosh, we\u2019ve had some hard times (and 3 deployments added for good measure),\u00a0but somehow the whole thing\u2019s been covered in grace. Like God took one of Rhema\u2019s markers and colored his goodness all over our ugly, restoring to us things and years we thought we lost. The girls are doing so well. Hope continues to amaze me with her devotion to Rhema. It seems that from a small age, all on her own, she decided to be her sister\u2019s best friend. She\u2019s made it her aim and pleasure to love, protect and cheer her sister. Recently Rhema became overwhelmed when we were dining out at a restaurant with extended family. Much to my dismay she scratched/hit Hope who was sitting next to her. Later Hope showed me the mark on her arm and we talked about what happened. Mainly I just listened in wonder as Hope explained to me that sometimes Rhema gets so overwhelmed\u00a0she just doesn\u2019t know what to do. I asked her how she felt when Rhema got upset\u00a0in the restaurant\u00a0and she said, \u201cI just kept trying and trying to think about what could be bothering her so I could help, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201d The next day Hope told me that she and Dana gave Rhema the opportunity to say she was sorry. \u201cBut she was too happy,\u201d Hope reported. \u201cRhema just kept giggling! So Dana suggested that Rhema give me a kiss on my arm.\u201d So with a little help Rhema kissed (nuzzled) Hope. That was it, case closed. And Hope laughed at the whole thing because she takes Rhema just as she is and loves her whole. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Rhema\u2019s voice. How I listen for it, like a hound dog with perked-up ears. According to the speech evaluations she presents with a \u201climited phonemic repertoire\u201d, and is currently working hard to learn to produce letter sounds. Her voice is beautiful and rare and every sound is precious because it comes from her lips. My Bible study reading in 1 Samuel this week said when the word of the Lord was rare in those days Samuel prayed, \u201cSpeak, Lord, for your servant hears.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think of Rhema and how I wait to hear her, how her \u201cBye\u201d in the morning as I drop her off at school doesn\u2019t come easy but when it comes it makes my day. So too, my soul longs to hear God. I know that just one word can breathe new life into me. \u201cSpeak, Lord; for Your servant hears. I have prayed to You, I have told You my grief and now I am just sitting still to hear\u2026 I am all ears and all heart. If You will command me, I will obey. If You will comfort me, I will believe. If You will reprove me, I will meekly bow my head. If You will give me the assurance of Your love, my heart shall dance at every sound of Your voice. Only speak, Lord; for Your servant hears.\u201d \u00a0 ~Charles Spurgeon I tiptoed into their rooms, prayed for them quietly and\u00a0said \u201cI love you.\u201d And I heard it. All this time, all along He\u2019s been whispering love.

Sometimes we go to the store or McDonalds, but\u00a0mostly we just drive, with the music of a lullaby CD softly playing. She stares out the window and I get to tell her many things. \u201cRhema, When you were a baby I was baffled by the fact that you did not sleep. I thought that babies slept, and you simply did not. You were colicky and seemed uncomfortable in your own skin. And just as you would finally start to fall asleep, spasms would shake your body. Even when swaddled, you would shake. I was a clueless, new mommy. I read books for advice. I tried home remedies and supplements. Nothing seemed to work, and you would scream all night long. The on-call nurse always brushed it off as colic and suggested I try the things I had already tried. Daddy was in Iraq then \u2013at the height of the war \u2013 and we lived in Germany. There were so many long, sleepless nights, that I really thought I might go crazy! I felt very alone. There was a TV program that came on from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.\u00a0 It was simply Bible verses set to instrumental music and nature scenes. Sometimes the crying (yours and mine) drowned out the music, but I would read and whisper the verses. One night these words came on the TV and went into my heart: For He has said, \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u201d So that we may boldly say, The Lord  is  my helper, and I will not fear\u2026 ~Heb. 13:5,6 Sweet girl, you and I are such a team. I can\u2019t always physically be with you. And sometimes I fret about you not getting everything you need if I\u2019m not there to translate, to be your hands, to make it so. That\u2019s just a Mommy thing. Listen close, my dear. You\u2019ve heard this before but let\u00a0it be\u00a0my unending ode to you and to Hope.

I hear the refrigerator door open and slam against the wall. Seconds later I hear the contents of the refrigerator being dropped on the floor as she rummages for something to eat. Next the dishwasher door is opened as she searches for the biggest spoon she can find. I envision her carrying a bowl of rice to the kitchen table. Then I hear a crash and \u201c Uh-oh \u201d, and I know it\u2019s time to intervene. (But first I make a happy mental note that she said Uh-oh spontaneously and appropriately, before I groan and go to clean the mess.) There was the time she microwaved popcorn that was already popped. There was the time she poured herself a glass of vegetable oil (she thought it was apple juice). There was the time she wanted a popsicle and jumped into the chest-deep freezer. (I was standing right there and couldn\u2019t believe she managed to climb in so quickly. The next day we put 2 safety locks on the big freezer, the refrigerator and oven). But, gosh I love that she means well. She\u2019s not always easy to teach, but when she gets something,  she gets it . And I think she\u2019s proud of herself. When she learned how to buckle herself into her seat, no carseat or baby\u2019s high chair was off limits. A few months ago, she and I were in the church parking lot and I stopped to chat with a friend who was sitting in her car. While we were talking, Rhema happily climbed into the open minivan next to us (not ours) and buckled herself into some little kid\u2019s car seat. There she sat contentedly, swinging her legs, ready to go, so pleased with herself. Take the picture in the header on this blog. This kid does NOT like socks and shoes. If she had her way, she\u2019d go barefoot all the time. Oh, the battles we had trying to get her to keep her socks and shoes (and pants) on at school. We tried turning her socks inside out so the seams wouldn\u2019t bother her. We tried different types of shoes (I was spending a fortune). One day\u00a0it finally clicked that she had to wear shoes in public, and now she is very intentional about putting them on. I snapped the picture above with my cell phone when she was in the hospital a few months ago. A nurse brought her the bright yellow hospital socks. Rhema dutifully put them on, found her sandals and put them on the wrong feet. Quite satisfied. To me, the picture is the essence of\u00a0her \u2013 trying so hard to learn. Trying so hard to do what\u2019s right. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/miss-independent-means-well/", "title": "Miss Independent Means\u00a0Well"},
{"date": "December 4, 2008", "body": "Months before her first birthday we learned that Hope had  severe allergies  to nuts, eggs, dairy, wheat and soy. Such allergies eliminate the possibility for a normal birthday cake. \u201cBut every one year-old I know always gets to eat cake on their birthday. It\u2019s tradition!\u201d I whined. So I embarked on a mission to find Hope a birthday cake. I contacted a gluten-free bakery in Boston and ordered a gluten-free cake. Then later it occurred to me that the bakery advertised buttercream frosting. Uh oh.\u00a0(I was still learning to think in terms of what Hope could and could not eat).\u00a0 So I called back. \u201cHi. I ordered a gluten free cake for my daughter. But she cannot have buttercream frosting because she has a dairy allergy.\u201d \u201cO.K. No problem. We\u2019ll use rice milk\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was jovial. Then suddenly I was on a roll. \u201cOh! And she\u2019s extremely allergic to nuts\u2026 so can you clean down all of your baking surfaces? \u201cUm yeah.\u201d Not as jovial. \u201cAnd of course I would need you to use organic vanilla and no food coloring in the frosting.\u201d \u201cO.K.\u201d \u201cOh! And no soy flour, please \u2013 she\u2019s allergic. It must be rice flour.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d The woman seemed ready to get off the phone, so we hung up. Then I remembered. I called back and said, \u201cI almost forgot! And NO EGGS!\u201d I think that was the first time someone ever told me that they didn\u2019t want my business. Finding a cake for Hope became an afternoon obsession. I finally found a baker in New Hampshire who would make Hope a cake. I think the cake cost more than our wedding cake. On the morning of her birthday, Brandon drove to NH to pick up the cake. (New Hampshire is not that far away, but it sounds romantic to say that we traveled to another state for Hope\u2019s birthday cake). A small gathering of family and friends waited at the house. When he heroically arrived with Hope\u2019s cake, I proudly announced, \n\u201cHere\u2019s Hope\u2019s gluten-free, casein-free, dye-free, nut-free, egg-free, soy-free birthday cake!\u201d \u201cOtherwise known as sawdust,\u201d muttered the husband. The cake was served. To say that it tasted awful is an understatement. People\u2019s faces changed colors. Kids spit it out. Hope would not touch it, her senses were thoroughly offended. My father commented that it tasted like a \u201cgood kind of sand.\u201d My sister waxed philosophically about the definition of cake. Is a cake with no eggs and flour really a cake? This year all Hope wants for her birthday is \u201chappy birthday cake.\u201d She recently saw episodes of Sid the Science Kid and Sesame Street in which the topic was birthday cake. (On today\u2019s episode, Elmo literally talks to a birthday cake.\u00a0 Of course.) Her birthday cake is all\u00a0Hope talks about. So this year, (her b-day is tomorrow) I\u2019m trying to make her birthday cake  myself .\u00a0\u00a0 What a joke. (Most of the gluten-free cake mixes call for eggs and the egg-free, dairy-free mixes have gluten).\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty hilarious. I am so not creative.

D has not been around Rhema much because Rhema is always at school during D\u2019s all-day stay at the infusion center. This past week, however, I needed to get D to the center first and then drive Rhema to school. As we drove into Boston, Rhema made her usual \u201cnoises\u201d in the car. I don\u2019t quite know how to describe her noises, but it\u2019s a mixed bag of hums, high and low-pitched vocalizations and sing-songy babbling, sometimes urgent in tone, sometimes relaxed. We have grown so used to her \u201cnoises\u201d that I am not even aware of them most of the time. Only when we\u2019re out in public or in a quiet place, do I realize that her sounds may seem strange to others. It was early in the morning and D was tired, so we drove along in silence except for the sounds of Rhema\u2026 \u201cShe said Mom.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d I looked over at D. \u201cShe\u2019s saying Mom.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d I said patronizingly while thinking  No, she\u2019s not. But whatever. Moments passed. D raised up a little in her seat (which was an effort for her) and leaned toward me. \u201cAnswer her.\u201d \u201cOh, O.K\u2026. Um\u2026 Yes, Rhema?\u201d Rhema, without missing a beat, continued to gaze out the window and make her happy little noises. Was she saying Mom? No. I didn\u2019t hear Mom. Besides if she were going to say it, she would say Mommy or Mama. Not Mom. I never go by Mom. People are always telling me what they think Rhema is saying. But if they knew her like I knew her they would know that she\u2019s not saying anything\u2026 But are you listening? It hit me like a ton of bricks.  Oh Lord, did I stop listening? When did I stop expecting to hear words? Could it be possible, remotely possible, that my baby has been calling my name and I have not been listening? Just in case. Just in case. I\u2019ve tuned my ears. I\u2019ve got my answer ready:  Yes, Rhema! I am listening.  In fact, I\u2019m answering her (stooping, looking in her eyes) whether she\u2019s calling me or not. (I remember being taught to assume she\u2019s saying something even when/if she\u2019s not. To answer her as if she is speaking, and in so doing, model and reinforce language). It reminds me of the \u201cDo It Anyway\u201d mantra of Mother Teresa:  The good you do today, will often be forgotten. Do good anyway. Give the best you have, and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway. On the flip side, Rhema may be \u201cdoing it anyway\u201d for me.  My mother is not going to answer me, but I\u2019m going to keep calling anyway\u2026 My thoughts are drawn to a loving and long-suffering God who does it anyway. He calls out to us to know Him, to seek Him, to trust Him with our lives and receive salvation. In the busyness and the striving and the hoping and the hurting, He is calling. Waiting for us to hear. Waiting for us to answer\u2026 Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;  I have called you by name , you are mine.

How about this country or that \u2013 how cool! Let\u2019s go where the weather is warm, where we can travel\u2026 Now our moving decisions come down to a few questions: How are the schools \u2013 are there any for children with low-functioning autism? What are the state laws like regarding special needs?  How is the medical care? Are there good, cutting-edge doctors? The not-knowing can be torturous for the control-freak mama.  I\u2019m the control freak and my husband is the planner-fixer.  I realized recently how much Brandon thinks about what will come \u2013 what may come \u2013 when he sat across from me at Olive Garden.

We used to be Invictus personified, he and I.  We were the captains of our ship, the masters of our fate.

{"date": "January 18, 2009", "body": "As a child, I believed that there were only three people in the world who had never sinned. My daddy, Jesus, and Martin Luther King, Jr. (Well, there was a 4th person \u2013 our pastor at the time, Reverend Johnson. But one day he yelled really loud during a Sunday sermon and I had to take him off my sin-less list). \u00a0 Her name was Heather. She was in my kindergarten class. I was absolutely enthralled with her long red hair and the smattering of freckles across her nose. I wanted her to be my friend very badly. Our teacher would always pick two children to lead the line to the bathroom and to recess. One day, Miss Martha picked Heather to lead the line. And then, to my delight, she picked me as well. I figured Miss Martha just knew Heather and I would make very good friends. I rushed to the front of the line and eagerly reached for Heather\u2019s hand. But she protested and quickly hid her hand behind her back. Miss Martha waited a moment as I held out my hand to Heather again. \u201cHeather,\u201d she said. \u201cTake your partner\u2019s hand.\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d said Heather. \u201cI will  not  hold a colored girl\u2019s hand.\u201d (It was 1980, but she still used the word \u201ccolored\u201d). \nMiss Martha tried talking with Heather a little bit, but she refused to hold my hand, and eventually a new partner was found for Heather. I need not detail the shame and humiliation I felt as I slid to a new spot in line. That was the day I realized that I was Black. I remember crying to my mother that evening as I recounted the story. I remember her wise, comforting words. She taught my sisters and I about  sense of self , about our identities as \u201cyoung ladies\u201d of color, but most importantly, about our identity as children of the Most High God. At that age, I learned to be proud because I was my Mommy\u2019s girl, God\u2019s daughter, and the same color as Martin Luther King, Jr. During\u00a0my junior high and high school years, I would recite the entire \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech at the annual MLK program in my parent\u2019s church. I had it memorized word for word (and it\u2019s not short), and I would perform the speech with dramatic passion. I was moved by his eloquence; his words sank into my soul. One year in college, my mother sent me a tape that contained recordings of some of King\u2019s lesser-known speeches and sermons. It was eye-opening for me to hear him preach a \u201cregular\u201d sermon in a regular church. This week I suspect that \u201cKing\u201d and \u201cObama\u201d are going to\u00a0show\u00a0up\u00a0in the same sentence quite often. I don\u2019t necessarily see the two men as similar. Although many regard King as a secular, political figure, he was first a preacher. In listening to the old recordings that my mother sent, I discovered that behind the image of this great historical figure, there was a man who simply had a heart for the things of God. He was a man who doubted, who got tired and discouraged in the face of indescribable adversity (- jailed over 18 times, nearly stabbed to death, his house bombed 3 times). But he always came back to trusting in His Lord and standing in courage on his faith. And God used Him mightily. There are portions of\u00a0his sermons that continue to speak to me in the midst of my own journey. There was his unforgettable  Funtown  sermon (I was unable to find the text online), where he, the great orator, struggles to find the words to explain to his 6 year-old little girl that she cannot go to the amusement park because she is Black. There is his illustration of Psalm 30:5 and demonstration of God moving on their behalf during the Montgomery bus boycott in\u00a0\u201c A Knock At Midnight .\u201d (You really should read the last several paragraphs of this sermon).\u00a0 There is his final exhortation in the sermon \u201c Unfulfilled Dreams \u201c: Oh this morning, if I can leave anything with you, let me urge you to be sure that you have a strong boat of faith. The winds are going to blow. (Yes) The storms of disappointment are coming. (Yes) The agonies and the anguishes of life are coming. (Yes, sir) And be sure that your boat is strong, and also be very sure that you have an anchor. (Amen) In times like these, you need an anchor. And be very sure that your anchor holds. (Yes, Glory to God)  It will be dark sometimes, and it will be dismal and trying, and tribulations will come. But if you have faith in the God that I\u2019m talking about this morning, it doesn\u2019t matter. (Yes) For you can stand up amid the storms. And I say it to you out of experience this morning, yes, I\u2019ve seen the lightning flash. (Yes, sir) I\u2019ve heard the thunder roll. (Yes) I\u2019ve felt sin-breakers dashing, trying to conquer my soul. But I heard the voice of Jesus, saying still to fight on. He promised never to leave me, (Yes, sir) never to leave me alone. (Thank you, Jesus) No, never alone. No, never alone. He promised never to leave me. Never to leave me alone. (Glory to God) And when you get this faith, you can walk with your feet solid to the ground and your head to the air, and you fear no man. (Go ahead) And you fear nothing that comes before you. (Yes, sir) Because you know that God is even in Crete. (Amen) If you ascend to the heavens, God is there. If you descend to hell, God is even there. If you take the wings of the morning and fly out to the uttermost parts of the sea, even God is there. Everywhere we turn we find him. We can never escape him.

{"date": "January 9, 2009", "body": "\u00a0 Reflections by Lee Teter \u00a0 When I began this blog, I intended it to be a therapeutic outlet for me.  \u00a0 I also hoped to be an encouragement to \u201cnew\u201d autism moms. \u00a0  I think back to a couple years ago, and I felt devastated and alone. \u00a0  I remember saying to my mom \u201cIf it\u2019s 1 in 150, where are all the other 1 in 150\u2019s? \u00a0  I\u2019m the only autism mom I know!\u201d\u00a0 I hoped to share some of the lessons I\u2019d learned (and am still learning). What I did not foresee was how God intended to bless my socks off with the wonderful friendships and relationships that developed as a result of my \u201coutlet.\u201d\u00a0 THANK YOU. In this space I have found mothers who understand how important relationship is. We share how we  long  for the  communication  that fosters relationship between two people. Some time ago, Rhema was doing  Tomatis listening therapy . She was receiving auditory stimulation by listening to Mozart and Gregorian chant at high frequencies through headphones. The idea was to improve auditory processing by re-training her hearing mechanism to receive and tolerate a full spectrum of sound. During the listening therapy, she was receiving speech and occupational therapy (\u2013 yes, we had to wrap bands around her head in order to keep the headphones on.) At the time, a therapist explained that at the precise moment when Rhema was receiving appropriate sensory input (through OT) and increased auditory processing through the listening therapy\u2026 over time, we might see some expressive language or social interaction. It seemed like we were drilling a small hole through a thick wall in which some form of communication\u00a0might slip through. I remember thinking, that\u2019s a heck of a lot of work for one little word from Rhema. But that\u2019s what we do. We work at it, we pray for it, we fight for it. We want our children to know and be known. Never far from my mind is God\u2019s very desire to have  relationship  with us. \u00a0  It\u2019s a recurring  theme  on this blog, but I believe He is saying, now you have an inkling of how much I long to communicate with you.\u00a0 I\u2019m amazed at the lengths He will go to be known by us.\u00a0 The book of Hosea is a poignant allegory of God\u2019s efforts to pursue relationship with us. To illustrate His unrelenting love for the people of Israel (and by extension, us) God instructs Hosea the prophet to marry a prostitute named Gomer. Hosea loves, protects and cares for her. But Gomer is repeatedly unfaithful to him; she leaves him and returns to her former life. God instructs the prophet to pursue and woo her again, and bring her back to home. God says to Hosea, \u201cGo again and love this woman.\u201d The story reveals God\u2019s initiating,\u00a0persistent love for us, His commitment to reconciliation with us, His passion just to have relationship with us. Again and again and again. As I strive to knock down the wall of separation that autism has imposed between my daughter and me, I think of the powerful painting above. This is said to be a portrait of deceased soldiers reaching out in consolation to a grieving comrade. In the same way, I believe God is yearning to reach out to you.\u00a0me. us. The good news is that we don\u2019t have to do, do, do, do to have relationship with Jesus. He has already done the work. As my friend  Sumi  writes, we just have to be willing and available to  be  with Him.  The walls are down. Here I am. What do you want me to know about You? This year I\u2019m excited about relationships \u2013 with family, friends, and God Himself. My relationship with my autistic daughter is growing sweeter by the day. It took a while, but I am finding ways to relate to her, and connect with her, and truly enjoy her. \u201cFor he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us\u2026\u201d Eph 2:14 *If you are struggling to believe, click  here  for a beautiful story of  Faith In the Face of Autism .

{"date": "January 12, 2009", "body": "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then  face  to  face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 1 Cor 13:12 This\u00a0photo has entranced us. On Christmas day, Rhema\u2019s grandmother snapped this picture of\u00a0Rhema and her Uncle Ben. I cannot quite explain it, but it\u2019s a picture of a Rhema we rarely see. For a brief moment, I fancied that this is what she would look like without the autism. People often refer to autism as the invisible disability. The physical appearance of a child with ASD is usually no different than any other child. Certainly, at first glance, there is nothing about Rhema that screams \u201cdisability.\u201d Friendly people in the grocery store (or wherever) seem naturally drawn to her. They make conversation with her \u2013 \u201cOh, what pretty pink boots you have!\u201d, \u201cAre you helping Mom shop today?\u201d, \u201cAre those cookies for you?\u201d When she fails to look at them or respond, I usually explain about her autism and the fact that she has trouble communicating. But to the experienced eye, sometimes autism has a \u201clook.\u201d For Rhema, it\u2019s a faraway look \u2013 her big brown eyes set in a pale face, with dark circles underneath. The picture below was taken less than a year ago (-she\u2019s come so far since then).\u00a0 (Imagine me kneeling in front of her, slightly to the right, calling her name over and over. She does not, cannot look at me directly.) I know I\u2019m not alone when I say this: we have been trying to get a  good  picture of her for years. To capture a moment on film when she is \n1) actually looking up,  making eye contact \n2) still \n3) smiling \nShe smiles and giggles at her own private jokes. But so rarely do we get an \u201cengaging smile.\u201d \u00a0 After cropping and zooming the picture every which way, it dawned on me that this is not a\u00a0snapshot about autism, with or without. It\u2019s just my Rhema. Finally. There she is. And for once I get to gaze \u2013 as I long as I want \u2013 into those beautiful eyes.\u00a0 She\u2019s looking at me and smiling back at me.\u00a0 She\u2019s telling me with her eyes what she cannot yet\u00a0express with words.\u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m happy, Mommy.

{"date": "August 6, 2009", "body": "Rhema was *great* during her EEG. It was unbelievably smooth, and I know that someone must have thought of us and prayed for us! I will write about her results soon. Rhema\u2019s doctor is one of the top pediatric neurologists in Boston. On Monday, before he arrived, a team of medical students and residents came to speak with us. First, they asked lots of questions of Brandon and me, getting Rhema\u2019s history from our perspective. (Rhema\u2019s seizure disorder \u2013 Landau Kleffner syndrome \u2013 is rare. You just don\u2019t see a case like hers everyday.) Then the resident examined Rhema while she sat in bed. These examinations are never easy \u2013 even something as simple as getting a temp or blood pressure on her is difficult because she gets scared. She wriggles, squirms and fights. The resident did manage the standard checks \u2013 he looked in her eyes with a flashlight, tested her reflexes. Some tests were unsuccessful because they required following directions and  understanding  the directions to begin with, such as \u2018raise your arms,\u2019 and \u2018deep breath in and out.\u2019 The resident stooped down to look her in the eyes (she was sitting on the bed). He raised two fingers and asked, \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d There was silence as Rhema looked all around, anywhere but the doctor\u2019s face. \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d He attempted to get her to look, waving his fingers in front of her, \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d No response. Switching gears, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Silence. Crickets chirped. \u201cWhat\u2019s your  name ??\u00a0What\u2019s your name?\u201d I could feel the heat in my face. I was starting to get angry, angry at him, angry at the whole situation. Hadn\u2019t this guy read her file? Didn\u2019t he know her medical history? Surely the word NONVERBAL was written somewhere in magic marker on her records, across her forehead? Wasn\u2019t it painfully obvious by now? The doctor spontaneously ripped off his watch and dangled it in front of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Rhema. What\u2019s this?\u201d Finally, I interjected. Surprisingly, my voice was soft: \u201cShe\u2019s not going to answer you.\u201d He slowly turned to us, \u201cWhat  does  she answer?\u201d I know he wanted to know for education\u2019s sake, for the benefit of the other medical professionals in the room. Brandon and I looked at each other. A flicker of deep longing and\u2026 loss\u2026 passed between us. Something I believe no one can understand unless, they, like us, would move heaven and earth, spend their last penny, and chop off their limbs\u2026 \njust to have one real, meaningful conversation with their child. It is what we  miss  most of all. What  does  she answer? His pen was ready to take notes on a blank page. \u201cNo\u2026 nothing.\u201d I stuttered, as if realizing it for the first time. He waited. He seemed to want us to scroll our memories, to come up with something. But we didn\u2019t have to try to remember.  Surely  we would remember. But there was, \u201cNothing.\u201d Later, after everyone had left and it was just Rhema and me, I nearly jumped off the sleeper chair when I remembered something. Rhema is nothing! Seriously. Rhema is nothing!!! I have been studying her name\u2019s meaning for a long time. Many who read this blog know that her name is translated from the Greek as \u201cthe spoken word\u201d (as opposed to  logos , which is \u201cthe written word\u201d). But there\u2019s another, lesser known meaning for rhema, and that is \u201cno word\u201d or \u201cno thing.\u201d Specifically, in Luke 1:37, when the angel is telling Mary that she will birth the Son of God, he says, \u201cFor with God  nothing  shall be impossible.\u201d \u2018Nothing\u2019 in the original translation is \u2018rhema.\u2019 She is the embodiment of that verse. I look at her, and I already see God doing the impossible. There are a LOT of discouraging times, but I tell you, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind God will continue doing the impossible in her. In that hospital room, and even now, I am prompted to open my fists and give all of my nothing to Him\u2026 \u201cto the God who gives life to the dead and creates  something   out of nothing. \u201d (Rom. 4:17)\u00a0 I give my  rhema  to the One, who with a Word, framed the worlds from nothingness and sustains it even now. (Heb. 1) \u00a0 Write our story, Lord, in your words. Take our nothing, and fill our blank pages with all of the impossibles You have made possible. \u00a0 *My friend Lianna sent a link to a beautiful post about  nothingness . Click  here .

{"date": "August 10, 2009", "body": "Lately, Rhema is into hiding things, namely, food. My mother-in-law was visiting from Michigan last week. She went to fix herself a nice, quiet cup of tea, but when she opened the teapot she found a Ziploc bag containing (what we think were) awfully smelly, blackened, fuzzy strawberries. No telling how long they\u2019d been there. Today I found the crusts of her $6.39 GFCF pizza (she only eats the soy cheese) in one of my books bags. When I served her tator tots this weekend, I watched her wrap the tots in a paper towel and stash them (in a perfect row, of course) in a desk/cabinet where we keep a phone. There I found a large family of old tator tots just waiting for others to join them. (Good sorting skills, I\u2019m thinking \u2013 putting the old tots with the new tots and  not  with the rotting strawberries in the teapot). Speaking of  hiding places , she\u2019s found a new one for herself. (Yes, we\u2019ve tried safety locks on the dryer, freezer, refrigerator and toilet. She\u2019s long since figured those out.) When she\u2019s not hiding in the dryer, she can be found in the bath tub. The girl is absolutely obsessed with bubbles baths lately. The only problem is as soon as I turn my back, she dumps the entire bottle into the tub. She.is. FAST. I have spent a small fortune in bubble bath and bath soap. Recently, I started hiding (seems to be a theme) the bottles of bubble bath. But Rhema, despearate for bubbles, will grab the nearest bottle of whatever and run upstairs, disrobe, jump in the tub, and dump the whole bottle in. To date, she has bathed in hand soap, vegetable oil (her favorite), Olay refreshing toner, baby oil, shampoo and glitter finger nail polish.

{"date": "August 8, 2009", "body": "I\u2019ve tried in vain to organize my thoughts over Rhema\u2019s test results from her hospital stay earlier this week. The good news is that her EEG came back clean. The not-so-good news is that the only medication that seems to stop Rhema\u2019s seizure-like activity is high-dose diazepam/valium. There is a risk that Rhema will become addicted to this drug with long term use. A little less than a year ago, a  very  high-dose diazepam protocol was given to Rhema in order to \u201crescue\u201d her from a pattern a continuous mini-seizures. The results were astounding \u2013 she went from a spike index of 85-100% to less than 2%. We were thrilled! Rhema during an EEG last September Because of its addictive properties, our neurologist did not want her to stay on the med long-term. We immediately began weaning her over several months. The hope was that the first bolus had shocked her brain out of the seizure pattern and that another anti-seizure med, Lamictal, (non-addicting) would maintain the seizure-free state. An EEG in June confirmed our fears that the seizure activity had indeed returned with a vengeance. She was put back on the diazepam, and now, several weeks later, her EEG is clean again. Over the past 3 years, we have tried many anti-epileptic meds to no effect. Her options: \n1) Diazepam long term \n2) Intensive steroid therapy \u2013 her dr. is very much against this \n3) A brain surgery called  MST \u00a0\u2013  definitely  a last resort Our \u201cchoice\u201d for now is clear: uncontrolled seizures or unknown reactions to the drug in the future. But the last thing we need is a child with symptoms of drug dependence, and my biggest fear is putting a 5-year old with autism through some horrible drug withdrawal down the road. (Not to mention, the diazepam makes her very h-y-p-e-r-a-c-t-i-v-e\u00a0 \u2013 as if we needed more of  that . Ugh!) How long term is long term? Nine months? A year? We don\u2019t know. But for now, her brain is quiet and she has a chance to really  learn  and perhaps even gain language. And for that I am grateful. But no matter how I spin this, I just can\u2019t seem to get settled on it. Maybe I\u2019m numb. Truly, I don\u2019t know what to think, how to feel. There is fear, worry, and hope\u2026 always hope. There is information overload from googling Landau Kleffner syndrome and diazepam\u00a0dependence all night long. There is the constant wondering if we\u2019re doing the right thing for her.

You may not  really  miss it, but because other people have it and you do not, you decide that maybe you miss it. My thing? A kiss. I miss. Or I think I should miss. (Don\u2019t get too excited! 8) ) I\u2019m talking about a kiss from my oldest daughter. Her oral motor coordination is still very poor; she cannot blow candles, bubbles, whistles\u2026 or those blowout thingies you get at birthday parties. She has never formed a pucker or given a kiss. She does not seem to\u00a0know how to show affection, so even if she could physically form a kiss, she would probably not do it. \u00a0 I had a dream once that they did a re-make of the movie \u201cNever Been Kissed\u201d \u2013 only it was \u201cNever Been Kissed By My Kid\u201d, and I played the lead part. \u00a0 But, like hearing  I love you , I am secure in the belief that she loves me whether she says so or shows me. My mothering is not validated by how she acknowledges me or appreciates my efforts. I do what I do simply because  I  love  her . I have learned not to need my affections reciprocated. But I treasure those fleeting moments of true connection with all my heart. Lately\u2026 every now and then\u2026 when I steal a hug, she\u2019ll press her face against mine for just a moment\u2026 long enough to blink. Could it be? A Rhema kiss?\u00a0I wonder. Nope. It\u2019s a sensory thing, she\u2019s seeking deep pressure into her face. That\u2019s all it is, I tell myself. All too often I\u2019m ready to ascribe an autism-reason for her actions and behaviors. Even so, this time, I pretend it\u2019s really a kiss. When she does it, I supply the word \u201ckiss\u201d and then say, \u201cThank you, Rhema!\u201d After her therapy visit, Rhema\u2019s teacher Courtney brought her out and said, \u201cShe was so interactive today. I even got a butterfly kiss!\u201d \u201cOh, so you think they\u2019re kisses, too???\u201d \u201cWell, yeah!\u201d So now it\u2019s official. I am Drew Barrymore no longer.

Please pray.\u201d \nThe text I got back simply said, \n\u201cCovered.\u201d \nAnd I  felt  it. \u00a0 This Sunday, Brandon had the opportunity to go before the church and share about his upcoming deployment to Iraq. (The church is quite large, and we have not had the opportunity to get to know as\u00a0many people as we would like.) Rhema was unable to sit still in the service, so she and I were upstairs in the \u201ccry room\u201d when Brandon was speaking. The cry room was filled with mothers and small children fussing and cooing. I did not know any of the women in the room very well. When one of the mothers realized that Brandon was speaking, she jumped up and turned up the volume so that we could hear him. It was hard to concentrate on what he was saying, but I could tell that he was getting a little choked up as he talked about Rhema and Hope. I stood so I could hear him better. One of the mothers walked over and stood beside me. When Brandon finished, the pastor asked the congregation, \u201cAre you willing to stand with this family and support and pray for them?\u201d I heard over\u00a0three hundred\u00a0voices answer with a resounding \u201cYes.\u201d I gasped. Not many days ago I was feeling  a tad overwhelmed , and suddenly\u00a0I had a multitude (there\u2019s a Bible word for you) of real, tangible help.\u00a0 Our pastor continued, \u201cLet\u2019s pray a prayer of protection over Brandon and his family now.\u201d The next thing I knew there were hands on my shoulders. Babies were left to play on the floor, while their mothers stood\u00a0around me. In the midst of that chaotic playroom, women I did\u00a0not even know stood\u00a0with me, shed tears and prayed for my family. It\u2019s difficult to put into words what their simple kindness meant to me. I felt it again.  Covered. After the service ended, we were overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and support. There were offers for free babysitting, and offers to cook meals, do laundry, run errands and do \u201canything else I could think of.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Friends have formed\u00a0\u201csupport team\u201d and will come once a week just to be an extra set of hands. I had to laugh. Trust God to set me up with even more help than I could imagine! I  know  that He has put people in my life who will faithfully  be there  whenever and however I may need them. I continue to be amazed at His marvelous provision. How very blessed am I. There is a teenaged boy in our church named Cole. He has autism and reminds me of  Reid . These are the kids that parents like me just love to watch. They have such a purity of spirit. They\u00a0inspire me. They cause me to hope. I want my\u00a0girls to grow up\u00a0to be just like them. Cole\u2019s father approached us and asked if Cole could take a picture with Brandon. \n\u201cHe likes to have a picture of who he is praying for,\u201d his father explained. It\u00a0was all Cole\u2019s idea. So his father snapped a photo. Then Cole told us he wanted to pray for us. Rhema was squirming, and I had been struggling with her all morning. I was hungry. I was hot \u2013 90 degrees with no AC in the building and I was sweating like a pig. I did not know what to do with all the love and attention, and I had the urge to pull a Rhema and run like the wind. But nothing in the world could have dragged me away in that moment. Cole put his hands together and bowed his head. With halting words, he prayed with all his heart, \u201cDear, dear, dear, dear, dear God\u2026\u201d He petitioned the God of the Universe to take care of us, and I\u2019m certain that God was all ears.

{"date": "January 22, 2009", "body": "The final scene in the movie  Schindler\u2019s List  is one I will never forget. The war has come to an end, the factory workers are finally free, and Oskar Schindler is preparing to leave. Instead of feeling happy, he is troubled with guilt. In spite of all he has achieved he realizes that maybe he could have done even more. (It\u2019s such a moving scene. To view,  click here .) Schindler : I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don\u2019t know. If I\u2019d just\u2026 I could have got more. \n Stern : Oskar, there are eleven hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them. \n Schindler : If I\u2019d made more money\u2026 I threw away so much money. You have no idea. If I\u2019d just\u2026 \n Stern : There will be generations because of what you did. \n Schindler : I didn\u2019t do enough! \n Stern : You did so much. Even though only two lives are involved \u2013 that of my darling girls \u2013 sometimes I feel like Schindler. For Rhema, I sometimes worry that even with all of the hard work we\u2019ve done: the treatments, therapies and interventions, the meetings, the fundraisers,\u00a0the prayers \u2013 that somehow we\u2019re still not doing enough. I recently read an article in the New York Times in which an autism mother says, \u201cIf not for speech therapy five or more days a week for six years he would not have the limited language skills he now has, which enable him to speak in short sentences, make his needs known\u2026\u201d And my initial thought was  Oh no. Maybe Rhema\u2019s not getting enough speech therapy. Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s not talking!  (Later on when I thought about it, I remembered that she actually gets speech therapy  six  days a week. So chill, girl). A mom of a teenaged boy at Rhema\u2019s school told me she feels free from the guilt imposed by Bettelheim\u2019s ridiculous \u201c refrigerator mother \u201d theory, but there\u2019s still this incredible pressure on mothers to save our children. (She cited a certain US magazine cover from October 2008.)\u00a0She said that if the child does not make huge gains, there\u2019s this notion that the mother didn\u2019t do enough. If you\u2019re like me, time and money (as in \u2018We\u2019ve run out of time in the day\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019ve run out of money\u2019) eventually stop you from doing every therapy out there, but you still wonder if XYZ therapy or JKLMONOP therapy might help your child. At the end of every successful IEP meeting I walk out full of anticipation, yet always hoping, wondering in the back of mind if it\u2019s enough. For me, it all has to come down to trust. Do I really trust God with my child? Can I do my best and trust him to do the rest, to \u201cfulfill His purpose for her\u201d (Ps. 138:8). Can I trade in the blame, guilt and self-doubt for the promises: \u201cBut my God shall supply all my needs.\u201d (Phil 4.19), \u201clt is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man.\u201d (Psalm 118:8), \u201cDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.\u201d (Phil 4:6) I know for certain that the interventions in which we have invested for Rhema are beneficial and important. We will continue. But I\u2019m learning not to be driven by guilt or fear to just do more. My friend Carrie is such a good example for me. She gives her daughter her best, she gets her daughter what she needs, and she does it all without getting wrapped around the axle. She relies on God in gracious simplicity, knowing it\u2019s not in her power but in His strength. Is not God enough for thy need, or is His all-sufficiency too narrow for thy wants? Is His heart faint? Is His arm weary? If so, seek another God; but if He be infinite, omnipotent, faithful, true, and all-wise, why gaddest thou abroad so much to seek another confidence? Why dost thou rake the earth to find another foundation, when this is strong enough to bear all the weight which thou canst ever build thereon? Wait thou only upon God, and let thine expectation be from Him.  \u2014Charles Spurgeon, Morning and Evening Will all we do for our kids ever be enough? Maybe not. But guess what? God motions me to lean in for a whisper. \u201c It\u2019s O.K\u2026 Because she\u2019s mine.

She came over, we put the kids to bed, and the three of us ended up talking for over an hour about our struggles in parenting and learning to trust God with our children. Her son is now in his late teens, and we wanted to glean every morsel of wisdom she could offer. Just as we were heading out she said something that we\u2019ve heard and read a million times, but tonight it was sticking: \u201cYou  must  make your marriage a priority. Promise me you\u2019ll do this.\u201d Brandon and I split a pizza and then stopped at an ice cream shop. I felt young and light again, remembering days when we would sit in the car and talk and laugh and slurp down two scoops of cookies-n-cream with marshmallow topping. We got home after 10 p.m. (yeah, we\u2019re party animals), and not surprisingly Rhema was still awake, crashing and banging around in her room. While I said goodnight to Joanne, Brandon went up to check on Rhema. A moment later I heard him say, \u201cUm, she\u2019s had another\u2026 accident.\u201d (\u2018Accident\u2019 is a euphemism, of course. Rhema\u2019s digestive system has been on the fritz lately.

Nice conclusion to our last date night in a long while , I thought, as we cleaned the child and the floors. This is  not  what I imagined when we said \u2018I do.\u2019 But there we were on hands and knees, side by side, scrubbing the gross stuff out of the wood floor. It was rather romantic. Instead of retreating to our own corners, I think we\u2019re finally learning how to  protect  one another in all of this. The cute, curly haired, half-naked girl escaped down the stairs. Brandon got to the kitchen just in time to find her holding an orange and wielding a steak knife. When I\u00a0came down, the two of\u00a0them were sitting at the table at 11 o\u2019clock at night eating an orange together.

{"date": "August 24, 2009", "body": "Months ago I read a post\u00a0by  Andrea \u00a0that really resonated with me.\u00a0She posted a video clip about  The Horse Boy  \u2013 the story of\u00a0a father who traveled all the way to Mongolia so that his son with autism could ride horses and visit a shaman. While we cannot all hop on a plane to Mongolia, the story highlights the lengths we as parents are willing to go to help our children. It made me think of my husband, Brandon. He leaves in four days for training in Georgia and then on to Iraq for a year. He goes because he loves this country and is committed to serving her. He believes in the cost for freedom, and he\u2019s not afraid of sacrifice. But he leaves for one other reason:\u00a0 \u00a0 Three years ago, the Army sent us to Boston. It turned out to be, in our opinion, the best place we could be in terms of services and medical care for Rhema. She attends an excellent school for children with special needs \u2013 a school that currently has a five-year waiting list. She has been blessed with some of the best teachers  eva  at her after-school therapy center. The skill of her doctors at Children\u2019s Hospital\u00a0is unmatched; they are\u00a0persistent and cutting edge. Last year, the Army came a-calling and said, \u201cSorry kids, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d (I\u2019m oversimplifying this for the sake of brevity). We knew that we would have to move, and that Brandon would deploy. The Army has something called the Stability Transition Team \u2013 it\u2019s a job that involves operating with a small military team \u201coutside the wire\u201d to train and counsel Iraqi police/border patrol. It\u2019s a dangerous and unpopular job \u2013 so much so that incentives are offered to deploying soldiers who will\u00a0do this mission. One incentive is getting to choose where you live. You guessed it. Brandon agreed to take the job in exchange for our family getting to stay in the Boston area a little longer. He was getting deployed no matter what, but\u00a0by taking on\u00a0this mission, he essentially gave us\u00a015 more months for Rhema\u00a0to benefit from some of the best schooling, services and medical care in the country. There are two reasons I\u2019m sharing this information in blogland. 1) By chance a teacher, therapist, respite giver, or aide of a special needs child may come across this post. I want you to know how grateful we are for you, how much we depend on you, how much your work and care impacts our entire family. I want you to know that we will go to great lengths just so our children can learn, thrive, be who they are, and enjoy life to the fullest. Thank you, thank you for your life-changing work. 2) There\u2019s a parallel to this whole concept of sacrifice that just blows my mind. We, as parents, are willing to put ourselves in harm\u2019s way so that our children can live their best lives. Andrea writes,  \u201cIs there a more powerful example than the cross? For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him would have eternal life. The Easter message is one of sacrificial love. Jesus, who is love, was motivated to go where no man has gone\u2013literally to hell and back\u2013to save you and me\u2026 When we do anything resembling that, whether by affording some outrageous therapy, homeshooling \u2019til we don\u2019t recognize ourself in the mirror, or driving illogical distances to a qualified therapist, we are following Christ, sharing in his suffering, and becoming more like Him. Go ahead and spill yourself out for someone you love; you\u2019re in good company even if the world doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d God will go to any length (even death) \u2013 just to reach us, to save us, to demonstrate His love for us.

{"date": "January 27, 2009", "body": "This is just a little story about God\u2019s provision. Right after Hope was born, a dear friend wrote me: \n\u201cI think you will find that Hope will form a special attachment to Rhema and will become protective and caring in a way that will be wonderful to see.\u201d Believe it or not, his words troubled me. Although it was very apparent that Rhema had autism, I still found myself in denial.  Rhema is quite capable. She won\u2019t need protecting , I thought. (People say not-so-smart, even hurtful things some times. My friend\u2019s words certainly did NOT fall into that category. But I realize that at that time in my life, I was angry and extra-sensitive. Just about anything anyone said to me could be twisted into something negative. Nowadays I try to extend a little grace when people say things\u2026 most of them mean well, and I was probably just as clueless once.) \u00a0 Yesterday we took the kids\u00a0to a place called Monkey Joes \u2013 an inflatable play zone. They know this place forwards and backwards. But it was extremely crowded and, lately, Rhema seems to be really struggling with crowds. She quickly ascended the steep stairs of the inflatable slide. But after she made it to the top, she got  \u201cstuck.\u201d  Stuck for Rhema does not mean that she is afraid or incapable of completing the task. For whatever reason, she just loses her way.\u00a0 For a long time, Rhema remained at the top of the slide completely engrossed with her hand that she was bouncing and twisting\u2026 back and forth, back and forth\u2026 in front of her eyes. Lots of children came and went, but Rhema seemed oblivious. By the time, Hope and I came over, Brandon said, \u201cShe\u2019s been up there for over 20 minutes. She won\u2019t come down.\u201d Hope eagerly climbed up the rungs. Still a toddler, she\u2019s a little slow but she always makes it to the top. When she got there, she paused for a minute by Rhema\u2019s side. Then she went and sat down at the top of the slide. \u201cGet Rhema! Hope. Get Rhema!\u201d Brandon called. I think I shouted a \u201cGet Rhema\u201d as well, but I was a non-believer. I did not think Hope could get Rhema down the slide. Hope could barely stay on her feet with the older, taller children bouncing all around her. Sometimes I think I want to spare Hope. I don\u2019t want her to become discouraged. She tries to talk to Rhema, but Rhema won\u2019t look at her. She tries to offer Rhema a toy or a pretzel, but Rhema won\u2019t take it. She tries to hug Rhema, but sometimes Rhema pushes her away. We watched Hope stand up from the slide and squeeze her way past kids and wedge herself behind Rhema. She hugged her legs. She tried to push her. \u201cC\u2019mon Rhema. C\u2019mon.\u201d Rhema wasn\u2019t budging. Hope tried for a little longer before giving up. She returned to her seated position at the top of the slide. \u201c Hope. Get Rhema! Get Rhema! \u201d There was a sense of urgency. Hope scrambled up again. I could see that she was going to try and lead Rhema by the hand this time. It was not going to work, I was sure of it. To take Rhema by the hand you must have a strong grip \u2013 if you weakly hold her hand for a second, you can forget it. She will become either an escapee, an immovable fortress, or a wet noodle on the floor. But Hope, in 2 year-old determination, grabbed Rhema\u2019s fingers. As if she were rescuing Boots himself from the Gooey Geyser, she yelled in her best Dora the Explorer voice, \u201c Pull! Pull! Puuuullllllll! \u201d I think she knew. She knew this was more than physical. Rhema was in her own world again, and with all her might, Hope was pulling her out. Rhema went with her. To the top of the slide. As if waking up from a trance, Rhema got her bearings and happily slid down the slide. Hope followed, squealing all the way down. Brandon and I looked at each other, wonder and joy in our eyes. \u201cThank you, Lord,\u201d he breathed.

Let me kiss it and make it better.\u201d It\u2019s so predictable. Hope is immediately comforted upon receiving her kiss. In fact, she\u2019s come to depend upon a kiss from Mommy or Daddy to heal her invisible \u201churt.\u201d Hope is also in the habit of needing us to pray for her when she gets hurt.

Last week Hope and I went to our first Parent/Tot gymnastics class at a new gym. The class has been going on for several weeks, but due to illnesses and doctor appointments, we had missed a number of sessions. The class was very structured, which was a little different for us. In her old class, Hope had free time to explore the gymnasium. In this class, there were obstacle courses and activities that had to be completed as a group before you could move on to another part of the gym. I thought to myself, Rhema and I would have had a  really  hard time in a parent/tot class like this. All the children lined up and were instructed to hop one at a time down a long track of in-ground trampoline and then jump into a foam pit. The parents stood on the sidelines. When it was Hope\u2019s turn to hop, she was very excited and started out a little too quickly. After a few hops she could not control her momentum and fell on her back with a thud. She stood up in the middle of the trampoline track and announced, \u201cMommy. I hurt my butt!!!\u201d \u201cO.K., honey. You O.K.?\u201d \u201cYou gotta kiss it!\u201d I quickly looked around. \u201cUm, Hope. Kids are waiting behind you. Keep going!\u201d \u201cNo. You gotta kiss it.

(pause) fingers, toes, belly, yes\u2026 but\u2026 not\u2026\u201d With that I went and scooped her off the trampoline and carried her to one side of the gym. \u201cHow \u2018bout we just pray,\u201d I whispered.

{"date": "February 17, 2009", "body": "Recently the school called to say that she was doing something really strange with her hand. She held it rigid against her chest, wouldn\u2019t use it. It seemed like she\u2019d lost some mobility. They wanted to know, \u2018Is this a pre-cursor to a seizure?\u2019 But I didn\u2019t know. I drove the 45 minutes to the school to pick her up early. A school nurse came out to talk to me. She believed Rhema was having absence seizures. Rhema had been \u201cout of it\u201d all week. \u2018Is this the result of medication changes? Is she coming down with something? Is this just a bad week?\u2019 Yes? No? Maybe all of those things? Maybe none of those things? I don\u2019t know. She is constantly moving, and she needs constant supervision. I\u2019ve had conversations with God about making me younger, stronger. I\u2019ve suggested that He grow me an extra, bionic arm. I had to laugh at a recent IEP meeting when someone commented that my almost 5-year old is still treating people as if they are jungle gyms. She\u2019ll climb right up your legs and do a backflip. And she\u2019ll swing from the shower curtain rods. And eat soap. And paint herself in butter. Where will I find the energy to keep up with this child? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not creative. I\u2019m not organized. I\u2019m not a \u201cnatural\u201d teacher. What God was thinking? \u00a0 After the IEP meeting, my head was swimming with I don\u2019t know\u2019s. With everything that she needs to learn, are these the right goals for right now? Are these goals going to stretch her, challenge her? Are they realistic? There was a stack of annual consent forms to sign (not the IEP). I quickly flipped through them and signed my name with an unsteady hand as uncertainty wreaked havoc in my mind. Someone in the room looked up. \u201cHi Rhema.\u201d I turned around in my chair. There was my girl\u2026 Standing in the doorway in her purple coat and pink backpack. I had not seen her yet. I had been escorted into the meeting before I had the chance to see her in her classroom. \u201cHi Rhema!\u201d Not looking at me, she smiled. But the smile  was  for me. She came in and sat down in the chair next to me. Her eyes were averted, but the soft smile never left her face. Cindy Crawford mole above her lip. Exquisite. All my love. I reached over and held her hand\u2026 So many things I don\u2019t know. But then there are moments when I just know with everything in me that I was always meant to be her mommy. And she was always meant to be my girl. \u00a0 Just like this. \u00a0 \u00a0 Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

{"date": "February 26, 2009", "body": "For nearly all of her life I have been waiting for words. (That\u2019s about one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five days and counting). I can still remember the moment I knew her name. I was 7 months pregnant, and Brandon was preparing to deploy to Iraq. My friend Shannon and I were chatting after dinner in my kitchen in Heilsbronn, Germany. I told her I that I was not crazy about the name we had chosen for the baby \u2013 it just didn\u2019t seem to fit. Shannon insisted that I had to be excited about the name. And so we brainstormed long into the night. Shannon was the first to say the name  Rhema . And when she spoke it, I can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s like my heart  remembered . I knew her. I knew that was her name. I was so excited. The name meant \u201cthe spoken word.\u201d Specifically, \u201cGod\u2019s Word revealed.\u201d At first, Brandon thought it was too sacred of a name to put on a child. But my heart was set on it, and we studied the Scriptures for anywhere the Greek word  rhema  (which is translated as \u201cword\u201d) appeared. We chose Romans 10: 8-9 as her \u201ctheme\u201d verse: \u201cThe word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is LORD\u201d, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d I recited the verse to her while she was still in the womb. Little did I know that a year prior my mother had been praying for me one night. I had been trying to conceive for a couple years. My heart was breaking because we could not get pregnant. When my mother prayed, she asked God to \u201cspeak our baby\u2019s name.\u201d She remembers it being a strange request, but that\u2019s what she had felt led to pray. Just before Rhema\u2019s birth, I told my mother her name. My mother\u2019s face contorted as she recognized the name, and remembered the prayer she had prayed. \u00a0 Autism, for us, has been about adjusting expectations. Initially after her diagnosis, I thought, so I can\u2019t expect conversations anytime soon\u2026 I\u2019ll settle for sentences. Then it was\u2026 o.k\u2026 how about phrases? No?\u2026\u00a0o.k., o.k\u2026\u00a0Words? Approximations? Single sounds? Instead of \u201cI want pop\u201d, if she just says \u201cp-\u201c, we are to\u00a0celebrate the effort. All along we have been hoping, praying, fighting for words. Maybe I\u2019ve focused too much on the language part? As she gets older, I kind of get that vibe\u2026 that maybe I should let it go. We hold on\u00a0to the hope \u2013 the belief \u2013\u00a0that her name is a promise. Every night for the past several years I have quoted Romans 10:8-9 to her as I tuck her into bed.  \u201cRhema, the Word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart\u2026\u201d  Every night. It\u2019s  my  ritual \u2013 half the time I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s listening. If Brandon or a babysitter puts her to bed, I slip into her room after she\u2019s asleep and whisper that verse. I\u2019ve written the verse on her bedroom door. \u00a0 Tonight as I tucked her in, I quoted the verse to her (not nearly as enthusiastic as I was 1000 days ago). \u201cRhema, the Word is near you; it is in your mouth\u2026\u201d I touched her lips. \u201c\u2026and in your heart\u2026\u201d I traced a heart on her chest. \u201cHar.\u201d She whispered, echoing me.\u00a0Out of the blue. I don\u2019t think I was dreaming. Honestly, I was tired. But I don\u2019t think I dreamed it. \u00a0 The Word is there.\u00a0 It\u2019s in her heart.

They were beautiful, smart, funny, \u201cnormal.\u201d Some had children with Asperger\u2019s. Others with classic autism. Others with multiple children spanning the spectrum. Suddenly I was not alone. I was surprised. I did not know that  this  happened to ordinary people\u2026 even extraordinary people. For the first time I finally realized that it wasn\u2019t my fault, that I had not done something wrong. In an instant, these mothers took me under their wings, pulled out their day planners and rattled off phone numbers for different doctors to call, places to go, things to do. They tossed me a lifeline of hope. Today I have been unspeakably blessed with a precious community of friends. We share a bond that cannot be severed. Our community is a reflection of God\u2019s ideal for relationship:  That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. 1 Cor 12:25-26 I\u2019m grateful for all my bloggy mama friends who  get  me,  get  this. There are days when everything is hard. Every. Single. Thing. But I can literally\u00a0sense you around me cheering me on, commiserating with me, or offering some ingenious solution.

Thank you. I\u2019m grateful for the wonderful Godly examples of  Kathryn ,  Shanda ,  Beth  and other real-world friends who are faithful to walk alongside and encourage me with Truth. I\u2019m grateful to my Bible study sisters who bring new meaning to the phrase, \u201cI Got Your Back.\u201d From bringing meals when the kids are sick to taking notes for me for my next school meeting, they love in action. We laugh together, we seek God together, we pray for our husbands and children together. Tahni  sent me a notecard wheel to keep a record of verses and thoughts as they apply to Rhema and our family. I felt led to use the notecard wheel as a prayer journal. I spend a day praying for each individual child (I cycle through the list \u2013 Day 1 is Josiah, Day 2 is Grayson, etc.) Simply put, your children have touched my life (through you). And it is my joy and honor to pray for each one.\u00a0 (I love that my prayer list is growing.) (I struggled with posting this picture of my prayer list because there\u2019s a Bible verse about praying in private (Matt.6:5-6). I do not do this for show. ) Pardon the mush, but I wanted you to know what you mean to me, what your families mean to me. It may not seem like much, but the most powerful gift I know to give is to pray. So excited to meet some of you in person this  weekend !

{"date": "July 21, 2009", "body": "The hiding place in Corrie ten Boom's room When the world is too much, Rhema will often go and squeeze herself into a quiet, enclosed space. Once, at the airport, in the midst of noise and chaos,\u00a0she climbed into a bin near the baggage claim area. At home, she squeezes heself between shelves and boxes in our \u201cbook nook.\u201d There is something about the tight confinement that brings her a sense of calm. She is safe, she is in control, she is surrounded on all sides; she knows  where she is  in space. Once in a great while and for only a brief moment, she finds her hiding place in my arms. This morning I discovered that\u00a0she was not in her bed. I found her, instead, asleep behind a clothing bin, huddled\u00a0in the back of her closet. Some time ago, we removed the knob from the closet door to prevent her from going in. (Rhema likes to pull down clothes and swing from the bar in her closet). But last night, she had managed to get into the closet and find her perfect hiding spot. She was actually  sleeping peacefully \u2026 and that\u2019s kind of rare around here. Instantly I was reminded of a beautiful song from the Psalms. \n You are my hiding place \nYou always fill my heart with songs of deliverance \nWhenever I am afraid \nI will trust in you Many years ago, I was working in Ethiopia for Mother Teresa\u2019s Missionaries of Charity. Two students I knew from Brown had accompanied me into the city to buy supplies. When it was late in the day, my friends and I parted ways. They were concerned about me traveling alone. (This was a very dangerous part of the city and any young woman who looked foreign, lost or vulnerable was preyed upon. In fact, several weeks earlier I had lost my way. I had been locked out of the mission where I worked and forced to spend a very frightening night in the city alone.)\u00a0 But, on this day,\u00a0I assured my friends that I would be fine. Not long they left, a man grabbed me and tried to steal my bag. He sneered my name, which made me suspect that he had been following\u00a0us all day. (My friend Rachel was very tall and very fair \u2013 she attracted attention \u2013 mostly beggars, some thieves \u2013 wherever we went). I bit his hand, dropped the bag, and ran like Gail Devers. I darted into what looked like a post office and hid myself behind rows and rows of mailboxes. There I stayed, in my little hiding spot, afraid to ask for help, afraid to trust anyone. I did not speak the language, did not know where to go. I thought the man might be waiting for me outside, so I stayed there for hours. To put it in Bible-speak, I was sore afraid. As the hours ticked by, I began to hum that little Psalm: You are my hiding place \nYou always fill my heart with songs of deliverance \nWhenever I am afraid \nI will trust in you I will trust in you \nLet the weak say I am strong \nIn the strength of the Lord \nI will trust in you It gave me courage to know that these are the very words the  ten Boom  family clung to during their time in hiding and in the prison camps. After several hours, I got up,\u00a0strode out of the place and walked all the way back to the mission. I looked straight ahead and sang that little song the whole way, and not a single person stopped me. \u00a0 I admire our children for recognizing when they need to get away, to calm their senses, to go and hide. When the Israelites battled the Philistines, if they saw that they were in trouble and could not defend themselves, they would turn tail and run to a hiding place. It might be a rock, a high place, a thicket, a pit, or a cave. We too, when we are too weak for our enemies (fill in the blank), we can seek a safe and sure hiding place. Certainly there is a hiding place for us, if we had but skill to\u00a0seek it out they way our children do. Where is it but in God?  \u2018For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his shelter: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.\u2019 Ps. 27:5 Seeing Rhema curled up on top of her shoes in the closet this morning made me remember to go there \u2013 back to the place where there is refuge, comfort, rest and, yes,  deliverance .\u00a0This is the place that\u00a0has the capacity to contain me and receive me.\u00a0This hiding place is big enough for all that we have.

{"date": "July 16, 2009", "body": "This one\u2019s for Maura \u2013 a sweet 13 yr. old I met in the waiting room today \u2013 who inspired this post. \u00a0 When I was pregnant with Hope, people would ask me what we planned to name her.\u00a0 I always got nods of approval when I told them the name. \u201cOh! What a nice name,\u201d they\u2019d say. Then I\u2019d follow up with, \u201cYeah, and her middle name is going to be SheSleepsThroughTheNight or She\u2019sAGoodEater.\u201d I\u2019d get some weird looks. Would you believe that I was so stupid that I was ANGRY at the world, myself, Brandon, and the ultrasound technician when we found out she was a girl? She was perfect and healthy, but I had the nerve to be upset because I wanted a boy. I had no idea what God was doing. Would you believe that I was so stupid that I actually\u00a0had feelings of shame\u00a0for being pregnant again?\u00a0Rhema had a LOT of needs, and I wondered if her speech therapist thought I was being a tad irresponsible. I remember Rhema\u2019s neurologist looking at my round belly and saying, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried??\u201d I had no idea what God was doing. \u00a0 She\u2019s only 2.5 years old, but now I think I\u2019m catching a glimpse of what God is doing\u2026 She\u2019s Rhema\u2019s Hope. She\u2019s the one who demands hugs and  high-fives \u00a0\u2026and  gets  them. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s been sitting in therapy waiting rooms since she was weeks old. She\u2019s the one who gleefully runs to Rhema and throws her arms around her after every appointment. Without fail. She\u2019s the one who reminds Rhema to use a spoon to eat her rice. She\u2019s the one who begs me to let her go with Rhema to her special needs school \u2013 because she\u2019s in awe of her big sister. She\u2019s the one who cheers for her sister the loudest. She\u2019s the only  friend  Rhema\u2019s ever had. She\u2019s the one who tells me sleepily as I tuck her into bed \u2013 as if she\u2019s passing the torch to me \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take care of Rhema.\u201d She\u2019s the only one who tries to speak Rhema\u2019s language instead of getting Rhema to speak hers. She\u2019s the one who understands  sister  on a deeper level than many adults.\u00a0 She\u2019s the only one who can pull Rhema out of the  gooey geyser . Rhema\u2019s hand is the only hand she wants to hold.\u00a0 She pleads, \u201cRhema. Listen to Hope. I need you to hold my hand.\u201d Rhema refuses. I try to explain to Hope that you have to have a firm grip to hold Rhema\u2019s hand. Hope\u2019s hand is simply too small. The words come out, but not exactly the way I mean them: \u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough to hold her hand. You can\u2019t walk with her yet.\u201d \u00a0 I stand corrected. Hope Hope is strong enough to hold her hand, to walk with her, \u00a0to be her companion. And, Hope,\u00a0although I wish you didn\u2019t have to be such a wise old soul so young, I see God\u2019s great love and provision for us in  you .

{"date": "July 23, 2009", "body": "In the past few weeks I have had the good fortune to spend precious time with two families in the \u201cbloggy mama village.\u201d First, I was able to meet up with  Andrea , her husband and her teenaged twins Reid and Allie at Logan airport. They had just endured a red-eye flight from California and were on their way to the Cape. Meeting Andrea was\u00a0like seeing an old friend;\u00a0we have\u00a0a  soul connection .\u00a0Wise, peaceful; the love of the Lord was shining in her face. Her life, her  writing  moves me in ways I cannot even articulate. Reid greeted me with enthusiasm. \u201cWell, hello Nicole C. Mullen!!\u201d Nicole C. Mullen In case you\u00a0don\u2019t know, Nicole C. Mullen is a contemporary Christian singer. She is a beautiful talent, and I was  tickled pink  that Reid thought I was her. I couldn\u2019t get the silly grin off my face. Finally, Andrea gently told me that I was not the first African American woman Reid had dubbed Nicole C. Mullen (in fact, perhaps  many  Black women have been re-named Nicole C. Mullen). 8) No matter. It was\u00a0one of the best compliments I\u2019ve received, and I like to think that I\u2019m the most special Nicole C. Mullen that Reid has ever met! We spent a very short time together, but Reid envigorated me.\u00a0 He seems to live life\u00a0to the full, passing out hugs freely. When he dances, he  dances . When he sings, he  sings . Every time I watch this video of Reid\u2019s baptism and hear him sing, I am moved to tears: * My family got to spend an afternoon at Jess\u2019s house with her husband\u00a0Luau and her daughters\u00a0Katie and\u00a0Brooke (fortunately, we\u2019re practically neighbors). Katie\u00a0and\u00a0Brooke possess a beauty that you simply don\u2019t get used to \u2013 I could not take my eyes off them. Katie\u00a0was her gracious, wonderful self. She selflessly\u00a0indulged and entertained Hope all afternoon, chasing her, playing with her, assisting her on the Air Pogo and decorating her face\u00a0like a clown. And Hope was\u2026 absolutely starstruck. Luau\u00a0brought out a glass pitcher of ice water. Rhema had been playing in the sandbox, but she made a bee-line for the water. On the way over, she picked her nose with sandy fingers. And then she picked her bathing suit wedgie. And then she dunked both hands into the water pitcher, chasing ice cubes. Instead of dissolving into dry heaves, as one would expect,\u00a0Luau and Jess laughed it off and projected a no-worries attitude throughout the day. It is  so  refreshing to be with people who get it. What a relief! Brandon said he could not remember the last time he\u2019d been able to just sit and chat. With Rhema, we are usually too busy trying to prevent catastrophe to actually engage in conversation. And Rhema felt free and joyful there. Both Jess and\u00a0Katie were able to get\u00a0words out of\u00a0her (\u2018bounce\u2019 and \u2018boing\u2019)\u00a0without even really trying\u00a0\u2013 and that\u2019s no easy task! In a matter of minutes, Jess was able to capture more photos of my happy, laughing\u00a0Rhema than I\u2019ve been able to get in years. She knew, she just knew how much I would cherish those pictures. Jess, Luau, and the girls had already had a full, exhilarating  weekend . By the time we showed up, I knew they were tired and in need of some downtime. But they never made us feel that way. They still had a little something extra, and they gave it all\u00a0to us. Brooke\u00a0was spent, but she stayed with us. For as long as she could, she played in the sandbox with the girls, she patiently shared her toys with Hope. She reminded me of her mama, giving everything she had in her to give. Each one of them, that\u2019s what they do.  They give.  That\u2019s just their way. Jess cares with every piece of her heart for  all  of our special kids. She is a  force,  making speeches ,  raising money , giving hope and inspiration to so many. I admit that I once wondered if this family was too good to be true. Let me tell you,\u00a0they are more than good. Jess is\u00a0every bit\u00a0as genuine and loving and\u00a0generous as she seems on the computer screen. And her girls? Even more wondrous.

{"date": "July 13, 2009", "body": "Rhema pulled a disappearing act \u2013 the third in as many days. This afternoon we were playing in the backyard. When Rhema ran around to the back gate, I followed. However, instead of running after her (which is what I\u2019m always doing, it seems), I stopped to grab Hope\u2019s hand and we  walked  to the side of the house. (The backyard is large, wrapping around much the house, and enclosed with a  tall wooden fence .) I knew that earlier Brandon had made sure\u00a0the\u00a0back gate\u00a0was locked, so I wasn\u2019t really worried.\u00a0However, Hope and I\u00a0found the gate door swinging wide open, and Rhema was gone. I could already hear my heart pounding. I told Hope to \u201cfreeze\u201d and sprinted into the neighbor\u2019s yard. Our neighbors have an outdoor pool. Rhema does not know how to swim, and because she\u2019s had tubes in her ears since she was 21 months old, is very inexperienced in pools. I scanned the entire pool, and thankfully Rhema was not in it. I ran up and down the street, wondering if it was futile to even call her name. As I just blogged, she has gotten better at coming when called, but we have to be pretty close for her to respond. I doubt she would come if I were calling from far away, and she certainly would not call out to me. She was nowhere in sight. Too much time had passed, and I was starting to lose it. Then I saw Brandon heading home (he was visiting a neighbor), and I told him Rhema was gone. He put Hope in the house, told her not to move, and we continued searching. My biggest fear was that Rhema would dart out into a busy street. She knows nothing of the danger of cars. Brandon called the police, and the search continued. (I will say that I was mildly comforted by the fact that she had her  ID bracelet  on, in fact, duck-taped-so-she-can\u2019t-rip-it-off.) They found Rhema in someone\u2019s house.\u00a0 A woman (whom I\u2019d never met) had come home from work and heard a noise in the house. She found Rhema happily playing with toys in the playroom. She said she was not sure how Rhema could have gotten into\u00a0her house. She had seen a crazed woman running down the street (that would be yours truly) and put two and two together. Pardon me now while I scream. \u00a0 .\u00a0 \u00a0 Did you hear it? After Rhema was safe at home and I had regained some composure, we talked to the police about  Project Lifesaver . Hope was a star throughout the whole thing, and she certainly gave us something to smile about. In all her 2 year-old glory, she spontaneously jumped up and gave the officer a grateful hug. When she wrapped her arms around his legs, her head kind of landed in his\u2026 ahem\u2026 special place. I\u2019m so thankful to God for protecting Rhema yet again. I  am  concerned = it seems like she has upped her game lately in terms of escaping and wandering off. Brandon is leaving for Iraq soon, and the task of keeping her safe seems daunting right now. After the officer left, we walked over to the woman\u2019s house where Rhema had been found and thanked her. She kindly offered for Rhema and Hope to \u201ccome and play in the playroom anytime.\u201d We went to other neighbors that we did not know, introduced ourselves and told them about Rhema (\u2013 something we should have done long ago.) Now they will be on the lookout for her as well. Brandon is putting combo locks on the gates, and we\u2019re going to get a  MedicAlert  membership.

{"date": "July 29, 2009", "body": "I was pushing Rhema on a swing when\u00a0two girls excitedly ran over to us. \u201cWanna play with us? Wanna play with us?\u201d they asked Rhema. A pause. \u201cCan we play with her?\u201d the girls asked me. You would think I\u2019d be prepared for this, used to it by now, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure of myself. \u201cUm\u2026 yeah,\u201d I said, wishing that Rhema would magically\u00a0possess social skills and play skills when I took her off the swing. The girls attempted to talk to Rhema and \u201cplay\u201d with her, but she ignored them, and in short order, took off running. The girls were confused, but we chased after Rhema. As I watched the two girls, I was intrigued by their typical-ness. They were Rhema\u2019s age, and I paid attention to every word they said, every thing they did. I wonder if I will ever get to a point where typical development no longer amazes me. I wonder if the day will come when I don\u2019t feel that familiar twinge of sadness creep in when I see the things that children Rhema\u2019s age can do. Will I ever get over it? I tried to assist the girls as they attempted to play with Rhema, but it did not take long for them to realize that  something  was different. One of the girls, named Mia, finally looked up at me and asked, \u201cIs she not a regular girl?\u201d I can talk just about anyone\u2019s head off about autism \u2026 but this day I was thoroughly at a loss for words. \u201cWell,\u201d I stammered. \u201cShe has trouble talking and understanding everything you say\u2026 but she\u2019s really very much like you. She loves to play and laugh and swing and\u2026\u201d (Rhema darted again) \u201c\u2026 and run.\u201d The girls were not giving up; they continued to try to engage Rhema. When she ran off for the umpteenth time, Mia exclaimed in exasperation, \n \u201cWhy did they make her this way???\u201d I was not put off by her words. She didn\u2019t say it in a mean way, and she seemed genuinely frustrated for Rhema. In fact, I was kind of amused that she used the word  they  as if Rhema were a product made in China. Before Mia took off, she looked at me and knowingly concluded, \u201cIt must have been something she ate.\u201d She took off to find new friends. Truth be told, in moments of frustration greater than Mia\u2019s I have asked that question of God. \nIn her hospital room when a doctor looked at us and shrugged, \nIn the middle of the night when she shrieks, \nWhile on my knees scrubbing up poop art, \nDuring a major meltdown in public, \nDuring a self-injurious, destructive phase, \nWhen I cannot figure out for the life of me what she wants or needs, \nWhen the non-stop vocal stimming is about to make me insane, \nI have thrown my hands up and cried,  Why did you make her this way? I cannot say I know the answer fully. I think it\u2019s something I\u2019ll be learning about for all of life. But I know that it\u2019s o.k. to be honest with God; I know He can handle my questions, my frustrations. Ps. 142:2 says, \u201cI pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble.\u201d And I trust that He hears me. And sometimes that\u2019s enough. I will say this. This autism thing could have consumed us. Not so long ago, I was close to being swallowed up in self-pity and bitterness. I could have let\u00a0the anger and the stress destroy my marriage.

Sick kids, flat tire, laid-off parent, dead pet, bad back, etc., etc. (And that\u2019s putting it mildly.) I was reading about a pilgrimage in Psalm 84. The sojourners were on their way to a heavenly city. But they had to pass through the Valley of Baca. Baca is described as a desert place of \u201cadversity.\u201d It is literally translated as the Valley of Tears. Many of us know that place \u2013 where hope goes a-missing, circumstances don\u2019t change, and isolation, frustration and despair seem to rule the day. We start our journeys strong. Naturally, we lose steam as the road gets long and the sun beats down. We have parched spirits, tired feet and weary hearts. The travelers in the Psalm are said to go from  strength to strength . Instead of getting weaker as they journey, they get stronger and stronger \u2013 even while passing through the valley of weeping. The pilgrims \u2013 because their strength is in the Lord \u2013 are able to make the desolate valley a place of springs, in which God sends early autumn rains. As mothers, we have to be strong by definition. We have to be advocates, and \u201cwarriors\u201d, and \u201cmama bears.\u201d We have to be doctors, and therapists and teachers. My motherhood story is only five years long, and it\u2019s clear to me that I cannot do this in my own strength. No use in even trying. To get to the other side\u2026 to reach the promise, I do not want to just go from one struggle to the next, I want to go from strength to strength. Brave in the face of each new trial because God is for me and with me. The Psalm 84 pilgrims demonstrated that those who look to Him to be their strength are not only sustained, but  empowered  as they pass through the valley. \u00a0 Our kids are getting stronger and stronger. I look at my girl \u2013 she\u2019s moving slow, but she\u2019s learning. She\u2019s growing. She\u2019s showing me that in going from strength to strength, there is always the element of progress.

{"date": "July 31, 2009", "body": "I once saw a summary guide for the MTV show called  MADE . MADE is a self-improvement reality show in which teens try to be \u201cmade\u201d into something\u00a0such as a star, an athlete, or a skinny person. Each teen is trained by an expert in their field, known as a \u201cMade coach.\u201d The episode captions are somewhat amusing: \u201cBritney is made into a broadway diva.\u201d, \u201cBrian is made into a ladies\u2019 man.\u201d, \u201cPinnochio is made into a real boy.\u201d (O.K., I made up that last one). I\u00a0thought about the last few years of life and how experience changes and shapes us. I wondered,  What am I being made into? \u00a0 We went through a very difficult time with Rhema a couple years ago. She had been hospitalized for seizure-related stuff, and she came home with new problem behaviors.\u00a0 For one thing, she would go ballistic if I spoke to anyone. To this day I do not know why, but she could not stand for me to talk. She would scream and tantrum if I spoke in the car, at home, on the phone. She would charge me and pinch my lips together HARD. Brandon and I could barely speak to each other around\u00a0her \u2013 it was pointless anyway because we could not hear ourselves over the screaming. We were relegated to silence. It got so bad once that when she had a doctor appointment I wrote out the things I wanted to say ahead of time, so that I wouldn\u2019t have to talk! During this time, Rhema was scheduled for a school evaluation. Rhema, Hope and I attended the meeting. Silly me decided not to tell the team evaluating her about our little problem. Yeah. I was going to try to get through the meeting without saying much! (I know, crazy. Blame it on the sleep deprivation). And we were a sorry bunch, lemme tell you. At the time, Hope had severe eczema on her face ( pics here ). The day before I had fallen down the stairs and smacked my face on a wooden post. So I had a big, black eye that made me look like I had been punched good. (As the saying goes, when it rains it pours). Sad. Discouraged. Tired. And looking like death warmed over. That was me. Thankfully, the meeting was held in a gross motor room, and Rhema was too busy playing to \u201cnotice\u201d that I was talking very quietly with a team of therapists and teachers. At one point, I was asked a question that required a detailed answer. As I spoke, Rhema suddenly stopped playing and flew across the room. She was coming for my throat. As her hand clamped down on my mouth, she began to scream and do the \u201ctantrum dance.\u201d I was keenly aware of the five sets of startled eyes on me as they waited and watched to see how I would handle things. I silently begged for calm, and God granted\u2026 more than I\u2019ve ever had. I removed her fingernails from my lips. It. Hurt. Quietly and firmly, I said, \u201cNo, Rhema. No. Mommy\u2019s talking right now.\u201d I expected her to do a back flop onto the floor and kick and scream. I was sure the meeting would have to be re-scheduled. But miracle of miracles, I watched a peace settle over her and she slowly turned and walked back to the toy she was playing with. It was amazing. The rest of the meeting went off without a hitch. I remember thinking afterwards,  God, this is some hard stuff! And I never thought I\u2019d be here. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. But you\u2019re making me into something \u2013 something good, something better, I hope\u2026 You might wonder what this has to do with the last post.

{"date": "March 18, 2009", "body": "An amazing thing happened. A local Special Olympics gymnastics team that normally has a minimum age requirement of eight decided to change the age to five so that Rhema could participate. This past Saturday was the first practice. I was excited about this opportunity for Rhema, and also nervous because of our  last\u00a0experience at a gym . I had no idea how she was going to behave. I tried to prep her by telling her where we were going, but I don\u2019t think she understood what I said. As we were walking into the building, Rhema smelled a rat. She did The Flop. Also known as the I\u2019m-not-going-to-walk-anymore routine. So I carried her in, and we passed other parents in the foyer. We were a minute late, and the rest of the team was already on the floor warming up. As I opened the door to the gym, Rhema let out a blood-curdling scream. The whole team turned around to see their newest member clutching the sides of the gym doors for dear life. \u201cHi!\u201d I said cheerily over the screams while prying my kid\u2019s hands off the door. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to sit on the bleachers and\u2026 um\u2026 take, take everything in.\u201d We made it to the bleachers, and Rhema wailed into my\u00a0chest, with her back to the team. If I so much as shifted positions, she would launch a new, higher-pitched cry. I tried to calm her down, talking to her softly. There we sat. On the bleachers. For 45 minutes Rhema babbled loudly in discontent and repeatedly wiped her snotty nose back and forth across my  black  shirt. A coach came over to say hi and ask her if she\u2019d like to join them. But Rhema did not seem to understand a word. With ten minutes left to go, I started having a little chat with God. God, this is not a big deal, really. I know. I just know she can do this and would enjoy it so much. Can you help me? I just want her to at least go down on the floor. I managed to disentangle myself from Rhema without too big a scene. I went down on the gym floor and called for her to come to me. (My method was inherently flawed because she does not always respond to her name.) But I could tell that deep down she really wanted to play. She used to go to an open gym every weekend and LOVED it. Only recently has she developed this aversion to gyms. After a lot of coaxing, Rhema finally came off the bleachers. She was walking with her feet scrunched, toes curled under. Cautiously, she approached the edge of the mat I was standing on. \u201cC\u2019mon, babe.\u201d Dear God. Lord. Just let her take one step. When Rhema put one foot on the mat, she shrieked and recoiled as if she had stepped in hot lava. She scurried back to the bleachers. A light bulb went off in my not-so-bright head. Oh. The mats. Something about the mats was bothering her. I\u2019m not sure if it was the chalk on the mat\u2026 Or the color of the mat (some are light blue, some are dark blue, some are black). Or the fact that the mat feels cold on her feet. Or the fact that some mats are soft and some are hard. I don\u2019t know, and Rhema cannot tell me. Hhhhmmm. For a minute, I toyed with asking the coaches to remove the chalk and remove the mats from the gymnasium.  Nah. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d go for it. Hhhhhmmmm. O.K. Well, Lord. I asked for one step. But I didn\u2019t mean literally\u2026 one step. And I know I\u2019m always saying how small steps are big steps\u2026 and one step at a time and Neil Armstrong and \u201cWhat About Bob\u201d and all that. But really I\u2019m not good at this baby step stuff. I\u2019m impatient and I want more\u2026\u00a0\u00a0 (Sigh). But I\u2019m going to be thankful. Because she got off the bench. She took a step. (Amazing what an attitude change can do. In times past, I would have cried all the way home. Lately, I am grateful for the fact that my children are blessed with  life  and the ability to walk, run and play). As if on cue, Rhema came down again and scrunch-walked her way over to a corner of the gym. She managed to get there without stepping on a single mat. For the remaining 5 minutes of practice she climbed up and down a wall ladder with a big smile on her face. She had fun. Even if only for 5 minutes. As we were packing up to go, the head coach walked over to us. She handed me a piece of paper to fill out and bring back next week. It was for recording size measurements. She smiled. \u201cThese are for the team  leotards .\u201d Like I said.

I have a slew of articles that detail strategies\u00a0for helping young children cope with deployments. All of these articles naturally assume that the child has the ability to speak and understand language. Hope will miss her daddy sorely, but I know she will be o.k. It\u2019s Rhema I wonder and worry about. How do I explain? Do I even  try  to explain? She will be aware of his absence, but she won\u2019t understand where or why he\u2019s gone. It\u2019s typical for children to display more behavior problems when a parent is deployed. Will this be the case for Rhema (times ten)? Brandon and I work hard to connect with Rhema when she is in the same room. It takes significant time and effort. How will Brandon maintain a connection when he is several time zones away? She does not do phones. When she was a baby, Brandon sent a few tapes. He used an old tape recorder and read her Bible stories and told her all about Iraq. I suppose we\u2019ll try that this time around. Even if she does not understand what is being said, at least she\u2019ll hear his voice. We\u2019ll try video as well, but I don\u2019t know if it will hold her attention. I read an  article  about an airman who organized a 5K run during Autism Awareness month while he was deployed to Iraq. He had a young son at home with autism. He was able to raise thousands of dollars as soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in Iraq participated in the run.\u00a0The father\u2019s\u00a0motivation for the event: \u201cIf I cannot be with him to support him and participate in his therapy, I want him to know, one day when he can understand, that wherever I am and whatever I am doing, my heart and soul are with him.\u201d Naturally, that statement gets to me, and\u00a0it reminds me of a love story.\u00a0One in which the Man\u00a0loves so much that He lays down His life. He breaks down the wall of separation.\u00a0His ministry is reconciliation. His very name is Emmanuel.  God with us. The Father says to his child:  It may seem like I\u2019m far away, but I have not left you. You may not understand it all right now, but no matter what you may face, I am with you! Not for a moment have you left my heart, my thoughts, my love. \u201cWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d Romans 8:35; 38-39  \u201c\u2026And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\u201d Matt 28:20  \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u201d Heb 13:5 \u00a0 And so, we take heart!

I chased her into a kitchen where two women were chatting and cleaning up. I heard: \u201c\u2026 So hard\u2026 But their daughter Hope?\u00a0Now  that  one is smart.\u201d Her voice held an It\u2019s-such-a-pity tone. She looked up in surprise when she saw me. I knew that they had been discussing my family, my daughters. I knew the woman meant well; she was speaking out of concern. She just didn\u2019t know. (I used to think \u201csmart\u201d only came in one flavor, as well. When I graduated from Dartmouth, I thought I was pretty smart. Since then God has humbled me \u2013 largely through my children \u2013 and taught me about  wisdom .) \u00a0 Rhema raced over to a cabinet filled with glasses. I caught her before she could accidentally break a glass. Then she darted out of the kitchen, and\u00a0I followed close behind. Sigh. I wanted to get the chance to say, \u201cRhema is smart, too. No, she does not really speak. She\u2019s still learning how to point. We\u2019re still working on non-verbal imitation. Still working on object labeling. Still trying to teach her to sit and attend; to identify colors, numbers, letters, animals, etc. Still trying to teach her how to draw a straight a line. But she is so smart, so wise. In spite of continuous electrical activity in the brain \u2013 comparable to a radio station losing its signal over and over again \u2013 she has managed to learn. In spite of auditory processing problems, she understands that when I say \u201cI love you\u201d, she is loved. In spite of sensory integration issues, she is learning how to navigate this world and make it through a day. In spite of a broken communication system, she is a master problem solver and comes up with resourceful ways to get the things she  needs and wants\u2026 everyday. If you could really consider all of the challenges she faces, you would be amazed, like me, at how much she has learned, how well she has done. She\u2019s  brilliant , I tell you.\u00a0 Oh. And she\u2019s a puzzle whiz.\u201d \n\u00a0 Anyway, that\u2019s what I wanted to say. \u00a0 This is what the LORD says: \n\u201cLet not the wise man boast of his wisdom \nor the strong man boast of his strength \nor the rich man boast of his riches, \nbut let him who boasts boast about this: \nthat he understands and knows me, \nthat I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, \njustice and righteousness on earth, \nfor in these I delight.\u201d Jer 9:23-24 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3:17"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/smart/", "title": "Smart"},

{"date": "May 20, 2009", "body": "\u201cCommunication is difficult without the grasp and execution of appropriate greetings and responses.\u201d \u00a0 Rhema\u2019s after school team of therapists have introduced a greeting program. That is, Rhema is prompted to actually say hi or bye appropriately. Eye contact is preferred, but currently not required. I am thrilled about the new program, but surprised at the emotions it has uncovered. When Rhema was younger, she would not acknowledge others around her. A marching band in the living room\u00a0might\u00a0not elicit a response. Greetings were completely lost on her. Even today, unless you are a familiar face \u2013 with a goody perhaps \u2013 she will not \u201cnotice\u201d if you have entered the room.\u00a0 I remember I would pick her up from the nursery with the other moms, and the children would squeal and yell their parents\u2019 names. My child would not look up from the piece of string she was flapping.\u00a0 Brandon and I went away for a weekend once, and I missed Rhema terribly.\u00a0 When we returned, I was overjoyed to see her, but she seemed unfazed, indifferent \u2013 as if she could take or leave me.\u00a0 Then there were the times when a therapist would ask her, \u201cWhere\u2019s Mommy?\u201d I would feel self-conscious and silly, hoping that she would by chance look in my direction. I realize that with Rhema\u2019s new greeting program, I still feel the pain of what I perceived as her rejection of me. Today Mr. Tim (one of the best ABA therapists I have ever known) met us in the waiting room, ready to take Rhema back for her session. \u201cSay bye-bye to Mom, Rhema.\u201d \u201cBye bye, Rhema.\u201d I\u00a0sound cheerful, but\u00a0I\u00a0am raw and vulnerable. \u00a0I do a little wave and wait.\u00a0And wait. And wait. Mr. Tim prompts again. \u201cSay bye-bye to Mom, Rhema.\u201d Rhema does the wet noodle, dropping to the floor. I begin to feel a little self-conscious, standing there, in front of the other moms in the waiting room. These mothers totally \u201cget this.\u201d\u00a0 They understand. But I think that surely all of their children happily run to them at the end of a therapy visit and say \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d Mr. Tim stands Rhema to her feet, and I stoop in front of her. She won\u2019t look at me. \u201cBye, bye. Rhema.\u201d\u00a0 I wave. She begins to climb me. As if I am a rock wall. Mr. Tim rights her again and gently tries to get her to look in my direction. \u201cSay bye-bye to Mom, Rhema.\u201d Oh Tim. It\u2019s o.k. We can give up now. Time\u2019s a-waistin\u2019\u2026 But Tim won\u2019t give up.\u00a0 He prompts her again. Finally, she manages a \u201cBuh buh buh.\u201d O.k. good enough. Thanks Tim. Thanks Rhema. \u201cTry again, buddy,\u201d Tim coaxes. Rhema turns her head back and forth. She is fidget queen. Clearly, she wants to break away from Tim\u2019s grasp and  run .\u00a0 This is so hard for her. \u201cTry again, buddy.\u201d Finally, finally. It comes out. In her sweet angel whisper. \u201cBye. bye.\u201d \u201cGood job, Rhema!\u201d And off they go, leaving Mom a tad emotional. \u00a0 Brandon was laughing at me because I was trying to find \u201cGod greetings\u201d in the Bible. Greetings are so important \u2013 anytime you study a foreign language some of the first words you learn are hola and adios, amigo. I believe with all my heart that God longs to commune and communicate with us\u2026  that He does not hide His face\u2026 that we are never rejected\u2026 that He said \u201cHi\u201d and started the conversation a long time ago. But there seems to\u00a0be no place in the Bible where God just sort of shows up with a \u2018Hello\u2019 or\u00a0\u2018Yo\u2019 or \u2018Wazzup.\u2019 Well, maybe there is a place. In Matthew 28, there is a hi and bye of sorts. After Jesus has risen from the grave, He greets His disciples,  \u201cAll hail.\u201d  According to commentaries I\u2019ve read, the word  hail  here means  rejoice  \u2014\u00a0\u201ca term of salutation connected with the word joy \u2013 \u00a0joy at his resurrection and at meeting them again.\u201d\u00a0 So the one documented God-greeting I found in the Bible simply means\u2026 rejoice. How perfect. Every time my children greet me, I will try to remember the Lord\u2019s simple\u00a0salutation:  Rejoice! \u00a0 And I will rejoice. (Rhema\u2019s \u2018hi\u2019 is certainly reason for joy, but I will also rejoice in the fact of a risen Savior!) At the end of that chapter and book (Matt. 28), Jesus also says \u201cBye bye\u201d (before his ascent to heaven).\u00a0 The last part of His \u201cBye bye\u201d is:\u00a0 \u201c And surely , \u00a0I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/05/20/his-and-byes/", "title": "Hi\u2019s and Bye\u2019s"},

Phil 4:6 \u00a0 Hope has shown me how much a little kid can want.

When she was younger she used to tantrum all the time it seemed.\u00a0 The books and professionals explained that the meltdowns were largely due to her frustration over being unable to communicate her needs and desires. As she has gotten older, the tantrums have decreased, thankfully. Usually, she is calmer, more patient. Recently, I have actually been concerned about the lack of tantrums. Has she gotten  used  to the frustration?\u00a0 Has she resigned herself to the fact that she will not receive the things she wants?\u00a0 Is she slowly giving up on trying to articulate her requests? That would be so sad\u2026 \u00a0 One evening last week we were driving home from an ABA therapy session. I had a small bag of marshmallows in the car. The marshmallows are only used as reinforcers during therapy visits, but it had been a long day and Rhema had worked so hard. So at a red light, I reached back and handed her a few marshmallows. I drove along, lost in my own thoughts. Her soft, sweet whisper snapped me out of my daydream. \u201cMore.\u00a0 More, more.\u201d\u00a0 Her head was down and she was looking at her hands. She kept whispering \u2018more\u2019, almost as if she were talking to herself. I cannot tell how many times I have knelt before her, held a desired object just out of her reach, and modeled the word \u201cMore.\u201d I have signed it, I have said it, I have shown her the  PECS  symbol for it. And then hoped so hard it left me dizzy that even just the \u201cm\u201d sound would escape her lips. But there it was. A spontaneous request for more. Meaningful and appropriate. Unprompted; I did not say it first. I pulled over as soon as I could. Happy? More than I can say. \u201cYou said  more , Rhema!\u00a0 More marshmallows!\u201d\u00a0 (She is doing so well lately.)

{"date": "May 11, 2009", "body": "Rhema went through a phase in which she was extremely sensitive to various types of clothing. She loathed socks and shoes, shirt sleeves had to be pushed up, and pants with buttons or zippers or anything \u201cheavy\u201d were not tolerated. No hard or scratchy materials, no tags.\u00a0 For her, dresses were absolutely out of the question. But in my mind, she  had  to wear a dress to church on Sunday. That was my thinking, anyway. From the moment the ultrasound technician declared she was a girl, my mother and sisters had stocked the closet full of beautiful, elegant dresses. Nowadays, people do not really get dressed up for church, but I grew up in a culture where you always wore your Sunday best to service. It was not about vanity; it was about revering God and trying to give God your best. Even though church happened once a week, every Sunday service\u00a0qualified as\u00a0a special occasion. O.k., so it was about vanity. For me for Rhema, at least. She\u2019s the granddaughter of a pastor, for heaven\u2019s sake. She may hurdle the pews, color her face with an ink pen, spill juice, stick her head in a wind tunnel and mess her hair Medusa style, but she was going to do it in a fancy dress, dagnabbit!!! And so the battle would rage on Sunday mornings. I would\u00a0launch a\u00a0surreptitious attack:\u00a0\u00a0 1) Give her a popsicle 2) Ever so casually slip on a tagless, cotton T-shirt 3) Quickly come from behind and throw her dress over top, hoping the fabric would not offend. It would offend. She was like a pig in a dress, contorting, thrashing, tantrumming and nearly ripping the dress off, popping buttons, tearing lace. Then we would repeat the steps, she and I. If I managed to get her buckled in her carseat with a dress on, she would disrobe as soon as she was free. Finally, one morning during Dress War, Brandon said quite simply, \u201cJust let her wear pants.\u201d What????!!!! The thought had never crossed my mind. He gave me a look that said, \u2018It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u2019 We were already late for church and I was battle weary, so I finally waved the white flag of surrender. I knew it was my pride.\u00a0 Rhema was already so obviously different.\u00a0 Her special needs made her different. Her diet made her different (she\u2019s the only kid with GF pretzels while the others eat animal crackers). I didn\u2019t want her to be the only girl without a dress on.\u00a0 Especially when she had a closet full! She was down to one or two pairs of \u201csoft\u201d pants that she actually kept on (sometimes). She always wore them to school, so they were worn and faded. But for months she wore those same pathetic pants to church every week. One child at church\u00a0always liked to point out that \u2018Rhema wore that last Sunday.\u2019 It sounds silly now, and it was.\u00a0 But my mind was set on the way things should be.\u00a0 So many of my  expectations  for my \u201cperfect\u201d family and my \u201cperfect\u201d kids seemed to be crushed, and this dress thing was something I was trying to hold on to like a stubborn child [thanks,  Shanda !]. Truly, it was me who was done up on the outside, but undone on the inside.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe LORD sees not as man sees. Man looks at the outward  appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.\u201d 1 Sam 16:7 Looking back, I am now grateful that this is one of the small ways God had to humble me.\u00a0 Of course, there have been other expectations for her life \u2013 our lives \u2013 that I have had to re-adjust (such as \u201ctypical\u201d kidnergarten \u2014 that was a hard one for me). But lately, my focus has shifted to see all the ways\u00a0God goes beyond my expectations. Rhema is my shining example, and every day she makes me proud. More times than not, she manages to do something I think she\u2019s not ready for, and she does it  well . Just when I think I\u2019ve got her figured out, she\u2019ll surprise me with something new.\u00a0 At first, autism crushed my expectations. Funny thing is, now, my expectations are greater than ever before. My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from  Him . Psalm 62:5 \n \n \n Rhema on Easter 2009.

Your mother surprised me\u2014although as soon as I saw her face, I knew what she was about to say. I remember her beaming face. You were so small then. Smaller than my pinky fingernail. Yep, definitely smaller than that. I was speechless, so speechless that your mother had to ask if I was excited. Oh, I was, I just don\u2019t show excitement too much thinking it to reveal my immaturity. I imagined the cradle your mother\u2019s body was. I was so concerned for her for she never sits still. Then you started to make a bump of your mother\u2019s tummy. I watched you grow from inside. One day, we went to the doctor and I got to watch you sleep inside mommy as you were growing. My goodness. It was a miracle. I looked at those pictures of you resting inside Mommy often while I was away. I had to go to Iraq to protect you, which meant I wasn\u2019t there when you were born. But, I am coming home soon. I can\u2019t wait to hold you. I can\u2019t wait to try to teach you something. I can\u2019t wait until you recognize me. I can\u2019t wait until you scream \u201cdaddy\u201d when I come through the door. I can\u2019t wait until you are old enough to know about Jesus. (I pray you accept Him at a young age and follow Him forever.) I can\u2019t wait until I see you play sports. I can\u2019t wait to see you sing. I can\u2019t wait to see you make us all proud as you head off to college. I can\u2019t wait to see you accomplish a million things your mother and father didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t wait to see you married to a Godly husband. I can\u2019t wait to see you and your family (my grandchildren) take on the world for Christ. But, I have to wait. I don\u2019t want to rush any moments. I want to slow down and cherish each second.  Your daddy loves you with all his heart.  I hope I get to be your hero. Love, \nDaddy \n Just wanted you to know, dear Brandon, that you\u2019re her hero. Remember the sign that was posted in the old gym in Germany at your homecoming from war?  Even though, you are still waiting to hear her scream \u201cDaddy!\u201d, you are her hero.

It is incredibly hard for me now to see her struggle with pain. It kills me to be so helpless. \u00a0 Her husband was out of town, and I knew we needed to go to the hospital. I thought I was going to be a basket case. I had myself one good cry, and she did, too.\u00a0 And then she was, as she always is, beautiful and strong. Now, several days later, the pain and discomfort for my sister remain. Simple things like walking, standing on her toes, putting weight on her heels, writing with her left hand are difficult. We still believe in the power of God to  mend . \u00a0 This morning I was driving my friend, Deb, into Boston for her infusion. She is a patient at the same clinic as my sister, and she was telling me about her on-going battle with MS. Her voice was hoarse: \u201cWhen I was in rehab all those months and could not walk, it was really, really hard. But you know what? I never lost my praise.\u201d Praise. To commend, to applaud or magnify. To worship and adore, lift up and glorify the Lord, the only One who is worthy. In the midst of the storm, in spite of the storm\u2026 Praise. I never lost my praise,  she said. My sister and I say in unison (people always think it\u2019s cool when twins say something in unison): Me neither. \u00a0 \u00a0 Strengthen the feeble hands, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0steady the knees that give way; \nsay to those with fearful hearts, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBe strong, do not fear; \nyour God will come\u2026 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he will come to save you.\u201d\u00a0 Then will the eyes of the blind be opened \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and the ears of the deaf unstopped.\u00a0 \nThen will the lame leap like a deer, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and the mute tongue shout for joy. \nWater will gush forth in the wilderness \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and streams in the desert.

{"date": "June 22, 2009", "body": "We\u2019ve managed to accrue a few of those toy laptops over the years. There\u2019s the Barbie one, the VTech one, and the Disney Princess one. I tried once, a long, long time ago to teach Rhema how to play with the laptop. But I became\u00a0discouraged quickly, because it turned into a \u201chand war\u201d with her trying to push all the buttons while I tried to stop her from pushing all the buttons. She was so focused on the buttons that I could not get her to look at the screen. (A little  joint attention \u00a0would have been helpful). The same is true for looking at books together \u2013 we always end up in a hand war. So Rhema just perseverates on the laptop toy, turning it off and on, pushing the same button repeatedly until I take it away from her. For a year, I have not attempted to show her how to use it correctly. Just assumed she couldn\u2019t. A couple nights ago, Rhema found the VTech laptop in my bedroom. On the spur of the moment, I sat down on the bed, put her in my lap and opened the computer. The hand war ensued as we battled over the On/Off button. Then she stopped trying to press the button, and instead tapped her hand to her chest two times. I immediately recognized the gesture as her saying \u201cfor me\u201d in sign language. Years ago we tried teaching her some sign language, but it just didn\u2019t take. (Her poor motor planning and lack of receptive language made it very difficult). But here she was signing \u201cfor me\u201d, and I understood that it was her way of saying \u201cmy turn.\u201d So I let her turn the laptop off and on. Then it was my turn, and I managed to quickly get us into an alphabet letter identification game. Suddenly I was determined to teach Rhema how to appropriately play with this laptop. Rhema knows some, or most, of her letters\u2026 we think. (She will repeat some letters if we prompt her, but we never know for sure if she\u2019s just repeating or if she really knows them.) The first letter that appeared on the screen was a \u2018D\u2019. I was holding Rhema\u2019s hands so that she could not turn it off. I cautiously let go of one hand to see what she would do. She signed \u201cmy turn.\u201d (Amazing!) Then she casually ran her fingers over the keys and deliberately pressed the letter \u2018D\u2019. Oh my gosh. She did it.  I almost fell off the bed. But then she was turning the laptop off and on again. I caught her hands, got us back into the game and waited for the next letter. \n\u2018R.\u2019 I  know  Rhema knows the letter R. But I still did not know if she understood that she had to press the R key. She did. She did! Don\u2019t get excited. Let\u2019s try another letter. \u2018I\u2019 She skimmed her fingers along the keyboard, found the \u2018I\u2019 key and pressed it. She started stimming on the I key, pressing it repeatedly. But I didn\u2019t care. I grabbed her and spun her around. \u201cGood job, Rhema. You did it! You did it!!!\u201d She looked a little bored, not nearly as excited as me. It was if she was saying, \u201cWoman, chill. What? You didn\u2019t think I knew how to play this?\u201d We played with it for another half hour. I had to continually break her out of stimming patterns, but she definitely \u201cgot\u201d the game and only made a couple mistakes. \u2018Cause you\u2019re a wonder child \nLiving in a world that\u2019s all surprise \nAnd you make me see things through your eyes \nWonder child, this I know \nIt\u2019s no wonder that I love you so \nWonder child, wonder child (-Old Sesame Street song) \u00a0 I recently told my friend Cha that Rhema had moved to a new level of  PECS  at school. She is now working on  attributes , specifically colors. So if she wants a red popsicle, she must build the sentence \u201cI want \u2013 red \u2013 popsicle\u201d using her PECS symbols. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how she does, because we\u2019re not even sure she knows her colors. But that girl, she keeps teaching me again and again to never underestimate her.\u201d I said \u201cI bet she does know her colors,\u201d Cha said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least.\u201d You know what?

At that time, Brandon and I were going through a grieving process of sorts.\u00a0 Our bright-eyed little girl who used to laugh and clap and say \u201cHi\u201d on the phone was now distant,\u00a0unreachable and painfully silent.

{"date": "June 23, 2009", "body": "I realized that not all homes are Rhema-proofed when\u00a0we visited my sister over a year ago. Rhema and her older cousin Lexi were sitting in the living room watching TV, while my sister and I prepared dinner. The girls were being \u201cwatched\u201d by my brother-in-law in the living room.\u00a0Rhema was in a T-shirt and her\u2026 unmentionables. She always removes her pants to get comfortable. (It\u2019s still humorous to us when we visit someone\u2019s house, and Rhema takes off her pants as soon as we get in the door. The host will always say, \u201cOh! Does she need to use the restroom?\u201d \u201cNope,\u201d we say, \u201cShe\u2019s just making herself at home.\u201d) I was chopping tomatoes, and my sister and I were laughing about something in the kitchen. I suddenly realized that her husband was in the kitchen laughing along with us. Instantly, I  knew . I ran into the living room. Lexi was in her same spot on the couch, mesmerized by the TV. Rhema was long gone, and the front door to the house was swinging wide open. The adults ran out of the house, up and down the streets, calling Rhema\u2019s name. I remembered a Nicholas Sparks book I\u2019d read years before I had children called  The Rescue . It was\u00a0about a young, speech-delayed boy lost in the woods in the middle of a storm. The mother was a nervous wreck because she knew the boy might not answer to his name being called.  Just like Rhema,  I thought . She won\u2019t call out, she won\u2019t respond to her name. How will we find her? Thankfully, mercifully, it did not take long to find her. She was beneath the deck of a house, crouched on the gravel. I found her there, barefoot, with no pants, happily playing with rocks. I\u2019m here to tell this story so I guess I did not have a heart attack. \u00a0 Rhema, is for the most part, fearless. She has no sense of danger. She bolts. She wanders, although I believe she has a destination in mind \u2013 (a park she saw once or a curious tree we passed in the car), she\u00a0seems to\u00a0have\u00a0no real concept of space and time. She\u2019s quite determined, quite resourceful, and we now have more than enough  escape artist  stories.\u00a0Although she has gotten so much better at responding to her name, she cannot  tell  you her name if asked. So. After brainstorming with  Carrie , whose daughter wears an ID necklace,\u00a0\u00a0I would like to present\u00a0my latest attempt at risk management: \u00a0 Medical ID bracelets from  N-Style ID . Both girls have them. Hope\u2019s bracelet lists her multiple food allergies and asthma. Rhema\u2019s has her name and phone numbers. (Of course,\u00a0Rhema did not want to wear it at first but seems to have adjusted.) Our next step\u00a0is\u00a0to use\u00a0the\u00a0 MedicAlert  system, which uses an RF tag and can contact families within minutes of a child\u2019s disappearance.

When she was a baby, I was baffled by the fact that she did not sleep. I thought that babies slept, and mine simply did not. She was colicky and seemed uncomfortable in her own skin. Just as she would start to fall asleep, she would flail and shake. Even when swaddled, she would shake. Sometimes, she would briefly turn purple. I was a clueless, new mother. I read books for advice. I tried home remedies and supplements. Nothing seemed to work, and my baby would scream at me all night long. When I called the nurse, she always brushed it off as colic and suggested I try the things I had already tried. Brandon was in Iraq at the time and there were so many long, sleepless nights, that I seriously feared I might lose my mind, or even worse, hurt my baby. (I suspect I had postpartum depression and did not even realize it.) There was a television channel called PAX that featured a program from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.\u00a0 It was simply Scripture verses set to instrumental music and nature scenes. I could not hear the music over the crying, but I could read the words. The program was my lifeline during those long nights. (Some time later I wrote the program creators a letter and sent a donation \u2013 I\u00a0basically told them they saved my life.) \u00a0 Fast forward a couple years later and\u00a0we are sitting in the neurologist\u2019s office at Children\u2019s Hospital. He tells us that Rhema\u2019s EEG results indicate that she is experiencing continuous epileptic activity during sleep. The doctor is excited in a wierd sort of way. He shows us graphs and highlighted images of her brain: In drowsiness, the electrical discharges increase in \u201crhythmicity and frequency.\u201d In the transition from sleeping to waking, there is even more epileptic activity\u2026 on both sides of the brain. One report states that they were unable to get a normal reading for more than 2 seconds.  \u2018This is a very abnormal study\u2019 , it reads \u2026  \u2018Landau-Kleffner syndrome.\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget that day, sitting next to Brandon, with baby Hope in my arms and Rhema, in her own world, pinging off the walls. It was a day where everything finally made sense and absolutely nothing made sense. And I felt tired, achingly tired. \u00a0 Fast forward to today. Rhema has been unable to sleep, really sleep, for the past month and a half.\u00a0 She is up all hours of the night, screaming in frustration, crying, laughing hysterically, humming, babbling, crashing, banging, pounding her feet against\u00a0the headboard. For safety reasons, we\u2019ve had to remove everything from her room except the bed and a few books (in which she has torn the pages) \u2013 the dresser, toybox, even the light bulbs are gone. She goes through phases like this, and she amazes me with her ability to function during the day and even do well in school and therapy on little to no sleep. But this latest run has been particularly brutal. As I lay in bed, listening to Rhema\u2019s antics, it\u2019s heartbreaking for me to wonder about the electrical storm raging in her brain. Lately, it\u2019s taking a toll and we\u2019re seeing an increase in meltdowns, aggression and even self-injurious behavior. \u00a0 \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.\u201d Matt. 11:28-29  \u00a0 I\u2019m for real here. I\u2019m not trying to be Happy Christian or toss out pat Bible verses. Our load is heavy, the road stretches out looooonnnngggg before us, and we get weary. I\u2019m angry in the morning at the huge circles under my eyes.\u00a0 But there is a rest for the soul. And I\u2019ve found it only in God. It is a grace-given, saving\u00a0rest that does not depend on external circumstances. For me it is rooted in the fact that I know the Lord is faithful and true. Time and again, He has blessed us with provision, guidance and  miracles ,  big  and  small .\u00a0 In the words of a favorite song, \u201cI can\u2019t remember a trial or a pain He did not recycle to bring me gain. I can\u2019t remember one single regret in serving God only and trusting His hand.\u201d A rested soul can refresh a weary body. His promise, when we come to Him, is literally,\u00a0 I will rest you. \u00a0 So tomorrow, it\u2019s back to Children\u2019s for a 24-hour EEG. Although we will have to wait for some of the results, I suspect an increase in her current anti-seizure meds is on the horizon. \u00a0 Meanwhile, I\u2019m learning to rest. \u00a0 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.

I know that some of you are not \u201creligious\u201d, and I appreciate you for being willing to read my posts anyway. My faith in Christ, my dependence on the Bible colors everything I see and do. So when I was a young girl, there was one particular Scripture that was my  plea , given my tendency for catastrophe: (Often muttered feverishly in my best Anne voice), \u201cBe merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me\u2026 in the shadow of thy wings will I take my refuge, until these  calamities  be overpast.\u201d As I got older, the mishaps all but disappeared.

I was Green Gables no longer; I was Avonlea.\u00a0 God has quite a sense of humor, though, because then He sent me Rhema. The day Psalm 57:1 came back into my life was the day I had to take Rhema and Hope down to the DMR (Department of Mental Retardation) office. Although I had already completed oodles of paperwork, I was told that I would need to bring Rhema into the office and answer more questions. I knew it was going to be interesting. I met with a woman we\u2019ll call\u2026 Patience. I entered her nice, neat office with Rhema and Hope in tow. Hope was content to sit in the stroller while Patience and I sat at a round table. Rhema sat on a couch in the office with a coloring book. One minute into the interview, Rhema climbed onto the back of the couch and began eating plastic grapes off the fake cornucopia arrangement on the wall. She would NEVER eat a real grape, but plastic ones are all the rage. She clawed at the wall decoration as I pulled her down.\u00a0A myriad of\u00a0plastic grapes rolled onto the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s o.k., it\u2019s o.k\u2026.\u201d said Patience. \u201cYou know, I have a puzzle that she might like.\u201d It was an old wooden puzzle, and Rhema was instantly interested. We continued the interview, and I signed paperwork as fast as I could. Minutes later, Rhema began to wail, frustrated with something. Perhaps she was hungry for more plastic fruit? I jumped up and walked over to the couch. Rhema picked up the puzzle board and flung it. She did not realize I was right in front of her and the puzzle board hit me across the bridge of my nose, right between my eyes. I saw stars. And the pain quickly turned into a headache. I gingerly touched my head. There was blood. Must. Keep. My. Cool. I blindly reached down into the back of the stroller and grabbed a tissue for my cut. Time to pull out the big guns, I thought as I\u00a0pulled out the portable DVD player with a Dora video \u2026aka \u201clast resort.\u201d I quickly turned on the DVD player, handed Rhema some raisins and a juice box and we were good to go. Patience and I continued the interview. Then Rhema spilled her juice in her lap. Oh no. Instantly she stood and removed her pants, underwear, socks and shoes. I tried to put her pants on. She took them off. I put them on. She took them off. I tried to reason with her. There was no way, absolutely no way she was putting slightly wet pants on. Dumb me did not have spare clothes for her. I ALWAYS have spare clothes, but of course not on the day I actually need them. At this point, Hope began wailing because she could not hear Dora because Rhema was tantrumming\u2026 in the buff. That\u2019s when it started. I heard someone muttering feverishly,  \u201cBe merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me\u2026 in the shadow of thy wings will I take my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.\u201d \u00a0Anne, is that you?\u00a0 Then I realized it was me. \u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s o.k., It\u2019s o.k.\u201d Patience\u2019s words snapped me out of it. I looked at her. Huh? \u201cIt\u2019s o.k.,\u201d she said. So I went back to the table to complete the paperwork for eligibility into the Autism Division of DMR. I glanced over. There stood Rhema, eyes fixed on the Dora video, bare bottom and all. Yes, there she stood, daughter of The\u00a0Queen Of Couth,\u00a0with nothing but a T-shirt on, in a (once) nice and neat office.\u00a0A\u00a0wall\u00a0ornament hanging by a thread, spilled juice, and plastic grapes and puzzle pieces scattered over the floor. In a matter of minutes. And I? I\u00a0had a\u00a0huge bloody welt between my eyebrows. \u201cSo do we qualify?\u201d I joked. I am quite certain that Patience never forgot us.

{"date": "April 16, 2009", "body": "Hope\u2019s latest blood test confirmed that she still has very severe, multiple food allergies. I was really,  really  disappointed. When your child has allergic reactions to foods with egg, wheat, dairy, soy and nuts \u2013 sometimes by simply touching them \u2013 it\u2019s not always\u00a0easy living.  This  is what food allergies have done to Hope. We\u2019ve\u00a0also been concerned for some time about Hope having difficulty breathing. (One trip to the ER a few months ago yielded a verdict of bronchitis). After a scary episode one night last week, I took her to the doctor again. They took one listen to her lungs, and the next thing I knew I was loaded down with a pediatric mask and chamber, 2 inhalers, an action plan, a prescription for Singulair, another EpiPen, and a children\u2019s book called  \u201cThe ABC\u2019s of Asthma.\u201d \u201cOh, and I\u2019m sending you to a dermatologist because it looks like she has  alopecia ,\u201d tossed out the doctor as she noted a couple bald spots on Hope\u2019s head. Wah. I joked to my friend that my family has growing a list of \u201cA\u201d disorders \u2013 autism, allergies, asthma, alopecia\u2026 It could be worse. So much worse. I am so thankful that the medical issues for both our children are relatively benign and manageable. But sometimes we get weary and overwhelmed in the  managing \u2026. Whenever we leave the house we are always on high alert for Hope, looking for foods that could possibly send her in to anaphylaxis. Now we must also be aware of triggers that may leave her struggling for breath. And it goes without saying that the  autismometer  is always in gear for Rhema who never stops moving and seems to have no sense of danger or boundaries. Even in our home, we have to be on high alert. Rhema has the physical ability and sense of independence of a five-year old, but her mind has not yet caught up to the way certain things work. I know many can relate when I say, if the walls in my house could speak, they would have a fascinating blog. Just before Brandon returned home from his deployment to Iraq in \u201905, spouses in the unit were encouraged to go through \u201cre-integration training.\u201d I re-call the instructor giving the following scenario: \n Imagine you are driving along in your car, listening to the radio. You go through a green light, and someone in a car perpendicular to you runs a red light. You hit the breaks just in time as the car races by barely missing you. Your heart is pounding, your throat is dry. Even as you resume driving, your breathing is fast and your heart is racing. Imagine living in that elevated state for a whole year. That is what it has been like for your deployed spouse in the war. I think, to some degree, that scenario fits anyone who loves and cares for someone who is ill or disabled or has special needs. You may get used to it, but the stressors are very real and very constant. Sometimes the first step is simply recognizing that the stressors are there. (For me that means saying out loud that Superwoman doesn\u2019t live at my address. And, oh yeah, Superman doesn\u2019t live here either so maybe I could cut the man some slack.) Anyway, Hope is her name. And she is the best stress-buster I know. Just when we feel stretched to the limit\u2026 with\u00a0one look, one word, one smile, one giggle, one song, she gives me and her Daddy a heaping dose of Hope. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

I jumped out of her top bunk and headed out the door. As I went out, I heard  \u2018Iiii yew\u2019  in her sing-song voice. She had been doing the \u201cvocal stimming\u201d thing all day long.

When we got to the ER on Saturday, her blood oxygen level was dangerously low, and her heart rate was very fast. She was put on steroids and received \u201cintensive breathing treatments\u201d every two hours. Hope was her same Hope-ful self, even at her worst, dazzling the hospital staff. And once she was feeling better, the girl pretty much had a blast. She had the nurses on the floor wrapped around her finger. She would  ask  to have her temperature taken. She was given a stethoscope, and she checked everyone else\u2019s lungs many, many times a day. She giggled through her nebulizer treatments and politely demanded that her Dora doll receive breathing treatments as well. She always said thank you.\u00a0She could not eat a single bit of hospital food (except an apple) because she was allergic to everything on the menu (but that\u2019s o.k. because the food was  really  bad). She always said \u2018Hello Doctor\u2019 to the custodian, who always muttered back, \u2018I wish.\u2019 She kept us laughing the entire weekend. I loved her even more.

After 24 hrs. of EEG monitoring this week, the seizure activity\u00a0was at\u00a065% of the time, mainly occurring when she is asleep. The disappointing news is that Rhema does not seem to be responding to her anti-convulsant medication. Now we are trying to decide if we should just take her off the meds altogether. She has an MRI scheduled in 10 days and perhaps that will give us more answers. In any case, we are reminded of just how limited we are as humans. As we pray and trust the Lord to make Rhema better, we know that He is the only one who knows her body detail by detail (Matthew 10:30). She is His. A couple picts below.

Share about something that trips a memory in your journey with your child or children, or just a memory that is special to you. The memory can be happy, sad, or anything in between. If you don\u2019t have time to write specifically for this prompt, feel free to share a post that matters to you from your archives. \n This is a journal entry from last year that I wanted to share: \u00a0 After a long day I tuck her into bed. \u00a0  I know that Rhema hears sounds in a unique way. \u00a0  If she repeats a sound or word, it is exactly in the same pitch, rhythm and inflection that she heard it. \u00a0  In \u201cautism vocabulary\u201d, it\u2019s called scripting, a form of echolalia. \u00a0  Although she scripts, her pronunciation and articulation are so poor that she often sounds like a deaf person when she speaks \u2013 it\u2019s as if she cannot hear her own sounds. \u00a0  And she does not seem to understand the words her sounds have formed. \u00a0  Additionally, her voice has that sing-songy timbre characteristic of autism. \u00a0  So I said the words \u201cI love you\u201d in a high-pitched voice exactly the way the baby bear in her talking book said it. \u00a0  Just hoping she would repeat the words. \u00a0  I tell Rhema I love her over and over \u2013 all the time. \u00a0  But I don\u2019t know if she even knows what it means, if she associates the phrase with a feeling of warmth, affection and specialness I try to convey to her. \u00a0  I try to make her  feel  my love when I say the words. \u00a0  But I don\u2019t know if she gets it. \u00a0  Anyway this night I just needed to hear her say the words, even if she were just repeating meaningless sounds. \u00a0  If I could just hear her attempt the words I would pretend that she was telling me she loved me. \u00a0  So again and again I said  I love you  as I readied her for bed. \u00a0  Waiting for a response. \u00a0  Waiting. \u00a0  When the tucking was done, I sighed and went to turn out the light. \u00a0  She burrowed her head in her sheet and finally repeated in the same baby bear voice,  \u201cI uv ou.\u201d \u00a0  My heart soared. \u00a0  It may be a long time before I ever hear her attempt the words again. \u00a0  In the future I may doubt it even happened. \u00a0  But tonight I indulge in the fact that my baby girl loves me and she told me so.

{"date": "May 8, 2008", "body": "I had been looking for a certified ABA therapist to work with Rhema at home.  A few weeks ago, a wonderful therapist came over to meet and observe Rhema for a couple hours. We did not make a very good first impression, I\u2019m afraid. Rhema did not seem to know what to do with herself and was very sensory-seeking \u2013 running around, purposefully falling on the floor, and crashing into the couch cushions.  Rhema is on the hyper side, but this was a whole new level, as she was completely unable to focus.  At one point I pulled out the mini trampoline in an effort to re-direct some of her energy, and my darling child bent over and took a BITE out of the side of the trampoline.  Wow. We took her outside on the swings and Rhema did much better. However, when it was time to come in, she went into major meltdown mode.  Rhema is usually pretty good about transitions, but of course not on this day when I wanted her to be an adorable angel for our new therapist.  (I should know better by now.) Rhema\u2019s screaming escalated to the point where I knew that the only way she would calm down was to put her in her bedroom for a time out.  Rhema quickly quieted upstairs, but I left her in her room so that the therapist and I could have a chance to talk.  After about 10 minutes, it was time for the therapist to leave so I told her that I would bring Rhema down to say good-bye. As I went up to Rhema\u2019s room I assured myself that even though the day had not gone so smoothly, it was still salvageable.  And I could demonstrate how \u201cin control\u201d I was by bringing her down to say good-bye.  (Rhema\u2019s good-bye usually involves me holding her still and waving her hand \u2026 if we get eye contact, we\u2019re really doing good!) What I did not know was that behind her door, the following scene had unfolded.  Rhema had removed all of her clothing as well as the blanket and sheet from her bed.  She had dragged her mattress onto the floor, and then she peed on her mattress.  Her mattress has the plastic material you find on most crib mattresses, and there was a nice, large yellow puddle of urine. \n Before I go further, I should explain my 4-year old a bit more.  Rhema can find a way to have fun in whatever environment \u2013 even with limited resources she has an amazing imagination for all sorts of stunts.  Because Rhema\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d can be dangerous, we have removed everything from her room besides her bed and some toys\u2026 no dresser or bureau, no table or chairs, nothing that can be scaled.  While Rhema understands by now that she should not pee on the bed, I do not know if she fully understands that you just don\u2019t play with the stuff.  (See  Poop-art ). I opened the door in time to see my naked little girl take a running leap and dive gleefully onto the wet mattress.  The big yellow puddle splattered, and when she got up from the mattress, there were lots of little yellow puddles.  She cheered.  She had created her own Slip \u2018N Slide! Rhema was wet \u2013 her hair, her arms, her legs, her stomach.  Hope began to cry in the other room \u2013 the Slip \u2018n Slide fun had awakened her from her nap.  For a moment, I was so shocked and mortified that I truly did not know what to do. Instead of putting Rhema right in the bathtub, Silly Me quickly wrapped her in her blanket and marched her downstairs to say good-bye.  Manners first, after all.  I did not explain to the therapist what had happened, although I\u2019m sure she deduced something crazy had occurred and that it involved a bodily substance, because Rhema\u2019s hair was wet, she was wrapped in a blanket, and reeked to high heaven! \u201cSay bye, Rhema.  Bye-bye,\u201d I said while disentangling an arm from the blanket and flapping her hand for a wave. There.  Our freak show was complete. =} Thankfully, our therapist came back, and now that she has actually begun working with Rhema, things are going better.

He just decided all on his own that we are going to cold turkey stop consuming refined sugars for 31 days. When he informed me of this, I laughed in his face. When he shot me a look, I sobered up and agreed to his terms even while my mind was plotting.  On Monday, when he\u2019s at work I\u2019ll sneak to Dunkin Donuts and get one of those vanilla kreme donuts! I have not had a vanilla kreme donut for, like, 15 years at least. I used to love them as a kid. Somewhere along the way my metabolism slowed down, and I got older, wiser, and calorie conscious. But since I spent three long years in Germany away from\u00a0a Dunkin Donuts on every corner, I now feel that I am entitled to indulge, indulge, indulge.\u00a0German pastries are so not sweet, and I still feel jipped (even though I\u2019ve been back in New England for two years already!) Since it\u2019s all of a sudden \u201cNo Sweets Month\u201d, the vanilla kreme donut became my forbidden fruit. All weekend long I fantasized about the donut covered in powdered sugar and filled with thick, white cr\u00e8me that\u2019s so sugary that it makes your teeth hurt. How could you ever settle for a plain donut with a hole in it after having a plump donut so engorged with sugar and kreme that it was spilling out the side? Hope and I set out early this morning. I imagined myself wiping all the extra powdered sugar off my face after I\u2019d consumed my donut with one of the wipes from the diaper bag. \u201cSorry, Hope,\u201d I said as we pulled up to the drive-thru. \u201cI\u2019m about to eat something that would probably kill you, but boy, is it gonna be good.\u201d (Hope has severe food allergies \u2013 nuts, eggs, wheat, dairy, soy \u2013 but that\u2019s another blog post.) \u201cHi. I\u2019d like one vanilla kreme filled donut\u2026 no\u2026 make that two.\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any.\u201d \n\u201cOh, no.\u201d \n\u201cWould you like vanilla frosted?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d Pout. Undaunted we drove to the next Dunkin Donuts. We went through drive-thrus. We went to walk-ins. At the fourth store, it occurred to me that maybe the donut had been discontinued. Maybe while I was suffering in Germany with wanna-be pastries, they had removed my beloved donuts from the shelves. I wish someone would have just told me that instead of saying \u201cWe don\u2019t have any.\u201d I wanted to come home in complete violation of No Sweets Month. But alas, my cravings went unsatisfied. I even called Dunkin Donuts corporate headquarters and asked, \u201cHow could you?\u201d A woman on the phone told me that it was up to individual franchise owners to decide whether or not to carry the donut. (Well, that\u2019s a no-brainer). I was resolute. Ready to make a day of it, drive to the other side of the state for my donut. \u201cDo you know which franchises carry the vanilla kreme filled?\u201d \u201cNo, sorry.\u201d Sigh. My quest for 320 calories of sugar and saturated fat was suspended. (But if anyone knows of a Dunkin Donuts franchise that sells my donuts, lemme know!) Sometimes I have this annoying habit of reviewing past \u201cjips\u201d in life when I am denied something, something even as small as a donut desire. And I make it out to be so much bigger than it really is. Like when the high school lunch lady had it out for me and always gave me really small portions. (Seriously!) Like when I don\u2019t get what I paid for. Like when I don\u2019t get what I bargained for. Like when my twin got MS. Like when my daughter got autism and seizures. Like when my baby got just about every food allergy known to man. Just craving something sweet, God. Still feeling jipped. Then, in the span of five minutes, Hope reached for me and squealed, \u201cHi Mommmmmy!!!\u201d and left wonderful Hope-baby kisses all over my check. Then, when I opened the door to Rhema\u2019s school bus, she gave me the most beautiful smile I have ever seen.  Thank you, God. I. am. so. blessed.

{"date": "July 3, 2008", "body": "A quick update: \nWe had a meeting with Rhema\u2019s neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital today.  He believes that the ongoing seizure activity is interfering with Rhema\u2019s brain function.  She continues to have significant \u201cactivity\u201d on the left side of the brain \u2013 in the speech areas \u2013 as well as increasing activity on the right side.  Her current anti-epileptic medication is simply not working.   At the advice of our doctor, we have decided to begin weaning Rhema from the current drug.  Once weaned, she will start a new anti-epileptic medication called Keppra.  In August, we will do another overnight hospital stay in which a  24-hour EEG  will be performed to determine how well the Keppra is working.  I had really hoped to avoid switching her from drug to drug.  Hopefully, the Keppra will work for her. It is hard to know what\u2019s really driving the train here.  Is it the autism that makes it so difficult for her to speak and process language or is it the seizure activity?  Or both?   One thing I am confident of and that is, simply, God made her.  He created her brain in all its glory and complexity, He formed her mouth and tongue.  No matter how many doctors we see, or treatments and therapies we try, we know for certain that if our little one speaks it will be because of God and God alone. I love a Bible passage where God is revealed to Moses in the Burning Bush.  The Lord tells Moses that he will be the one to lead the people of Israel out of their captivity in Egypt.  Moses is full of questions and objections, but can you blame the guy?  He was just supposed to roll up into Pharaoh\u2019s house and tell him that God said to let the Israelites \u2013 the ones who had provided hundreds of years of slave labor \u2013 just pack up and leave?  This was no small task.     In Exodus 4:10-12: \n Moses said to the LORD, \u201cO Lord, I have never been eloquent\u2026 I am slow of speech and tongue.\u201d  The LORD said to him, \u201cWho gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD? Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.\u201d Moses was literally saying, You\u2019ve got the wrong guy.  I am not a man of words.  (Some believe that Moses did in fact have a speech impediment \u2013 Isn\u2019t it just like God to choose someone like that to demonstrate His power?).  God\u2019s response is simple: I made your mouth.  Don\u2019t you think that if I made the mouth and created the gift of speech, I can give you the ability to speak?  God gives those gifts, He can take away those gifts and restore them again \u2013 ultimately His purposes will be accomplished.  In another translation, God literally says to Moses,  I will be with your mouth  and teach you what you will say.   Wow, there\u2019s such a peace in that.  And it doesn\u2019t just have to apply to my family and our struggle with autism and epilepsy.  For those of us who know the Truth of Christ, we must share it and live it.  But we also have the gift of speech, and we must speak it.  That is, \u201cSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12).  If you\u2019re the least bit fearful like Moses, let God be with your mouth. By the way, slow-of-speech Moses later becomes God\u2019s eloquent messenger, commanding plagues to come, and plagues to cease, and waters to part.  In Acts 7:22, Moses is not remembered as a man of few words, but instead as \u201cmighty in words and in deeds\u201d. **I have met so many friends and \u201cencouragers\u201d since I joined the blogosphere.

She\u2019s going, she\u2019s going, she\u2019s gone!? One night, a group of us were having dinner, celebrating the return of a friend from England. Janice had just gotten back from a fabulous trip, and she was going on and on about the hotel she stayed in. I was sitting there, looking around at the others all put together so well. It was hard not to compare and feel sorry for myself. I was feeling pretty pathetic, when Janice turned to me with a beautifully wrapped package, and said, \u2018I brought you this.\u2019 It was a book on the great cathedrals of Europe. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure why she\u2019d given it to me until I read her inscription: \u2018To Charlotte, with admiration for the greatness of what you are building when no one sees.\u2019 In the days ahead I would read \u2013 no, devour \u2013 the book. And I would discover what would become for me, four life-changing truths, after which I could pattern my work: No one can say who built the great cathedrals \u2013 we have no record of their names. These builders gave their whole lives for a work they would never see finished. They made great sacrifices and expected no credit. The passion of their building was fueled by their faith that the eyes of God saw everything. A legendary story in the book told of a rich man who came to visit the cathedral while it was being built, and he saw a workman carving a tiny bird on the inside of a beam. He was puzzled and asked the man, \u201cWhy are you spending so much time carving that bird into a beam that will be covered by the roof, no one will ever see it.\u201d And the workman replied, \u201cBecause God sees.\u201d I closed the book, feeling the missing piece fall into place. It was almost as if I heard God whispering to me,  \u201cI see you, Charlotte. I see the sacrifices you make every day, even when no one around you does. No act of kindness you\u2019ve done, no sequin you\u2019ve sewn on, no cupcake you\u2019ve baked, is too small for me to notice and smile over. You are building a great cathedral, but you can\u2019t see right now what it will become.\u201d At times, my invisibility feels like an affliction. But it is not a disease that is erasing my life. It is the cure for the disease of my own self-centeredness. It is the antidote to my strong, stubborn pride. I keep the right perspective when I see myself as a great builder. As one of the people who show up at a job that they will never see finished, to work on something that their name will never be on. The writer of the book went so far as to say that no cathedrals could ever be built in our lifetime because there are so few people willing to sacrifice to that degree. When I really think about it, I don\u2019t want my son to tell the friend he\u2019s bringing home from college for Thanksgiving, \u2018\u201dMy Mom gets up at 4 in the morning and bakes homemade pies, and then she hand bastes a turkey for three hours and presses all the linens for the table.\u201d That would mean I\u2019d built a shrine or a monument to myself. I just want him to want to come home. And then, if there is anything more to say to his friend, to add, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love it there.\u201d As mothers, we are building great cathedrals. We cannot be seen if we\u2019re doing it right. And one day, it is very possible that the world will marvel, not only at what we have built, but at the beauty that has been added to the world by the sacrifices of invisible women.

{"date": "October 2, 2008", "body": "I know. We all have them. Our war stories about toilet training. Some time ago I was buying a training potty for Hope at Wal-mart, and an elderly woman put a hand on my arm and looked close to tears. \u201cYou poor thing,\u201d she said, shaking her head. In her eyes, I could see her re-living the memories of potty-training her own children many years ago.  Wow , I thought.  She still bares the scars from those days. She\u2019s old, and she\u2019s still clearly affected! Time has not healed the pain of the potty training. I thought I\u2019d post a page out of my potty diaries. Brandon was away this past weekend, so I was outnumbered \u2013 me against them and their digestive systems. In the morning, I went into Hope\u2019s room and found that she had taken off her pjs and diaper and had peed in the crib. (She\u2019s decided to become a stripper like her big sister). \u201c Hope! Why did you take off your clothes and pee in the bed???!!!\u201d ( Sternly ). \n\u201cI had to go potty.\u201d ( Matter of fact-ly ) \n\u201cHope, You are supposed to go pee pee in the potty!\u201d \nHope looked around her crib and shrugged her shoulders. \n\u201cNo potty here.\u201d \nShe\u2019s 21 months old, and all ready smarter than me. I scooped up the nude child and walked across the hall to Rhema\u2019s room. We stood in the doorway staring. There are 2 beds in her room, and Rhema was in neither of them. We looked under the beds. (Rhema went through a phase where she only wanted to sleep under the bed). Not there. I was starting to get nervous when we checked the closet. There she was, with of course, no clothes on, sleeping in a large bin of baby clothes. \n \u201cOh, please no\u2026\u201d  I uttered. But sure enough, she had peed in the clothing bin. So five minutes into the morning I had two smelly girls to bathe and lots of extra laundry to do. After their baths, I put both girls on their respective toilets. Rhema uses the big toilet successfully. But she has this habit of lowering herself into the toilet bowl until her bottom touches the water. She takes great pleasure in feeling the cold water on her backside! In order to prevent this little butt baptism I try to hold her in place on the toilet. Well, while I was holding Rhema, Hope successfully went to the bathroom in her little potty. And in one quick moment, Hope tried to bring me her potty to show me her success. Of course she dropped the bowl as I dropped Rhema in the toilet and urine splattered all over the bathroom. Rhema is doing well with her toileting, though, and I\u2019m grateful. I think we may be past the  Slip-N-Slide  days. Her bathroom habits have included: \n-Going in any open container, such as my pots and pans \n-Splashing in the toilet water \n-Dumping rolls of toilet paper or whole containers of Clorox wipes in the water and then going \u201cfishing\u201d \n-Taking cups from the kitchen and scooping out the water to, yes, imbibe. \n Is this getting too gross? We\u2019ve had safety locks on the toilet bowls, but our latest lock is broken\u2026. Yeah, I guess we better get a new one. Fast. Later that day, I dared to talk on the phone to my in-laws. Talking on the phone while both kids are awake can be pretty dicey, but I was feeling risky. While on the phone, I think I noticed Rhema slip into the kitchen, but I didn\u2019t hear any crashing or banging so I kept on gabbing. At some point in the conversation, I was absent-mindedly pacing the living room when my foot landed in a pile of smush on the carpet. Oh, no. A banana? The lights were out, and whatever it was was still sticking to my foot so I hopped over to the light switch and discovered the excrement on my extremity. Not so bad. I\u2019ve had worse. But which child did the poop belong to and where was the rest of it? Ah! A mystery for the night! After some detective work, I figured out that Hope had gone in her diaper and then removed it. The evidence was still on her legs. And she must have carried the diaper around for a while b/c she dropped pieces in a couple different rooms. All this while I was on the phone. Ugh! I grabbed her to put her in the tub (for the third time that day). We had to pick up Rhema on the way, and that\u2019s when I discovered that Rhema had removed her clothes  again  and had rubbed a stick of butter all over herself. I think she thought it was lotion. Fat yellow pieces of lard were sliding down her arms and legs. After their baths, I put them to bed and thanked the Lord I have a blog so I can tell people about  mi vida loca . =) ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/10/02/the-potty-diaries/", "title": "The Potty Diaries"},
{"date": "September 4, 2008", "body": "What we thought was going to be a 24-hour stay in the hospital turned out to be three days! My aching bones will be so happy to rest in my own bed tonight. I don\u2019t wish to bore with Rhema\u2019s medical details. Something rather exciting happened, however. Dr. BEAM  and his team were willing to think outside the box, and I love them for it.  Mara Mara  said\u00a0seizure disorders have\u00a0been described\u00a0like a radio losing its signal or a TV screen flickering on and off. The first night Rhema\u2019s spike index was around 65% \u2014 better than her last reading (which was 85% \u2013 100%), but still not great. Dr. BEAM decided to try a high dose diazepam (valium) protocol on Rhema the second night. This is commonly used to treat Landau-Kleffner syndrome, a disorder in which epileptic seizures during sleep affect a person\u2019s ability to speak and understand language. Dr. BEAM was hopeful that the protocol would improve things somewhat, quiet the  electrical storm  in Rhema\u2019s brain. But none of us were quite prepared for the result \u2013 After an initial violent reaction to the high dose, Rhema  slept like a baby . The next morning Dr. Duffy\u2019s team excitedly came to us with the news that Rhema\u2019s sub-clinical seizure activity during the night measured at 2%!!! One doctor said (and I am nearly in tears as I write this), \u201cLast night her brain  rested  for the first time in a long time\u2026 maybe ever.\u201d ****** Over the next month, we will be giving her a much smaller dose of the diazepam along with her seizure med (and more EEGs in October) in an attempt to continue reducing the spikes. The doctors are enthused; hopeful that\u00a0we may see remarkable improvements in Rhema if we can keep the spike activity down.\u00a0Perhaps in doing so, Rhema will be able to acquire some language. That\u2019s a big PERHAPS. But one thing I became convinced of while in the hospital and that is, God is for us. It may not always seem like it.\u00a0 Life may be horrible; circumstances may seem hopeless. But God is for us. Seriously, ask me again in a month. If my daughter makes no progress, I will still tell you, God is for us. Because He said He is. And because His goodness is not based on my circumstances.  \u201cWhen I cry unto Thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.\u201d Psalm 56:9 I once heard a story in which a man lay on his death bed with his family gathered around him. He had once been healthy, but was now dying because of some medical mistake. As the plug was pulled, his wife\u00a0said to those\u00a0in the room, \u201cThis is by no means a lapse in God\u2019s goodness.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible for any human speech to express the full meaning of this delightful phrase, \u201cGod is for me.\u201d He was \u201cfor us\u201d before the worlds were made; He was \u201cfor us,\u201d or He would not have given His well-beloved son; He was \u201cfor us\u201d when He smote the Only-begotten, and laid the full weight of His wrath upon Him\u2014 He is \u201cfor us,\u201d with all the infinity of His being; with all the omnipotence of His love; with all the infallibility of His wisdom; arrayed in all His divine attributes, He is \u201cfor us,\u201d\u2013eternally and immutably \u201cfor us\u201d\u2026\u201d  \u2013 Charles Spurgeon By the way, Rhema was a superstar, enduring the confinement, the pokes and prods with a smile most of the time.\u00a0 She only tried to chew the power cables a few times, only bit off 12 marker heads, only tried to stuff foam puzzle pieces up her nose a dozen or so times, only had 5 meltdowns, only got trapped under the hospital bed \u2013 and it only took 3 people to get her out \u2013 one time.

{"date": "October 6, 2008", "body": "Back in 2006, Brandon, Rhema and I (pregnant with Hope) were vacationing in Michigan after completing a military tour in Germany. At the time, we knew Rhema had some delays, but in our little family, in our isolated world, she was perfect. After being around extended family in Michigan (particularly Rhema\u2019s cousins), I was suddenly painfully aware of the significance of Rhema\u2019s delays. To make matters worse, all of the changes \u2013 6 hour time zone difference, new environment, new people \u2013 virtually sent Rhema over the edge, with all of her behaviors amplified. I remember picking up the phone to call my twin in Boston, and in anguish, I blurted the words I had never dared to say to anyone before, \n\u201cRhema\u2019s acting like she\u2019s  autistic ! I\u2026 I just can\u2019t seem to reach her.\u201d My sister let me tell her everything. She cried with me, comforted me and told me we would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to get Rhema the help she needed. What my sister did not say was that at that moment on the phone, she was fighting her own\u00a0personal battle. She was experiencing intense pain and could no longer walk. Looking back, I realize that pain and fear and worry were gripping us at the same time, but I had no idea what she was going through. After she hung up with me that day, she called my mother and told her I needed her. Then my sister \u2013 a young mom herself \u2013 managed to get herself to an emergency room. There she was diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis). Later I asked her, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? We talk everyday, we share everything. Why didn\u2019t you tell me? Her response: \u201cI was too worried about you. I didn\u2019t want you to worry about me.\u201d That\u2019s my twin. Last year I was visiting her in the hospital. Feeling completely helpless I started writing out Bible verses on paper and posting them all over her room. She got a call on her cell phone from a friend who had just ended a relationship. For an hour, my sister comforted her and dispensed dating advice, all the while managing her pain and being poked and prodded by nurses. Finally, I heard her friend on the phone ask, \u201cSo what are you up to?\u201d \nMy sister lightly and casually responsed, \u201cOhhhh, I\u2019m\u00a0hanging out at\u00a0the hospital for a few days\u2026\u201d That\u2019s my twin. She has tough days, but never once have I heard her complain or say \u201cWhy me?\u201d (as compared to me who wails  Why!  on a continual basis!).\u00a0 Today she is going for an MRI. These are always difficult for her. She has to get injected with dyes to illuminate her brain and spine. It\u2019s painful because she has received so many infusions in the past couple of years that her veins are shot. So I\u2019m praying today that the medical staff will be able to find a good vein! Anticipating the results of these MRIs is always emotionally draining. So I\u2019m praying for her to have a peace that only God can give! My sister and Rhema have a special bond, and both have already overcome so much. In two weeks, my sister will  walk  with us in the  Greater Boston Walk for Autism Speaks . She will walk for Rhema and for all people and families affected by autism spectrum disorders. Beautiful giver.\u00a0 That\u2019s my twin. Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved,\u00a0for you are the one I praise.\u00a0 Jer 17:14 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.walknowforautism.org/site/c.mhLPKZPELmF/b.3616099/", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/twin1.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/10/06/thats-my-twin/", "title": "That\u2019s My Twin"},
{"date": "October 10, 2008", "body": "Hope occasionally says \u201cpoo poo\u201d when she means \u201cpee pee\u201d and \u201cpee pee\u201d when she means \u201cpoo poo.\u201d We were at the mall a couple weekends ago and I really had to go potty. (I\u2019ve lost all couth by now \u2013 I don\u2019t say, \u2018I need to use the restroom.\u2019 I say,  \u2018gotta go potty.\u2019 ) We went into a crowded bathroom, and crammed into a stall. Hope is in the habit of cheering at potty success. We cheer for her when she goes, and we cheer for Rhema when she goes. So it only follows that she cheers when I go. Only on this day in the public restroom she got her bathroom action words mixed up as she loudly proclaimed, \n\u201cYaaayyy Mommy. You go poo poo on the potty!!\u201d ******* \nRhema LOVES ice. We got in the habit of not keeping ice in the freezer when we lived in Germany, and back at home, the habit has continued. So when Rhema sees ice, she\u2019s just gotta have it. (Hhhhmmm, that\u2019s a good idea for a reinforcer!) Back to the mall (that same day). We decided to brave the Food Court. In the past, this has been a hairy undertaking. Rhema still has that innocence about her that believes \u2018What\u2019s mine is yours and what\u2019s yours is mine.\u2019 So everybody\u2019s meal at the food court (or a  hospital waiting room ) is subject to a sampling by Rhema \u2013 and the girl is fast. But we were feeling courageous this day. We got our food, sat down and I was quite pleased that both girls stayed seated while we ate. The only hiccup was that I forgot about Rhema\u2019s ice obsession and had purchased a sweet tea with ice in it from McDonalds. But as soon as I remembered, I hid my drink in Hope\u2019s diaper bag. So things were going great: Hope wasn\u2019t breaking out in hives from allergies, and we had found gluten-free food that they both could eat. I was feeling quite confident and relaxed, when a man sat down at the table next to us, right next to Rhema. I saw Rhema\u2019s eyes get big as she spotted the man\u2019s giant Dr. Pepper. Like a bird dog honing in on its prey, Rhema pounced on the man\u2019s drink in one quick move. By the time I got to her, she already had the lid off. But I managed to grab her hand before she plunged it into the startled man\u2019s drink. Uttering a quick apology, I tried to re-direct her. I grabbed my hidden sweet tea with the intention of giving her my ice. She lunged for my cup causing me to drop it. Sweet tea and ice splattered to the floor. Rhema, not the least bit bothered by the spill dove under the table and began eating ice off the floor. I looked over at Brandon who had remained seated next to Hope the whole time, eyes closed praying for peace or divine intervention\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/ice-ice-baby/", "title": "Ice Ice Baby"},
{"date": "November 4, 2008", "body": "We are trying to transition Rhema to Children\u2019s Church. It has not been so easy. The husband and I have been taking turns being in Children\u2019s Church with her until we\u2019re confident she can handle being there with a volunteer. The children are excused from the sanctuary to go to Children\u2019s Church midway though the regular service. In the main service, our challenge has been to keep Rhema: \n1) seated (she prefers to hurdle the pews) \n2) quiet (she prefers to \u201cwail\u201d during prayer time and Scripture reading) \n3) still (she prefers to color in all the hymnals\u2026 and then rip the pages) This past Sunday, all attempts to keep her in the regular service were aborted after oh, say, two minutes. It was nowhere near time for Children\u2019s Church (which has its own set of challenges), so I led her up a staircase that is just off the side of the sanctuary. Upstairs we found an empty classroom, and Rhema busied herself with sitting in each chair one at a time. After a while, she noticed a cupboard and discovered crayons and paper. She enjoyed coloring, and I enjoyed watching her. At one point, she crumbled her paper and ran over to a small trash can. \u201c Throwawayyyy. Throwaway. \u201d She mimicked in the voice of one of her therapists. I was thrilled! I was having such a good time just being with her that I decided we would skip Children\u2019s Church. Bad mama. Next she discovered a basket of about 30 kid-sized scissors with multi-colored handles. She\u2019s been working with scissors at school, and so she was all too happy to cut up paper with the scissors. Only, of course, she had to try out each pair of scissors. Just when I was thinking,  Wow, this worked out perfect! I\u2019m getting some great alone time with Rhema! , she suddenly took off out of the classroom with a pair of scissors still in hers hand. Down the stairs she flew. I knew I had to catch her, because communion was in progress. I could see her lighting into the sanctuary, sprinting down the aisle, making a bee-line for the pulpit. There she would gleefully jump up and down, up and down, in the pastor\u2019s cushiony chair. On her way down the stairs, the scissors fell mercifully from her hand and clattered on the floor. Just at the bottom of the stairs, I tackled her. The side doors to the sanctuary were wide open. Many people, in the midst of their communion wafers and grape juice, witnessed me sack my child like Mike Singletary. (Only I had a skirt on). I scooped up my girl and carried her upstairs.  Phew. We played with the water in a sink in the bathroom until church was over. Next week it\u2019s the husband\u2019s turn! Oh yeah, any suggestions on how we can manage church better?

The Singing In The Rain award is for individuals who demonstrate perseverance through extreme challenges, it\u2019s for those can find the silver lining and keep shining when the going gets tough. I\u2019m happy for the chance to encourage these women in my own small way on this blog. It is not my intention\u00a0to highlight their challenges. I am learning that it is no use to compare struggles. One\u2019s life may seem more difficult than another\u2019s. But pain is pain is pain. These women choose hope in the midst of their pain, and I want to honor them for it. This award goes to  Pixiemama . She is a\u00a0wonderful mother to four beautiful children. This family has been through so much, and just when you think that they cannot endure anymore, they do \u2013 and come out stronger than before.\u00a0 From brain tumors to autism to the loss of a dear friend, Pixiemama continues to encourage and support other families and share from her own experiences.\u00a0 Simply put, she honest and brave.\u00a0 Pixiemama, I know you say that you just do what you have to do, but you have a strength of heart that I truly admire!\u00a0 Praying for more \u201c perfect all the way around \u201d days\u2026\u00a0 This award goes to Ecki over at  Opposite Kids .\u00a0 She is a busy mom to two darling girls. Ecki posseses the patience I strive for. She is thoroughly committed to her family. She shares the life and love of a family affected by autism and Downs Syndrome. And even though she has every right to complain, she chooses not to whine but to enjoy her girls. I love this post:  It\u2019s A Daddy Thing  about Kayla and her father. Ecki, I have learned so much from you! This award goes to  Tamara . Tamara is an amazing woman of faith and is a mother to three precious children. Her lovely daughter Abby Grace has so much to teach us. Abby has multiple disabilities including CP and epilepsy, and may possibly face  brain surgery  in the near future. I am really just getting to know them, but Abby and her family have already overcome so much, and the testimony of their daily lives is to God\u2019s glory alone.\u00a0  Here  is a touching post (her photography is amazing) when\u00a0Tamara got to see her sweet girl stand for the first time in a Hart walker! Tamara, thank you for your example of faith and for singing in the rain.

{"date": "May 4, 2015", "body": "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Next week we will be in Green Bay, WI. Rhema will be receiving special training through  Rapid Prompting Method (RPM)  \u2013 a teaching technique designed to help people with disabilities improve their communication and academic performance. I\u2019ve researched it and read about it for years. I\u2019ve corresponded with friends and others who use RPM with their students. And I\u2019ve been encouraged and inspired by many non-speaking people who have found a way to share their beautiful minds through their writings. For years I thought,  One day I\u2019m going to take Rhema to Texas to see Soma \u2013 the mother who pioneered this teaching method for her autistic son.  Finances and multiple military deployments always put it on the back burner. When Brandon came home last summer my desire for Rhema to be exposed to RPM fanned into an internal fire. We waited for months to get a training slot at the Texas center, but the classes always filled within minutes of opening. Friends prayed that a door would be opened \u2013 and finally it was in Green Bay, WI. Brandon will be away on business so it will just be the girls and I traveling to Green Bay for a week-long camp. At first I told Hope that she would have to stay with the grandparents. \u201cBut\u2026 but I really, really want to go!\u201d \u201cI know, Hope. But I also need to be trained so that I can work with Rhema when we get home. I don\u2019t want any distractions. I\u2019m going to need to concentrate during the sessions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to be concentrating, too,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd taking notes in my pink notebook and asking questions at the end.\u201d I laughed. Of course. Hope is the girl who reads Rhema\u2019s home notes from school more intently than I do. She communicates with Rhema better than anyone I know. They play school and games together and Hope is always teaching and always studying her sister. How could I forget: I  needed  Hope to be there with us. Rhema already receives a wonderful education at her school. The best. I am hopeful RPM will be another tool in her belt to help her communicate. A very gifted therapist and friend is interested in helping us practice RPM with Rhema at home when we return.  There is a real possibility for her to learn to spell and type, to finally have a voice.  I believe it. This is an important time for her, and I feel like this could be a life-changing week for us. Brandon\u2019s parents and my parents have insisted on contributing to the cost of travel and training. It means a lot to me \u2013 how they believe in her! My father and I talked about it recently: \u201cShe had another speech evaluation done. Spoken words are just so hard to come by, Dad. Her mouth and tongue can\u2019t make the letter sounds. It seems like she\u2019s been working on \u201cp\u201d and \u201cb\u201d for years\u2026 never mind the other 24 letters. It\u2019s just hard for her, but I know she has so much inside, so much to tell us.\u201d \u201cRhema, Rhema.\u201d He let the sound of her name hang in the air. \u201cHer name has such a  powerful meaning . A living expression of  word . I still believe God has amazing plans, great things in store for Rhema.\u201d So we are ready to go. I\u2019m so thankful we go with the prayers of many. \u201cO Lord, I have never been eloquent\u2026 I am slow of speech and tongue.\u201d The LORD said to Moses, \u201cWho gave man his mouth? Is it not I, the LORD?

The older girls are always creating some magical adventure, and Hope drinks them in, eagerly following them, trying to be just like them. So I should not have been surprised when my almost-2-year-old started telling me about her \u201ccastle.\u201d I was a tomboy as a child, only interested in kickball, collecting frogs and skateboarding. And Rhema seems completely unaware of such things \u2013 she\u2019s been too busy learning how to sit and attend and point and imitate and learn her letters, numbers, shapes and colors. No time to explore princesses, fairies, moats and such. So I bought Hope a tiara. Oh, the joy on her face when I put on her tiara as she stood in the mirror. Her hands flew to cover her open mouth as she squealed and exclaimed, \u201cPrincess Hope!\u201d Daily she dazzles and amazes me with her imagination and intelligence. She never stops talking. From the time she wakes up to when she goes to sleep, she offers a running commentary on all that she sees, hears and thinks. I spend all of my days laughing \u2013 now I know. Now I know why they say kids say the darndest things. As I experience this new kind of motherhood with Hope, my thoughts always trail away to my Rhema, usually at her special needs school. I think of my precious firstborn, so severely affected by autism. I wish she could share a real friendship with another child. With all my heart, I want her to know the blessing of deep, rich, meaningful relationships. How I long for her to tell me something, anything about herself.  What\u2019s your favorite color? Do you dream at night? Why do you dance in the window? The weeks, months and years of silence go by and I feel like I missed something \u2013 I didn\u2019t get to fully experience you experiencing the world. I wish I could hear the clever things you would say. I  know  you, but there\u2019s so much more I wish I knew.  When I look at my girls, I know that God has blessed me beyond measure. They are happy and healthy (relatively speaking), and they are  here . But there are days when I feel, heavy on my heart, a sense of loss. Sometimes I can\u2019t help missing what I\u2019m missing.

{"date": "November 10, 2008", "body": "Dear Dr.  BEAM , Last week we received the news that our daughter\u2019s latest EEG came back  normal .  The epileptic activity that she experiences during sleep has been completely \u201ccleaned up.\u201d I wanted to say thank you. When we met you  a couple months ago, we had arrived at Children\u2019s for yet another overnight EEG and I did not have high expectations.  Our daughter was on her third anti-seizure med, and her condition was no better.  In fact, things had gotten worse.  We knew that it was fortuitous that you were going to be on the ward at the same time we were in the hospital because you are only scheduled to be on rotation twice a year.  Upon our arrival we were told that you would not be our attending physician. My husband is an incredible and thorough advocate for our daughter and our family.  He made several phone calls, and somehow convinced somebody that we needed to see  you .  Hours later a nurse came to tell me that you had agreed to \u201ctake us on\u201d and we were being switched to your service.  Her words were, \u201cThis is unprecedented.\u201d You believed she met the criteria for  Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS)  [\u2013 a disorder characterized by continuous electrical discharges during sleep resulting in intellectual deterioration and loss of language.]  Your simple kindness made an already frazzled and emotional mom want to break down in tears.  You prescribed a high-dose diazepam protocol, and her spike activity, which at times has been at 85-100%, was knocked down to 2%.  (We later learned from Dr. C that you made bets with some of your students about whether or not the protocol would work.  You won. 8) )  Now, after two months of being on a smaller dose of diazepam and another anti-convulsant, her EEG has been cleaned completely! Yesterday we began slowly weaning her from the diazepam.  We know that there is a good chance the seizure activity will return; thus, she will remain on one anti-convulsant drug.   But for now, the electrical storm has quieted, and  Rhema has a chance to learn . In the past few weeks we have seen significant changes: Her receptive language has increased \u2013 she seems to understand more. She is now completely toilet trained In therapy, she is looking, listening, engaging, trying out sounds and repeating words Days after the protocol, I believe she spoke her first sentence.  She said, \u201cI\u2026 want\u2026 pop.\u201d (popsicle). Recently, her behavior has improved\u2026 4 Perfect Behavior Days at school last week! A few months ago I could not imagine her doing these things. I had called this a  little miracle .  I was wrong.  This is a HUGE miracle!  I am so grateful to God, for although the road has been difficult, He has been faithful to provide for us every step of the way.  Jeremiah 29:11 says  \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d There is no way of knowing how far she will go in her language development, but her name means \u201cthe spoken word\u201d.  We hold on to that promise.   I cannot put into words how wonderful it is to know that as my little girl drifts off to sleep, her brain is no longer wracked with continuous seizure activity.  It does this mother\u2019s heart good knowing that we have done everything we can to help our daughter learn and grow\u2026 we have given her a fighting chance, and that\u2026 Simply. Feels. Good.     My mouth will speak words of wisdom; \nthe utterance from my heart will give understanding. \nPsalms 49:3 Thank you so very much, \nRhema\u2019s Mommy Working with her therapist: \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.friendsoflks.com/medical_overview.htm"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/unfolding-miracles/", "title": "Unfolding Miracles"},
{"date": "May 6, 2015", "body": "It\u2019s important to know you are not alone. When Rhema was first diagnosed with autism she received over thirty hours of in-home therapy. Managing her schedule was like a full time job, and our lives seemed very isolated. The first time I went to special needs support group I studied the other mothers. They seemed\u2026 sane. They were organized. They were knowledgeable. Their hair was brushed. They were strong. They were beautiful. They could cry. They could laugh. They were still standing. And as I watched them I realized that maybe autism wasn\u2019t my \u2018fault\u2019, maybe it just happened, and maybe I would be ok. Since then I\u2019ve been blessed with a community of friends \u2013 in real life and virtual. We share in each others\u2019 journeys, and it is an indescribable gift. My friend Judith said, \u201cIt makes it easier somehow knowing our experience isn\u2019t just ours. To know that we are not the only ones who struggle and who rejoice and who struggle again and rejoice again. Our unique cycle of love, pain and hope is something few can understand\u2026\u201d But we have each other. When someone you love self-injures, it tears your heart. When someone you love self-injures and it seems you are the trigger, it\u2019s gut-wrenching. The other day Hope had to cough several times, and Rhema became so overwhelmed and upset that she hurt herself very badly. Hope got a bag of ice for Rhema\u2019s arms and retreated to her room while I cleaned up. Later when I called Hope down, her face was covered in tears. She said through sobs, \u201cI feel so guilty when she hurts herself. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Oh no . Her sadness broke me. Hope has asthma and allergies. She can no more help her coughing than Rhema can (at least right now) help her reaction to the coughing. I tried to comfort her and assure her, but it didn\u2019t seem to help. Then our precious friends  Katie and Brooke  and their sweet mama Jess came to my mind. \u201cHope, I\u2019ve never had a sister with autism to love. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be you. But you know what? There is someone who knows what it\u2019s like. She has felt like you do and said some of the same things you\u2019ve said.\u201d Brown button eyes looked up at me, \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cKatie.\u201d Katie. Kind, beautiful and talented Katie, whom Hope looks up to and adores. They\u2019ve been friends since Hope was just a toddler, and Katie has never let their six year age difference stop them from having a blast when they get together. Her eyes filled with hope, \u201cReally??\u201d \u201cReally.\u201d Later I recounted our troubles to Jess and before I could ask, she said, \u201cCan you guys come over? Or can Katie call Hope?\u201d Katie called Hope. Hope told her about what happens with Rhema when she coughs. (Hope tries so hard to be strong. It was enlightening for me to hear her talk about it with Katie). Katie had the same story in many ways \u2013 watching things unravel, watching her sister hurt \u2013 simply because she coughed. Katie said, \u201cI get it.\u201d And Hope said, \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cIt makes me sad when my sister hurts.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s not your fault, Hope. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d And even though it\u2019s hard for her to believe that it\u2019s not her fault, Katie said it wasn\u2019t, so Hope whispered, \u201cYeah.\u201d Sister-friends, that\u2019s what they are. And their mothers are thankful and sorry at the same time that their girls share struggles like these. And so glad they have each other.

{"date": "May 20, 2015", "body": "Meeting the different wants and needs of my girls is sometimes like trying to walk a tightrope and juggle at the same time. It often seems like Hope sacrifices or gives\u00a0up\u00a0more. But there are times it is clear to me that Rhema is so in tune with Hope\u2019s wishes. She\u00a0chooses to be uneasy or endure the pain of overwhelm for Hope\u2019s sake. During our time in Wisconsin, Hope wanted just two things: to go to an amusement park and to go swimming. Rhema was having the kind of week where parks and pools would be extremely difficult for her to manage. Rhema enjoys swimming, but the downstairs pool at the hotel was on her avoid-at-all-costs list. We\u2019d been unsuccessful in getting her to go down, which meant Hope could not go swimming. (You know because I\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0be in two places at once, juggle or walk a tightrope). Then, on our last afternoon, Rhema let me put on her swimsuit. We walked downstairs, hopeful with every step. She covered her head with her arm as if to shield herself from the sensory onslaught. She found a place against the wall and remained there. She never got in the water but stayed nearby all the while her sister splashed with new friends. She sat and waited for Hope. I\u2019d heard Baybeach Amusement Park was small and not so busy during school hours. I told Hope we would *try* it, and she squealed with excitement. \u201cHope, we may drive into the parking lot and then drive right back out. I can\u2019t promise anything. We just have to see\u2026\u201d \u201cI know. That\u2019s totally fine.\u201d (One of the many things I adore about Hope is her\u00a0thankful heart. As much as she wanted to go, I knew she truly would be \u2018fine\u2019 if we couldn\u2019t). In the parking lot, Rhema seemed up for it. So we went, we saw, we conquered. We lasted for four rides. For one memorable, precious, fun-filled hour. Lo hicimos, baby. On our way out Hope happily hugged her sister, \u201cThank you, Rhema.\u201d The hotel had corridors that seemed endless. Rhema was not particularly fond of our room \u2013 I had to barricade the door to prevent escapes \u2013 but she enjoyed roaming the long halls. Whether coming or going she always flopped in the same two places. One of\u00a0her flop-spots\u00a0was just a few feet away from our room, opposite the door. When Rhema flops, it\u2019s often best to wait her out and after a time help her get up and keep moving. Sometimes it took an hour or more before she was willing to move. She spent a LOT of time in those hallways. Once when she flopped in the spot near our room, I went in to prepare dinner and left the door open so I could keep her in sight. In spite of all our little victories, I was weary. Weary of seemingly simple things being hard. Couldn\u2019t we just once walk down the hall like regular people? I looked up\u2026 One day I hope they know even just a little how grateful I am for the lessons they teach about real love. Gospel love. Love that sits with you and waits for you. Love that gladly lays down self and gives and gives again so that the other can have more.

{"date": "May 13, 2015", "body": "Last week I found her sitting in a chair with her eyelids fluttering and her hands twisted in a sort of frozen, palsied manner. Even though she has an epilepsy diagnosis, I did not want to assume it was a seizure. She\u2019s done funny, stimmy things with her hands and eyes before. Still I knew, with a sinking feeling, that a Shift had occurred in Rhema. For us, that means a period when our girl suddenly changes before our eyes and behaviors become extreme and we are literally just trying to make it through the day and B and I are scratching our heads wondering what in the world happened? The timing of the Shift was not ideal. We were already committed to a weekend retreat on the Cape hosted by Brandon\u2019s new company. Following that we\u2019d fly in different directions \u2013 Brandon to his work site and the girls and I to Wisconsin for Rhema\u2019s RPM training. Over the weekend we took her to the ER hoping we could rule out anything medically. We received a LOT of help with her gastrointestinal issues, but we left knowing that something was still not right with our girl. Rhema flew on an airplane 6 months ago and did very well. This time I called ahead to the airport to ask for assistance and they kindly provided someone to help us through the security check. The moment we walked into the airport things went downhill. Rhema could not wait in line and took off running. Hope and I caught up to her, but when I tried to redirect her she flopped on the floor. I knew that by touching her and trying to help her up (when she was already overwhelmed) would turn into a struggle and further escalate the situation. Often the best thing to do is to wait, give her time until she\u2019s able to calm and then continue on\u2026 even just a few steps. But she couldn\u2019t lay on the floor of Terminal A all day. We needed to check bags, get through security and get on the plane. I tried to scoop her up and the rest is kind of a blur. I remember us somehow getting to the security checkpoint and 3 airport employees trying to help me handle my Rhema screaming, flailing, kicking, knocking things over \u2013 well-intentioned, but unfamiliar hands on her. I remember a TSA agent barking at me to restrain my child. I remember someone saying she had to take her backpack off but she was so escalated I couldn\u2019t get it off. I remember all of the people staring at us, unable to hide their horror. I remember inadvertently almost mooning them all because I didn\u2019t wear a belt because I didn\u2019t want to set off the metal detector. I remember the airport staff warning they wouldn\u2019t let us on the plane if Rhema could not calm down. I remember looking for our strewn boarding passes, my bag, and Hope. I  don\u2019t  remember how we got through security, but I realized we\u2019d made it to the other side just as Rhema got her bearings and took off for an escalator. The woman who had been sent to assist us apologetically told me she had to go and warned me not to let Rhema run back through the security checkpoint or we\u2019d have to go through the whole thing again. Hope and I kept up with Rhema and tried to keep her safe without touching her. Too many doors, too many exits in airports. We arrived at the gate just as people were getting off the plane we would be boarding. Rhema ran to the gate door as someone yelled, \u201cNo, she can\u2019t do that!\u201d I all but tackled her right there and held on for dear life as she screamed and kicked. Hope sat down beside me. \u201cIf we\u2026 if we could just sit here,\u201d I said to a Delta employee who rushed over. \u201cShe\u2019s just overwhelmed right now\u2026 and afraid\u2026 and having trouble waiting. But if we can just sit here, I\u2019ll hold her and she\u2019ll calm and feel safe again.\u201d The woman said, \u201cOk, but you\u2019ll have to move a bit out of the doorway so people and a wheelchair can get by.\u201d But Rhema\u2019s foot was hooked around the door. In another century or so I will laugh at the surprise on people\u2019s faces as they deplaned and stepped over us, panting and sprawled out on the floor at the gate door. A young woman ran over to us, compassion written all over her beautiful face. \u201cCan I help? Is there anything I can do? Anything at all?\u201d I smiled for the first time that day. \u201cYou\u2019re sweet. Thank you. We\u2019re fine. Well no, we\u2019re not fine. But I think\u2026 I think we\u2019ve got it. Thank you so much for asking.\u201d The woman from Delta stayed with us on the floor the whole time. She talked to Hope about school and the teddy bear Hope was clutching. She talked to Rhema about the letter R and how her name began with R and how it was her favorite letter, too. She thanked Rhema for waiting so well. We chatted about her seventeen year-old daughter. I shared about our trip to Green Bay and my deep desire to help Rhema communicate better. She questioned if Rhema would be able to tolerate the flight. I told her she would be ok once we got going, and she believed me. We finally boarded, and just before take-off, she brought a handful of coloring pages, activity books, crayons and other trinkets for the girls.  Thank you, R. I want people to know about the young woman who bravely, kindly asked if she could help. I want people to know about R, the Delta employee who sat with us. The details of our hard day may fade in time, but my girls and I will always remember their kindness. Things did not get easier. There was the layover in Detroit, the second flight, baggage claim, the rental car process still to get through. I usually have some clue as to what to do. I usually have courage. At that point I had nothing left. I prayed,  Every minute, God. I need your help for every minute. Every step. She needs you for every step she takes.  It wasn\u2019t easy. But every minute we made it, I breathed  thank you . Every minute she waited and every minute she held back a scream was another minute of  thank you.  Every single step she took without flopping or bolting or fighting was a step of victory. And every minute we fell, we were lifted. Thank you so much for all the texts, emails, FB comments, prayers as we have made our little journey to RPM training in WI. Your encouragement, your hope for Rhema and our family has meant more to me than words can say. Thank you!

{"date": "March 5, 2015", "body": "It\u2019s one of those times when we look up to find Rhema quietly weeping. We don\u2019t know what brings on her sad tears. But every time, we drop everything, Hope and I. We swoop down on her holding her hands if she\u2019ll let us, stroking her hair, sheltering her in love. She cries. His faithfulness will be your shield,  I read it this week. Yes, there are days even weeks and months when so much hurt and painful information crowds around like enemies of the soul. Broken bodies, fragile hearts, temptations, what I can\u2019t undo, disappointment one every side \u2013 they roar their mockery. Can we be helped?

{"date": "May 18, 2015", "body": "Our week in Green Bay for RPM training turned into something bigger than I imagined. I can\u2019t speak for the girls but for me so much of it seemed like a struggle \u2013 from Rhema\u2019s health issues to even just getting there. I received daily(!) notes of encouragement that helped me put one tired foot in front of another. I/we feel humbled, undeserving and grateful to be on the receiving end of such support and prayer. Thank you, thank you. I\u2019m not going to spend time here explaining the methodology and theories behind Rapid Prompting Method (for more information on Soma RPM \u2013 click  here  and  here  ), but I would like to share some of my observations and impressions after seeing it in practice with Rhema. Presume competence.  It\u2019s something you hear a lot in the autism world, and until this week I don\u2019t think I really grasped it. Douglas Bliken describes presuming competence as a framework that says  \u201c\u2026approach each child as wanting to be fully included, wanting acceptance and appreciation, wanting to learn, wanting to be heard, wanting to contribute.\u00a0 Assume that a child has intellectual ability, provide opportunities to be exposed to learning, assume the child wants to learn and assert him or herself in the world.\u201d \u00a0 I\u2019ve realized that I still have much to learn when it comes to seeing and understanding my daughter. I always try to dream big for her and yet in the same breath I underestimate her. At RPM camp, Rhema\u2019s teacher Erika taught her grade level material. Rhema was taught grade level material. (Yes, I said that twice). I learned along with her as she received lessons in weather, continents, bones, the polar habitat, William Penn and the Quakers, etc. The same child who has not reliably counted to ten in her life worked on subtraction and addition and carrying-the-one and word problems and fractions. Fractions, y\u2019all. Hope said, \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t even learned fractions yet!\u201d Watching my girl \u2013 the one who has the expressive language of a 1-year old\u2026 the one with bite marks covering her arms\u2026 the one who has never attended a typical school or sat in a typical classroom\u2026 the one who needs help with every part of her day\u2026 the one who cannot complete any type formalized testing \u2013 watching her learn about science and history and math like it ain\u2019t no thing was just about as exhilarating and nerve-wracking and hope-filling as anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. For Rhema as well, I believe. Well, how can we ever be the same now? After the sessions I spoke to her and of her differently. I spoke to her as I would any non-autistic person. And I started believing that everything I said was truly understood  whether she demonstrated understanding or not . She may not respond in a way I expect or recognize but I am no longer assuming she\u2019s not hearing or comprehending. (I\u2019ve said this for years right here on this blog, but it has taken me so long to really get it.) Bag of tricks.  During her sessions Rhema hummed, rocked, crawled under the table, closed her eyes, hit herself, fought for markers and paper, tried to climb over her teacher, put her fingers in her nose and mouth repeatedly. And yet her teacher continued with the lessons, adapting her ways of engaging Rhema constantly. Never once did she conclude that Rhema was not smart enough to comprehend the material. Instead she believed the onus was on her to creatively find ways to help Rhema focus. When Rhema was presented with choices, she closed her eyes and would not open them. Erika said, \u201cI know it hurts to look.\u201d And she pretended to write the words on Rhema\u2019s arm with her finger, spelling aloud as she did. When Rhema\u2019s humming grew loud and she seemed to be tuning her teacher out, Erika changed her own voice to a whisper and Rhema softened her humming and seemed to listen better. Other times Erika changed the beat and tempo of her voice. When she felt like Rhema\u2019s mind was racing, Erika spoke very rapidly as if to keep pace, and Rhema responded. When Rhema seemed to be tactile defensive and lacked the motor skills to form a point with her finger, Erika put tape on the paper (sticky side up) and helped shape her hand, and Rhema pointed to the correct answer. When Rhema seemed entirely distracted by her marker, Erica used the marker to draw dust particles and teach the word \u2018vapor\u2019, or she would draw a circle, shade a portion of it and teach a lesson on fractions. Erika\u2019s goal was to outpace the stims and the distractions to such a degree that the lesson actually  became  the stim. By the end of the week, with a little assistance, Rhema was able to point to letters that spelled out words on a rolled letter board. Watching Erika reminded me of Rhema\u2019s teachers at home. They are willing to do whatever it takes to help her learn and grow. They work miracles everyday as they come up with innovative ways to teach my girl. They cheer her on when something works. And when it stops working, they find still new ways to guide and teach her. They never stop working, never stop trying, never stop believing. Favorite color.  After days of academic work, Erika asked Rhema about her favorite color. As soon as Erika asked the question my heart began to pound. For so long I\u2019ve wanted to ask Rhema a question like that and have her answer me. Erika presented choices to Rhema and prompted her to select one. For e.g., the choices would be Green, Blue, or Something else. It took quite a while to narrow it down, but in the end Rhema consistently selected \u2018Red\u2019, even when asked the question in slightly different ways. I was dismayed. I was certain her favorite color was yellow. Immediately doubts began to fill my head. During a break I said to Hope, \u201cSo Rhema said her favorite color is red.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I thought her favorite color was yellow. When she was two she would always hoard the yellow Legos.\u201d \u201cYeah. I thought her favorite color was yellow or orange because she always eats the yellow and orange candy hearts on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Then Hope said thoughtfully, \u201cBut when I was three my favorite color was purple. And then it was pink. And now it\u2019s blue. Now Rhema\u2019s favorite color is red.\u201d Leave it to the little kid to make it plain. So I let go of what I  thought  I knew about Rhema and gave into the joy of realized hope: My daughter shared something with us, something about  her , something I\u2019ve always wanted to know. Rhema loves colors, and right now her favorite color is red. (!!!)  I know this because she told us. At the beginning of our trip, Hope wondered \u201cIs it gona be worth it?\u201d Honestly, I think deep down we hoped Rhema would quickly catch on to the RPM method and find her voice. It didn\u2019t exactly happen that way. Instead it seems it will come bit by bit, day by day, on her own perfect timeline. I suspect there will be many setbacks and many gains, but even more belief. For now, we wait and we work, with more hope than ever.

{"date": "March 25, 2015", "body": "Rhema\u2019s coming upon another birthday. Brandon and I were recently reflecting on the adventures life with our precious girl has brought us. We recounted some of the stories aloud, others we just shook our head smiled \u2013 no words necessary. Remember the early years? The worrying, wondering and waiting? The silence. Remember when her brain continuously seized forty times a minute. Oh, she was such a little tornado. It took every ounce of energy to keep her safe. The most tired days of life. Remember how much she loved the big windows in the old house? She would climb up and stand in that window all night long. There were those old, double-hung rope and pulley windows with stained blue panes. The ropes were broken, and every night\u00a0she would pull down on the ropes. I can still hear the counterweight inside the frame screech up to the top and then come crashing down. She liked the sound, and she particularly liked to hear it over and over in the middle of the night. And then there was the poop art. It seemed I was cleaning her and scrubbing the floors and walls every day. I never thought it would end, I really didn\u2019t. But it did. And now she\u2019s toilet trained. (!) We can never forget the severe lead poisoning that came from eating paint off those walls and windows. We can never forget that dark period, and the many months of chelation treatment. But she made it.  We  made it. How about the hair-pulling and swallowing and the resulting gastro problems? Another struggle I was sure would never end \u2013 even when we cut her hair short. But now she is healthy again, and I can brush her curls into a ponytail. Those days are behind us and now we face new and different challenges. For I consider the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. ~Romans 8:18 A couple weeks ago our pastor said something that has stuck with me. He said there are bumper stickers that say, \u201cAsk me about my grandchildren.\u201d But you never see stickers that say \u201cAsk me about my daughter\u2019s labor.\u201d Yet in life we can be so focused on the labor\u2026 on the hardship\u2026 we forget about the glory that\u2019s coming. The challenge is to say, in whatever circumstance,  Ask me about the glory. I think it has something to do with searching for the secret of contentment that spills into joy and thankfulness.  Lord, I won\u2019t compare. I won\u2019t count any losses today. I won\u2019t take this, all I have, for granted. Thank you, thank you, thank you Lord.  There\u2019s God-glory in that. The magnificence is seeing God do what he does \u2013 make beauty out of ashes and the impossible possible, sing a song without words, stretch faithfulness to the sky. The hope of glory to come is all in Him. One day when we will be disability-free, pain \u2013free, sin-and-sadness free. As my friend Lianna wrote years ago:  \u2018I cried when I imagined Rhema, who doesn\u2019t necessarily respond when you call her name, rising up at Jesus\u2019 voice calling her. I pictured her hearing him and responding, unhindered by autism. Autism and epilepsy will be non-factors.\u2019 \u00a0\u00a0She\u2019ll lift her head and dance upon gold-paved streets. She will open her mouth and sing praises to her Lord forever. That glory.

Her handful of words\u2026 \u201cHi, bye, yeah, help, Ho (for Hope).\u201d She\u2019d lost them. Or somehow they\u2019d become inaccessible to her. When she began learning to use the communication app on her iPad, her ability to speak those words seemed to vanish, for a solid year at least. A few months age we expressed our concerns to her teachers, and it was eerily familiar to when she was 15 months old and I worried and took her to the doctor: \u201cShe stopped saying \u2018Hi.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what happened. She stopped saying \u2018Hi.\u2019\u201d Rhema\u2019s teachers, being the incredible teachers they are, worked so hard with her to get those precious words back. And all throughout this weekend we heard her words! I could cry because we\u2019ve known the heartbreak of working so hard and long for something, and then somehow it slips away. And we\u2019ve known the glory-strength God gives to keep moving forward. And we\u2019ve known the joy of finding what we lost. I\u2019m learning on this journey with Rhema not to take any of it for granted, to treasure every little-big gift. Less than a year ago she competed in the Special Olympics Summer Games, and with the help of her beloved coach Shea, she won three medals in gymnastics. It was a day I will cherish always. Then Shea went away to college. Special Olympics took a break during the summer and winter. And now it\u2019s like we\u2019ve taken five years of steps back, back at the very beginning for my girl who needs so much consistency \u2013 every day consistency \u2013 to maintain skills. Today we\u2019re just trying to help her cope with being in the gym again. Desire and motivation seems to have flown the coop. Her feet no longer run, skip, jump or walk on the beam as they once did. I look at empty hands, the spaces between my fingers. Skills gained and skills lost. And the one constant, my darling, the one thing you cannot lose, is our love. \u201cI heard a\u00a0 song  today that made me think of you. It\u2019s based on a  Bible verse  that says nothing can separate us from God\u2019s great love for us. Not anything in this world! Not the present or the future, not height nor depth, not the worst sins, not hardship, not pain, not sorrow, not even death can do it. That means  so  much to me, Rhema, when I think about my life and things I\u2019ve done. That He loves me still, anyway, even though. \n I can\u2019t even make sense of that kind of faithful, unending love. But God gave me a taste of it when He gave me to you and Hope. \n Because nothing can separate you from my love. Not silence or distance. Not aggressions and regressions. Not flopping or bolting. Not lost opportunities. Not stares in public. Not broken things and broken dreams, not heartache. Not weakness or\u00a0failure now or ever. Not the present or the future. Not highs or lows. Nothing can take you from my love.\u201d \n ~Adapted from a December 2011 letter,  \u201cI Belong to You.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg9TchaiOck", "http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A38-39&version=NIV"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2015/03/16/the-constant/", "title": "The constant"},

In the video, he is asked about learning to read and type: \u201cHow did you learn how to type?\u201d Letter by letter Ido slowly, purposefully types the words:  I saw letters would liberate me from my isolation. {To watch the video, go to  http://idoinautismland.com/  . In the sidebar: \u201cIdo Answers FAQ (1/2) and (2/2)} I\u2019ve thought about his statement on a daily basis. We\u2019ve never doubted for a moment that Rhema is a deeply thoughtful, intelligent, amazing young girl with so much to share with us. We have, however, struggled to believe that she\u2019d ever find her voice. As she grows older I sense a restlessness in her and I feel it, too\u2026 this urgency to free the words inside. To liberate her from the isolation. She longs to be understood, to be heard. Every day we pray that God will make a way. Recently we\u2019ve been telling her not to give up. We promise that we will not stop working to give her a variety of tools that will help her communicate. Saying these things out loud to her has increased my own faith. When I talk to her, everything I see with my eyes tells me she\u2019s not listening, not understanding, not even interested. By now I know there is so much more than meets the eye with my Rhema. She has taught me more than anyone the meaning of walking by faith and not by sight. I\u2019m thankful for people like my friend  Jess  who remind me to keep believing. The following is a text conversation we had a while back\u2026 Jess: I was just talking to my friend (who is non speaking and types to communicate) about kids still searching for their method of communication. She wrote\u2026  Words don\u2019t age before we can type them. They are always ready, for when we are. Me: Thanks Jess. That\u2019s comforting. I just worry/wonder what if they never find their method of communication. What happens to all those ready words? Jess: I hear you 100%. I can only imagine the frustration. You will help her find the way. I truly have no doubt. And that doesn\u2019t happen a lot. I have faith. She\u2019s writing her name. That was unthinkable. So what is unthinkable now? Isn\u2019t. In the coming months we\u2019ll be trying some new interventions that I trust are really going to help us. Y\u2019all, I can hardly wait.

Somewhere along the way I\u2019d tucked that one in my back-of-the-closet suitcase of Dreams Deferred. And even as my mind raced with excitement I was reluctant to pull out that old suitcase and dust off that dream. Because then I might go crazy and start hoping and believing and letting other dreams and expectations out.  Pace yourself, girl , I warned. And then I ran to the computer to search for a new dress for Rhema. I wanted it to be perfect. I spent hours looking for a dress that she would be comfortable in and dreamed up ways to do her hair. The day of the dance I tried three different outfits and she rejected them all, throwing them off moments after I put them on. She refused to let me style her hair. This was  not  how it was supposed to go. I envisioned mother-daughter bonding time as I readied her for her big night, not shrieks and a tug-of-war! She went to the dance in a faded, old dress with some spaghetti sauce on the front and her usual fuzzy ponytail. I was still in a huff on the drive over to the school. My friend  Emily\u2019s  words came to mind:  \u201cIt\u2019s time to throw out my ideas of what I thought life would be, should be, and let joy fill up those brand-new vacancies.\u201d  Ok God, I prayed, I\u2019m opening wide my suitcase of dreams and expectations and once again I\u2019m giving them all to you. I know your dreams and plans for my children are so much better than mine. When we arrived, all of the school staff was waiting for us at the door, and my heart filled and nearly burst with gratitude. This is so much more than a job to them. How they give, how they love and care for our children. Just as they are. They take her in her spaghetti sauce dress with bite marks on her arms, slime on her fingers and chocolate ice cream on her face, and they celebrate her. They put a pinwheel in her hand, a circle of flowers on her head and take pictures like she\u2019s an A-lister on the red carpet. They help her with every step. \u201c Just like this. I wait for you and I wait for them. Just like this, I love you. I love them.\u201d  I can hear Him whisper it. Rhema at the Spring Fling dance. Rhema had one-on-one staff with her throughout the night (thanks Megan!), and when we picked her up she was so giggly and HAPPY.

{"date": "June 18, 2015", "body": "I recently read a piece entitled \u201c To My Son\u2019s Autism Therapists .\u201d I can relate well to the writer\u2019s words: she wants to convey to her son\u2019s therapists how very personal their work is to her. How day and night she grapples with worry, fear, exhaustion and hope\u2026 and much of that hope lies within their hands. I gather that the writer\u2019s child is young. I want to tell her, \u201cHold on! If your experience is anything like ours, your child will lead you to discover a special class of people you did not know existed. You will find teachers and therapists who care so much and teach so well that your son\u2019s gains, challenges and well-being become deeply personal to them. You will find people whose compassion, commitment, creativity, and belief in your child\u2019s ability to excel never fails.\u201d One mom wrote a letter to her son\u2019s therapists. This mom (as in me) has cherished letters written by therapists and teachers to  us . Honestly, there was a time I did not know how a child who lacked language and social skills and needed one-on-one support with every part of her day could have rich, meaningful relationships. But now I know: she is a gift to others, and her teachers have shown me that again and again. She is loved. I am very grateful that my girl is surrounded by people who not only teach her, but treasure her, just as she is. A sample: From A- Dear Rhema, Over the past four years I have spent a lot of time learning, playing and laughing with you. You have come so far, I am so proud of you! I am so grateful for all of the joy you have given me. I know that with all of the wonderful memories we have made together, I will absolutely never forget you. Keep up the incredible work, Rhema girl.  From S- As you know, Rhema and I love to color together at school every day. She\u2019ll pull my hand in and have me write words for her to copy. I do everything from mom, dad, Hope, and more, but sometimes I write her teachers names (including my own). The other day during one of our coloring sessions, she scribbled [my name] across one of her papers, and it didn\u2019t even matter that the letters were in a different order. \u2026Rhema and I, we just connect and she is so important to me. I just wanted to share this with you because it meant the world to me that she wrote it on her own and I feel unbelievably lucky to get to work with her every day. \n From A. M.- It is hard to find an appropriate time to say it with the rush that is the morning and afternoon drop off/pick up routine, but I am so proud of your Rhema every day. I see her eyes get wide with understanding, I hear her try new words, and watch as she follows a new direction for the first time with the same accuracy as if she had done it a million times before. I can\u2019t believe how much she has grown these last few years and I am so thankful to be a part of her learning and growing. Thank you.  From H- Whenever I am asked why I love being an OT I always talk about teaching Rhema to write her name. I keep the letters at my desk to remind myself why I do what I do and how rewarding and lucky I am to get to work with these kids. Everyday it reminds me to do my best and that little miracles happen everyday. Thank you for letting me be a small part of your children\u2019s lives. They are both amazing little girls who are going to have positive influences in many lives. They already have both taught me so much! From C- Rhema was taking a break at her desk, and I was tearing pages out of a coloring book for her to color one by one. I handed her a word search which she instantly scribbled all over and held up to give back to me. But then, something caught her eye and she began to trace letters.  When she handed me back the paper, ready for a new one, I saw that she had somehow, in the middle of the word search and among the scribbles and scrambled letters, found and traced the word \u201cteamwork.\u201d There were no other letters traced in the word search, and no letters missed from the word. I was amazed! And I still am. Of all the other combinations of letters she could have traced, she not only found a word, but she found the one that best sums up my experience as one of her teachers. Teamwork. Everyone all together, for Rhema. Picture on the wall at school. {The walls of a special education school are decked with large photos of the students. Near the front door is a picture of Rhema taken a few years ago. Every time I walk into school one of the first things I see is her picture and it speaks volumes to me. It tells me that she  belongs , that her teachers are there for her, and she and her fellow students are an inspiration them. It tells me that no matter what kind of day she\u2019s having, she is treasured and celebrated every day. And really, what more could I want?} My letter to her teachers and therapists boils down to simple words that can never tell it all: THANK YOU.

{"date": "June 4, 2015", "body": "So one night Brandon and I decided to watch a movie my mother had recommended called, Facing the Giants. This was years ago \u2013 Rhema was two or three. I think of that time, the span of a year, in which Rhema was diagnosed with autism and then with epilepsy as the year I could not concentrate. We were immersed in 30+ hours of ABA, speech therapy, OT and any other therapy I could find. I remember walking around the grocery store thinking, \u2018My daughter has autism.\u2019 I recall sitting in church as people sang and the pastor preached and the only thought running through my head was, \u2018My daughter has epilepsy. My daughter has autism.\u2019 (What\u2019s so interesting is that even now, after all these years of continued therapy, IEP meetings and appointments and the myriad days and minutes of living life with my beautiful, complex, amazing girl, the shock of her autism can still knock the wind out of me). Anyway we put in this movie starring a Christian film director. The suppporting cast was made up of volunteers from a Baptist church in Georgia. During the first twenty minutes of the film, B and I laughed because we thought the acting was so amateur. By the end of the movie we were bawling like babies. There\u2019s this part in the movie where a boy has to do the death crawl across the football field while he is blindfolded and carrying another team member on his back. The boy keeps crying out, \u201cIt\u2019s too hard! I can\u2019t do this. It hurts!\u201d And all the while his coach is beside him, yelling at him to keep going and not quit. Call me crazy, but at that time in my life when my world had fallen down, when I seemed immobilized by a haze of grief over my child\u2019s diagnoses, I felt like God was talking to me\u2026 through a small-budget football movie\u2026 telling me to \u2018keep going.\u2019 That He was with us and would get us down that field. (I know nobody ever has time to watch videos. But in case you do, this is the scene.) As Rhema and I try to do RPM at home I am again reminded to press on. It\u2019s not going so well for us, this RPM. (I\u2019m chuckling because that is the understatement of the year). I don\u2019t feel like a natural teacher. I get discouraged and feel like I lack the skills, patience and perseverance to teach her well. My gratitude and admiration for her teachers and what they do every day has increased even more. From Rhemashope Faceboook page: We\u2019ve had many days of (ahem) less than successful RPM sessions, but Rhema and I seemed to really make some progress today! A precious mom in Australia gave me some ideas to try, and by the end of the session my girl was pointing to letters on a letterboard to spell words. (Thanks Bec!) Afterwards Rhema had a huge smile stuck on her face. She is not a big smiler. Brandon said, \u201cShe seems really happy! She can\u2019t stop smiling!\u201d I think she knows. We\u2019re not giving up. We\u2019re goin g to keep trying and working hard to help her find ways to communicate. We\u2019re getting better and closer every day. And I think tonight she really grabbed hold of that hope. \n Joy. \n When I am most overwhelmed by the road before us, it seems then that Rhema will show me something. Something that speaks louder than words. In her own, amazing Rhema-way she encourages me that she is learning and growing  and  communicating all the time. I think it\u2019s her telling me. And me telling her. And God telling us\u2026 Yes, my love. I know it\u2019s so hard. Today we are going to keep on.

No indication at all that she heard or understood. By now I have learned from her: when the tongue is bound and eyes don\u2019t seem to see and ears don\u2019t seem to hear, love translates. And words meant for her were just as much for me. A challenge to leave a comfort zone, to boldly persevere and run after what I believe is true and right and good no matter the cost. \u201cDarling Daughter, I know that home is your safe place. And I know this world \u2013 with all its sights and sounds and demands and unpredictability \u2013 is so overwhelming for you, more than I can ever understand. I see your fear as you cover your face with your arm whenever we are in public. It\u2019s hard for you to even walk on your own. I wish I could shield you from it all. I wish I could let you stay in your safe place. But baby, we must go find the key. Your father and I would go to the ends of the earth for you to taste and hold every good thing. I believe there\u2019s a chance for us, for you, to learn how to share what\u2019s inside. Let\u2019s reach for it! A secret, little one. You have a hiding place wherever you go. In the airport, at school, on the playground, though a seizure, in your pain, in the unknown. He is sure and strong. He is comfort like your blue blanket, you can shelter under his wings. He is a communing hideaway:  \u201cO my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.\u201d  ( Song of Songs 2:14 ). So open your heart, dear one, and let it be filled with songs of deliverance. Songs of how the weak are strong and the old become new. Songs of beauty in the broken. And Christ our joy and strength. Open your mouth and whisper your sweet \u2018yeah.\u2019 Open your ears \u2013 every day and always, we are all silently-at-the-top-of-our-lungs cheering for you.

I write that casually, as if it is nothing new. But we sit and I read to her and ask her questions about the story (by writing out choices on paper RPM-style), and I believe that she is listening and understanding. Well, that\u2019s never happened here before, and it\u2019s remarkable. At first there was resistance (as in,  what is my mother doing to me??\u201d ) Now it seems the time is precious, just 20 minutes or so, just for us. For the first time in eleven years I get to teach her in a way I\u2019ve never been able to before. When we\u2019re done, she pushes my hand toward the pen; she wants to keep going. I picked Moses. Because he too had to find his voice. I write out the words God spoke to Moses through the burning bush: I have seen, I have heard, I know. He tells Moses that He has come down to rescue the people of Israel. He is sending Moses to deliver them from their slavery and oppression. Moses protests, saying, Who am I that I should do this? No doubt he is thinking of his inadequacies, his unworthiness, past failures and fears, his \u201cslow tongue.\u201d God says, But I will be with you. I ask her about it, writing out different choices on paper. What did God say to Moses\u2019 objections? She waits. She lifts her hand and slowly, purposefully points. That beautiful, hard-won point. Her finger presses the words,  But I will be with you. \u201cHe will, Rhema,\u201d I whisper. \u201cAlways. He will.\u201d When I cannot, He will. And if she remembers in the moments when she feels so alone, little girl standing at the window, always on the outside looking in, that she is indeed  seen\u2026 And if she believes that when she can\u2019t speak, that she is  heard\u2026 And if she trusts that when no one understands her quiet sorrows, that she is  known\u2026 by the God who wonderfully made her and whose love for her is indescribably extravagant, measureless, endless\u2026 that is enough, more than enough. No matter what life brings if she will touch those words, cling to them, hold them close to her heart, But I will be with you Then this mama\u2019s heart rests and rejoices.

{"date": "June 26, 2015", "body": "I sit quietly with Rhema in a broken recliner. She used to rock in it, back and forth and back back back, until it flipped over and knocked a hole right through the wall. Now the chair leans to the side like a drunk man and stuffing spills out of\u00a0it with every rock. It\u2019s been a hard night. Sometimes a frustrated body leads to bursts of aggression. We sit, after the storm, comfortable in our silence. Her hand guides mine over paper. She wants me to write something. I don\u2019t know what, so I write her name because I love her special name and I\u2019ll not ever grow tired of seeing her write her name. She scribbles over the letters. \u201cNow write your last name.\u201d This is something new she\u2019s shown us (at home, at least). One afternoon Dana wrote \u201cRhema\u201d, and then Rhema wrote her last name as if it were no big, incredible, mama\u2019s-whooping-and-happy-dancing thing at all. Once upon a time her academic goals included  learning to use a stamp  with her name on it because learning to write seemed out of reach for her. Dana saved that paper for me so I can pull it out and smile and I\u2019ll never throw it away. This night she understands exactly what I\u2019m asking. She writes her last name again. No copying, no tracing. Remarkable accomplishment, years of hard work in letters on a crinkled piece of paper. All things are possible. Then she writes M O M. My heart stills and tears fill my eyes. I remember the days of extra speech therapy on weekends. I\u2019d walk into the office at the end of the session and her therapist would say, \u201cRhema, where\u2019s Mom?\u201d She\u2019d lean close to Rhema and try to get eye contact and urge her to look in my direction. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d I\u2019d smile and wave my hand in a goofy way.  Me. Over here. I\u2019m the mother.  Rhema never looked. She failed the find-your-mother test every time. Although I\u2019m pretty sure she chose not to acknowledge the question because she was insulted by it.  Of course I know where my mother is.  To this day, she does not call me by name. She can be prompted for some verbal approximation of \u201cMom\u201d, but she\u2019s never called to me. Her teachers have been teaching her to write \u201cMom\u201d, \u201cDad\u201d, and \u201cHope\u201d for quite a long while. In the past she\u2019s worked on a picture ID program where she points to pictures of us when prompted. But I was not sure that she really associated those 3 letters with me. She does. She does. Of course. And on a hard night she knows how to bless my heart and communicate love. For the first time in eleven years I truly feel  named  by my girl. So honored, so proud, so very grateful to be M O M. Hers. Photo booth, 2010 \u201c\u2026I\u2019d never forget you\u2014never. \n Look, I\u2019ve written your names on the palms of my hands.\u201d \n~Isaiah 49:16, The Message \u201c\u2026I have called you by your name.

{"date": "August 7, 2015", "body": "I\u2019d love to skip this part, but I need to start at the beginning. It seems to me the stories that spread \u2013 or the ones that stick in my mind \u2013 are the ones where someone has been ignorant or disrespectful or unkind to a person with special needs. I want to add to the stories of not one person but many people who showed incredible patience, compassion and understanding to a family with special needs. Our flight to Dallas was 3.5 hours long and Rhema did well for the first hour, giggling and coloring on the barf bags. Hour #2 she held my hand and closed her eyes and hummed. I could tell she was getting anxious and I silently prayed that she could keep it together until we landed. Somewhere during Hour #3 she decided she\u2019d had enough. She handed me my purse as if to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d, took off her seatbelt and tried to leave. I grabbed her around the waist and held on for dear life. I knew that a little stroll up the aisle was not what she had in mind: she wanted out. She fought me and shrieked as I told her it was not time yet and we had to stay in our seats. All the while I held her, I prayed please God help me, God help me. She broke free and bolted up the aisle. I followed her as she tried to open doors \u2013 any door to get off. She tried to open the emergency doors but I was there to stop her. She opened bathroom doors looking for the exit. To my horror I realized she was heading to the front of the plane, straight for the cockpit. We were practically wrestling in the aisle as I tried to hold her back. She crashed into people. She accidentally caused a man in first class to spill tomato juice on his shirt. \u201cMa\u2019am! Ma\u2019am, do you need medical assistance?\u201d By now two flight attendants were involved. One blocked the cockpit door and another helped me move Rhema \u2013 completely escalated \u2013 back to her seat all the way to 36B at the back of the plane. There were two more instances of Rhema escaping and trying to exit the plane during flight (on two separate flights). I don\u2019t even know if she understood that we were still in the air, she just wanted to go home. She had to be held down by me, flight attendants and a couple other passengers. The fear, the feeling of being out of control and powerless was one of the worst experiences ever for me. It was not lost on me that she was feeling the same things and sadly our special kids must experience it often. The man who was wearing his tomato juice ran up and offered his electronic tablet. \u201cShe can play with this! Will that help?\u201d A woman who\u2019d undoubtedly been hit by flailing arms gently tried to talk to Rhema. As we panted and held her, I said to a flight attendant, \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d She replied kindly, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. This is ok. We\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The men in 14A and 14B traded seats because we\u2019d never make it back to row 36 where Hope still sat. We\u2019d have to sit for landing. We muscled Rhema into a seat and I sat next to her. I noticed her lip was split. She jumped into my lap (all 11 years and 100 lbs of her) and I held her for dear life. A flight attendant got a seat belt and somehow strapped it over Rhema as she sat on my lap, and then she ran to her seat just as we landed. Another woman made eye contact and mouthed, \u201cAre you ok?\u201d I nodded even though I was so very not ok. The man who\u2019d been seated in 35 B came to me with my backpack and Hope. He offered to continue carrying my backpack as we made our way off the plane. In the terminal in Austin it took some time for us to find the wheelchair assistance we\u2019d requested. Hope found him, a white-bearded heavyset man whose mannerisms reminded me of my father. He pushed Rhema in the wheelchair and although he\u2019d never met us before he instantly seemed protective. As we walked toward baggage claim he asked about Rhema. \u201cWhat does she do well?\u201d We\u2019d just lived through a nightmare on a plane and he was asking me what she did well. I shrugged. \u201cWell\u2026 she\u2026 um. She. She hums. She sings. Well, not words. She doesn\u2019t speak. But she has a beautiful voice.\u201d He nodded knowingly. \u201cA gift. There\u2019s always a gift.\u201d At the car rental place there was a long line, much to my dismay. I went to a kiosk and was able to do a video call with a car rental agent. During the call Rhema escaped the wheelchair and tried to pry the phone out of my hands. I explained to the woman on the screen that my daughter was autistic. The agent excitedly began telling me about a class she was taking on developmental disabilities. She happily lectured me on the fact that Rhema may not show it but she understood so much. As we hung up she said, \u201cGod bless you in Texas.\u201d Our wheelchair man who I could have hugged showed us to the parking lot and to the rental car. He bid goodbye to Hope and Rhema and said, \u201cY\u2019all be careful now.\u201d I\u2019m sure there were some frustrated people on our flights. But throughout our travels not one person was unkind or showed disdain. Instead it was quite the opposite.  There is still much work to be done, but if you ever wonder if autism awareness/acceptance is spreading, let this story be proof that it is. We faced more struggles that day \u2013 even things like walking into the hotel, getting on the elevator, getting food \u2013 proved to be very difficult. By evening, I was incredibly low in spirit. I felt foolish not brave. I felt horrible for the way we\u2019d inconvenienced so many people. I thought I\u2019d made a big mistake taking Rhema on a journey she simply couldn\u2019t handle. I was angry that it was so hard. In spite of the wonderful help we\u2019d received all day, I was bitter. When we were seated on the plane and I was holding Rhema begging God to help me hold on and she escaped, those moments,  that\u2019s  when I needed the help. I texted my sister, \u201cIt was worse than my nightmares.\u201d She texted back, \u201cNow God will bless bigger than your best dreams\u2026\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2015/08/07/finding-the-lock-part-1/", "title": "Finding the Lock \u2013 Part\u00a01"},
{"date": "August 10, 2015", "body": "\u201cWhile they were saying it couldn\u2019t be done, it was done.\u201d \n~Helen Keller Day 1 When we arrived at our RPM training, Soma was waiting for us. As in standing in the parking lot, waiting. It was as if she already understood that walking in and sitting in a waiting room would have been difficult for us. She was ready. I was a bit star struck, having read her books and heard so much about her. Before I could say a word she ushered Rhema into the building. She had a sense of urgency about her; she would not waste time on introductions. Rhema and Soma. Same height. Immediately she began a lesson on markers \u2013 Rhema had managed to grab some on the way in. She spoke with her as if they\u2019d known each other for years. Never once did she use \u201cbaby talk\u201d or simplify her speech. Even though Rhema hummed and rocked and scribbled vigorously, Soma conversed with her as if she was listening and understanding everything. I quickly realized Soma was not only teaching lessons in spelling, math and history, but also lessons in life. She gave advice as if she were passing on gems of wisdom like an old friend. \u201cWait. Everything has it\u2019s time.\u201d \u201cLife has discipline. Strive for discipline. If you don\u2019t, how will they know how intelligent you are?\u201d \u201cAlways respect your teacher.\u201d Methodically she taught Rhema to spell by instructing her to push her pencil through letters on a stencil board. It was tedious work. I\u2019ve been trying to do RPM with Rhema at home for a few months so it was not unfamiliar to her. As we were leaving that first day, Hope handed Soma a picture she\u2019d drawn. On the back of the paper she\u2019d written, Dear Soma, Thank you so much for teaching my sister. There is nothing I want more than for Rhema to talk to me or wright. Love, Hope Day 2 What happened next, I cannot explain. I am still trying to process it and make sense of it. I watched in utter shock and amazement as \u2018better than my best dreams\u2019 happened right in front of me. Soma gave a lesson in poetry, teaching Rhema to spell the main words in each stanza on the 26-letter stencil board. Then she focused the lesson on rhyming words. She would circle two words in a poem that rhymed and ask Rhema to come up with another rhyming word. To my great surprise, Rhema consistently spelled out rhyming words. Words like SLEEP and PEEP, GROW and KNOW.\u00a0She often needed help spelling the words correctly, but they were clearly words she thought of herself. It was stunning to see my silent girl participating and following along. I did not know if she would understand the questions let alone respond in a meaningful way. I kept wondering,\u00a0 Is  this really happening? {I want to clarify that RPM is not FC (Facilitated Communication). Moral support and verbal prompts are common, but there is no physical prompting (as in hand over hand or hand to elbow) for the student\u00a0when touching/tapping letters. During Rhema\u2019s sessions, Soma periodically repositions the pencil in her hand to encourage her to keep going, but all of the letter pointing and tapping is performed by Rhema.} Next Soma did an exercise where she would say a word from the poem and ask Rhema think of something that went with that word. \u201cNot rhyming words this time,\u201d she instructed, \u201cJust any word that comes to mind.\u201d I did not expect this to go well. Soma wrote the word \u201cmorning\u201d. Rhema spelled PANCAKES, only needing some prompting for the last few letters. I don\u2019t think Rhema\u2019s ever eaten pancakes \u2013 she doesn\u2019t like them \u2013 but on a recent Saturday morning Brandon and I made a big production over pancakes. We tried to make gluten free, dairy free, egg free blueberry pancakes and failed miserably. We had laughed about it. Rhema had been there, of course. She\u2019d been  around , in and out of the kitchen, stealing popsicles. Though no one had spoken directly to her, she was taking everything in. Rhema spelled PANCAKES. !!! Our pancakes Soma asked her for more words to go\u00a0with \u201cmorning\u201d and Rhema pointed to more letters: BIRDS and SCOOL. When\u00a0given\u00a0the word \u201cstar\u201d, Rhema tapped the letters: IT SHINES. It. Shines. I\u00a0kid you not. My jaw was on the floor. My heart was pounding. My head was spinning. When it was time to take a break Rhema bolted into an office and grabbed pens and highlighters off the desk. Later, during a lesson about David Livingstone and exploring new places, Soma reminded her that there are some places one is not supposed to go. She lectured, \u201cLike into the office without asking. And like the cockpit.\u201d (I\u2019d told her about our troubles on the plane.) Soma continued, \u201cWhat would you tell me about that?\u201d Rhema spelled SORY. I blinked. Oh, my heart. About everything that had happened on the plane\u2026 she was saying sorry. Really? Really? I\u2019d felt so low, so discouraged and now, was God redeeming that struggle somehow, giving me a gift I could never have imagined? It was too much for me to handle. In that moment I couldn\u2019t speak. (Later I would whisper to her, It\u2019s ok, sweet girl. It\u2019s ok.) I played it over and over in my mind. For the hundredth time I wondered if it was real, if I had imagined the whole thing. I couldn\u2019t wait to get the video recordings of the RPM sessions so that I could make sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming. I prayed,  God, I feel like a child on Christmas morning. I think the gift we\u2019ve waited on for so long is right in front of us. But I\u2019m afraid. Afraid to open it and discover that it\u2019s not the right one. I want to shake it, flip it, turn it over in my hands. Even with everything that has happened\u2026 before I can trust this and let my heart hope, I have to see more.

And I laugh like the purple pie man, \u201cHa, ha, haaaa.\u201d I love her eagerness for quiet time in the morning. At age eight, she is sincere and unashamed in her faith,  devoted . I pray she will always be. That she will know His faithfulness stretches across all the days of her life. That she always knows she is His, a daughter of love. Recently I dug out one of my old devotion journals and showed it to her. Pages and pages of my reflections on verses and prayers I\u2019d prayed over 20 years ago. (Interspersed with some notes to boys, I might add. One says, \u2018Please don\u2019t call me anymore.\u2019 But I guess I never gave it to him(?)) Pages of the heart of a girl trying to love her God. Then Hope showed me a psalm she\u2019d written, and she said I could share it here. (Oh, and she\u2019s proud of her *creative* spelling).

{"date": "August 11, 2015", "body": "\u201cNow to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine\u2026\u201d \n~Ephesians 3:20 Rhema started Day 3 off by bolting into the building and attempting to swipe markers from the office. But the main office door was locked, and Rhema was  not  happy about it. She was resistant to walk away from the door. Soma pulled out a stencil board and a pencil and asked Rhema about the door. With a little prompting Rhema poked the pencil through the letters, spelling LOCKED. And then she calmed. We moved to the classroom and as Soma began the lesson we realized that Rhema had cut her hand, most likely during the struggle at the office door. Soma said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I must have cut you with the pencil.\u201d She looked at me and apologized, \u201cI feel horrible.\u201d Rhema touched the scratch on her hand. Soma said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Does it hurt?\u201d She held up the stencils. Rhema spelled, IT WAS MY FAULT. You guys. I just sat there frozen in disbelief. I couldn\u2019t even breathe. So often it has seemed to me that Rhema was not even aware of her actions. Who was this person? Taking responsibility, seeking to remove guilt from another. How did she even know the expression \u2018It was my fault\u2019? Unfazed, Soma continued with the lesson as if my whole world had not been forever altered. It was a geography lesson and I\u00a0was in a haze. I vaguely remember Rhema being prompted through spelling words like river, meander, mountains, glacier, plains and delta. I \u201ccame to\u201d when Soma announced Rhema would be given a multiple choice test on what she\u2019d learned. She explained to Rhema that this is what they do in school \u2013 they give tests to see what information the student has retained. Rhema selected the correct answers to the questions. I had to guess on one of the questions because I did not know the answer. Rhema got 100. She asked me what Rhema had done in math. Huh? I mumbled something about patterns and counting. Soma started off with simple addition and subtraction and progressed to showing her how to add and subtract 3 digit numbers. Soma quizzed her non-stop for about 15 minutes and included math problems and reasoning. This child who cannot verbally count to ten. I watched as if in a dream as she pointed to number stencils and answered every math problem correctly. Soma asked her, \u201cIs this easy or hard? Tap E for easy or H for hard.\u201d Rhema tapped the E and then Soma encouraged her to spell the rest of the word. EASY. Well, that did it. The math did me in; my mind thoroughly blown. Hope leaned over and whispered that I was \u201ccrying a little bit.\u201d I got on the phone and blubbered to Brandon, \u201cGet on a plane to Texas. You\u2019ve got to see this. You\u2019ve got to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d Brandon got to Texas for Day 4 of RPM camp and was able to see Rhema do math problems and answer questions. Her emotions seemed to be all over the place during her sessions that day. She cried at one point and spelled SAD \u2013 the first time she\u2019s ever been able to communicate an emotion like that. Soon after, she was in a super silly mood and one of the last words she spelled in her session was DAD. *** Coming home was strange\u2026 even our house feels different somehow. Rhema is the same girl she\u2019s always been with the same challenges and needs, yet everything about her and everything around her feels illumined, forever changed. The task of picking up where Soma left off and continuing to teach her to spell on the letter boards is daunting. The first couple days back have been hard. I\u2019m scared to death we\u2019ll botch the whole thing, but we\u2019re giving it all we\u2019ve got. We know too much now. These hidden treasures are in all of our children. I believe that now more than ever. God has done this amazing thing in our lives. It is indeed the gift I have prayed and waited for (and I know many have prayed along with us \u2013 thank you!). He signed his glorious name on it all in love. I am overwhelmed and humbled by such grace and generosity. Five years ago I wrote  here : I want to tell everyone I know that God is the  Speech Maker . With Him,  nothing  is impossible. He alone can give words to the one with no voice. Come and listen. Can you hear her?

My warm peanut butter chocolate chip cookies \u2013 my reward for the day \u2013 were fresh out of the oven. I couldn\u2019t wait so I lifted a cookie off the sheet before it had time to cool and it crumbled in my hand. I gobbled it.  Oh well. \u201cFor ye have need of patience\u2026\u201d  ~Heb 10:36 Aw, shoot. I grew up memorizing Bible verses in the King James version and to this day they pop in my head at opportune and inopportune times. (My favorite verse is/was always \u201cBut Lord, he stinketh!\u201d \u2013 John 11:39) I was incorrect in saying that we would pick up where Soma left off. Ha. No. Rather we\u2019re starting at the beginning. Right back at square one. Every day we do our RPM sessions and it\u2019s\u2026 not  horrible . If it were horrible I\u2019d be eating five cookies. I\u2019m only eating four. The incredible progress we saw with Rhema in Texas (and in Wisconsin months before) seems to have missed the plane home. But I\u2019d been warned to expect this. That Rhema might be slow to open up. That this learning to spell is hard stuff. That it will take time and practice, practice, practice. That as my friend Lydia said, \u201cCommunication is an incredible gift, but it\u2019s a massive change, and, well, some of us are a bit unsure about change, even the very best kind.\u201d But oh I\u2019m hungry to have a taste of the communication Soma and Rhema shared. It seems like the waiting is harder now that we know what is truly possible. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve found the lock but now we must work on the combination. Charles Spurgeon, my favorite, says that we can cheerfully wait when we are certain that we shall not wait in vain. So I\u2019m trying to let go of my timetable and my worries and just enjoy the practice. The practice of RPM and working with my girl, and the practice of waiting. There is a new closeness in our family now that Rhema has given us a glimpse of a part of her we\u2019d never known before. When I used to talk to her I could only hope she understood my words. Now, I completely believe she does. Our conversations are sweeter because of it. And she seems delighted, she\u2019s been wearing a beautiful, contagious soul-smile. Yes, there can be joy in waiting.

When Hope coughs Rhema gets upset and hits, scratches or pulls Hope\u2019s hair. Hope has asthma \u2013 the kind that\u2019s landed her in the hospital in the past \u2013 and this time of year her asthma and allergies are always troublesome. We\u2019ve encouraged her to keep her distance when she needs to cough. But often she doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s coughing until it\u2019s too late. On Easter Sunday we sat in a circle at Children\u2019s Church while my friend taught the lesson. Rhema sat in my lap and colored and hummed and tried her best to stay in the circle. Hope, sitting next to us, coughed. Before I could stop her, Rhema reached out and hurt her sister. Hope\u2019s eyes silently begged me not to make a scene. So I just leaned over and kissed the spot of her head where she\u2019d been scratched and whispered \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d My heart breaks for both of my girls. Rhema\u2019s sensitivity to sounds seems to have increased over the past year and sometimes she is simply unable to cope. Some noises cause her to wilt in frustration; others cause her to lash out. With the myriad sounds in her day \u2013 predictable and unpredictable \u2013 I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for her to process. I was driving the girls home from school when Hope coughed in the backseat. \u201cRhema, stop! Stop!\u201d Hope pleaded as Rhema grabbed her head. I frantically pulled over and pried Rhema\u2019s fingers from Hope\u2019s hair. These are the moments that haunt Brandon and me and keep us up at night. Hours later I can still hear Hope\u2019s cries in my ears, still see her tears. At home I said, \u201cRhema, I want you to say sorry to Hope.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I just felt helpless and frustrated and angry for both of them. I held Rhema still while Hope stood there quietly and I prompted Rhema several times,  Say sorry. Finally my girl uttered two soft sounds. Sorry is such a hard word to say when your tongue doesn\u2019t work the way it should. But she tried. It didn\u2019t sound like \u201csorry.\u201d But we knew. And really she never had to say it. We knew she was sorry. She doesn\u2019t mean to hurt, we know how very much she loves. And then she put her hands to her eyes and cried. I froze. To see her pain and remorse in this way and for us understand it was a new experience. Hope wrapped arms around her, \u201cOh Rhema, I forgive you. I forgive you. It\u2019s ok.\u201d I hugged both of their curly heads to my heart. Forgiveness so costly, yet freely, joyfully given. \u201cDissolved by thy goodness, I fall to the ground. And weep to the praise of the mercy I\u2019ve found.*\u201d  I\u2019ve known it, I  know  it every day. As I stand speechless and guilty and sorry of many things. Seventy times seven times, He pays my debts and washes them all away. I am welcomed into open arms of mercy, covered in unfailing love. Later I asked her as we sat at the kitchen table, \u201cHope, how does God forgive?\u201d \u201cHe forgives forever.\u201d And again and again amen. *Thy Mercy, My God by Sandra McCracken ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/dsc_2226comp.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/forgiven-much/", "title": "Forgiven much"},
{"date": "September 17, 2015", "body": "We have many rituals, many little things we do the same way every day. From the way she makes me sit on the stool next to her in the bathroom to where and how she eats, walks, sits, comes and goes \u2013 everything has a pattern and must be done in a particular way. Our routines around RPM (Rapid Prompting Method) practice are quite established now. Terre, our therapist extraordinaire, comes on Saturday mornings and she and Rhema have their own way of working together. When it\u2019s time for a session with me, she gets up and heads down to the basement. She settles into her broken-down arm chair and hands me the remote. She knows I won\u2019t turn on the TV, but handing the remote to me anyway is part of the process. I read a story or do a math lesson. She scribbles on paper. I write words and numbers, hold up the stencil board and prompt her to stick her pencil through the letters. We \u201ctalk\u201d about it all\u2026 how Moses persevered, how Leah found beauty and worth in God\u2019s eyes, and how the yellow in Joseph\u2019s coat must have been brilliant. At the end she hands me the remote again and pulls me to sit in the broken-down chair with her. She wraps my arm around her and pulls the table in close as if to tuck us in. Silently we sit and watch the same old nursery rhymes. Together. It what we do. Sometimes I think that through our RPM practice we\u2019re finding a new pathway to each other through a complicated maze. A place where I get a glimpse of the  more  she has to share, and she discovers that she can indeed share it and be heard. Other times, try as we might there\u2019s no making sense of that board of 26 letters. We\u2019re looking at each other across a great divide. Pages and pages of written on/scribbled on paper like our own Morse code litter the table, the floor, the room. Nauseating, deep discouragement and panic set in\u2026 will we ever make it? Will we find the way again? I dare to pick up the book again \u2013 the Jesus Storybook Bible. Joseph, the dreamer, has been sold into slavery in Egypt. It seems all his big plans have been cruelly ruined. I read to her, to me, \u201cBut God had a magnificent dream for Joseph\u2019s life and even when it looked like everything had gone wrong, God would use it all to help make the dream come true. God would use everything that was happening to Joseph to do something good.\u201d And so the story goes\u2026 But God had a magnificent dream for Rhema\u2019s life and even when it looked like everything had gone wrong, God would use it all to help make the dream come true. God would use everything that was happening to Rhema to do something good\u2026 Take heart. It\u2019s doing something. Working something. I don\u2019t know what the \u201cgone wrong\u201d looks like in your space, but I know that nothing is wasted in His hands. When Rhema was a baby I began quoting Romans 10:8-9 to her as I put her to bed. It\u2019s another ritual \u2013 more for me than for her, I think. (And now, Hope too, requires I say the verse to her at bedtime as well). If I\u2019m not there to put her to bed, I slip into her room after she\u2019s asleep and whisper that verse. In the past I\u2019ve written it on her bedroom door. \u201cRhema, the Word is near you; it is in your mouth\u2026\u201d I touch her lips. \u201c\u2026and in your heart\u2026\u201d I trace a heart on her chest. And one day out of the blue, when she was five years old, she said words in her verse. \u2018Mouth\u2019 and \u2018heart\u2019 and \u2018saved\u2019. I hadn\u2019t known she was listening or remembering or even caring. But the words had made their way into her heart and they\u2019ve never left. Our many feeble attempts, our messes of paper, pencils, stories, numbers and letters. Our never ending, seemingly meaningless routines. Our long days of trying and praying and hoping. I can\u2019t always see it, but I have to believe. It\u2019s doing something good.

{"date": "August 27, 2015", "body": "When Rhema was three, she had a portable DVD player that in many ways served as a security blanket for her. (This was before iPads!) We\u2019d play her favorite nursery rhymes and Barney videos over and over. Before going to bed she\u2019d always\u00a0want a video of a live George Strait concert. That little player got us through\u00a0doctor appointments, air travels,\u00a0and long term EEG monitoring in the hospital. It was a constant for her. One Christmas we flew to Michigan to visit grandparents and family we don\u2019t get to see very often. Rhema\u2019s young cousins were naturally quite interested in her DVD player and kind of hijacked it without realizing it. Rhema let them. In a space that was not her home, where everything was different and unpredictable, she shared the thing that brought her comfort. Brandon took a picture and I keep it on my dresser to this day because it\u2019s a perfect reflection of a kind and patient heart, a\u00a0willingness to move aside, to share.  What\u2019s mine is yours . Last night, after the girls had been fed and bathed, I made myself a bowl of ravioli for dinner. I set it at my spot on the table and went to the refrigerator for a cup of juice. Rhema came\u00a0and sat down in her chair, reached for my bowl and began eating. I groaned. \u201cSilly goose. That was mine.\u201d But she\u2019s always felt free to help herself to whatever. (I kind of love that.) I thought of splitting the meal with her but she\u2019d already topped it with a mountain of cheese, and ravioli and sauce slipped and squirmed through her fingers. I sat down next to her as she ate. Watching her reminded me of\u00a0when I was twenty years old working in Ethiopia at one of Mother Teresa\u2019s homes for the homeless, the sick and dying. I lived in the women\u2019s quarters and a patient would often slip into my room at night. Without a word, she would sit on my cot and eat my toothpaste. We did not speak the same language so she would just smile at me as she made a meal out of my toothpaste. My time in Ethiopia was like no other and my love for the people was so strong I really gave\u00a0little thought for myself. Whatever I could do or give, I did, I wanted to help. I gladly took my clothes from my suitcase and gave them all to streetgirls. Without hesitation Rhema reached over, took my cup and gulped down the drink. I laughed and echoed words from my heart felt long ago on the streets of Addis Ababa.  What\u2019s mine is yours. Our lives are filled with the weight of too many demands. The things I really want to do I cannot do \u2013 it seems there\u2019s no time left for it at day\u2019s end. And often what I  am  doing just doesn\u2019t seem good enough in my eyes. The God who spared not His own Son, is the most generous of givers and we are the most blessed of receivers. It occurs to me that this stuff \u2013  \u2018all that has been in my life up to now\u2019 \u00a0can be given\u00a0to Him who gave all. The One who said,  I am yours . Call it extreme or \u201cdevout\u201d, but I hope this, pray this, want to live this: In the kitchen\u00a0in a heap of deferred dreams, and even in suffering, we come near and dance Freedom\u2019s dance. We fall on our knees in joy and\u00a0thanksgiving, unclench our fists. We lift up our loves, our empty cups, our suitcase of not-enoughs and guilty pasts, that thing we long for most, our small and big. All of it, an offering.\u00a0 Take this from my hands , everything I have.  What is mine? I belong to You.

She\u00a0never acts like she\u2019s the new kid on the block, even though\u00a0she has only been on the earth a short time. She has the wonderful ability to lighten the mood wherever she goes; unfazed by chaos, she will greet you with a grin so wide that her eyes squeeze shut. She is the merriment of\u00a0my life. Hope\u2019s nature helps me understand what it means to \u201cabound in hope.\u201d Abound can mean to \u201coverflow\u201d or \u201cexist in great quantities, a surplus.\u201d When I gave my heart to Christ, He gave me a hope that no matter what happens in my life, I will one day see His glory and live with Him. I know no greater hope. But I only just realized that this kind of hope is one that spawns even *more*\u00a0hope. I picture hope bursting at the seams, running over, uncontainable. Where there is progress and good news, there is hope. Where there is regression and sorrow, there is still more hope. Hope is plenteous; it never runs out. \u2026I want to exude this kind of Hope hope. God is the God of hope. At age eight, she still abounds in hope and fills my heart everyday. Recently she\u00a0made a \u201cStress Pocket\u201d for me and told me to take it to work. She explained that I could pull a card from it whenever I felt the need. I asked her where she came up with such an idea. I thought perhaps our friend Katie had told her about her birthday gift of special cards to her mother. Hope just smiled and said, \u201cI thought of it myself. And I did it one-handed. Haha.\u201d (She broke her wrist a few weeks ago). I put the Stress Pocket on my desk at work and forgot about it\u2026 until one day last week it caught my eye. I pulled out the instructions\u2026 {This is your stress bag. When you are feeling stressed pick a card (any card) and read it. Hopefuly, you will be encouraged. Your done!} So\u00a0I pulled out a card: {Cast all your cares and anxitey on him, because he cares for you.} I could have dissolved into a puddle\u00a0right there on the spot. My girl was\u00a0 ministering  to me, not with her own words but with the ancient words \u2013 God\u2019s Words \u2013 that alone have power to change my heart, lift my soul, spur me on. Even at a young age, she\u00a0knows these Words, she\u2019s proved\u00a0them, and they are spirit and life. How I desperately needed to remember and believe that simply\u00a0 He cares for me . I didn\u2019t know if I was allowed to pick another card, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\u00a0I laughed when the next card I pulled\u00a0had hearts and smiley faces and\u00a0said, \u201cPick again.\u201d This was getting fun. {\u201cCommit to the Lord whatever you do and your plans will succeed.\u201d} Over the past few days I have pulled more cards and each one is a treasure. {\u201cFear not for I am with you.\u201d} {\u201cdo not worry about anything instead pray about every thing.\u201d} {\u201cconsider it pure joy whenever yo face trials of meany kinds because you know that the testing of your faith developes persevearance.\u201d} \u00a0 Thank you, dear\u00a0Hope.

The paper looks like scribbles of blues, purples, reds and black. I\u2019ve learned to look closely, the moment her pen touches the paper. In so doing I\u2019ve discovered a prize. She freely writes letters, numbers, mom, dad, her name, Hope, the alphabet\u2026 and hearts. She draws hearts (!). Some of the letters are embellished with circles on the end and extra swirls. Some letters find the edge of a box she\u2019s drawn, others are in the center. She writes each letter quickly and then scribbles over it. You\u2019d never realize it when looking at the finished product, but there are words. Hidden words on the page. The  first time she wrote her name  \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just her name, it was a work of art: Rhema copies her name for the first name. Isn\u2019t that just like our kids? There\u2019s so much to see and hear and discover beneath their swirling colors and sharp patterns, the seemingly odd choices and even difficult behavior. We get caught up with the dealing, the just-making-it-through-the-day. When right there, right before our eyes, is treasure. Don\u2019t forget to look. Describing Rhema to a group of college students I once said: She does not often look up. She may cover her face if you speak to her. She may not seem to hear you or understand what you are saying. She rocks and hums. She squeezes her eyes shut. She shrieks and giggles. She does not speak. She rarely shows emotion on her face. She has no super-talent that we know of \u2013 she\u2019s a Special Olympics gymnastics dropout. She has really good days and really not good days. She\u2019s predictably unpredictable. She is often overlooked, occupying the periphery. She is severely affected by autism and a stubborn seizure disorder. She needs help with every part of her day.

I came in to say goodbye the night before. Because I am not conversational at 4 in the morning when he heads for the airport. \u201cGimme a hug.\u201d He hugged me and didn\u2019t let go. After a few moments I tried to break free, but his arms were too strong. Oh ok. A game. I patted him on the shoulder patronizingly and put on my Mommy voice: \u201cAll done.\u201d I was teasing, I didn\u2019t mind. And I am always, always too worried about time. How long had it been since we just rested in an embrace? When I thought we were done, he quickly whipped my arm across his shoulder and around his neck and held my hand captive. I laughed. It was a Rhema move. She has this way of getting you into a Jiu-Jitsu armlock and you\u2019re pretty much at her mercy. When we walk, when we sit, at home, in public, wherever \u2013 my arm is usually locked in position over her right shoulder. I think it makes her feel safe. I think it\u2019s her way of keeping me close. Lately it seems more than ever Rhema wants us to just  be . With her. It forces us to slow down, and I try to remind myself of how awesome it is that she wants this and is seeking it out. Giving her special time and attention means sitting with her while she listens to her favorite songs or plays on her iPad. It means driving, just driving, in the car together. It means a tickle fest. It means hooking pinky fingers long after you\u2019ve tucked her in. And if you try to leave\u2026 well, then the ninja armlock from a warrior girl. There\u2019s an old  Sara Groves song  that resonates with me deeply because it reminds me of precious friendships I\u2019ve shared and missed\u2026 and times with family I\u2019ll never forget. I am long on staying. I am slow to leave. Especially when it comes to you my friend\u2026 And I wish all the people I love the most could gather in one place and know each other and love each other well\u2026. And at the risk of wearing out my welcome, At the risk of self-discovery, I\u2019ll take every moment and every minute that you\u2019ll give me. Tonight we stole time and my Brandon took extra moments to hold me and be silly.  Thank you, faithful love.   I\u2019m so glad our arms are locked. And my Hope, already eight, kind and funny and amazing\u2026 she still wants to hold my hand, play with my hair, and giggle in my ear.  Oh darling, I will take it. Eight or eighty-eight, I love nothing more than holding your sweet hand in mine. Can you stay forever ? And my Rhema, it seems new, this being jealous for my attention. Our bond is deeper somehow, like she\u2019s shared a secret. Slowly, wondrously blooming, she is an exquisite flower.  I\u2019ll try not to rush, dear girl. I\u2019ll take every moment. Every smile, every connection, every sweet sound. Every moment and every minute that you\u2019ll give me.

She\u2019s had a string of good days and we\u2019ve been basking in her, the light in her smile and eyes.

Then I turn to Rhema knowing that Brandon has already petitioned God on her behalf, like Jairus falling on his knees, he\u2019s taken her and lifted her up. As she hums beside me, I am overcome. Because it is a gift, such a precious gift to pray over my daughter and trust that I am heard. Just simple, heartfelt  prayers of a mama  as a new school year begins. And it\u2019s the best and all I have. I know too well that the dark days will come, so I ask Him to be\u00a0with her and hold her in the ways I can\u2019t. That she would know Him near.

A couple weeks ago I posted this on  Rhemashope Facebook  page: We\u2019re at the point where the people have escaped Egypt, they are at the edge of the desert and they don\u2019t know the way\u2026 they don\u2019t know how to go on. But again there\u2019s the promise from God to Moses and to the people: I am with you. Rhema practiced spelling the word PROMISE.  So I wrote God\u2019s promise on paper, and she spelled it on the letterboard: \nI AM WITH YOU. Letter by deliberate letter, we believe more and more. He\u2019s spelling it out for us, inscribing it on our hearts. . Last night we read how the Israelites were trapped at the edge of the wilderness, with mountains on one side, the Sea in front of them, and Pharoah and his army with 600 chariots closing in on them. God caused strong winds to blow that parted the Red Sea and the people walked across on dry land to safety. Our Storybook Bible described it like this: When there had been no way, God made a way. It\u2019s good to remember the presence and faithfulness of God in seasons past\u2026 when we did not know the way. A friend once wrote: \u201c Remember \u00a0God.\u00a0 Remember\u00a0 him well.\u00a0 Remember \u00a0where you\u2019ve come from, where you\u2019ve been, and where you\u2019re headed.\u00a0 Remember\u00a0 how he\u2019s been there each and every time. He\u2019s in it all\u2014past, present, and future, and his faithfulness never ends.\u201d I said to Rhema, \u201cAfter Daddy and I got married we wanted to have a baby. But for some reason it was hard for me to get pregnant. I wondered if it would ever happen. And then one day after years of trying I found out that there was a precious life growing inside me. I was so happy. It was you! God made a way. And then Daddy had go away to war for a year just before you were born\u2026 we were stationed\u00a0in Germany and I wondered how we\u2019d do it. But God showed us the way. And I\u2019ll never forget the time we needed to get you into a special school as soon as possible. The school had a five year waiting list. You got in in three months! God made a way for us.\u201d (I find myself telling her\u00a0things I\u2019ve never told her before. Or, perhaps I did tell her in the past, but our conversations are different now. I now know they are not one-sided. It\u2019s awesome (so awesome!) to really be able to talk with my girl and believe she understands.) Then I asked her something. And I don\u2019t know if I was messing things up by asking such an open ended question at this stage, but there was no turning back. I held up the stencil board. \u201cSo\u2026 what do think about when you think of God making a way? Just one word is fine.\u201d I don\u2019t think it was coincidence, the word she spelled. We\u2019d practiced it once or twice several weeks before, but she had not attempted it since. She spelled R H E M A.

It\u2019s been a challenge to find the time and energy to think and write.\u00a0And when I\u2019ve been away from this space for too long, I complicate things in my head and pressure myself to be something other than I am. Like students in the first few weeks of school, we seem to be\u00a0in a review course. Right now we\u2019re just simple. Grace is an ongoing lesson \u2013 how to give and be grace to one another. Because we have received God\u2019s never-ending grace. My biggest grace-teachers are Brandon, Rhema and Hope. Even when I am absolutely horrible, those three  love  me.  \u201cGrace means there is nothing I can do to make God love me more, and nothing I can do to make God love me less.\u201d*  Every day, every single day that I get to be Rhema and Hope\u2019s mother, God whispers this truth to me. I watched a video from six years ago when Rhema\u2019s was working with her in-home therapist. Unexpectedly the video brought tears to my eyes. (Nevermind the fact that my precious baby is growing up so fast!) In it, she is so happy. No aggressions, no bites on her arms or self-hitting, no pulled-out hair. Just giggly. And she speaks. She says, \u201cOne, two, three, go.\u201d It\u2019s\u00a0her sweet four year old voice, and\u00a0it\u2019s been so very long (years) since we\u2019ve heard clear, articulate, spontaneous words like that. It was like hearing her speaking voice for the first time again and I played it repeatedly, memorizing the sound. And I wished for a different story. And I wondered and worried. Did we miss something? Did the seizures do this? Did she regress so much? Is it that we failed to consistently practice \u201cOne, two, three, go\u201d that we lost it somehow? This morning I underlined a sentence in the commentary that accompanies my Bible study of Joshua.  \u201cPeople in biblical times viewed a name as a living sign representing the future potential of an individual.\u201d  I reviewed: Her name is  Rhema , which means \u2018spoken word, a thing said\u2019 Her name is a promise. Some have encouraged me, saying that I speak for her through this blog. Yes, I record the stories and share what God is teaching\u00a0 me \u00a0through it all. But I believe that she speaks (and will speak in whatever form that may be \u2013 vocally, in writing, pictures, etc.) for herself. I simply still believe. Though we could not have imagined the challenges and setbacks we would face, God still has a good good plan for our loved ones, for our dear children. \u00a0My friend Judith once said of her son, \u201cTwo steps forward, one step back. I still believe in you, Jack.\u201d I still believe in you, God, able to do \u2018exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think\u2019**.

Anne explains how a certain hand position helped Helen. Helen would put her thumb on Anne\u2019s throat, her index finger on Anne\u2019s lips and her 2nd finger on Anne\u2019s nose. In so doing, Helen could feel the vibrations of spoken words. I\u2019ve watched it a hundred times and wiped a hundred tears and it never fails to inspire me to keep believing. To have the courage to try. To never give up. To keep praying that God will show us creative ways to help Rhema speak, in whatever way she will. Unexpectedly a slot opened up at  Soma\u2019s RPM  camp in Austin, Texas. The opportunity for Soma to work with Rhema and for me to observe and learn from her is on the level of me being gifted a thousand\u00a0cupcakes. A dream come true. (Smile). But I did not think we could possibly go. I laughed and said to Brandon: \u201cI mean, of course we can\u2019t go. That would be\u2026 like\u2026 crazy.

{"date": "September 18, 2014", "body": "I was sitting on the couch minding my own business when Rhema walked up to me and started pushing something into my mouth. She caught me off guard and I sputtered and resisted at first, not knowing what she was doing. I took her hand and found sprinkles stuck to her palm. Flower sprinkles. She tried again, pressing one to my lips. Rhema has a strong opinion about sprinkles: she LOVES them. I keep them on a high shelf so that she doesn\u2019t eat a whole container full in one sitting. She\u2019d moved a stool over to the cabinet, got down the sprinkles, and forced them into my mouth, I mean, offered me some. Oh my heart. I think you know. This was no small thing. This\u00a0sweet girl, seeking me out\u2026 not to lead me to something she wanted (and just the fact that she looks for me is something I never want to take for granted). She came to me to give to me. Brandon and Hope wanted some, too. She generously went to them with her sprinkles. Thank you, Rhema. During my junior year in college I had the life-changing experience of living and working at the  Missionaries of Charity Home for the Destitute and Dying \u00a0in the poorest section of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The mission was founded by Mother Teresa and I spent my days working with special needs children in the orphanage and sharing life with the young women who lived there. Every day we shared the same meal together: injera \u2013 a spongy, porous bread, topped with small portions of meat or potato and a sauce called shiro. Injera meal (Source: Wikipedia) At these meals my Ethiopian friends would \u201cgorsha\u201d me. Gorsha is when you break off a piece of injera with your right hand, wrap it around a piece of meat, dip it in the shiro, and then put it in your friend\u2019s mouth. Gorsha, they taught me, was an act of love and friendship. And the bigger than handful of food, the greater the love. Honestly the gorsha took some getting used to. I missed forks and spoons. Our injera was gray, thin and bitter (the poor kind) and the shiro made it all soggy and squishy in the fingers. Sometimes I worried I would throw up. But when I began to understand it, this special way of feeding the ones you love, it touched me deeply. We did not speak the same language, but as my bonds grew strong with these Ethiopian women, I began to treasure our time eating injera. I will never forget sitting through entire meals with my heart and mouth wide open as friends fed me gorsha-style. They forever have a piece of my heart. \u201cI am the Lord your God\u2026 open wide your mouth and I will fill it with good things.\u201d Ps. 81:10 Missionaries of Charity, Addis, 1995. I am third from the left, back row. Nineteen years later and my Rhema doesn\u2019t know it, but she\u2019s given me a precious gift. She\u2019s taken me back. Once I sat in a circle of women over soggy bread and sauce, in a home for the outcast, the orphans the sick and destitute; they nourished my soul and I felt so thankful and special to be among them. Once Rhema gently pushed apple slices into my mouth, and  I was comforted . Today she fed me sticky flower sprinkles. I am loved. I am full.

{"date": "October 10, 2014", "body": "She got a promotion\u00a0to heaven this week. She was not my biological grandmother. All of my grandparents died young and I never got a chance to know them. So\u00a0Gramma, aka Mariam Smith, \u201cadopted\u201d my sisters and I as her own. The moment she decided we were hers, she poured into our lives \u2014 from when we had long skinny black legs and puffy ponytails to the day each of us walked down the aisle to the time we were handing over a new baby for her to hold. My sisters and I have always been amazed and\u00a0baffled by how she loved us so much. She shaped us, she fed us, she showed us what it looks like to be a good wife and mother, she taught us about life and love and how Jesus never fails. Now that she\u2019s gone I feel almost lost without her comfort and wisdom. She\u2019d often call me up (or email me) after reading a blog I wrote and preach me a little sermon. I\u2019m so glad I saved her letters and comments. Gramma had many, many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was connected to this little section of the blogosphere just\u00a0because I was here. And if she met you she\u2019d adopt you, too. No matter who you are or who you\u2019ve been, she\u2019d gather you under her wings and bake you a pie. You  would  feel loved and valued, you\u2019d have no say in the matter. Her words that I share here were for me and Brandon, but perhaps you might take some encouragement from them as well. And get a glimpse of her beautiful heart. On marriage And again I say PRAY. For the other half of you. You are so Blessed to have each other. Prayer and Praise will PREVAIL. Love you both. Gramma \n You know Jeneil I believe actions speak louder than words,You can say I love you until the cows come home but it is what you do to prove or show your love. Hope I have not been too preachie but helpful cuz you know I love you and Brandon.  Love, Gramma \n Dear Jeneil,  I just read your blog and wanted to comment to you and Brandon privately.  My four children all know and will tell you they were well loved by their Mother and Father,but they always knew that their father put their mother first and vice versa\u2026  We never had Date night because we enjoyed staying home an being with our children,but we did thing to show how special we thought each other was\u2026 On food Hi Jeneil,How are you doing?Have you eaten the pie yet? I hope it was alright.It is not the best I can do,I was a little short\u00a0 of my crust so I called it apple pie crumb.I will do better next time:) Love you much,Gramma Dear Jeneil and Brandon, I LOVED making the food for you and will make it anytime. I was thinking next of baking a chicken and stuffing. It takes such a little effort and I loved knowing my grandchildren are enjoying it. Let me know okay? Love you much, Gramma Hi, Let me know if you want me to cook something for you I will be glad to. It will include chocolate cake with lots of frosting.  Love you much, Gramma On parenting Baby steps,baby steps how gigantic they are to us. \n Go Rhema and Hope. \n Love, Gramma This walk (or run )with Autism has made you and Brandon wiser.Isn\u2019t it funny how we think some things are so important at the time and later we look back and say what was the problem?I could tell you a lot of stories of things I put such emphasis on and later could not for the life of me remember why. \n Keep on keeping on Jeneil and Brandon Rhema is teaching you a lot. Love, Gramma Smith Her\u00a0comment in response to a story I told about a pair of women who sort of implied that Rhema was not smart. It still makes me laugh!: Good for you.I wish I had been there I would have said all of those things for you and then smacked them.:-)Love, Gramma Smith Happy birthday RhemaLove. Because God does not have deadlines for his Blessed children (and aren\u2019t they all Blessed,)Love and kisses from GreatGramma and Grampa Smith HE IS STILL ON THE THRONE JENEIL AND BRANDON\u2026YOU WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR RHEMA BECAUSE GOD WILL TELL YOU.  LOVE YOU MUCH.  GRAMMA  Praise GOD from whom all blessing flow. I know God has a PERFECT PLAN for our precious Greatgrandaughter.  When the praises go up Healing comes down. \n Hang in there Jeneil and Brandon, I am so proud of you and your parenting.  Try\u00a0to get some rest.  Love,Gramma You are not making the decisions your faith is.God knows all that Rhema is dealing with and has her in his hands.I know your and Brandon\u2019s parental instincts kick in( and Thank God they do) but you have always given over to God and he has given you two the wisdom to do what is right and safe for Rhema and Hope. \n I will pray and pray for all of you but know in my 76 year old heart and wisdom he has it all under control. Love you much,Gramma I cannot tell you how my heart and eyes filled up reading your beautiful words.You are such a good mother and an excellent author.I love all of you so much and I know that God is reaching and teaching you and Brandon so much through Rhema\u2019s life. We know she is and will be blessed so many times and in so many ways.Do we really appreciate our children\u2019s accomplishments or do we take them for granted? God is teaching you and I to appreciate them. Love to you all and give me a call when you can I really enjoy talking to you.I do not have too much communication with the world now so a telephone conversation with love ones is appreciated. Love, Gramma When I lived in Germany, she sent me this: Hi Jeneil, Just to let you know I am praying for you and counting the days until you come home. Love you, Gramma Hi Gramma, Just to let you know I am forever thankful for you and counting the days until I see you again.

{"date": "October 21, 2014", "body": "Disney World survived us! We made it there and back with the help of a number of individuals and organizations coming together:  Wings for Autism of the Charles River Center ,  ASD Vacations  and  Autism on the Seas . This trip was a first for many and it made the news. Hope, Rhema and I are in the video below briefly and there\u2019s a great shot of the back of my head as I\u2019m trying to get our bags checked. (Ha). Channel 7 News story (video) Channel 5 News  It was both and. Our trip to Disney. It was really fun and good and really hard and challenging. All worth it. And already I find myself letting go of the hard and treasuring in my heart\u2019s memory the GOOD stuff. For families thinking of going to Disney, I wanted to briefly share our biggest challenges: waiting and food. Even though we went during one of the less busy times of year, it was still very crowded and the lines were long. Rhema has only one mission in amusement parks and that is to ride rides \u2013 as many as possible, over and over. She has little patience for shows, exhibits, characters, parades, etc. We used the FastPass system to book three rides in advance each day, but these were all spaced an hour or two apart. We also used the Disability Access Services (DAS) card. We could take the card to a particular ride and get assigned a time to\u00a0return (usually an hour later) so we didn\u2019t have to physically stand in line. We could only use the DAS card for one ride at a time. So you can imagine all the planning and juggling that was needed to manage the waiting and keep things moving. Rhema constantly wanted to bolt. The second we took hands off her she would take off, and on a number of occasions we almost lost her.\u00a0So there was a lot of me or Brandon holding her and a lot of her resisting. This made the waiting tedious. But Rhema amazed me with how well she waited. She had to wait so much and she was flexible when she couldn\u2019t get on a ride. There were times when I was sure she was going to lose her stuffing but she would keep it together. I was so very proud of her. At Magic Kingdom, we met up with Lyah who served as 1:1 respite for Rhema. She used to work at Disney and now teaches kids with autism. She was a wonderful support to us. We\u2019d corresponded a good deal in the past month, and she immediately seemed to understand what Rhema needed and how to help. She helped us maneuver the park and stayed with Rhema while Brandon went to sign us up for rides. Whenever Rhema bolted Lyah was right there.  Thank you, Lyah! Lyah with the girls The food was insanely good! The food was insanely expensive! Rhema is a picky eater and basically refused to eat. Almost every insanely expensive plate of food put in front of her she pushed away. I think she\u2019s only person to go to Disney and actually  lose  weight (wish I could say the same!) Hope is allergic to nuts, wheat, dairy, eggs and soy. Everywhere we went they were very accommodating to Hope\u2019s needs. The challenge came in trying to find a place that served food Rhema would eat (many a meltdown occurs in restaurants because she\u2019s frustrated by the food)  and  that was safe for Hope  and  that fit into our Disney dining plan  and  that didn\u2019t have a long wait. It was a comfort and\u00a0relief to travel with the group of 21 Magic for Autism families. The\u00a0heavy weight of worry I usually feel when we\u2019re traveling (or when we\u2019re in public places in general) was lifted. On the plane, parents periodically checked in with other parents: \u201cHow you doing?\u201d or \u201cHow\u2019s [Ben] or [Sarah] doing?\u201d On the trip home, one boy had a particularly difficult time getting through the security check point with his mother. Even though TSA had set up a separate line for our group and tried to expedite the process, I think the crowds and confusion and noise and unfamiliar was just too much for him. I saw his mother was in tears and so did some of the others. Instantly we left our own precarious situations \u2013 our children/families in the line \u2013 and went to this mother to lay a hand on her shoulder, to encourage her son, to see if we could do anything to help, to even just a shed a tear with her.  Because we got it.  We so got it, because each of us has been there and we needed her to know more than anything that she was not alone. My friend Andrea wrote something years ago that I\u2019ve never forgotten: \u201cAll of us had made similar choices, seen beauty in the same light, endured related pangs, been patient for healing, and bear the same badge with pride. Without much explicit sharing or rolling up of any sleeves, we  knew  each other\u2019s life stories\u2013in large part \u2026 a sisterhood. Women are amazing creatures. And adversity is an amazing bonding agent. Autism is like Krazy Glue. \n Autism mums can be a diverse lot. Some are angry, some are militant, some are bitter, some depressed. \n And yet, some glow.\u201d The ones that glow \u2013 these are the women with whom I traveled. I am excited to share stories from our trip.

{"date": "October 23, 2014", "body": "Hope and I got away, just the two of us, for lunch with the Disney princesses. At one point during our lunch, she explained that she\u2019d been a little disappointed in one of the (gigantic) slides at the water park we\u2019d visited. \u201cI was hoping,\u201d she said casually, \u201cfor something more epic.\u201d I nearly spit my food I laughed so hard, and then I stared at her.     \u00a0 My little Hope. Her love for Disney princesses has faded somewhat, but I recall when she was younger and dressed in gowns and wore a tiara over puffy hair almost every day. People would ask her name and she would very seriously tell them Princess Ariel or Rapunzel or Belle. She\u2019d stay in character all day correcting us when we accidentally called her Hope. Now she\u2019s almost eight and using words like  epic . How and when did this happen? As she laughed and talked and ate her food, I tried my best to memorize every detail of her. Lunch would end too soon. Remember this, I kept telling myself.  Remember this. After dinner on our last night in Florida we stepped into an open sitting area where a man played songs from Disney films on a piano. They were beautiful renditions. Rhema began rocking from one foot to the other. Brandon took her hand and guided her in a circle: \u201cSpin, Rhema.\u201d I cannot recall ever seeing them dance like that. As the piano music filled the air \u2013 \u2018And at last I see the light, and it\u2019s like the fog has lifted\u2026\u2019 Rhema  danced . And we cheered. When the song ended\u00a0a woman walked over to us and said, \u201cYou are a beautiful family.\u201d Her words encouraged me in such an unexpected way and she could not know. Because until\u00a0the moment they danced I\u2019d felt so\u2026 ragtag.\u00a0Just a series of fumbles, barely keeping it together. Brandon and I are not always good to each other when dealing with lots of stress. Taking a\u00a0trip like this\u00a0is stressful, at least for us. And I think the wishing things were different/easier (we do, sometimes we do wish it and that\u2019s just the truth) and the frustration over what we can\u2019t change boils into anger. Anger that we direct at one another. But then moments later we see our girls and all that God has given us and we know there\u2019s beauty in the life of our imperfect family. It\u2019s then that I am just amazed at God\u2019s plan, that He would let me be a part of it, a part them. (So it is with the group of autism families traveling to Disney. It\u2019s not a club\u00a0I would have\u00a0imagined belonging to years ago \u2013 and there was a time I did not  want  to \u2013 and now I feel oddly blessed, so blessed, to be among them.) It\u2019s joy and heartache, it\u2019s beauty and ashes, it\u2019s both and. God\u2019s grace over all. Not one without the other. They spin and swirl and come together, like\u00a0my daughter dancing on her father\u2019s hand.

But not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.\u201d \n~Matt. 10:29 A couple days of video-EEG monitoring for Rhema in the hospital. Tethered to this room. I imagine people in white coats sitting in a control room correlating patient behavior with seizure activity in the brain. I imagine them watching \u2013 with a bowl of popcorn \u2013 the antics in Room 916. They see Rhema eat a blue marker tip. They see me eat three cupcakes. They see Brandon stand in front of the camera, put on his shades, flex, and smolder just for them. They see us pray. They see Hope cry because she doesn\u2019t want to leave her sister for even just one night. Caught on camera is a great view of my rear end (and the three cupcakes that attached themselves to said rear end) as I spend half an hour kicking and fighting with the chair that\u2019s supposed to turn into an extra bed. They see me when I turn and do a few fist pumps when I finally get the darn bed assembled. They see me kiss Rhema\u2019s cheek about every 15 minutes. Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come? Why should my heart feel lonely and long for heaven and home? When Jesus is my portion. A constant friend is He. His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me. Yes, his eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me. Tethered to this world and to these bodies. When she hums and giggles and screams and jerks and cries and we don\u2019t understand, she is seen. When her sister willingly, joyfully does everything she can to love and help her family, she sheds quiet tears, and she is seen. When her father pours himself out for his family, fights the frustration and then deeply longs just to have a conversation with his 10-year old girl, he is seen. When I do the things that only a mother can do for her developmentally delayed child day after day, year after year\u2026 I can\u2019t help my heart \u2013 it misses the things she misses, and I am seen. I heard a message last week from  Priscilla Shirer . She said everything I already knew, and yet it was everything I needed to hear again about overcoming the discouragement that had secretly, painfully settled in my soul. She said that it\u2019s no small thing. That the awesome God who makes something out of nothing every moment, who lays the foundations of earths and causes the morning stars to sing and launches lightening and carves canyons and paints the skies, sees me. Sees her. Sees you. I realized this in a personal way that day. Rhema had not slept through the night in weeks, constant shrieking for days. I felt like breaking, \u201csleep-depraved\u201d as my mother would say. At the end of the seminar, Priscilla prayed and in one line of the prayer she said something like \u2018Lord, please give sleep to the sleepless.\u2019 And a couple tears leaked from my eyes (because I was indeed sleep depraved and) I knew in my gut\u00a0that in a world, in a country, in a state, in a mountain town, in a lecture hall full of people, my God had come to me and  seen me . She sleeps\u2026 She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her:  \u201cYou are the God who sees me,\u201d  for she said,  \u201cI have now seen the One who sees me.\u201d  ~Genesis 16:13 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/camera.jpg", "http://www.goingbeyond.com/", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/shesleeps.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/seen/", "title": "Seen"},

I really, really wanted a bike and I prayed for one. And that\u2019s when I learned that sometimes God can say no.\u201d Hope and I waited.

But you got the bike, right? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI never got the bike.\u201d We scratched our heads as she walked off. The first time God was real to her was when he said\u2026 no? In Rhema\u2019s ten years of life I\u2019ve had many, many prayers for her. Some of those prayers were prayed for her even before I knew she would be mine. These days my biggest prayer is for a good day. Just a good day. One in which she can smile and hum, participate in life and enjoy the love of those who love her. Yes it\u2019s true, I often wish it were easier for me and Brandon and Hope.  Lord, you have assigned me my portion and my cup. Ps. 16:5 But more than anything I wish\u2026 I pray\u2026 it was better, easier for her. And honestly most days, it seems, the answer is no. But I think that sometimes when I love and pour myself out for my daughter and my only \u201creward\u201d is a painful headbutt, that God is telling the story of how He gave Himself for me and forgives and loves me over and over again. For the times my head says I should be \u201call better\u201d by now, but the heart still breaks,  God is close to the broken-hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit (Ps 34:18). For years of unchanging circumstances and unanswered questions, He is  doing  something and the whole story is yet to be told. For\u00a0 moments when there\u00a0is\u00a0no strength left, yet somehow strength comes\u2026  I love you O Lord my strength. Ps. 18:1 Maybe that\u2019s what Grandma meant. When you want a thing so bad, and the answer is no. And God is not all you think he is. No, He is real, more real than He\u2019s ever been, and sovereign and  good . Don\u2019t always feel or see it, can\u2019t explain it, but my gosh, you believe. Lord, I pray for a good day. And in the land of No, I will hold my girls and whisper that You hear their hearts\u2019 cry, that You never leave and You love them even more than I do.

{"date": "August 28, 2014", "body": "\u201cI am what you would call \u2018indoorsy.\u2019\u201d  ~Jim Gaffigan, on camping Well, I thought I\u2019d share some pics from our vacation earlier this summer. The husband ordered up a weeklong getaway for the family to a place called Camp of the Woods in the Adirondacks. Now. I am a luxury hotel, fine dining kind of girl. So you can understand why I might have a problem with a destination called Camp of the Woods. The husband assured me that we would not actually be camping, that we would be staying in a lakeside cabin equipped with beds, a refrigerator, stove, etc. We\u2019d eat in a dining hall for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He said, \u201cWe will not be roughing it.\u201d What he failed to realize is that my definition of the word \u2018camping\u2019 is totally different from his. If (-and this happened of course-) I pull back the bedcovers and find a chunky spider sitting under the pillow \u2026 and get this\u2026  I\u2019m not surprised  to see the chunky spider sitting there\u2026 then I am indeed CAMPING. Looking back on it now I can say that our accommodations really were nice but it felt like \u2018roughing it\u2019 to me and I might have had a tiny\u00a0bit of a bad\u00a0attitude and maybe acted like a big baby for the first day or so. Just maybe. Because my visions of vacation are me lounging on an island\u00a0beach, eating, sleeping, reading, repeat. This was me the first night. I wasn\u2019t keen on sharing the bed with Mr. Spider and his homies so I wrapped myself in Rhema\u2019s plastic mattress cover that we\u2019d brought from home! In the end we had such a great time going on little adventures together, enjoying the beauty of our surroundings, hearing great speakers and incredible music, I forgot to care about the fact that it didn\u2019t fit my grand dreams of vacation. We did things as a family we\u2019ve never done before. We rode a gondola to the top of a mountain. Played ping pong. Attended concerts. Took a boat ride. Hiked to a waterfall. Built sandcastles and had a carnival on the beach. The Camp of the Woods staff was wonderful, and I\u2019m probably not supposed to end a sentence with a preposition but I can\u2019t think of a better way to say it: we felt ministered to. All too often God takes my plans and expectations and shows me He has something better, something I need more. I was reminded of a favorite Emily Colson quote:  \u201cIt\u2019s time to throw out my ideas of what I thought life would be, should be, and let joy fill up those brand-new vacancies.\u201d Rhema certainly had times when she struggled, but I think she would say it was worth it. Throughout the trip I tried to jot down reasons to be thankful, things I never wanted to forget. The first one occurred when we were driving on an open road in the mountains. The air felt so good and the beauty of creation enveloped us. A song was on the radio \u2013  Multiplied  by Needtobreathe. Rhema began clapping. On her own. No one guided her hands or held them together. She clapped to these words: God of mercy sweet love of mine \n  I have surrendered to your design \n  May this offering stretch across the skies \n  And these Hallelujahs be multiplied\u2026 \n  These Hallelujahs be multiplied \n \u00a0        ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/bed.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGrmmQGaOCI", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc_0290.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_1088comp.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/rhema_russell.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/hope-horizon.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_1098.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc_0342.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc_0256.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_1078.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/famcrop.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_1065.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/adirondacks/", "title": "Adirondacks"},

My good friend Gail willingly came over and stayed with the girls \u2013 almost until midnight \u2013 while I picked Brandon up at the airport. This homecoming was different. He was not in uniform. He traveled alone. There were no  crowds or signs, no ceremony . No newspapers or  news cameras  this time. Just me and him. It was the best way. The first time he deployed to war over ten years ago it had been just the two of us at an airport\u2026 (well, actually my dog Ronald had been there and Rhema was in my belly, but we\u2019re just counting the bipedal adults\u2026). Now\u00a0things seemed to come full circle for us. He walked over to me and gave me a hug. He sighed heavily, \u201cWe made it another year. No more.\u201d It was a promise. And I simply said, \u201cOk.\u201d Two kids, three deployments and what seems to be a lifetime of ups and downs, pains and joys, we were back to just the two of us. Making peace with all the life lived apart and what it cost us. Looking ahead to a new chapter. The\u00a0quiet homecoming made me think of a favorite story: A missionary couple, after years of faithful service overseas, was returning back to the States. They returned to the New York harbor on the same steamship as Teddy Roosevelt. Upon their arrival in the harbor Roosevelt was greeted with great fanfare \u2013 a brass band, reporters and photographers, firecrackers were set off. And this aged missionary couple, health broken and spent in their service for Christ, walked off the gangplank and through the crowd, unmet and seemingly unknown. As they walked, a tear trickled down the husband\u2019s cheek. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d his wife asked. \n \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve given to serving God. We\u2019ve spent ourselves for Jesus and nobody is here to greet us. There\u2019s no bouquet of flowers for you.\u201d \n His dear wife thought for a minute and then said, \u201cHoney, we\u2019re not home yet.  We\u2019re not home yet . \u201d \u00a0 In the coming months Brandon will begin the process of retiring from the Army. It will be quite a change for us \u2013 I\u2019ve only always known him as a soldier \u2013 but it\u2019s a welcome change. I\u2019m thankful, so thankful for the chance to finish and begin again, for whatever God has for us next (we give our lives to Him), to live and love and work together until we\u2019re Home home. . *Thank you so much for the prayers and encouragement this past year!\u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/mailslot1.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxdFUz3whw4"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/home-home/", "title": "Home home"},
{"date": "July 8, 2014", "body": "\u201cI will stand at my watch\u2026I will look to see\u2026Yet I will wait patiently for the day\u2026\u201d  ~Habbakuk 2:1 We are down to days. Many years of being a military spouse has taught me that nothing is for sure in the Army\u2026 but I think this deployment is finally coming to an end. Honestly? I feel like I\u2019m crawling toward the finish. And when I get there, instead of doing a victory dance, I think I\u2019ll just fall asleep. Yeah right there at the finish line. Don\u2019t pick me up. Just bring me a pillow and some blankets! I hope I will let myself take a deep breath and put aside my concerns about schedules, work, changes and the whole re-integration process. I suspect my apprehension will fall away and joy will overtake as soon as I see him home, safe, laughing with Hope, holding Rhema\u2019s hand, making up for lost time. I turned back the pages of this old blog and found some things I\u2019ve shared about deployments and reunions of the past. At every turn God\u2019s faithfulness sings out to me. Brandon and I have been physically (and sometimes emotionally) separated for years at a time, and God so gracious, has stood over the process of us reorienting ourselves back to each other. Time and again He helps us find our way, as a family together, again. Because of this I believe with all my heart that God in a marriage can do anything. Mind if I share some snippets this week?? The following was  written in 2009 , at the beginning of a 14-month deployment. But the events actually occurred 10 years ago (!)\u2026 and still, we wait. And the waiting is precious. I\u2019m waiting for a call. A call to say that he has arrived safely in Kuwait. Even as he goes out, I am already thinking of his coming in. I think back to five years ago when a handful of spouses gathered in an old gymnasium in Katterbach, Germany in the dark of night. There were babies and small children, and wives who were suddenly decked out in their best clothes. We were waiting\u2026 like the ten bridemaids of the Biblical parable, we were waiting for the groom, with oil in our lamps. I\u2019ll never forget walking into that gym and seeing the signs that caused a lump to form in my throat. The first thing I did was to check the manifest. To see, for sure, if my beloved was on the list. He\u2019d said that after a long, hard year he was coming home. But in the Army, you just never know what might happen, so I stared hard at the list until I found his name. And when I did, I bounced an 11 month-old Rhema on my hip, and let my heart  rest  for the first time in a good while. The hours dragged on and we chatted, laughed, traded babies and tried to be patient.\u00a0 Around 2 in the morning, the announcement came that Bravo Company, 3rd of the 58th\u00a0\u2013 deployed in support of\u00a0Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2013 had landed on the kaserne. While in Iraq, they had set up an airfield for coalition aircraft in Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown of Tikrit, and now they had returned to their home away from home in\u00a0Katterbach. It\u00a0would still be hours before we could see them, as they had to take inventory and turn in their weapons. It seemed like forever. Then a screen descended, the lights went out and a music video played. The song finished, the screen was raised\u2026 and then we saw them. A small, weary company of air traffic controllers, led by my husband. Before\u00a0being released\u00a0to their families, they stood almost humbly, in formation.  You could hear the tears. I  know  they were praying, quietly thanking God along with us. Thanking God with all their hearts that not one of them,  not one , had been lost. So here am I again.  Waiting \u2026 for a homecoming. While I wait, I am aware that we are all waiting for something. May your waiting make you stronger. May you  know  His peace that passes understanding\u2026 while you\u2019re in the in between. May you  know  His love surrounds you, May He be your portion\u2026 in the waiting. This I pray. \u201cNow, Lord, not my will, but Thine be done. I know not what to do; I am brought to extremities, but I will  wait until Thou shalt cleave the floods, or drive back my foes. I will  wait, if Thou keep me many a day, for my heart is fixed upon Thee alone, O God, and my spirit waiteth for Thee in the full conviction that Thou wilt yet be my joy and my salvation, my refuge and my strong tower.\u201d  \u2014Charles Spurgeon ", "outgoing_links": ["http://wp.me/pfdt6-sb"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/if-thou-keep-me-many-a-day/", "title": "if Thou keep me many a\u00a0day"},
{"date": "March 4, 2009", "body": "Several weeks ago I got an e-mail from an old friend. He was telling me about his 9 year-old daughter Allison, who was troubled by a belief that her teacher didn\u2019t like her. She explained to him that her teacher (who gives stars for positive behavior) used to give her tons of stars. Allison was one of the leaders on the star board. But then all of a sudden the stars stopped coming for Allison, while other kids continued to get lots of stars. Some kids had gotten 15 or 20 stars since she last got a star. In her dry spell, she went from near the top to absolute bottom. When pressed, she confessed that okay, \u201cthere was this one ne\u2019erdowell kid who had fewer stars than her, but among the human kids, she was dead last.\u201d Allison\u2019s father suggested that they pray that she would find favor in her teacher\u2019s eyes. So they did. The next day he asked her, \u201cDid you get a star today?\u201d She said that she did (her first star in like 10 days). When he cheered, she protested, \u201cBut EVERYONE got a star today. It was a star for everyone because we were good.\u201d He said, \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. But we prayed to God for Him to help you to find favor in the teacher\u2019s eyes. If she truly didn\u2019t like you then she would have given everyone BUT YOU a star. Right?\u201d (She begrudgingly said, \u201cYes.\u201d) Her father continued, \u201cDon\u2019t cheapen God\u2019s blessing. He answered your prayer today.\u201d Allison went on to get stars every day for a week, and she pulled out of last place. She came home one day and exclaimed, \u201cDaddy, this is DEFINITELY God!\u201d What\u2019s so special about this little girl and endearing about this story is that this occurred during the week when Allison\u2019s mother received a diagnosis of breast cancer. And yet, Allison can still recognize the blessings in her life (like stars) and can proclaim with a knowing in her heart, \u201cThis is definitely God\u201d as He moves on her behalf. \u00a0 Why did I share that little story? Lately, I\u2019ve been troubled with something  JoyMama  illuminated recently.  Elvis sightings . It\u2019s a one-time utterance or action that comes surprisingly out of nowhere, and then disappears again. Or it\u2019s something new and exciting that Rhema will do for a time, such as say  hi  or  yeah , and then without warning she will seemingly lose the skill. I hesitate to tell friends about Rhema\u2019s progress sometimes because they do not understand the nature of these things. When I tell someone, she said Hi, they are so happy for us all assuming that the \u201clanguage explosion\u201d has finally come. (I realize that this is not just something that affects kids with classic autism. My friend has a son with high functioning autism, and she told me that on a recent vacation they were absolutely amazed because he acted so typical. For a couple days, she and her husband caught a glimpse of \u201ctypical\u201d in their son.) Although we have come to expect that these things will go away, these glimpses \u2013 the Elvis sightings- \u00a0leave us a little baffled, heartbroken and discouraged each time. Perhaps the hardest part is knowing that we  won\u2019t  know when the last time will be that we will hear the word or see the action (- some other form of communication such as signing or consistent eye contact). We live waiting for the other shoe to drop. Allison\u2019s story about the stars was well-timed for me. First, I think I need to learn the same lesson: don\u2019t cheapen God\u2019s blessing. Like streams in the desert, God has allowed me rare insight into my daughter through these Elvis sightings. I\u2019m learning to be thankful for them, as they are, pure and simple. Thankful that each \u201cElvis sighting\u201d is just a little dollop of encouragement to keep pressing on. Thankful that the gains and setbacks keep us humble, keep us from taking anything for granted. Thankful that we know how to cherish the little things. Again, I\u2019m thankful for this space. That I can write about the unexpected, out-of-the-blue, blow-your-mind gains. And that there are friends who will cheer each step forward (even if there are two steps back). Friends who help us celebrate each and every little victorious moment, even if it is just for a moment. I want to change my own demeanor and language starting right here, right now. Instead of telling you, \u201cI think Rhema\u2019s been saying \u201cMama\u201d today (she\u2019s home sick), but I know it\u2019s not going to last\u2026\u201d I\u2019m saying, \u201cRhema\u2019s been calling me Mama today\u2026 This is DEFINITELY God!\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/just-for-today-she-signed-word-more.html", "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/no-cheap-blessings/", "title": "No Cheap Blessings"},
{"date": "January 2, 2009", "body": "We took the kids to an open gym the other day. It\u2019s the same gym we visited a year ago in Michigan, and Rhema absolutely loved it. Trampolines and balance beams, a rock climbing wall, foam pits, a large bouncy house, and lots of\u00a0space to run and roll \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s a\u00a0sensory smorgasbord. Rhema is naturally gifted when it comes to things like gymnastics. She has amazing balance and physical coordination and is absolutely fearless.\u00a0The kid can pop a backflip faster than I can blink. I have desired to find a coach who would be willing to work with her and a gym where she could get some real training. Her nonverbal-ness, short attention span, and difficulty understanding language and following directions have made it hard to find a good fit. Needless to say, we were eager to take her to the gym for open play time. We were going with her aunt, uncle and cousins, and her grandparents would be watching from the balcony above. The gym was crowded with children, but unlike some people with autism, crowds have never really seemed to bother Rhema. However,\u00a0when we arrived at the gym, Rhema was completely out of sorts. She seemed terrified and clung to Brandon for dear life. It was so uncharacteristic of her. We tried to get her to relax and eventually we were able to get her to jump on a trampoline. But she was obsessed with her pants. Rhema does not believe in pants. Over the years she has come to understand that she must wear them in public. As soon as she gets home (or anyone else\u2019s home) , she removes her pants \u2013 often in the doorway. When she is particularly aware of the feeling of her pants against her legs, she pulls the pant legs up to her knees and walks around holding them up. She looks quite bow-legged as she tries to run and walk while holding her pant legs up. ( Carly Fleischmann , a nonverbal teen with autism describes a similar feeling of a million ants crawling on her). This was the scene as she tried to make her way around the gym. She was distracted and disoriented. At one point, Brandon led her to a ladder that was laying horizontally with one end raised off the ground onto a large cushiony mat. There was a line of kids behind her and I watched Rhema try to climb the ladder while holding her pants up. As she tried to climb, her pant legs would drop when she put her hands on the ladder. Then she would grab her pants and try to start over. She repeated this several times never getting very far. It may be humorous to me one day, but I felt only sadness as I watched her struggle. Soon she gave up on the ladder and began aimlessly wandering around the gym. She did something Brandon and I had never seen. She scrunched her feet and tried to walk around with her toes curled under. It was as if the mats on the gym floor were burning her soles. When she was not holding her pant legs, she flapped her hands incessantly or covered her ears. At the entrance to the bouncy house, she created a pattern of going up and down the stairs repeatedly while humming to herself, never entering the bouncy house. All the while, kids tried to wait patiently in line behind her. It was clear that she was overwhelmed, but, truly I was somewhat baffled. Almost every weekend we take her to an inflatable playground or open gym, and she is fearless. She usually thrives in this type of setting. I should have rescued her, but instead I made the biggest mistake of the day. I scooped her up and tossed her into a foam pit. Believe me when I say that normally this would be a sensory delight for Rhema with her body engulfed in proprioceptive input. I hoped this might be the very thing to put her at ease. But when she landed in the pit she was literally paralyzed with fear. I\u2019d never seen anything like it \u2013 her body was completely scrunched up and she  could not move . Sheer terror on her tight face. Instantly I jumped in and got her out. Both of us were shaking as I apologized to her over and over again. Fighting back hot tears. That was the end of our \u201cfun.\u201d As I held her, I looked around the gym. Kids were jumping, playing, squealing, talking, laughing, dancing, and having the time of their lives. I could see Hope on the other side of the gym, happily participating in a group dance. It looked so easy for her. My niece, Rhema\u2019s age, is a beautiful little gymnast, and she was decked out in her glittery velvet leotard and deftly swinging on the high bars\u2026 And I gave in to the longing. I gave in to the wishing. \u201c Lord, I want my baby to have a velvet leotard ,\u201d I said in a choked whisper. \u00a0 Since the moment I learned she was growing inside me, I have only wanted everything for her\u2026 the big things, the little things, the typical things. That longing is always there \u2013 just under the surface. By now I know that it will never go away. Sometimes the wishing leads me to become envious and judgmental of other mothers. I carry it around like a ball and chain. I love her with all that I am. What do I do with the wishing? Give it to me. \u00a0 It occurs to me that God has a knack for taking something little and making it great. (See  David ). Taking something weak and making it strong. (See  Esther ). Taking something old and making it new. (See me, my life, my heart). Taking something broken and ugly and fashioning it into a glorious work of art. (See any Christian believer saved by grace). Taking the stuff of pain and loss and creating a beautiful instrument of praise. (See  Job ). So here I am again, Lord. Releasing to you the pain of dreams deferred and shattered expectations. I\u2019m giving you my wishing. Do what you will. \u00a0 After a rough day at the gym, you may think me delusional. But knowing God and Rhema like I do, I still think those two are going to blow my mind\u2026 and there may even be a velvet leotard involved.

She sings in the middle of the night.  \u201cI call to remembrance my song in the night\u2026\u201d Ps. 77: 6. I know. I can hear the experts. It\u2019s a vocal  stim . To me, it\u2019s the gentle music of a sweet voice (well, o.k. not so much in the middle of the night).\u00a0 But there was a time when she was completely silent. Now I like to hear the song in her heart. I only wish I knew the words to her songs. My father is an old Georgia preacher. In the small church he grew up in, the old folks had a tradition called \u201clining a hymn.\u201d I believe the practice was carried over from slavery days and was intended to serve those who could not read. Sitting in the old country church of hard wooden pews and no air-conditioning, I can still hear the moving, harmonious sounds of worship in my ears (and the flapping of cardboard fans from the local funeral home). An elderly deacon would stand and sing, in a deep tenor, one or two lines at a time of a hymn or Negro spiritual.  Pass me not, O Gentle Savior\u2026 Hear my humble cry\u2026  The church members would collectively sing the melody back, line for line. Then the deacon would hum. Whatever he intoned, they intoned back. There was repetition and\u00a0call-and-response. No piano.\u00a0No drums.\u00a0 The raised voices and the stomping feet made the music. For long periods of time, there were no words. Only deep, heartfelt humming and moaning offered up to a sovereign God. A sacrifice of praise. With all the meaning in the world. Sometimes I think she is lining a hymn for me. (I need not know the words.) Reminding me, prompting me to sing. Because I had almost lost my song. But when I sing, my anthem comes back to me:  Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD is my strength and my  song ; he also is become my salvation.

{"date": "May 1, 2009", "body": "We had a beautiful, sunny afternoon free last week so I drove the girls over to the playground.\u00a0 The playground was a little crowded. This\u00a0was the first time we\u2019d been to one since last fall. I always get a little nervous when I\u2019m on my own because it is difficult keeping up with both girls. Brandon, in fact, does not like me to take them to parks by myself. What if Rhema runs away or darts into the street? What if you can\u2019t give Hope the attention she needs? Here we go , I thought. Rhema headed straight into the middle of the playground. I saw her look over to the swings, which were all occupied by older girls. Instantly,\u00a0she dropped to the ground and began crying in a high-pitched voice. I knelt beside her and spoke to her softly. Finally, she stood to her feet. She looked around quickly, frantically. She ran to the edge of the playground, wailing all the way. Then she began to run in circles around the playground.\u00a0 As she ran, she calmed herself, focusing on her hands bouncing in the air. The whole time we were there, that\u2019s what\u00a0she did. Run in circles around the playground. Kids jumped, climbed, squealed and played hide and seek. And Rhema ran in circles, never able to come in and enjoy the swings and slides. A few times I tried to interrupt her, re-direct her. I grabbed her hands, I tickled her, tried to coax her over to a climbing structure. But she brushed me off and stuck to the predictable \u2013 running laps around the playground. She\u2019s done this before. Once, before we knew her diagnosis, my sister, mother and I took her to a wading pool. \u201cShe\u2019ll LOVE it. She loves the water,\u201d my mother had said. But somehow it was too overwhelming and Rhema never put toe to water. Instead, she ran in circles. Oh, my girl. How much of her life is spent on the periphery. As I suspect for many children with special needs, she seems so close yet so far away. She wants to take part, she wants to play and have fun. I know it. But some days, it\u2019s just beyond her reach. It\u2019s just too much. It\u2019s just too hard. But she\u2019ll keep trying, she\u2019ll keep coming back. Before long she will come in from the edges, she\u2019ll play and jump and climb and swing and  soar .\u00a0 She\u2019ll get it.

{"date": "June 3, 2009", "body": "So here\u2019s my little story. ~Last year I read an  article  about a Special Olympics gymnastics team, and I contacted the coach. She informed me that the program was only for 8-year olds \u2013 (Rhema was 4 at the time). When I hung up with her, I never imagined that I would hear from her again.\u00a0 ~Just 6 just months ago I whispered, \u2018Lord, I want my baby to have a  velvet leotard .\u2019 Just a simple, silly wish. ~In March, (3 months after my wish),\u00a0Heather, the coach\u00a0called to say that she had found a way to accommodate Rhema. (I could not believe she even remembered us or even had my number!). ~Since March Rhema has been \u2018doing\u2019 gymnastics. We had no idea how Rhema would do, but I admit I was a little disappointed when I realized that she was no where near ready to participate on the same level as the other girls. Every Saturday at practice, she  runs  and climbs and jumps and  runs . The team has dedicated a sweet 17-year old girl to run after Rhema during practice. While other coaches do (in my opinion) the exciting work of getting the rest of the team ready to compete in a meet at Harvard next month, Kerrin faithfully spends the time chasing Rhema around the gymnasium. And Rhema loves it.\u00a0 Eventhough\u00a0she cannot fully participate, she is still a part of the team and treated as such. There was a meet a couple weeks ago and I decided not to go. For one thing, at formal meets, the athlete must  look  and acknowledge the judge by raising her hand before her routine. You sit in a circle and warm up together as a team. You travel from apparatus to apparatus as a team. You sit and wait and watch while your teammates complete their exercises.\u00a0 These are all things that would be very difficult to Rhema, and I\u00a0cannot explain the rules\u00a0to her, let alone get her to follow along. She would not understand why she could not just run around the gym as she does every Saturday. I had visions of her running into the middle of a girl\u2019s floor exercise routine during competition\u2026 so I kept her home. Lately I\u2019ve had to work a little harder to silence the whispers in my head:  Her deficits are too great \u2013 she\u2019ll never be able to do what the other children can do. This is too hard. What were you thinking? ~This past Saturday, Brandon took Rhema to practice instead of me. When they came home, he held up a hanger, \u201cThe team leotards came in. Here\u2019s Rhema\u2019s.\u201d It was still in a garment bag, and I saw that there was a matching silver hair scrunchie attached.  How adorable.  I wistfully slipped my hand under the plastic and fingered the material. It. was. velvet. No accidents , right? How about this? God\u00a0is\u00a0a God of details! Six\u00a0months ago, I  wrote  ,  \u2018After a rough day at the gym, you may think me delusional. But knowing God and Rhema like I do, I still think those two are going to blow my mind\u2026 and there may even be a velvet leotard involved.\u2019 I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t even  pay  for any of it. God did it all.  Specifically. \u00a0 This is the message that has been a year in the making for me.  Don\u2019t be afraid to dream big dreams. It may seem impossible, but it\u2019s just a setup\u2026 for\u00a0God to show you what\u00a0He can do. He can take our dreams for our children and give them wings. I dare you to trust God. With Him, nothing is impossible. \u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next\u2026 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://salemnews.com/pusports/local_story_189004555.html?keyword=topstory", "http://http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/listening-for-the-angels-alternatively-titled-no-accidents-part-one/"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/06/03/theres-a-velvet-leotard-hanging-in-my-laundry-room/", "title": "There\u2019s a velvet leotard hanging in my laundry\u00a0room"},
{"date": "July 1, 2009", "body": "We met with the neuro this week to devise a new game plan for Rhema\u2019s seizures. We knew every possible option would be discussed: Diazepam/Valium. Steroids. A brain surgery called  multiple subpial transection (MST) . In my mind, none of the options were good. And I cannot begin to explain the emotional turmoil I felt over even entertaining the MST surgery as a possibility. The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. Psalm 28:7 \u00a0 It\u00a0realized how often she is having  absence seizures . Because she has autism, people may assume that she\u2019s just in her own world. Absence seizures in a \u201ctypical\u201d child are much more obvious. In Rhema\u2019s case, I wonder how many times we\u2019ve chalked it up to \u2018the autism\u2019 when really it was \u2018the epilepsy.\u2019 \u2026 my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. \u00a0 But we came out of the meeting feeling good. We are stopping the current med (because it\u2019s  so  not working).\u00a0She is now on a relatively high dose of diazepam. She will go into the hospital in a few weeks for long term monitoring. If the diazepam works, she will remain on it for the next 6 months to a year. If the seizures return, then we will re-visit the MST surgery as an option. We have been blessed with the best doctors, the best therapists, the best teachers\u2026 \u2026my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. \u00a0 She\u2019s been on the new med for 3 days. The diazepam makes her loopy. Her eyes are unfocused, half-opened. She\u2019s unsteady on her feet. She looks so \u2026 drugged. It\u2019s hard to watch. \u2026my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. \u00a0 A precious friend of mine often takes care of Rhema during church, just so that Brandon and I can attend the service. Last Sunday she held Rhema in her lap and prayed with all her heart for healing, for peace, for joy, that Rhema would know her God. Tears. Is there any greater gift? In fact, people pray for us whom we\u2019ve never even met.\u00a0 \u2026my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. \u00a0 When prompted, Rhema says  hi and bye  quite regularly now. Hope cheers. And it floors me every time. Because even in my dreams, try as I might, I could not imagine her looking someone in the eye and saying \u201chi.\u201d And then there\u2019s Romans 10:8,9. Her  name verse . I believe she has the entire thing in her head. When I recite it to her, she nows says \u201cheart\u201d and \u201csaved.\u201d Good words, yes? What a miracle. Her EEG reports detail how continuous spikes, sharp waves, and focal slowing  dominate  the areas of her brain\u00a0that\u00a0control speech and comprehension. I have pictures of her brain on my desk explaining to me in complicated medical jargon why she cannot understand language. Based on the reports, it does not seem possible that she could produce speech. \u00a0 And yet, she speaks. \u00a0 Just a word here. Just a word there. \u00a0 But. she. speaks. \u00a0 Awesome God \u2026my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.

{"date": "October 15, 2008", "body": "Cute backpack, eh? Yesterday Rhema got her own princess cap. We\u2019re at home for the next 24 hours doing an ambulatory EEG.\u00a0Initially, we were happy at the thought of not staying in the hospital, but we were concerned about keeping all the electrodes glued to her scalp and the monitoring equipment out of the toilet (literally). We\u2019ve had to be pretty inventive in the last few hours, but so far, Rhema is doing great! The diazepam protocol Rhema\u2019s been on for the last six weeks has brought about some interesting results.\u00a0There\u2019s\u00a0no doubt that\u00a0it has\u00a0helped to calm the electrical storm in her brain, and there have been several amazing moments for us: \n1)  In the hospital , a high dose of diazepam essentially cleaned up her EEG. Spike activity was knocked down to 2%! 2)  Hi! 3) Soon after she began the protocol, I believe Rhema spoke her first sentence. She wanted a popsicle and dragged me over to the freezer. She said in a sing-songy voice, \u201cIwant\u2026 \u2026. \u2026. \u2026 pop.\u201d 4) She began greeting me. If I\u2019ve been away for a couple hours, she runs to me with a smile, claps my hands together as I stoop in front of her and says \u201cYaaayyyyy.\u201d Oh. my. heart. 5) This past weekend some people stopped by our house (2 adults and a 6 year-old girl). Rhema walked right up to them, and when they said hello, she repeated \u201chello\u201d right back to them. Then,  with interest  in her eyes, she walked over to the little girl\u00a0and gently patted her on the chest. Brandon and I had to pick our jaws off the floor. We\u2019re still trying to figure out what caused that little exchange. We have  never  seen Rhema do that before. Ever. Most of these events\u00a0have been \u201c Elvis Sightings \u201d moments; they came out of the blue, and then they disappeared just as quickly, not to be repeated.\u00a0 And besides them, Rhema has just been Rhema. In fact, the diazepam has actually caused some not-so pleasant side effects. It usually makes her hyperactive and agitated. She\u2019s been unable to focus at school and we\u2019ve seen an increase in noncompliance and tantrumming. She\u2019s had trouble sleeping at night (but  Kathryn  prayed Ps. 4:8 and it\u2019s been getting better!). And she has limited her already limited diet to about 3 food items. Sigh. Honestly, a small part of me was hoping for some earth-shattering miracle. I could see us on the cover of Children\u2019s Hospital magazine with the headline  \u201cMedical Breakthrough\u201d  and  Dr. BEAM  beaming at our side. It didn\u2019t happen. But that\u2019s o.k. I am just thankful. So thankful that God is God of both big\u00a0 and \u00a0small miracles. Only peace here in this heart of mine\u2026 and that, my friends,\u00a0is one of the big miracles! Thou wilt keep  him  in perfect peace,  whose  mind  is  stayed  on thee : because he trusteth in thee.\u00a0Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD  is  everlasting strength.\u201d Isaiah 26:3-4 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/amb_eeg1.jpg", "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/", "http://purewells.blogspot.com/2008/09/in-god-we-trust.html"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/ambulatory-eeg/", "title": "Ambulatory EEG"},
{"date": "September 8, 2008", "body": "I have mentioned my friend  Carrie  on this blog a number of times.  I feel like she is a gift from God just for me!  Even though we live many miles apart, she faithfully holds my hand on this autism journey and blesses me with her wisdom.  Carrie has a six year-old daughter on the spectrum, and she recently wrote to me about her first week back at school.  I know so many mamas went through first-day-of-school jitters last week, and so many are yearning for our kids to  let us in , I wanted to share some of Carrie\u2019s letter: Since your \u201c Questions \u201d post I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to ask questions of Grayson, even though I don\u2019t expect an answer.  Sometimes, like yesterday on the first day of school, I\u2019m more HOPEFUL that she\u2019ll give me one \u2013 I choose my words carefully, make sure I\u2019ve got her attention, and then launch it very deliberately and wait expectantly for an answer\u2026 and the answer is always\u2026 \u201cMAKE SOME CUPCAKES!\u201d    I\u2019ve been told on many occasions that I ask a lot of questions. I guess when it comes to people I care about or something I am interested in, I like to \u201cknow it all\u201d.  I get a little crazy the first week or two of school each year.  Surely most parents do\u2026 we are sending our greatest treasures off \u2018into the world\u2019 on their own, entrusting their care to OTHERs, praying that they will be treated well, taught well, and that they\u2019ll come home to us safe and happy.   But there is a difference.   Most parents (whether their kids like it or not), have the ability to grill their kids when they get home from school\u2026 and get results.  \u201cWhat did you do at school today?\u201d \u201cWhat did you have for snack time?\u201d \u201cWho are your friends?\u201d \u201cWhat was the best part of your day?\u201d For a question asker like me, the fact that I can ask all I want but with zero feedback makes me nuts.  I\u2019VE GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS!!  This leaves me at the mercy of everyone else who is around her during the day.  PLEASE!!  Teachers, bus drivers, occupational therapists, speech therapists, adapted PE teachers \u2013 DETAILS! INFORMATION! THIS WAY!   So I think that God must have a lesson for me in this. There is a great measure of comfort in knowing that she is not \u201con her own\u201d out there, but that she is HIS child, He is with her and loves her even more than I do.  And He is fully capable of taking care of her.   So maybe I don\u2019t have to follow the little bus to school in the morning, maybe I don\u2019t need to grill everyone who she encounters in her day, and maybe (strrrreetch) I don\u2019t need for her to answer my questions\u2026 at the end of the day, I really don\u2019t need to know it all.  The truth is that it feels strange to even write that.  My fingers are moving, but my brain is still saying \u201cYES, YOU DO!\u201d  So I\u2019ll walk the walk and remember that sometimes\u2026 actions precede feelings.   I didn\u2019t follow the little bus today.  I haven\u2019t emailed her teacher yet this afternoon.  But I know I\u2019ll be reading her Daily Note a dozen times at least, somehow certain that with each reading a golden nugget of information will pop out at me lending some insight to her day and the hours of her life spent away from me.   And I\u2019ll keep asking her questions, not because I expect an answer (though I\u2019ll keep hoping for one), but because I believe that she hears me and understands that I ask because I\u2019m interested and because I love her. Along these lines, one of my all-time favorite posts comes from Adventures in Autism called  Letting Go Of Chandler .  Whether you\u2019re a special needs parent or not, I believe it\u2019s a must-read.

{"date": "September 11, 2008", "body": "It was early, early on a Saturday morning, and the husband and I were clinging to the last few hours of sleep. In my mind, I recall hearing her manage to somehow get past the child-safety lock on the inside doorknob of her room. I heard her toe-walking\u00a0feet prance on the wooden floor and down the stairs. And then I told myself it was a dream and drifted off to sleep\u2026 Some time later Brandon and I were jolted awake by the ear-piercing sounds of our home alarm system going off. We looked at each other dazed and confused. Brandon jumped out of bed, threw on some pants and headed downstairs. As he descended the stairs, he could see out the windows that police cruisers had silently surrounded the house\u2026 Our child, oblivious, was happily entertaining herself with some toys in the living room\u2026 Turns out our little culprit had escaped her room, come downstairs, and set off the house alarm by climbing on the edge of the couch to reach an alarm pad by a window. She hit the touch pad so many times or in such a pattern, that she triggered the \u201cimminent hostage threat.\u201d Then, to pass the time, she had stripped naked, peed on the rug, and emptied the contents of the refrigerator onto the kitchen floor. All this while her parents blissfully slumbered\u2026 We still laugh at the image of cop cars whizzing around the house with lights flashing and sirens off (so as to sneak up on the kidnappers, I suppose). Thankfully, Brandon had quickly figured out what happened and explained it to the police.

{"date": "September 15, 2008", "body": "I remember that as children, my sisters and I were both intrigued by and afraid of our older cousin.  He was our Boo Radley, and we would create an imaginary character named Crazy and then imitate our cousin\u2019s oddities and strange noises.  I did not know then that what he had was autism. I remember overhearing my mother, a special education teacher, once speak of one of her students who had autism.  I remember thinking, what\u2019s so bad about being artistic? Several weeks ago, my parents came over to pray with us.  I was busy describing some of our struggles with Rhema, when my father asked, \u201cDo you ever draw on your experiences in Ethiopia to help you handle this?\u201d In a huff, I quickly replied, \u201cNo.\u201d   As if to say,  nothing  could have prepared me for autism. When I was a college student, I spent several months working for Mother Teresa\u2019s Missionaries of Charity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  I worked at an orphanage called \u201cshishobavin\u201d which means  for the children .  One part of the orphanage housed children who were perfectly healthy, albeit underfed.  The other part housed children who suffered from a range of diseases and severe disabilities.   There was an adorable, laughing three year-old girl who was paralyzed from the chest down.  She had the happiest, biggest brown eyes, and nobody laughed as much as she did.  We did not have a wheelchair for her so she would lie on her stomach and drag herself around on the ground.  People would often accidentally step on her, and she would respond with giggles.  To this day, I can see her beautiful smile and laughing eyes.  There was one room where all of the children who were bedridden lived.  Some of them had oversized heads and shriveled bodies.  Others had disturbing deformities.  They were all bald.  Be they boy or girl, their heads were shaved because of the lice problem.   In the beginning, I thought I was doing something big by just going in and sitting with them at their beds.  I called myself \u201cgetting used to them.\u201d  Little did I know how much these children would invade my heart and forever change me.   After a couple weeks of sitting and watching, I finally got into the real work of caring for one little girl named Haylin.  Daily I fed her, changed her, bathed her stiff body, cleaned her bedsores, sang to her, loved her.  In no time, I was assisting the other two workers in caring for all of the bedridden children.  It was exhausting work, but I found that it was all I ever wanted to do. Looking back, there were several children in the orphanage that I am now fairly certain were on the autism spectrum, although I did not realize it then. Excerpts from my book  Sunburned Faces : \n There\u2019s this little boy who cannot speak, and he insists on eating his shirt!  He\u2019s always chewing on the bottom of his shirt.  When he gets happy, he jumps up and down and spits in the air.  He reminds me of a fountain because the spit flies everywhere. Another boy at the orphanage stands with his feet pointed out in opposite directions. When he stands, he looks like a wishbone. Now this kid is completely in a world of his own. He will stand in his wishbone position and start wringing his hands and making funny noises and hand gestures.  It looks like interpretive dance to me. There\u2019s a young, chubby boy who cannot talk.  I don\u2019t know everything that is wrong with him, but I guess he\u2019s a destruction unit all on his own because someone is always tying him up!  He sits outside all day long tied to a pole with a piece of cloth. When he is put in bed, they tie the back of his shirt to the bedpost! His name is Valio, which means \u201cblack\u201d, and that he is!  He looks like Buddha to me.  He likes to pick up whatever is within reach, which is usually a bug. He\u2019ll hold it in the air with two fingers, and then make noises that sound like a jet landing as he lets the bug drop to the ground. He usually does this all day long.  Although he never looks at me, I like to tickle him because all of a sudden a big, white toothy grin pops up on his round black face. So since my father asked me the question about my Ethiopia experience, the thing I have come up with is this: Perhaps I may have once wanted to sit on the sidelines and sort of observe from afar, but maybe it was always God\u2019s intention that I get my hands dirty. Maybe He was preparing me. Maybe He was using my children in  shishobavin  to teach me how to love without condition. (I call them mine because they are always a part of me). Do you ever wonder if you were somehow pre-determined or pre-pared to be a special needs parent?  Were there little signs along the way?  I do believe that nothing that happens takes God by surprise, (although sometimes I am still shocked).  I believe He has a perfect plan.   \u201cAs for God, his way is perfect.\u201d  Psalms 18:30. I dare not say I know God\u2019s mind. His ways and thoughts are so much higher than my own.  I don\u2019t think he \u201cpicked\u201d us to be Rhema\u2019s (or Hope\u2019s) parents because we were super cool individuals full of grace and patience and faith (that\u2019s a  really  laughable notion).  On the contrary, He wanted to  teach  us those things through our children.  Surely motherhood like no other thing in life, has driven me to my knees in prayer uttering, \u201cHELP!\u201d  What a great gift God has entrusted to us in caring for these miraculous little lives.   May we live up to the challenge.  May He help us live up to the challenge.

{"date": "September 18, 2008", "body": "For the first 9 months of  Hope\u2019s  life, she suffered with severe eczema on her face, scalp, ears, and limbs. It was so bad that it often became infected and inflamed and would ooze pus.  Gross.  She also always seemed congested and had trouble breathing at night. We tried months of antibiotics and skin creams (including the steroid creams). We used special shampoos and special laundry detergent. Nothing worked, and she only got worse. It got to the point where the only soft spot on her face was the tip of her nose. That was the only spot on my sweet baby\u2019s face that I could kiss. Hope did not sleep very well at night because of her congestion and her insanely itchy face. \u201cEczema\u201d is a Greek word that means \u201cto boil over\u201d, and that\u2019s an accurate description.\u00a0\u00a0Hope would scratch her blistered skin, and it would instantly bleed. Several times during the night I would have to switch the sheets because of all the pus that oozed from her infected face. I took her to three different doctors and, believe it or not, not a single one ever mentioned allergies. They just prescribed more antibiotics and skin creams and told me that maybe she would grow out of it in a couple years. Finally, one day in desperation I took her to the local emergency room because she had a deep infection on the side of her face. The ER doctor referred us to a dermatologist at Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston.  Ah! , I thought.  A place we know well . I was grateful and relieved. We went to Children\u2019s, armed with all of the research I had done online. I was convinced that Hope\u2019s problems were allergy related. I had eliminated milk and eggs from my diet (I was nursing), but Hope was no better. Thankfully, the new doctor was willing to do allergy testing on her. He also prescribed another round of antibiotics (which I detested giving her), and yet another 3 skin creams to be applied many times a day. When the results of Hope\u2019s tests came back, I cried. She was severely allergic to nuts, egg, wheat, dairy, soy, and citrus foods. I felt like I had been poisoning her with my breastmilk. I was relieved to have an answer, but also worried and overwhelmed.  What in the world am I going to feed this child?  I instantly began weaning her, and we started on an expensive hypoallergenic formula. There\u2019s been debate surrounding the link between food allergies and autism. In my own family, there is no such debate. Hope\u2019s allergies gave me the impetus to view some of her sister\u2019s challenges as allergy-related\u2026 from the shiners under Rhema\u2019s eyes to her chronic diarrhea. But how I dreaded putting Rhema on a gluten-free, casein-free diet! At the time, the child LIVED on Taco Bell chicken quesadillas and pretzels. And fellow autism moms know when I say that\u2019s all she ate, that\u2019s all she ate. However, within a week of putting Rhema on the diet, she began sleeping better at night and her diarrhea CEASED. Brandon and I were shocked out of our minds. After 2 years of chronic diarrhea and gastroenterology appointments, Rhema\u2019s diarrhea stopped within days of removing gluten and casein. She also went from having colds and ear infections almost every month to going a whole year without either. And even though she is still on the restricted diet, she eats better today than she ever did before. Certainly not every child with autism is affected by food allergies and gut issues. And the GFCF diet is not beneficial to all. But in our family it made all the difference in the world. (For more on allergies and autism, click  here  and  here .) Back to Hope. It took months for her skin to heal. But as soon as I started weaning, we could see improvements. The pictures in this post are actually after Hope started healing. She was far worse than these pictures show, but at the time I could not bear photographing her. Now, she is almost two years old and is still very allergic to most foods. In fact,\u00a0more foods have been added to her list of allergies, but I am confident that she will outgrow some of these (and some she will probably never outgrow like the nuts). We\u2019ve had a number of scares, and sometimes just walking into a public place or a friend\u2019s home will trigger a visible allergic response in Hope. We never leave home without an EpiPen. When I think back to that time when Hope was so sick from allergies, I know that God carried me. I was running on fumes \u2013 no sleep \u2013 consumed with both Rhema and Hope\u2019s medical problems. During that time, I could not imagine Hope\u2019s skin ever healing. I had assumed that she would have permanent scars from the deep infections. (And the doctor warned that we might see scarring from all of his prescribed steroid applications).\u00a0 When I look at her now, it is a reminder to me that God can (and  does ) heal and can make anything new again.

{"date": "June 3, 2008", "body": "A few months ago, another ordinary miracle occurred when Rhema began communicating by using pictures. Words cannot convey what a momentous event this was in our lives. She wanted rice. She casually went to her  PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)  book and brought her rice icon to me. \n \u201cYou want rice? O.K.!\u201d I made her rice as fast as I could, sat her in her chair, and she ate it all. Her face was one of peace and contentment. I was amazed, truly amazed. This was one of the first times Rhema had ever communicated a desire in a way that did not involve her dragging me to the kitchen and thrusting my hand toward the refrigerator. There was no tantrum, no frustration, no guessing game between she and I. Once before I had tried to implement PECS at home. One day I had taken snapshots of Rhema\u2019s favorite foods and snacks and then checked out a book from the library on PECS. I ran to Staples and excitedly purchased 2 sheets of posterboard, Velcro strips, and laminating materials. I am not an arts-n-crafts-or-scrapbooking kind of girl. So this was\u00a0a major project\u00a0for me! While Rhema was at school, I laminated my pictures, put the Velcro on and proudly taped two large posterboards on a kitchen wall. I eagerly waited for Rhema to come home, just sure she would be just as excited as I to see that her Mommy had provided a way for her to communicate. When Rhema came home, I showed her the Wall of Food Pictures, and she promptly pulled the posterboard off the wall. Undaunted, I taped it back up only to have it ripped down seconds later by her little sister. And so it went, every time I turned my back Rhema and Hope made a game of ripping the posterboard down. By the end of the day, my magnum opus was dirty, crumpled and torn. Thankfully Rhema was learning how to use PECS at school. I am grateful to her teachers for their unrelenting patience in working with Rhema. A little over a year ago it was difficult to even get her to look at (or attend to) a picture or symbol, and if you handed her a picture she would just throw it down. At times we were not sure that Rhema even understood what she was looking at. Shortly after that first time Rhema requested rice at home, she surprised me again. She wanted a pancake, but we did not have a pancake icon in her PECS book. So she went and found a picture of a flat cookie and handed it to me. That was enough to clue me in to the fact that she wanted a pancake (Rhema doesn\u2019t eat cookies). Another time, she \u201ctold\u201d me that she wanted a taco by giving me a picture of a tortilla wrap. I was thrilled and amazed.  My little girl is clever.  Yet again, I had underestimated her. After years of silence and what seemed like indifference, I was learning that Rhema was longing to communicate with us. I even\u00a0discovered that she knows what she wants \u2013 when she wants a taco, she really wants a taco! How many times has she wanted a taco, and I did not know? Before she would tantrum and I would have no idea why. How frustrating it must be not to be able to express your thoughts and wants\u2013 it brings tears to me eyes thinking about it. We still have a long way to go with PECS, but Rhema is learning. We still pray, pray, pray for spoken words, but Rhema is learning. And I am so very thankful to God.

Nor has  she yet learned to quote that old proverb \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try again.\u201d She does not know the Biblical parable of the importunate widow who continually petitioned an unjust judge until she wearied him into granting her request. However, she, in all her 19 months of wisdom, has been employing these principles for one important ambition, that is, what the playright Daniel Kamenetz referred to as \u201cthe salutation of slapping palms.\u201d Rhema never stops moving. But Hope, with her chubby, toddler legs chases Rhema day after day, week after week, month after month. With her arm raised in the air, Hope calls out imploringly, \u201cHigh five? High five?\u201d According to Wikipedia, \u201cIf one initiates a high five by raising a hand into the air and no one consummates the celebration by slapping the raised hand, the initiator is said to be \u201cleft hanging.\u201d\u201d (For more on High Five Ettiquette, click  here ). Until today, Hope had always been \u201cleft hanging.\u201d Rhema has been a tad bit peeved with Hope, since hhhmmm, the day Hope was born. It was understandable in the beginning: all siblings go through adjustment periods when the new baby arrives. For Rhema, I had always been her means for communicating and getting what she needed or wanted. She was queen of the \u201cautistic leading\u201d technique. Without words, she would simply grab my hand, drag me to the desired object and thrust my hand at it. I believe my preoccupation with Hope as a baby caused Rhema to view her as an intruder and an interference, and she has tenaciously held onto that view. Rhema\u2019s game plan has been to basically ignore Hope\u2019s existence until Hope has a popsicle. Then Rhema turns into Swiper and steals the popsicle. Oh man. The response to the plaintive request for a high five has been no response\u2026 or a fast run in another direction. In the past I have felt bad for Hope \u2013 getting dissed and all \u2013 so I have offered her a high five. But she shakes her head\u2026 she doesn\u2019t want it from me, she wants it only from Rhema. I have attempted to tackle Rhema and force her hand to slap Hope\u2019s, but it always reeks of phoniness. Nevertheless, Hope possesses that defiant boldness and strong devotion that embodies  hope . She insists on sharing  something  with Rhema \u2013 not her popsicle, not her toys \u2013 no way! \u2013 but a  connection , a greeting, an acknowledgement. Her determination reminds me of the Dreamgirls hit \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d sang by Jennifer Hudson. And I am telling you \nI\u2019m not going, \nEven though the rough times are showing. \nThere\u2019s just no way, there\u2019s no way! \nWe\u2019re part of the same place, \nWe\u2019re part of the same time. \nWe both share the same blood. \nWe both have the same mind. \n\u2026. \nI\u2019m staying, I\u2019m staying, \nAnd you, and you, and you, you\u2019re gonna love me. \nOoh, you\u2019re gonna love me. \nYou\u2019re gonna love me!

Hope stepped back and raised her hand in the air. \u201cHigh five?\u201d Rhema awkwardly, all the while grinning and avoiding eye contact, slapped the palm of her sister. What word suffices here? Momentous? Stupendous? I cheered like the Red Sox had won another World Series. Hope, of course, couldn\u2019t get enough and requested high-fives all afternoon. And Rhema obliged her every time.

The way my child sees, hears, tastes, smells and touches the world around her is so unique. It is a gift, in many ways, because when she intently gazes at a blade of grass, I believe she sees patterns and details that I will never notice. But her senses are also troubling to her \u2013 sometimes too strong, sometimes too weak, rarely in between. And for so many reasons, this makes it difficult for her to relate to the people around her. When her back is turned and she is a million miles away, I yearn to reach her. My arms are literally outstretched.  Sweet child, I want to see you. I want to hear you. I want to touch you. I want to know you. I am determined to see God in new ways as we walk down Autism Road. Those of us affected by autism know how cherished and precious those \u201cconnections\u201d are with our children \u2013 that moment when we are truly experiencing something of them and they are experiencing something of us. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as a shared laugh, a mutual understanding, a social game, an exchange of high-fives, but it means the world to us. Perhaps, then, we have the perfect basis for understanding God\u2019s very desire to relate to us, His children. See  My \u201cRunaway\u201d Bunny . God created us to have a relationship with Him. From the first page of the Bible to the last is documentation of the lengths God went to to have a close relationship with each one of us. Whether you realize it or not, God continually pursues us to know Him and communicate with Him. I thought it would be interesting to examine each of the five senses (who knew those kindergarten lessons would be so handy) in the context of autism and, more importantly, in the context of God\u2019s ultimate goal of having relationship with us.

{"date": "May 13, 2008", "body": "\u201cThere is life in a look at Him\u2026\u201d \u2013 Charles Spurgeon Eye contact is looking another person in the eye, and without good eye contact, full communication cannot take place. It has been suggested that of all the ways we communicate with people, eye contact is the most important. So many aspects of communication rely on eye contact: attention, intent, conversational turn-taking, etc. When engaging in conversation with someone, you not only hear what they say, you  see  what they say. If my husband walks away to do something while I\u2019m trying to tell him something, I feel like he is not listening to me. And you just have to think back to your dating days to know that there are those conversations where no words are spoken \u2013 everything is communicated with the eyes. Poor eye contact is one of the most common symptoms of autism. I\u2019m not sure when Rhema began losing her eye contact \u2013 somewhere between 12 \u2013 15 months \u2013 but we sure knew when it was gone. She has these huge beautiful brown eyes \u2013 in fact, when she was an infant she looked kind of freakish to me because her eyes were so big. Now, when she gives good eye contact, it is like a gift, I just want to gaze into those gorgeous eyes. Some people with autism have explained that they avoid eye contact because they cannot always understand facial expressions, which can be distracting and unpredictable, preventing them from focusing on what is being said ( link ). But eye contact is vital, and especially in young children, the more they see, the more they will learn. Every time Rhema gives us eye contact, a connection occurs. If you care about a relationship with God, perhaps you should consider how good your eye contact is. I have asked myself the question: How much time have I spent lifting my eyes to the Lord? Sometimes when we are trying to establish eye contact with Rhema, she will avert her eyes and gaze away. I have watched her therapist create \u201cblinders\u201d by putting her hands at the edges of Rhema\u2019s eyes, so that Rhema cannot look anywhere else but into her therapist\u2019s eyes. This always makes me think of how Jesus must often want to put blinders on me. Too often I focus on the circumstances around me instead of looking to Him, or I will regard God with that \u201cperipheral vision\u201d (so common in autism) instead of looking at Him straight on. How do we get good eye contact with the Lord of Lords? I think, first, perhaps we humble ourselves and say, \u201cLord, I want to see you. Open up my eyes. Show me your face.\u201d We read our Bibles. We pray. And we look for Him. He will show Himself.  For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. 2 Chronicles 16:9 It\u2019s intimate, no question. The eyes are the doorway to the soul, isn\u2019t that what they say? (Matt. 6:22 says that the eye is the lamp of the body). But if we truly want to know and hear the Lord better, we must look at Him. People with autism are more comfortable looking into the eyes of those with whom they are familiar \u2013 the ones they love and trust. So it can be with God. I believe there is so much He wants us to see. Turn your eyes upon Jesus \nLook full in His wonderful face \nAnd the things of earth will grow strangely dim \nIn the light of His glory and grace.

{"date": "May 16, 2008", "body": "Yesterday Rhema had her scheduled MRI at Children\u2019s.  The purpose of the MRI is to identify starting points for her seizures and see if there is any structural damage in the brain.  Since Rhema has not really been responding to medication, we are hoping that the MRI might provide us with some information.  We will not have the results for another week or so. I had to take Rhema by myself, and Brandon stayed home with Hope.  As hospital visits go, there was a lot of waiting.  Waiting makes both of us antsy.  In the MRI waiting area, Rhema was not the least bit interested in Mickey Mouse on the TV or the crayons and coloring book I had brought.  She preferred to run around the room, jump up and down on the chairs, and then pound on the receptionist\u2019s computer keyboard.  At one point, she found a pad of sticky notes on the desk and began ripping off sticky notes one at a time and throwing them in the air with a \u201cWhee!\u201d   While I was filling out paperwork, Rhema was jumping on a chair and a man came out and sternly told her to be careful and to stop jumping.  He was completely ignored.  I almost laughed, but simply said, \u201cThank you.\u201d  I mean, how do you even begin to explain? Rhema noticed a woman in the room who had just started unwrapping her expensive Au Bon Pain sandwich.  At this point Rhema realized that she was FAMISHED \u2013 (I hadn\u2019t fed her because she had to have an empty stomach for the anesthesia).   The scene unfolded in slow mo: I lunged for Rhema as she dove for the \u201cChicken Ceasar Asiago on Ciabatta\u201d sitting nicely in tin foil on the woman\u2019s lap. Too late. She didn\u2019t eat it, but she managed to get her hands on it and \u201cdisassemble\u201d it a bit.   \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said, as I tried to rearrange the sandwich with the tin foil wrapper.  Then I placed the sandwich back in the woman\u2019s lap before she could say a word, grabbed Rhema and we went for a walk.  It occurred to me later that I should have at least offered to buy the lady another sandwich, but these things always occur to me after the fact.  When we returned to the waiting room, the woman was gone, thankfully.  Instead, there were hospital volunteers dressed up as clowns who were able to get Rhema to color a little bit. Rhema did well with getting her IV.  This is pretty awesome for a child who can be very tactile sensitive \u2013 she cannot stand stickers, band-aids, or having an admission bracelet on her arm.  She\u2019s kind of used to the IVs and needle pricks by now.  But the problem is always keeping her from pulling the IV out.  The nurses wanted to give her IV fluids before giving her the sedation drug.  So we waited and waited while the fluids dripped in.  Rhema cried and fussed and fought to get all the tape and gauze off her arm.  We tried distracting her with bubbles and singing and stickers (forget it).  Rhema kept jumping off the bed, taking my hand and leading me to the door.  She wanted to leave, IV pole and all. Finally the sedative was added to the IV, and I held her in my arms.  Most kids fall asleep quickly.  Rhema, of course, fought it.  The nurse even mentioned that we might have to give her another \u201cbolus\u201d, which is another strong dose of the drug.  But in one quick instant Rhema was suddenly silent with her pretty head drooped over my shoulder.  The nurse smiled and whispered, \u201cI think we won.\u201d The nurses were so kind and wonderful.  I love good nurses.  For a moment, my heart feared as I looked at my little girl asleep \u2013 so uncharacteristically still with her mouth half open, cardiac monitor on her chest, oxygen in her nose, pulse monitor of her toes, blood pressure cuff on her leg, head tapped.  She looked like an angel.  Just before she was slid into the MRI chamber, Rhema started sighing softly, and one of the nurses said it sounded like she was singing.

I didn\u2019t know that Rhema\u2019s room is as sparsely furnished as Grayson\u2019s once was.  Reading your blog brought back a flood of memories: Week 1:   Found Grayson hanging from her curtains, just as the rod pulled out of the wall and landed on her head.  Damage: Two black eyes and a giant goose egg in between.  No more curtains. Week 2:   Heard a loud thud during \u201crest time\u201d.  Thud followed by crying.  Crying precipitated by rolling off top shelf of floor-to-ceiling bookshelf.  No more shelves on the bookshelf.  Bookshelf anchored to wall.  Frame looks nice\u2026 and it has a couple drawers for storing toys. Week 3:   Grayson is eating the drawers.  She likes to pull them out, dump out all of the toys, and chew on the edge of the wood.  No more drawers. Week 4:   Grayson is eating her books.  Spines are chewed until the pages fall out.  Then, pages are chewed into tiny little spit wads and stuck to the walls and windows.  No more books. Week 5:   Grayson is eating the toes, fingers, ears, and tails off of all her Little People figurines.  The toy stash is dwindling. Week 6:   AAARGH!!  She has discovered her dresser.  All of her clothes are thrown all over the bedroom.  Not a stitch left in the drawers.  The drawers are stacked in a tower, and she is climbing them.  (This happened every day for weeks until we got smart and moved the dresser INTO her closet, and installed a lock on the closet doors). Week 7:  Grayson banged her head on the corner of her nightstand while she was jumping on the bed.  She jumps on the bed all the time, and it is more than likely to happen again.  Who really needs a nightstand? Week 8:   Heard another crash.  Grayson knocked her pictures off the wall. Broken. Week 9:   Grayson has a mattress in her room, and two big curtainless windows with really pretty views outside.  I found a set of butterflies made from beautiful fabrics that I could suspend from her ceiling.  I think they are safe!  While we have drifted toward a french-country / farmhouse style decor in the past, we are beginning to appreciate a minimalist style.  It works for her, and us. Week 104:   Happy to say that Grayson\u2019s bedroom has slowly reclaimed it\u2019s rightful belongings!  She has a queen size bed, WITH a frame, intact, just a few bitemarks from times past.  She now has a dresser, with drawers, and the only time she takes out clothes is to PUT THEM ON, and all by herself.  Her closet is no longer LOCKED.  She has both books and toys, and they have not been partially devoured.  Her windowsill and walls, once seemingly pitbullified, are now repainted, replaced and they haved remained perfectly untouched.  Model home new.  Amazing.  Her once boring as all can be room is now the most kid-desired in the house \u2013 she has a floor to ceiling rock wall and a soon to be installed Zip Line.  She still has her beautiful butterflies.

{"date": "May 25, 2008", "body": "When Rhema was around 18 months old, we lived in a tiny village in southern Germany, and I was in that confusing time of Wondering.  Is there something wrong with Rhema?  A clue in the affirmative came one day when I went to pick her up from my German neighbor who had been babysitting for me. As I crossed the yard, I could see that my neighbor Babbsi was standing at a large, closed window and Rhema was in her arms. I was so excited to see her that I stopped outside the window and started chanting her name. She did not notice me. Babbsi smiled and told Rhema \u2018Mommy\u2019s here.\u2019 Babbsi tried to get her attention; she pointed at me and even tapped on the window. But Rhema continued to look away. I began jumping up and down, making funny faces, pumping my arms, calling her name. But she never even looked in my direction. I remember feeling a pit in my gut, as I finally dropped my arms and headed inside. At the time, I did not know there was a name for what Rhema was lacking. I now know that it is called Joint Attention. Joint attention  refers to shared moments when an adult and child are both focused on the same thing. This process of shared experience involves observing an object  or event by following a gaze or following pointing gestures. Joint attention is a prerequisite for language development and social development, and babies typically develop this skill around six to eight months of age. Joint attention teaches children \u201csocial referencing\u201d. In other words, when a child looks at Mom and identifies her excited reaction in response to what she is looking at, the child will often assume the same emotional response when he sees the beautiful cardinal in the tree that his mother is observing. Joint attention is (at least, initially) usually severely lacking in children with autism. Now here\u2019s the cool thing.  I was reading a book the other day that referenced a study on joint attention by a researcher named Dare Baldwin.* He stated that babies gain new information and learn to communicate through joint attention, but that the power of joint attention hinges on one thing: the baby\u2019s parents and other family members have to  matter . Because the baby cares about what Mommy cares about, the baby seeks her focus of attention. Mom is her point of reference in a new and changing world, and so,  baby sees what Mommy sees . The baby learns to see the world first through her mother\u2019s eyes. Language acquisition naturally follows. So you know I had to think about God and our relationship with Him in terms of joint attention. It goes without saying that God wants our attention. The Bible is explicit: He wants our hearts, our love, our worship, our lives. Just as there are things I long to show Rhema, I know that there are things God wants to show me \u2013 about me, about my family, about His heart for this world \u2013 if only I would give Him my attention. But the biggest thing I have learned from studying joint attention in autism is that there must be a referencing point. Moreover, that referencing point has to be the most important thing in your life, it must captivate you. For me, that still point, that center of attention, must be Jesus. Oh, to learn to see the world through His eyes! To learn to see my situation through His eyes! Well, I think I\u2019m going to try it. In the midst of all this, I\u2019m going to try to make Jesus my single point of reference again. Nothing else. If anyone else is up for the challenge, let me know how it turns out. Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.

It\u2019s a simple truth, but one that can be hard to hold on to when you\u2019re consumed with worry and fear about the future. A few weeks ago after we had been in the  hospital  with Rhema, the uncertainty of her future (in regard to her health and development) was weighing on me heavy, but what a peace I felt when I finally released it all to God. My mother said: \u201cFaith does not always provide answers, but it is a hand in the darkness keeping alive that trust that despite all appearances, God is still on our side.\u201d She sent me the following quote: In his Christmas Eve Broadcast in 1939, King George VI quoted these words: \u201cAnd I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year: Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown. And he replied; Go into the darkness and  put your hand into the hand of God . That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.\u201d So let the road ahead become unclear, the God of the Universe is with  you .

To date, she has been fully weaned from an antiepileptic med\u00a0(Depakote), and is in a 2-week phase of not receiving any seizure meds at all. Next week she starts on a new medication (Keppra). The effects of the withdrawal on her little body have been significant. Mood swings, tantrums, noncompliance, screaming, toileting regression \u2013 yeah, poop everywhere -, night screams, increased stimming. She was nearly manic \u2013 too much energy, unable to sleep, much too much going on inside and out.\u00a0 Trapped. It was a brief period of just holding on for dear life and trusting God that she\u2019d be there when it was over.\u00a0 My family gathered, and we prayed. After a span of unbearably hot days, the rain came. In the midst of the storm, Rhema gleefully ran outside for a taste and a baptism. And I knew  she  was still with us. Of course. She is the one who gives  well  just when I think she has nothing left. Like the rain lily . . . thought not to last . . . but when the rain comes she sprouts new flowers in a succession of blooms. An amazing little girl whose blithe spirit refuses to be parched. Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.

{"date": "July 13, 2008", "body": "\u00a0 I was trying to clean up our old computer, delete ancient files, make some more space. I came across a letter that I do not think I had ever read before. It was written by my dear husband to our firstborn, while he was serving a year-long deployment in Iraq. Rhema was born about 6 weeks after Brandon deployed, and he returned home when she was almost 1 yr. old. 6 September 2004 (from Tikrit, Iraq) Precious Rhema, I remember the first time I ever thought about you. Your mother surprised me\u2014although as soon as I saw her face, I knew what she was about to say. I remember her beaming face. You were so small then. Smaller than my pinky fingernail. Yep, definitely smaller than that. I was speechless, so speechless that your mother had to ask if I was excited. Oh, I was, I just don\u2019t show excitement too much thinking it to reveal my immaturity. I imagined the cradle your mother\u2019s body was. I was so concerned for her for she never sits still. Then you started to make a bump of your mother\u2019s tummy. I watched you grow from inside. One day, we went to the doctor and I got to watch you sleep inside mommy as you were growing. My goodness. It was a miracle. I looked at those pictures of you resting inside Mommy often while I was away. I had to go to Iraq to protect you, which meant I wasn\u2019t there when you were born. But, I am coming home soon. I can\u2019t wait to hold you. I can\u2019t wait to try to teach you something. I can\u2019t wait until you recognize me. I can\u2019t wait until you scream \u201cdaddy\u201d when I come through the door. I can\u2019t wait until you are old enough to know about Jesus. (I pray you accept Him at a young age and follow Him forever.) I can\u2019t wait until I see you play sports. I can\u2019t wait to see you sing. I can\u2019t wait to see you make us all proud as you head off to college. I can\u2019t wait to see you accomplish a million things your mother and father didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t wait to see you married to a Godly husband. I can\u2019t wait to see you and your family (my grandchildren) take on the world for Christ. But, I have to wait. I don\u2019t want to rush any moments. I want to slow down and cherish each second.  Your daddy loves you with all his heart.  I hope I get to be your hero. Love, \nDaddy \n Just wanted you to know, dear Brandon, that you\u2019re her hero. Remember the sign that was posted in the old gym in Germany at your homecoming from war?  Even though, you are still waiting to hear her scream \u201cDaddy!\u201d, you are her hero. Every time you teach her something new \u2013 be it pulling up her pants or using a spoon \u2013 you\u2019re her hero. Every time you fall on your knees before God on her behalf, you\u2019re her hero. Every time you hold her in your loving, strong arms for a butt-shot, you\u2019re her hero.\u00a08) Every time you sing \u201cYes, Jesus loves Rhema\u201d, you\u2019re her hero. Every time you clean up the  poop art , you\u2019re her hero. At every doctor\u2019s appointment, therapy visit and school meeting, you\u2019re her hero. Every time you get up early and seek God\u2019s face on how to lead this family, you\u2019re her hero. Just wanted you to know, B. Rascal Flatts, cue music.

{"date": "July 18, 2008", "body": "Rhema and Hope\u2019s grandparents are here visiting from Michigan. All week long Rhema\u2019s grandmother has asked Rhema questions as if she fully expects that she will get an answer. \u201cWhat did you do at school today, Rhema?\u201d Later she will ask, \u201cDid you play on the playground today?\u201d, \u201cWhich do you like best, the slide or the swing?\u201d She does not ask in a grilling, testing sort of way, but in a conversational manner as if they\u2019ve been talking together all their lives. These are not rhetorical questions; even though no reply is given, the expectation of an answer remains. Her expressionless face, her averted eyes, her sometimes detached body language belie the fact that she is listening or even understanding. I always talk to Rhema as if she understands what I am saying. I tell her where we are going, what we are going to do. I inform her about the order of things: \u201cFirst bath, then pop (sicle).\u201d When I send her off to school, I tell her to be a good girl. I tell her to keep her clothes on. I tell her that Mommy loves her more than anything. I tell her that I am so proud of her. But I realized this week that I\u2019ve stopped asking questions. I suppose that after all these years of never getting a response, I just stopped\u2026 expecting, hoping. And I did not even realize it. I still ask questions in the form of choices, such as food choices. Holding up her PECS icons, I will ask, \u201cDo you want chicken or hotdog?\u201d But there are no longer questions about  her , how she feels, what she likes, what happened in her day. \u201cRhema, where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d That question used to kill me. At the end of a speech therapy visit or an OT session, I will come into the room and her therapist will say, \u201cRhema, where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d I stand there feeling uncomfortable, as her therapist crouches down to Rhema\u2019s level and tries to get eye contact, urging her to look in my direction. Sometimes I kind of smile and wave my hand in a goofy way.  Me. Over here. I\u2019m the mother.  I know Rhema knows who I am. I know she knows I love her, and I know she loves me. So it doesn\u2019t bother me that much anymore that Rhema fails the find-your-mother test every time. In fact, lately I think she may not acknowledge the question on purpose because she\u2019s insulted by it.  Of course I know who my mother is. \u201cRhema, will you show me your new shoes?\u201d Rhema was sitting in her chair eating dinner. At first she looked off into the distance. \u201cRhema, do you like your new shoes?\u201d her grandmother asked. Then she looked over her tray and down at her dangling feet. She flexed her feet up and down displaying her pretty shoes. She clearly understood the question, and she clearly gave an answer. \u201cHow was school today?\u201d is a big question even for a typical child. Today if Rhema gave a vocal answer to that question someone would surely have to pick me up off the floor. But it doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t ask it. At best, she knows that I care about how her day went at school. I remember when I was pregnant with Rhema, Brandon and I went out to dinner with a couple we had met at a training in Germany. The couple had two sons, a 7 year old and an infant. I was instantly drawn to the seven year old. He was such a beautiful boy. I began talking to him right away, asking him lots of questions. When he didn\u2019t respond, his mother interjected: \u201cHe has autism.\u201d I knew very little about autism at the time, so all I said was, \u201cOh.\u201d We all went out to dinner, and no one spoke to the boy for the rest of the night. I supposed that the explanation that he had autism meant that I was not supposed to speak with him. It was as if he wasn\u2019t there, even though he was with us the whole time, quietly eating his dinner. That memory stays with me. I pray that Rhema is never that alone. To those of you, family and friends and neighbors of Rhema, thanks for being brave enough to let your words hang unrequited in the air. I always appreciate you when you say hi anyway. When you ask questions anyway. When you  high-five  anyway. Because you\u2019re still expecting an answer, It encourages me to keep asking questions.

What do you mean they scream and they\u2019re silent? They don\u2019t have a father around to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t act like a moron. You\u2019ll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don\u2019t sit there crying and screaming, idiot.'\u201d \u2013 Michael Savage I admit that I may have once been as ignorant as Michael Savage. But then God sent me blessings named Rhema and Hope who teach me daily about the stuff of humility, empathy. Thanks to Shannon Johnson at  www.foggyrock.com  for writing such a beautiful letter and for  Adventures in Autism  for sharing it with us. \u2013 Dear Mr. Savage, My name is Shannon Johnson and I am the proud parent of a 13 year old son with autism. If you met my son, you would probably think that he was very funny, as he would not hesitate to smile and call you weird, which is his best attempt at a compliment. He would find you intriguing because you have facial hair and he would want to touch it with his sticky fingers that usually smell like his last meal. He seems taller than he actually is because he walks on his toes. It makes it hard for him to wear shoes, but he will tolerate flip-flops in the summer and slip on shoes in the winter, as long as he can take them off as soon as he gets in the car or enters the house. Although he eats like a horse and I literally have to keep a lock on my refrigerator door, he is skinny and underweight, probably in part because of his severe digestive issues. Without a special diet of gluten-free and dairy-free foods, and a multitude of supplements, enzymes and medications, he wouldn\u2019t even digest a fraction of the food that passes his lips. For the majority of his life, he has experienced more restrictions, seen more physicians, been poked more with needles and been tested more by psychologists than most adults can ever imagine. Through it all, he has been braver and more courageous than anyone I have ever met. Naturally, it disappoints me to hear someone of your intelligence and of your influence describe children with autism as \u201cbrats\u201d. I can only assume that you are referring to the fact that some children with autism are known to have behavioral meltdowns or tantrums. Honestly, my son is one of those kids. If you saw him in public having a meltdown, you would probably deduct that he was screaming because he couldn\u2019t have a new toy or another ice cream cone; that he was using his lungs to manipulate his parents into giving into his selfish requests. However, you would be completely wrong. Instead, he might simply be reacting to the fact that the sights and smells, the sounds and colors in the mall, or at the grocery store, have overwhelmed his already over-stimulated sensory system and he needs to retreat to the safety of the car right away. In this heightened moment, his anxiety would be revved up and he would lose his ability to verbally communicate his needs. He would then rely on his tears to inform me or his father that his system had had all that it could take, no matter what goodie we might offer, no matter what reward lay in our cart\u2026.And then, once he was safe away from the sensory assault, he might ask, as he has in the past, \u201cWhat can we do next time so that it\u2019s not so loud in the store?\u201d\u2026\u2026Certainly, we have even sat in the rain to eat a meal outside when the restaurant lights were too bright or the music inside too loud for our very sensitive boy. If you stood outside my son\u2019s door sometime, Mr. Savage, as I invite you to do if you are ever in my neighborhood, you might hear my son ask God in heaven to \u201cplease make me get better soon.\u201d Not really the words of a \u201cbrat\u201d, Mr. Savage\u2026Only a very affected child who doesn\u2019t feel good most of the time, and would do just about anything to just be like everyone else.

{"date": "July 28, 2008", "body": "Recently, Rhema has started saying \u201cYeah.\u201d She, in fact, says it all the time now. According to her therapist, she is now over-using the word, and we may have to \u201cfade\u201d it. And of course, we would prefer \u201cYes\u201d over the informal \u201cYeah.\u201d But I don\u2019t care. I am still absolutely BLOWN AWAY, dazzled and stupefied when I stoop down to Rhema\u2019s level and ask her if she wants a popsicle and she looks me dead in the eyes, grins, and whispers, \u201cYyyeah\u2026 Yeah.\u201d I can\u2019t really explain it. But we\u2019ve had a conversation \u2013 an interchange of information through spoken words. A question has been asked. It has been heard and understood. Sufficient eye contact has occurred, and a spontanteous, appropriate response \u2013 an affirmation \u2013\u00a0has followed. Thank you, Lord!!! \u2026 But I admit, she does use the word a tad too much. Lately, any object worthy of a word label is called \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cRhema, what animal is this?\u201d (holding up a cow). \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cRhema, which crayon do you want?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Anyone who has been involved in behavioral therapy for children with autism knows that one of the most powerful pivotal behaviors is motivation. For example, \u201ca child\u2019s  motivation  to communicate about colors will increase if they are offered specific colored candies, to be given once they attempt to ask for the candies verbally.\u201d We\u2019ve always struggled\u00a0to find things that are motivating enough for Rhema \u2013 something that she wanted or was interested in so badly that she would actually attempt to make a vocalization. To date, the Beloved Popsicle is the only enduring motivator or reinforcer we have found. Rhema can be playing contentedly and if I come over to give her a hug, she remembers that I am her Popsicle Dealer, and she urgently grabs my hand and drags me towards the freezer. Before I can even ask her if she wants a \u201cpop\u201d or say anything at all, Rhema knows I know what she wants, and she is already saying, \u201cYyyeah. Yeah.\u201d Reminds me of a Bible verse that says  \u201cFor your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.\u201d  Matt 6:8. These words were spoken just before Jesus introduced the Lord\u2019s Prayer. I think it\u2019s significant that before the most famous and most recited prayer in the world was taught and prayed, Jesus prefaced it with, \u201cYour Father knows what you need even before you ask Him.\u201d God is my Father, and He knows better than me what I need. Again, it all comes down to trust. Just as my daughter trusts that I know she\u00a0\u201cneeds\u201d a pop, I must trust that my Father in heaven knows exactly what I need. This begs the question, Why pray then? C.S. Lewis says it best:  \u201cI pray because I can\u2019t help myself. I pray because I\u2019m helpless. I pray because the\u2026the need flows from me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn\u2019t change God, but it changes me.\u201d I\u2019ve asked. And I\u2019ve knocked. And I\u2019ve petitioned. And I\u2019ve prayed. Now all that is left is, sweet rest (ahhh), believing that He knows my needs even before I ask. So, Lord, my prayer today is simply one of total trust: \u201cYeah. I mean, Yes!\u201d Visit\u00a0 Busy At Home \u00a0at Thirstin For The Word Thursdays.

{"date": "July 31, 2008", "body": "My dear bloggy pal over at  Diary of a Mom  writes about the precious bedtime ritual between her and her daughter. Rhema and I also have a bedtime routine that is such a wonderful time of togetherness that I look forward to it every day. It\u2019s  our time  to truly connect without distraction or interruption. If I have to be out late at night, when I get home I am always hopeful that she\u2019s still awake. I find her in her top bunk bed, waiting for me, for us. It goes like this: I crawl up into her bed \u2013 all 30 plus years of me, and sit her in my lap. We beam at each other. \u201cWheels on the Bus?\u201d I ask. She lifts my arms, and I begin to sing the Wheels on the Bus song. We do all of the hand motions. She loves it! She tilts her head back, squeezes her eyes shut, and grins hard.\u00a0Her favorite part is\u00a0when the baby on the bus goes wah, wah, wah!\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing the Wheels on the Bus song together since she was 1 year old. After three years of singing it nearly everyday, Rhema will now occasionally provide the Beep, Beep, Beep when the horn on the bus goes Beep, Beep, Beep. We\u2019ve added a verse on the end in which I sing and sign  \u201cAnd Mommy says to Rhema, I love you, I love you, I love you. All through the town.\u201d After our song is done, Rhema lies down, and I lean over her and let her mess up my hair. She loves to flap strands of my hair\u00a0across her face. She tickles her forehead, her nose, and her cheeks with my hair. Gazing into her beautiful, brown eyes, I bask in her attention.\u00a0 Then she will suddenly try and gouge my eyes out with her fingers. This is fine because as she is going\u00a0after my eyeballs, she will quietly announce, \u201cEyes.\u201d Next she sticks a finger up each of my nostrils. I\u2019m careful not to move for fear of permanent damage. And then she says, \u201cNnnose.\u201d She touches my lips. \u201cMauwf.\u201d Then her little hands cover my ears and she whispers triumphantly, \u201cEee-ers.\u201d \u201cYah, Rhema!\u201d I say and put her hands on my hair, and I say, \u201cHair.\u201d She has not said hair yet, but I know one day it will come. She only recently began naming the aforementioned parts of the face, and she only does so on me and\u2026 uh\u2026\u00a0Mr. Potato Head. Then I will recite the same Bible verse to her, touching her lips with my finger every time I say the word \u2018mouth\u2019, and drawing an imaginary heart on her chest every time I say the word \u2018heart.\u2019 Rhema, The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is LORD\u201d, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. A kiss, A \u201cnight, night\u201d, and an \u201cI love you\u201d from me and I am out the door, with a soaring heart, Medussa-like hair, hurting eyeballs and a picked-clean nose. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Today was not a good day for us. So awful in fact that I cannot bear to go into the details, except to say that after one day on the new anti-seizure med, the Keppra Monster turned her into a raging, thrashing, screaming, self-injurious child. It was a long, frightening, disheartening night for me alone with the kids. By the end of the evening, I felt desperate and undone.  Oh God, where is my little girl? Beneath the bastille of the medication, the autism, the sensory overload, the frustration, the confusion, where is my little girl?? I heaved a flailing, brainsick child into her top bunk. Clearly there would be no bedtime routine tonight. I was ready to flee just when her hand grabbed mine. I turned back in surprise. She was quiet. For the first time all day she was quiet. In that moment, I imagined what her voice would sound like. I am honestly\u00a0not sure I know\u00a0\u2013 or remember \u2013\u00a0what her voice sounds like because she so rarely speaks. And when she does speak, it\u2019s usually a whisper or a mimic \u2013 someone else\u2019s voice. But as she held my hand, in my head, I heard her say ever so softly, \u201cCome on, Mommy. It\u2019s o.k. Climb up. Let\u2019s sing our song.\u201d My Rhema. I brushed one small teardrop from my face. Climbed up into her bed. And sang our song.

It is a new, strange and beautiful sound in my ears. Such a blessing. Hope .\u00a0 I have it again\u2026 in abundance. \u00a0 Visit  A Mom\u2019s Life  for Miracle Monday.

{"date": "June 24, 2008", "body": "\u201cAt about nine months an infant develops an intersubjective sense of self. If the infant could speak he or she might say \u2018I see that my mother sees me as lovable, so I see myself that way too.'\u201d \u2018Sense of self\u2019 is kind of a buzz phrase in our time. Books, magazines, seminars, wellness clubs, therapeutic massage\u2026 many are dedicated to helping people find their sense of self. A sense of self is a necessary step in the developmental process, particularly social development, because a child\u2019s understanding of \u2018self\u2019 comes from an experience with \u2018other\u2019. Developing a sense of self requires that one recognizes herself as distinct from others. Simply put, possessing a sense of self means knowing  who I am , what motivates me, what makes me me. The current  research  suggests that my daughter\u2019s autism leaves her with a poorly defined perception of \u2018self\u2019.  They say her ability for  self-recognition is impaired , her identity fragmented.  While I appreciate the research, a part of me wants to reject that notion with every fiber of my being. But the question for me remains: how do I help my nonverbal, autistic child \u2013 who at times seems so hyperactive and disconnected \u2013 how do I teach her to \u201cknow\u201d herself and to relate herself to the world. This is a daunting challenge and further reason for me to be on my knees before God. Over the years, I have come to know that my own sense of self is derived from my beliefs in God and His Word. My mother used to say to us, \u201cRemember who you are and Whose you are.\u201d In navigating the world, it has always helped me to know that I am God\u2019s daughter and my mother\u2019s child. My dear friend and college roommate, Chandra, went through the entire Bible searching for what God says about our identity. The result of her study is a wonderful Scriptural reference she entitled \u201cWhat God Says About Me\u201d in which she focuses on our Origin, Purpose, Lineage, Family, Nature, New Self, Freedom, Relationship with God, Role as a Woman, Relationship with the World, Eternal Life, and Character and Gifts. (If anyone is interested, I will gladly send you a copy. I refer to it often.)  *Edit : Click  here  for a copy of \u201cWhat God Says About Me\u201d. In addition to the unique and God-given gifts, abilities, and personalities that my children will discover as they grow, I pray to teach them some of the following things about themselves: \u2022\t I am created in God\u2019s image and blessed by God  (Gen. 1:27, Gen. 5:1-2) \u2022\t God\u2019s hands formed me and made me, and I am fearfully and wonderfully made  (Ps. 119:73, Ps. 139:13,14) \u2022\t The Lord has a purpose for me and He will fulfill it  (Ps. 138:8 ) \u2022\t God loves me so much that He calls me His child (1 Jn. 3:1-2) and He sent His Son to die for me so that I could live with Him forever  (Jn. 3:16) \u2022\t When I am weak, then I am strong. Christ\u2019s power rests on me in my weaknes, and His power is made perfect in my weakness  (2 Cor. 12:9,10) \u2022\t I belong to God. I am precious and honored in His sight. God loves me and I am created for His glory  (Isa. 43:1,4,7) \u2022\t I am fiercely valued and forever loved by my family These are the things I want my girls to know about themselves when I cannot be with them. When that Truth is challenged. When they are teased on the playground for being different. When they are repeatedly underestimated. When they fail and when they succeed. For Rhema, the last time she was tested she had the  receptive language  of a 12 month old. No matter. We have a renewed commitment to read the Word of God into her ears. I\u2019m trusting that the \u201c Rhema Word \u201d will come to her and bring understanding and teach her about her \u2018self\u2019.

{"date": "June 19, 2008", "body": "These days when I look at my wedding picture, there is the wistful desire to return to a simpler place and time. Life had been always so good to us both, that, at the time, I had no reason to think that life would not go on being good. I had my Jesus, my healthy, happy parents and siblings, an Ivy League education, and my own Top-Gun-officer-pilot on my arm. I often wonder why Autism devastated us so much. Perhaps it was the regressive nature of it, and the way it stole into our world and confiscated everything we thought we had. Perhaps it was the \u201cdream deferred\u201d that Langston Hughes wrote about \u2013 you may not realize the dreams you\u2019ve dreamed for your children until those dreams are shattered. Perhaps it was the slow and steady realization that the autism was severe and was not going to simply be outgrown or out-drugged (- that fact was more painful than the initial diagnosis). For two and a half years, I felt like I was the aim of Bamm-Bamm Rubble\u2019s club. IEP meetings, special schools, hospital stays, therapy sessions and registration with the Department of Mental Retardation were never in my plans for her life, for our life. I was caught in a cycle of grief, and I was angry, bitter and so very disappointed in God. All throughout, however, I could hear a whisper: God is faithful. Finally one day I whispered back: God is faithful? That used to be my theme song, but now I feel forsaken. \u201cLet us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.\u201d  Heb 10:23. The Greek word for \u201cfaithful\u201d in that verse is  pistos  and it means trustworthy, sure, or true. It resonated with me that God is trustworthy \u2013  worthy of my trust . Surely He had been faithful up until the point that trials came my way, surely He would continue. And even though I felt abandoned by Him, I remembered I could trust Him. So I said,  \u201cO.K., God. I\u2019m giving her up. I\u2019m trusting you even if she does not get better. I\u2019m trusting you with her life.\u201d  As I write this, it seems so simple, but it was oh so hard to do. But since I did it, I have felt an incredible, liberating peace. God is faithful. Faithful to His Word, faithful to the promises in His Word, and ever faithful to us. In Revelation \u2013 in the final analysis \u2013 His very name is \u201cFaithful and True\u201d. Have we ever had the shadow of a reason to doubt our Father\u2019s goodness? Have not His lovingkindnesses been marvellous? Has He once failed to justify our trust? Ah, no! our God has not left us at any time. We have had dark nights, but the star of love has shone forth amid the blackness; we have been in stern conflicts, but over our head He has held aloft the shield of our defence. We have gone through many trials, but never to our detriment, always to our advantage; and the conclusion from our past experience is, that He who has been with us in six troubles, will not forsake us in the seventh. What we have known of our faithful God, proves that He will keep us to the end. \u2014 Charles Spurgeon Back to my wedding picture: Nearly ten years later, we have changed. Wow, how we have changed. But God stays the same. And life is still good, and God is still faithful. Visit Celly from  Busy At Home  for more Thirstin\u2019 For The Word Thursdays.

{"date": "June 29, 2008", "body": "Imagine my delight when I found gluten-free, casein-free, soy-free, egg-free, nut-free fries shaped like alphabet letters in the freezer section of the local grocery store. Rhema is a picky, faddy eater (understatement of the year). She has 3 food lists: Obsession, Toleration and Detestation. \n1) Obsession: I\u2019m obsessed with you, ______ (fill in the blank food). I will eat you morning, noon, night and snack time. \n2) Toleration: I tolerate you, ______ (fill in the blank food), if the moon and stars are all aligned. \n3) Detestation: I despise you, ______ (fill in the blank food). Do not dare come near me. Any green food or vegetable is on this list. Foods on her list can, without warning, move from the Obsession list to the Toleration list and back again. There are never more than four or five food items on either the Obsession or Toleration List at any one time. Occasionally foods may drop suddenly from the Obsession list all the way down to the Detestation list, never to rise again. Currently, gluten-free fries are on Rhema\u2019s Toleration List. So I eagerly snatched up all the bags of Alphabet fries (they\u2019re actually called \u201cAlphatots\u201d), because any one who has a child with feeding issues knows that when there is something your child will eat, you must stock up on it.  You must never run out. This is great , I thought.  Here is a GFCF food she can eat, and it can even be a learning tool! Maybe I\u2019ll spell her name out on her plate tonight. Maybe I can give her the letter A, wait and see if I can get her to ask for B, then C, then D! Or maybe we can sing the ABC\u2019s before we eat. In the future, maybe I\u2019ll only give her vowels and then later work on consonants.  My mind was racing with the possibilities. I could hardly wait. For dinner that night, I set her plate before her with a random assortment of letters. Hope also got a plate of alphabet fries. Hope happily shouted, \u201cABC\u2019s!\u201d and consumed her fries within minutes. Rhema refused to touch hers. I was confused. It\u2019s new to her, I thought. She just needs a little time, a little coaxing. \u201cRhema, look! It\u2019s the letter W! Yummm. Taste it. It\u2019s so good.\u201d No response. I picked up one of her fries and wagged it in front of her. \u201cEat, Rhema!\u201d Then she started the squirmy dance in her chair. Then the escalating whines of protest. I could suddenly hear the alarm signals going off. Meltdown Pending. \u201cO.K., O.K., Rhema.\u201d Sigh.  I\u2019m backing off now. Let\u2019s give you something to eat from the Obsession List.  I looked at my daughter, waiting for her to look at me. When she did, I suddenly understood. If she could talk, she would have said, \u201cSilly woman. We can say the alphabet. We can sing the alphabet. We can even do the alphabet puzzle.

{"date": "October 9, 2009", "body": "The other day Rhema casually got out of the minivan, walked around to the back, ripped off our Autism Awareness car magnet and tore it into pieces. I seriously stood there dumbfounded and disturbed. What in the world was  that  supposed to mean? \u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026 now our van will feel naked, Rhema! How am I ever to find the van in a crowded parking lot without that magnet!\u201d She\u00a0seemed oblivious to my ramblings. I\u2019ll go inside and order another one right away. People must know that we\u2019re touched by autism. People must be  aware. I felt somehow stripped of\u00a0my identity. \u201cI am of the autism mother tribe. I am blogger. I am educator. I am advocate. I am\u2026 in need of a chill pill.\u201d I laughed at myself. A couple days later we were walking into the grocery store when Rhema suddenly made a beeline for an SUV in the parking lot. I spotted the autism ribbon on the back, and then realized Rhema\u2019s intentions. \u201cNo, Rhema, nooooooooooooooooooooooo.\u201d The girl has eyes like a hawk \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even seem like she\u2019s looking, but she\u2019s sees everything. I caught her before she could break the magnet into pieces. Hoping no one was watching, I slapped the magnet back onto the vehicle, grabbed\u00a0her hand and rushed into the store. When we came out the SUV was still there, and Rhema headed straight for the magnet. But this time I was prepared, and I literally carried her back to our car. I had to giggle. My child with autism just might manage to remove all the Autism Awareness ribbons from the whole town! Yesterday we were in a crowded waiting room at her therapy center. Rhema was playing with a train set while her teacher and I talked. I looked up and noticed a ribbon magnet on an office door clear across the room. Oh no. Rhema seemed to see it the same time I did because she bolted towards the door. In mid-conversation, I lunged for her. \nMissed. I tripped over a little kid on the floor, scrambled up, bumped into someone and finally caught up to Rhema. But it was too late. She\u2019d already broken a piece of the magnet. I grabbed the pieces, tried to fit them together and put them back on the door. I turned around to see the occupants of the waiting room looking at us curiously. No one seemed surprised, they were probably all used to the unexpected. (Speaking of the  unexpected , you must read this  post !). \u201cRhema seems to have a thing for Autism magnets,\u201d I announced. So if you have one, and you discover it\u2019s missing, call me and I\u2019ll replace it.\u201d \u00a0 By the way, I still have not ordered a new magnet. Maybe something\u00a0different like  Floortime Lite Mama ? Maybe nothing at all for a while. For a time, autism or \u2018life with autsim\u2019 was all-consuming.

{"date": "October 13, 2009", "body": "Hope and Rhema\u2019s all-time favorite person in the world paid them a visit this weekend. He\u2019d been away for six weeks when he slipped in the house early Friday morning while they slept. When Rhema awakened he went to her room, scooped her into his arms and carried her down the stairs. They sat on the couch, and Rhema, the child who never stops moving, was  still . She stayed curled up in his arms, making her soft babbling noises for a long, long time. For once, she was not frantic. It\u2019s so hard to know what\u00a0she is thinking and experiencing at times; how much she processes and even what she chooses to reveal is, most times, a mystery. But if I could hazard a guess as to what she was feeling as she sat there with him, it would be\u2026  Relief\u2026 Contentment. * Some time later when we heard Hope stirring, he went to her room, and I heard the most joyous sound of surprise and delight. \u201c Daddyyyyy!!!!!!! \u201d And then she couldn\u2019t stop talking. First, she said to him what people always say to her when they haven\u2019t seen her in a while: \u201cWell, Daddy, you\u2019ve gotten so big!\u201d As he lifted her for a dinosaur hug, she patted his head. \u201cI  love  your hair!\u201d she\u00a0exclaimed as if trading compliments with a teenaged girlfriend. Then the two of them got down to business. Ever since he left, Hope has been having nightmares. She insists that there are birds in her bed that \u201cwake her up\u201d and \u201cpeck her knees.\u201d Daddy explained that last night, while she was sleeping he came in and caught all those pesky birds and sent them on their way. Problem solved. Still in his arms, Hope looked over his shoulder with a smile, and whispered to me, \u201cHi, Mommy.  I found my Daddy .\u201d * \u00a0 After a fun day at the pool, we were all in the kitchen getting ready for dinner. I realized that Rhema was saying \u201cI luh yew\u201d over and over in her sing-songy stim. She was wandering around the room, looking at no one in particular, repeating the words, as if to herself. \u201cShe\u2019s saying, \u2018I love you!\u2019\u201d, I said. And then all four of us\u00a0started singing \u2018I love you, I love you, I love you\u2019 out loud, in that same Rhema-voice, as we busied ourselves in the kitchen. * The weekend wasn\u2019t all perfect. We still managed to forget to cherish one another at times. But I learned something recently in a Beth Moore bible study that has helped me view the imperfections in my family with new eyes: \u201cUnless the Lord builds a house, its builders labor in vain;\u201d (Ps. 127:1). When you view the \u201chouse\u201d in that verse in terms of family, you realize that God is the one who custom-builds our families.  Every member is there by His design, His composition, His assembling.  Beth Moore advises, \u201cBe careful not to expect your marriage, parenting, or even your singleness to be exactly like someone else\u2019s.\u201d I am praying that the Custom Builder will continue to fashion, repair and strengthen\u00a0my family and home even while we are separated for over a year. We had to say goodbye again early Monday morning, but the weekend was an unexpected and priceless gift of time for which I will always be grateful. \u00a0 Brandon is in his final stages of training at Ft.

I think back to five years ago when a handful of spouses gathered in an old gymnasium in Katterbach, Germany in the dark of night. There were babies and small children, and wives who were suddenly decked out in their best clothes. We were waiting\u2026 like the ten bridemaids of the Biblical parable, we were waiting for the groom, with oil in our lamps. I\u2019ll never forget walking into that gym and seeing the signs that caused a lump to form in my throat. The first thing I did was to check the manifest. To see, for sure, if my beloved was on the list. He\u2019d said that after a long, hard year he was coming home. But in the Army, you just never know what might happen, so I stared hard at the list until I found his name. And when I did, I bounced an 11 month-old Rhema on my hip, and let my heart  rest  for the first time in a good while. The hours dragged on and we chatted, laughed, traded babies and tried to be patient.\u00a0 Around 2 in the morning, the announcement came that Bravo Company, 3rd of the 58th\u00a0\u2013 deployed in support of\u00a0Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2013 had landed on the kaserne. While in Iraq, they had set up an airfield for coalition aircraft in Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown of Tikrit, and now they had returned to their home away from home in\u00a0Katterbach.\u00a0 It\u00a0would still be hours before we could see them, as they had to take inventory and turn in their weapons. It seemed like forever. Then a screen descended, the lights went out and a music video played.* The song finished, the screen was raised\u2026 and then we saw them. A small, weary company of air traffic controllers, led by my husband. Before\u00a0being released\u00a0to their families, they stood almost humbly, in formation.  You could hear the tears. I  know  they were praying, quietly thanking God along with us. Thanking God with all their hearts that not one of them,  not one , had been lost. So here am I again.  Waiting \u2026 for a homecoming. While I wait, I am aware that we are all waiting for something. May your waiting make you stronger.\u00a0 May you  know  His peace that passes understanding\u2026 while you\u2019re in the in between. May you  know  His love surrounds you, May He be your portion\u2026 in the waiting. This I pray. \u00a0 Thank you for\u00a0allowing me to blog ad nauseum about\u00a0this deployment! Today\u00a0is a\u00a0hard day knowing that Brandon is finally flying away.\u00a0We kept hoping to get an email saying, \u201cStop! Psych!

I feel like we\u2019ve been in a crisis like that. My girl has gone through a dreaded regression and has been exhibiting behaviors even extreme for her. She seems to have lost all toilet-training. She\u2019s up all night doing her up-all-night antics of yelling, crashing, banging, humming, breaking down her bed. She\u2019s been very hyperactive, a tornado, out of control. She\u2019s picked up a new hobby\u00a0of eating things that, well, you just don\u2019t eat. She\u2019s stripping. She\u2019s been harder to engage than ever, prompting her beloved therapist T to say \u201cthis is the worst she\u2019s ever been.\u201d I\u2019ve been in a haze just trying to hold on to patience and keep up with all the messes and bathroom accidents all over the house. (No use putting on a diaper, she rips them to shreds). When I complained to my friend  Carrie  that I\u2019d been destined to a life of poo-cleaning, she reminded me of Jesus washing the smelly, dusty, cracked feet of his disciples \u2013 how He humbled himself to clean their filth. It may sound funny, but it\u2019s given a little purpose to my days. To think that I\u2019m serving Rhema in love, but more importantly that I\u2019m serving Him as I care for her.  Let my  lifesong  (everything I do) \u2013 even this \u2013 sing to you, Lord.  I\u2019ve always been confident in my ability to figure out what\u2019s going on with her. When her sub-clinical seizures returned last spring, I knew. This time around I was unsure. Her doctor (and others) suggested that the sudden increase in behaviors was due to Brandon\u2019s absence. While I agreed that that was certainly part of it, I just couldn\u2019t believe that was all to the story. I was concerned that the seizures had returned or her medication was making her crazy. Finally, yesterday her doctor agreed that something must be done. We increased her anti-seizure med \u2013 this will either calm her somewhat or make her more hyperactive. Her doctor is also scheduling her for another overnight EEG in the hospital. Last night after the medication change,  we finally all slept . In fact, we overslept. And it felt GREAT! (Amazing what a good night of sleep can do.) It remains to be seen whether the crisis is over, but I\u2019ve got my second wind. I know we\u2019ll make it.

Every Saturday,\u00a0one or\u00a0two women set aside a few hours just to spend time with me and the girls, assisting in any way they can. I am very blessed, yes? Note: If you are ever reluctant to attend church because you have a special needs child, think of me. Sunday mornings are always an adventure, but my family has been totally embraced at church. People genuinely care about Rhema; they try to understand her and meet her needs. I never imagined I could find such a supportive, loving community. Anyway. Yesterday, a woman whom I recognized but had never met before came to help. I suggested we walk to a new playground. Normally I would just drive, particularly because Rhema is in a squat-walk phase (she takes a couple steps and then squats, takes a couple steps, then squats). But it was such a beautiful, warm fall day, and I had an extra helping hand, so we decided to walk. The walk took a looonnngg time with Rhema squat-walking the whole way, but we finally made it to the playground. I was glad for the adult company and the chance to get to know a new friend. I was happy to tell her more about Rhema and how her autism affects her. She was great with Rhema and did not hesitate to try and engage her, which I truly appreciated. Rhema squealed and ran around the playground while R and I chatted. Then I looked up and saw Rhema near a slide and her pants were down, her creamy bare bottom a contrast to the autumn leaves. Uh oh. I sprinted over to her with my new friend right behind me. \u201cPants on,\u201d I said a little\u00a0too cheerfully as I quickly slid her pants back up. Rhema stuck her hand in the back of her pants and dug around. I pulled her hand out, but she stuck it back in. I pulled it out, she stuck it back in. Starting to feel eyes on us, I yanked\u00a0her hand\u00a0out again. Finally, she acquiesced. Round 1 to mama. Then, with her fingers on the outside, she started slowly working something down her pant leg, intending for it to fall out the bottom. \u201cOh!\u201d my friend said. \u201cShe must have put some pebbles in her pants and needs to get them out!\u201d Um, yeah. Sure. O.K. I knew the truth, but oh, I hoped I was wrong. There we stood, by the slide, waiting expectantly as Rhema worked the \u201cpebbles\u201d down her pant legs to her socks. One by one, they rolled out onto the new playground turf. We bent over to inspect them and then got hit in the face with a bad odor. They were the smelliest pebbles we\u2019d ever seen.

I cannot seem to put my finger on it. My Great-Grandmother was the first Christian in our family\u2014or at least the one that sparked generations of Christian families with our last name. When she gave her heart to Him in the 1960\u2019s, she began to live for Jesus and pray for her family. So simple. So powerful. One by one, her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and, if only she could see them now, her great-great-grandchildren learning Bible verses and on their way to knowing Him. How the course of generations of our family was changed. I last wept when she died in 2003. I guess that is it. It is grief. Loss. How do I say goodbye to my kids tomorrow? How do I put Rhema on the bus and watch her ride off to school for the last time? (Dear God, that hurts so bad to even think about.) Does she even know what awaits her over the next many months? Will she think I have abandoned her? How do I hug Hope goodbye on the porch and have her say, \u201cI love you, Daddy.\u201d? How do I walk away from that little bundle of flesh and all of her growing, experiencing, learning, creating, laughing, hugging, teasing, smiling? Will she continue to thrive without me? Doesn\u2019t she need her Daddy? How do I leave my confidant, my buddy, my comfort, my intimate? How do I leave her to do all of the exhausting work? Have I done enough to make sure she will be ok? How do I stay close to her over these next months? As I wept today (yes, like a big baby), I could not help to be drawn to Jesus in Gethsemane. (It sounds trite, but sometimes those stories seem to lose significance with us because we hear them so much, but in hard times they often come to life and bring new meaning.) My trial can\u2019t come close to comparing with Jesus\u2019 anxiety, but it gave me great comfort to know that my Jesus has experienced my small degree of pain through his big degree of pain. All I could do today to release my pain is say his words,  \u2018Lord, not my will, but Yours be done.\u2019 May Your will be done in and through our family. Please use us, Lord, for your purposes. May this time be redeemed day-by-day. May we embrace with all our being\u00a0the purposes and assignments you offer us during this time. Psalm 23. The Lord is my Shepherd.

There was no way she\u2019d make her after-school therapy sessions on time. The decision was made to have the bus take her directly to therapy after school. I do not like the new schedule. She\u2019s at school all day and then therapy after school and\u2026 what time do I get to be her mommy?\u00a0 She\u2019s still so young, and she needs me (I tell myself). And I need to see her, touch her, know she\u2019s o.k. So Hope and I meet her bus \u2013 along with her teacher \u2013 at the therapy center.

We wait for Rhema. Later, when she\u2019s finally home, we are at odds. She doesn\u2019t know what to do with herself, her body. She escapes into her world. She can\u2019t stay still. She sheds her clothes, she breaks a glass, she pulls down a curtain and  dances in the window . She stims at the sink, letting the water run over her hands. She climbs into the washing machine, sits atop the agitator and spins around. She shrieks continuously. And I find myself saying, \u201cNo! No, no, no.\u201d to every single thing she does. \u201cNo! No, no, no.\u201d because this is not what I wanted. We battle over her food \u2013 she won\u2019t eat what I\u2019ve made, she only wants popsicles for dinner. She hides her dinner in the cupboard, and when I retrieve it, she tears her meal into tiny pieces all over the table. She dumps her drink in the toilet. She\u2019s been home for an hour, and I\u2019m already frustrated and exhausted. As I put her to bed, my heart literally pounds. I hope against hope for the miracle of connection.  Just one moment, God, for me and my girl , I pray. Let her turn her\u00a0lovely face to me. Let her  see  me. Let her be still with me. Let me occupy her attention for just a moment in time. (It occurs to me that God\u00a0desires the same things from me \u2013 that He would be my attention, that I would turn and  see  Him, be still and know Him). \u201cNigh, nigh,\u201d she whispers, like a benediction, unprompted. Before I can exult in the spontaneous, appropriate language, she pushes me toward the door. Like a pirate ship carnival ride, we swing back and forth, high and low. \u201cWait. I love you,\u201d I say. \u201c I luh yew ,\u201d she mimics. \u201cI love you!\u201d \u00a0 Another  bedtime   miracle  granted, thank you, Lord.

One of the goals is to teach her to identify and name her family members. Her teacher asked me to bring in pictures of each of us that could be added to her PECS book. They plan to start off by teaching her to point to the picture of a family member when prompted. Eventually she will be prompted to verbally identify each family member. I was so excited! I was thrilled by the thought of Rhema learning to identify us by name. At home, I rushed around with a sense of urgency trying to find 3 separate photos \u2013 one of Brandon, one of me, one of Hope. I never print photos anymore. They\u2019re all on my computer. But I did manage to find decent pictures of Brandon and Hope that we could laminate and put in Rhema\u2019s PECS book.\u00a0However, I could not find one of me\u2026 And then, KAPOW! It hit me like a\u00a0ton of bricks. My almost-6-year old has to be taught our names, taught who we are. Sure she  knows  us. But she fails to acknowledge us; she does not address us or call us by name. Memories filled my head of a therapist asking repeatedly, \u201cRhema,  where\u2019s Mommy ?\u201d And my daughter unable to understand the question or even respond with a glance in my direction. I try very hard not to let these things get to me. As  JoyMama  so wonderfully wrote, I choose to focus on her strengths and gains \u2013 she is growing, laughing, running, playing and even speaking words. She is happy and she knows she is loved. But some days, out of no where, the reality of her current development knocks me off my feet. I went to the bathroom to wash my face. Looking in the mirror I saw a tired woman who needs to dye away the gray, go shopping, and lose 10 pounds (at least).  I\u2019m a mess , I thought. And someone has to teach my little girl my name through a darn picture! My name, my name\u2026 God, really? After all the mothering I\u2019ve done, all that we have been through, it comes down to this? She has to be trained and coached and prompted to  name  me??? I feel so\u2026. anonymous. I realized that\u00a0the chorus to a beautiful old  hymn  was floating through my head: \n My name is graven on His hands, \nMy name is written on His heart. Later I looked up the Bible passage (Isaiah 54:16) on which the hymn is based.\u00a0A lamenting Zion complains, \u2018The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.\u2019\u00a0 But God says, I could never forget you! \u201cBehold, I have graven thee on the palm of my hands.\u201d\u00a0 Another version says, \u201cHow darest thou doubt my constant remembrance, when the memorial is set upon my very flesh?\u201d A commentary I read stated that it was common practice among the Jews at that time to make marks on their hands or arms by punctures on the skin, with some sort of sign or representation of the city or temple, to show their affection and zeal for it. \u00a0 This morning I wrote my name on Rhema\u2019s hand before sending her off to school. And I wrote her name on mine. But it didn\u2019t come close to the image of God engraving us on his hands. Peter Wade writes, \u201cWe are not chalked on God\u2019s hands, nor painted on; we are graven. If we were chalked or painted on His hands, He could wash His hands of us. If we are graven on His hands, however, as a sculptor engraves a name in granite, then we are literally on His hands forever.\u201d What amazing, illimitable love. Rhema knows my name. And her father\u2019s name and sister\u2019s name. Of course, she knows. But I\u2019m slowly realizing that my\u00a0worth is not in the name \u2013 what I am called or even if I\u2019m called at all. Mess that I am, God  knows  and remembers  me . Therein rests my value. \u201cI have graven thee\u2026 The name is there, but that is not all: \u201cI have graven thee.\u201d See the fulness of this! I have graven thy person, thine image, thy case, thy circumstances, thy sins, thy temptations, thy weaknesses, thy wants, thy works; I have graven thee, everything about thee, all that concerns thee; I have put thee altogether there.\u201d \u2013 Charles Spurgeon \n \u00a0 Note: Last week  Elaine  felt the need to send a book to me, and I received it in the mail yesterday.

Go to the laundry room and grab as many towels as you can find.\u201d I talked very slowly, very firmly like I was giving very important instructions. She said o.k. and was off. Ten minutes passed. \u201cHope! Bring Mommy some towels! I need you to bring towels!!!\u201d A few more minutes passed and then Hope re-appeared, dangling two pieces of tissue. (We re-enacted the scene just for you). At that point I decided to leave the flood and shut off the thermostat. In time, the water temp cooled to the point where I could put the cap on without burning my hand. The plumber arrived, but by then he was no longer needed. Thankfully, the damage was contained to the dining room, and it really wasn\u2019t bad at all.\u00a0I\u2019ll just be saying goodbye to the area rug. After the plumber left, I took a minute to catch my breath. There was a lot of cleaning up to do. It was only 10 am, and I already looked like I had been through a car wash. But I was relieved the water had stopped. I looked at Hope standing at a distance; she seemed timid, which is uncharacteristic of her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mommy,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOh, baby. It\u2019s o.k. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d I walked over and scooped her up in my arms. Then I realized why she was sorry. She had peed in her pants. \u201cI\u2019m wet just like you, Mommy!\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/just-call-me-noah/", "title": "Just Call Me\u00a0Noah"},
{"date": "October 8, 2009", "body": "I once walked by Rhema\u2019s little classroom and observed her teacher using edibles as a reinforcer. The motivator of choice was pretzel sticks, broken into tiny pieces. Every time Rhema gave good eye contact or imitated her teacher\u2019s nonverbal action (clapping her hands), she was rewarded with one tiny piece of pretzel. Many of our kids learn the concept of \u201cearning it\u201d early on \u2013 from mini-marshmallows\u00a0to token boards, they know how\u00a0to work for their reward.\u00a0 At times Rhema\u00a0has tried\u00a0to grab the pretzel out of turn. Her teacher has responded, \u201cNo, honey. You have to earn this.\u201d That phrase\u00a0reminded me\u00a0of the movie  Saving Private Ryan . I\u2019m not into war flicks (particularly right about now), but I\u2019ll never forget the closing scene of that movie. A small company of soldiers are tasked with finding Private Ryan and bringing him safely home. Ryan has already lost\u00a0three brothers in the war (WWII), and the Army has decided to rescue him as he is the last remaining son. Private Ryan is played by the adorable Matt Damon. Now don\u2019t you think he looks just like  my  soldier??? \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Not so much? Oh well. A girl can dream. Anyway, at the end of the of the film, most of the company are killed while trying to save Ryan\u2019s life. As the commander is dying (played by Tom Hanks) he whispers to Ryan, \u201cJames\u2026 earn this. Earn it.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful scene, and the whole movie contemplates, W hat is the value of one person\u2019s life?  Ryan seems to struggle with\u00a0that question\u00a0the rest of his life. How could he possibly \u201cearn it\u201d, that is, the sacrifice of 6 men giving their lives in exchange for his? We get it in\u00a0our heads that\u00a0we must earn everything \u2013 friendship, acceptance, value. As I\u2019ve blogged about before, I have been the somewhat reluctant recipient of many gifts lately. They have come in the form of encouraging words, prayers; people spending time with me and my girls, bringing us meals, helping me with the laundry\u2026 and the latest\u2026 gifting me with a rug to replace the one damaged in my\u00a0 radiator-flood-catastrophe . One of the hardest things about receiving all of this is that I did nothing to earn it. It\u2019s just people being plain good to me \u2013 no strings attached, no expectation of recognition or reward. It\u2019s like\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0getting to eat the whole pretzel, and I didn\u2019t\u00a0do anything\u00a0for it! For me, again I\u2019m brought back to the truth\u00a0of God\u2019s saving work. We did nothing to deserve His gracious gift, nothing to earn His great sacrifice for us. And yet, indeed He was willing to\u00a0die that we might live.\u00a0He judged\u00a0our lives so worthy that He would\u00a0sacrifice of His own. Not because of anything we have done, but simply because He loves us\u2026 incredibly.

I cannot imagine that there will ever be a post here as good and meaningful as this one. So here\u2019s a recap, \nRhema is a 5 \u00bd years old with autism, aphasia, and a seizure disorder \u2013 all of which make it extremely difficult\u2026 no, nearly impossible for her to speak and understand language. When last tested, Rhema had the expressive and receptive language of a 12-month old. For years I wondered how/why God would give us a daughter named Rhema \u2013 a name that means the \u201c spoken word \u201d \u2013 that could not, would not speak. Now I know that it was, as my twin would say, the perfect setup. The perfect setup for God to do something amazing with The Word. Readers of this blog know that I have quoted\u00a0a verse to\u00a0Rhema every night since she was a baby. It never seemed like she was  listening . But she was. Recently she began saying parts of the verse on her own. Of all the countless hours of language-based therapy she has received, no one taught her this\u2026 This Word is in her heart, and now, it\u2019s in her mouth. Over the past year of blogging I have been blessed and surprised at the care and interest people have shown toward Rhema and our family. Many have cheered the ups and endured the downs with us for over a year now. Many have prayed for Rhema. Come and listen to what the Lord has done. \u201cThe  word  is near you; it is in your  mouth  and in your  heart , that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your  mouth , \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your  heart  that God raised him from the  dead , you will be  saved .\u201d (Rom. 10:8,9) I want to tell everyone I know that God is the  Speech Maker .

{"date": "November 9, 2009", "body": "Update: Rhema is sick with the flu. EEG cancelled! Rhema will have a sleep deprived EEG\u00a0Tuesday morning. That means I have to keep her up all night tonight and then drive her into Boston for her EEG, during which time they expect her to sleep. A couple years ago when Rhema did her first  BEAM  study at Children\u2019s Hospital, a technician sat us down and told us everything that would happen. It was 12:30 in the afternoon when he explained that he expected Rhema to sleep during the 4-hour study. Brandon and I stared at him for a moment and then, as politely as we could, laughed in his face. \u201cOh, she won\u2019t sleep.\u201d \n\u201cOh, yes she will.\u201d \n\u201cOh, no she won\u2019t.\u201d He explained that he had been doing this for a billion years and was a master at getting the kids to sleep during the test. He said that once the leads are on, he lays the child down with mom or dad, turns down the lights, turns on music or a video, and the kid  always  sleeps. We bet him a pizza our kid would not. Needless to say, I have a handful of reports from BEAMs and EEGs performed over the past couple years that say, \u201cUnfortunately, we could not achieve sleep.\u201d In fairness to our BEAM friend, I must\u00a0admit that one particular day, Rhema was off her game and did actually sleep for a few minutes. She was quite disgusted with herself when she woke up. But back to this week\u2019s sleep deprived EEG. I called the kind folks over at Children\u2019s and explained that Rhema is quite used to being up all night and then going through a full day of school (including an hour long bus ride each way) and after-school therapy without so much as a yawn. It would be better to do the standard 24- or 48- hour EEG in the hospital \u2013 this is what we usually do \u2013 because she will sleep at some point in that\u00a0period of time. But the epilepsy floor is currently filled and we\u2019d have to wait several more weeks for a bed to free up. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m just worried she won\u2019t sleep for the EEG Tuesday morning.\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try our best,\u201d the woman on the phone said. So there it is. All-nighter tonight. EEG in the morn. As my blogging buddy  Tiredmama  would say,  To sleep or not to sleep , that is the question. (We actually really need her to sleep during the EEG, so that her doctor can determine whether\u00a0her anti-seizure med\u00a0is still working. Ideally, those beautiful brown eyes will close once the 32nd electrode is glued to her scalp.) Anyone wanna bet me a pizza?

{"date": "November 16, 2009", "body": "From the moment she wakes, she is making sounds. High and low, up and down,\u00a0soft and loud and soft. She sings and hums, she babbles repetitively; sounds that cannot accurately be represented through typed letters. It is, as one woman put, incessant. During the day, it becomes background music. At bedtime, it can be annoying. But I am most aware of it when we are in public. Once, I was told that she was \u201cdistracting the other children.\u201d But there is no stopping it. There is no silencing her. Her vocalizations were once hurtful, indicating an altered brain, and the fact that I, her own mother, had no idea if she was speaking words I should recognize or if she was just making noise. In the past, I clumped all of her \u201cnoises\u201d in the category of vocal stimming. Recently, I\u2019ve started seeing it as one of her languages, her primary language. (Hope was actually the first one to help me see it as a language \u2013 she used to mimic Rhema\u2019s sounds back to her. And then I watched  Amanda Baggs \u2018 profound video, and it forever changed my thinking about communication.) It occurred to me that while it is so important to me that she learn to speak and understand my language (and I am so appreciative when she does), it\u2019s just as important that I learn hers. So I\u2019ve been practicing when she\u2019s asleep or at school, trying to say things the way she says them and when she says them. When I sing a string to her, she doesn\u2019t always look me in the eye, but she grins a soft grin. Sometimes she repeats it back to me. Sometimes she just giggles. As I wrote in  Song Without Words , I realize that I don\u2019t have to know the meanings of the words in her language. Often she is prompted to repeat words in my language whether she understands the meaning or not. The hope is that she will understand the meaning in time. Perhaps I will understand the meaning of  her  words in time. Sometimes she is so busy talking in her language, she does not listen well\u2026 to me or to her teachers. She has to be shushed to hear what we are saying. Sometimes I am so busy talking in my language, I do not listen well. I have to be shushed to hear what she is saying. But when I hear it,  really  hear it, I feel like the most blessed mother of all,\u00a0because her lovely\u00a0chorus fills my days. Here\u2019s a sample of my daughter\u2019s beautiful song, her voice, her language. It\u2019s called \u201cI Want Rice.\u201d \u201cMy language is not about designing words or even visual symbols for people to interpret.

{"date": "November 18, 2009", "body": "Rhema had a 24-hour ambulatory EEG last week instead of a sleep deprived EEG. (That means we all got to sleep \u2013 Woohoo!) I took her to the hospital on Thursday to get the leads put on, we came home, she  slept,  and then we went back to the hospital the next day. It\u2019s usually the husband\u2019s job to go with\u00a0her when she gets her leads on. The whole process is usually torture for everyone, including the technician. Rhema is incredibly strong, and in the past it\u2019s taken at least 2 adults to hold her down. This time around I wondered how I was going to hold her all by myself. But the technician didn\u2019t waste time; she promptly brought out the straight jacket. (I\u2019m sure it has a more PC name, but I don\u2019t know what it is.) \u00a0 Rhema still managed to put up a fight from the neck up, moving her head back and forth as fast as she could. That\u2019s my girl! First her head had to be measured and marked. This took an excruciatingly long time, and as I stroked her cheek, Rhema tried to calm herself. She whimpered and babbled and hummed. At one point, she even chuckled. And I couldn\u2019t help it, I kissed her face a million times. Then it was time to glue the leads on. This is worst part. The\u00a0adhesive gel\u00a0is cold and smelly, and\u00a0Rhema is usually terrified of the small\u00a0suction tool\u00a0that is used to dry the gel and guaze on her head. The technician turned on the\u00a0suction thingy\u00a0and its hiss filled the room. Rhema stopped humming. \u201cUh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh,\u201d she sang. Even though I knew she was frightened, I loved the appropriateness of her language. I thought it was adorable, and she seemed to get over her fear quickly. After\u00a0one side of her head was done, I could tell that she was getting restless and frustrated. \u201cHuht, huht, huht, huht.\u201d She kept saying over and over. Hat? I wondered. Is she saying hat? She looked me in the eye, straight on, and repeated, \u201cHuht.\u201d Then I knew. Hurt.  She\u2019s saying it hurts. It just blew me away. Spontaneous and unprompted, she found a way to tell me what she was feeling. I\u2019ve never taught her that word before, never really had a way to make her understand a non-tangible\u00a0idea like \u2018hurt.\u2019 EEG\u2019s are\u00a0said to be\u00a0pain-free\u2026 uncomfortable, but pain-free. But my girl said it hurt, and\u00a0of course, Mommy wanted to take the hurt away. Tear off that straight jacket, pick my baby up and walk out of there. But the EEG\u00a0was necessary. And honestly, I was too excited over the fact that\u00a0 she actually told me it hurt! Later, I doubted the whole thing. Did that really happen or did I just imagine it? The next day, my friend Kristin\u00a0came with us to\u00a0the hospital and she went into the room with Rhema to get the leads removed while I stayed with Hope.

When he does call, the connection is bad \u2013 there\u2019s a delay, and so it seems like we\u2019re talking over each other and most of the time I cannot hear what he\u2019s saying. And of course the calls are never long enough \u2013 we talk the big issues fast: How are the girls? \u2013 Fine, How are you? How are you?\u00a0\u2013 Fine, Fine, Where are you?  Where?  Did you send a check to so and so? \u2026 Hello? Then the call drops and there\u2019s silence. I don\u2019t mention that Hope\u2019s getting really tall. That she prays for her  Angel Cake  everyday. That she\u2019s talking back  a lot  and I\u2019ve got to deal with that and it\u2019s totally new because I\u2019ve never had a child talk back before. That sometimes I just will not do, she just wants her Daddy, and she tells me so. That she is a huge help to me. That she has an incredible memory. That she wants to play the violin\u2026 so we better start saving our pennies. That I told her I don\u2019t want her to grow up and turn three years old in 13 days.\u00a0That she put a patronizing hand on my shoulder and said firmly, \u201cSorry, Orange Blossom. I\u2019ve got to.\u201d I don\u2019t mention that Rhema is really beautiful. (He already knows that. But  every day I think,  Wow, she\u2019s beautiful .) That she\u2019s  not sleeping again. That the EEG results are in, and I had to wait all weekend for the doctor to call. That I worry about her relationship with her sister. That she accidentally ate an artichoke!!! That I wonder if she wonders about him and where he is. That she managed to  escape  again (but don\u2019t worry, I found her). That the other day her teacher said she repeated, \u201cHope\u201d, \u201cMom\u201d, \u201cDad\u201d when looking at our pictures.

That I do get lonely sometimes. And overwhelmed. That I\u2019ve got really,  really \u00a0good friends. That one of our favorite old restaurants opened up in the next town over. That we\u2019ve got our routine, our pattern, things are just fine. That God is  so good!  That I wear his old Army T-shirts and sweats to keep him close. * Every now and then we get to video chat (using Skype). We\u2019ve only been able to do it a couple times since Brandon\u2019s been traveling in northern Iraq. Before he left,\u00a0he took\u00a0with him an extra webcam that  Jenn  sent us. It has been extremely important in helping us\u00a0stay connected. (Thank you,  Jenn !) I thought that the video chat would be great for Rhema, especially since she does not do well with phones. It was initially disappointing \u2013 when Brandon would skype with us, I could not get Rhema to even look at the screen and see him. (Darn, we sure could use some  joint attention !) He would call her name over and over, and I would try to get her to look, \u201cRhema! It\u2019s Daddy.\u201d She would not look, she\u2019d just run away. The last several times we got to Skype, I closed Rhema in the room. Even though she was bouncing around, never staying still long enough to attend to the computer screen, I told Brandon just to talk to her. \u201cAt least she\u2019ll hear your voice,\u201d I said.

If she\u2019s really thirsty, she\u2019ll carefully take a few sips. And then all of a sudden, she\u2019ll bolt from the table, run for the bathroom as if life depended on it, and dump the contents of her cup into the toilet bowl. Then she\u2019ll calmly return to the table. It was so insanely busy this past weekend that I couldn\u2019t find time to use the bathroom. (Been there?) Rhema seems to require  more  than constant supervision lately, and I\u00a0thought it would be risky to stop and \u201cgo potty.\u201d So I just opted to hold it for as long as I could. By late afternoon, my bladder was ready to betray me. The girls were at the table eating a snack\u00a0and seemed content. Ahhh, my chance?!

{"date": "September 6, 2009", "body": "If you read this, Mom, sorry again for the unladylikeness of this post. Brace yourselves. I have another bathroom adventure to share. The main toilet in the downstairs bathroom had been running all day. It\u2019s an OOOOLLLLDDDD toilet with a European-style \u201cpush button\u201d flusher. (Honestly, this little old toilet was one of the main things that attracted me to the house we currently live in \u2013 it reminded me of Germany). So after reading  \u201cHow Toilets Work\u201d  on the Internet, I put on my Mrs. Fix-it hat and set to work. Hope was in bed, and Rhema was in the kitchen having a late night snack. I took off the tank cover and inspected the guts of the toilet. Ew. I curiously lifted the floater ball thingy by the metal arm, thinking that action alone might solve my problem. But I must have lifted the arm too high because the whole durn thing snapped off in my hand! Water sprayed everywhere, and I screamed (again). It was like someone was beaming me with a Super Soaker. Water was spraying everywhere, and I couldn\u2019t stop it. Every time I tried to stop it, I would get sprayed in the face. And I just had a real problem with getting sprayed in the face with toilet water. Was it not enough to have been  doused with milk  last week? Rhema appeared and began squealing and dancing around on her toes in the bathroom.  Woohoo, a full-blast water sprinkler in the house! \u201cNo Rhema, noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!\u201d I managed to push her out of the bathroom (getting soaked in the process.) Then I closed the door and locked it. The risk of leaving her unattended for a few minutes while I tried to stop the water was a risk I was going to have to take. I figured out that if I held my fingers over the metal thingamajig in the toilet, the water would stop spraying. But if I lifted my fingers \u2013 let the pressure off \u2013 even just a bit the water would spray. By this time, we already had a nice little flood going. So I stood there with my fingers over the thingamajig for a good 15 minutes, eloquently pleading to the God of heaven and earth to give me a clue. \u201cGod,whatdoIdo. WhatdoIdo. WhatdoIdo. Idon\u2019tknowwhattodo.\u201d I looked around to see if there was anything heavy within my reach that I could use to hold down the thingamajig. The box of wipes on the floor was not heavy enough. \nThen I saw my cell phone on the bathroom counter. Called Brandon. No. Answer. Called my dad.  Thank God I can call my dad.  I had just called him a few days earlier to help me fix a broken bed. (Yes, Rhema decided to  break  her bed this week). \u201cUm Dddaaddy? How do I turn off the potty?\u201d I was a tad hysterical. \u201cSweetie, just turn the valve off at the base of the toilet,\u201d he said calmy. Oh. The first time I turned the valve the wrong way and got even more water. The second time I turned it the right way until the water finally shut off. I thanked everybody \u2013 my dad, the Lord, the toilet \u2013 which is now\u00a0\u201cout of service\u201d \u2013 for shutting off. How do you spell r-e-l-i-e-f?

{"date": "September 8, 2009", "body": "The past couple weeks have been a busy blur. And this is a sloppy post. I just felt like documenting some of the many ways people have blessed our lives since Brandon\u2019s departure. Not a day goes by that someone doesn\u2019t call, e-mail or show up on my doorstep offering to help. The funny thing is I spent months trying to get respire care to no avail. Now I have so much assistance, people actually have to  take turns  helping. (God is awesome!) I\u2019m so not good at asking for help. I would rather suffer alone and play the martyr than to admit that I might need someone\u2019s assistance. I\u2019ve realized my own pride in this \u2013 receiving can be very humbling. Lately, I\u2019ve been getting a crash course in humility: Friends set up the above display at church. There were sign up sheets for people to help in ways I had not even thought of. I was shocked when I saw it. I wanted to tear it down and take pictures of it at the same time! People have walked with Rhema at the mall (and gone up and down the escalators ad nauseum), they have cared for her so that I could attend church, they have entertained Hope, they have kept me company. A precious family has been accompanying us to the pool on Sunday afternoons. Going to the pool was a \u201cDaddy thing.\u201d And every time we go, the girls and I really miss him. But this family has a way of taking away the sting. I cannot put into words what it does to me to watch them love my girls. They actually  thanked us  for letting them be a part of our lives. I don\u2019t know what to do with love and kindness like that. And then, on one particularly rough day last week, a surprise package came in the mail, addressed to Rhema: Bubble bath. Lots and lots of bubble bath\u00a0\u2013 and even bubble wrap! (Remember this  post ?). A dear friend intended for me to laugh out loud when I opened that box. (Thank you, MB, mission accomplished and then some!). \u00a0 All of this has made me think about God \u2013 the giver of all good gifts. What makes it so hard for us to receive Him? To just believe that He  loves  us and desires to bless us. Maybe it\u2019s a pride thing. Things\u00a0can be\u00a0falling apart all around, but it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m o.k. I got this. I don\u2019t need You.\u2019 I\u2019m realizing just how \u201cneedy\u201d I am. Yes, I\u2019ve got autism, allergies, asthma, seizures\u00a0and MS in my family. Yes, I\u2019ve got a husband deployed and a broken toilet and a vehicle that needs new tire rods (what the heck are those?). But even if everything in my life was smooth as butter,  I would still desperately need God\u00a0more than I need air. \u00a0 Recognizing that need has helped me to receive the the Best Help; to accept the ultimate gift of grace. ( For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. Eph. 2:8\u2026 Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift! 2 Cor. 9:15 ). \u00a0 At first glance it may seem\u00a0like we\u2019ve got it tough right now. But we are living in  abundance .\u00a0Blessing upon blessing has come our way. \u00a0 There is a certain pride in man that will give and give, but to come and accept is another thing. I will give myself in consecration, I will do anything, but do not humiliate me to the level of the most hell-deserving sinner and tell me that all I have to do is to accept the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ. \n We have to realize that we cannot earn or win anything from God; we must either receive it as a gift or do without it. The greatest blessing spiritually is the knowledge that we are destitute; until we get there Our Lord is powerless. He can do nothing for us if we think we are sufficient of ourselves; we have to enter into His Kingdom through the door of destitution. As long as we are rich, possessed of anything in the way of pride or independence, God cannot do anything for us. It is only when we get hungry spiritually that we receive\u2026 \n\u2014Oswald Chambers, My Utmost For His Highest ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/good-gifts/", "title": "Good Gifts"},
{"date": "August 12, 2008", "body": "Happens almost daily at our house. It\u2019s the phenomenon coined by an Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, in which we destroy the old structure to create something new.  A Biblical metaphor for creative destruction is the clay in the potter\u2019s hand.  The potter mars the clay on the wheel, and a new vessel is fashioned.  Another image is the seed that dies in the earth so that a fruit-bearing plant can burst forth. On Saturday, during her home ABA therapy visit, Rhema was working on an animal puzzle.  She suddenly decided that she did not like the zebra piece and no longer wanted to play with the puzzle.  When instructed to continue with the puzzle, she launched into major meltdown mode.  Hit the floor.  Kicked and screamed.  And kicked and screamed.  Shoes, clothes, puzzle pieces, chairs went a-flying. (Rhema often conveys the sense of distress and mourning of people in Bible times who would rent their clothes when they received bad news, for invariably during a tantrum, Rhema gets naked.)     T (her therapist) and I tried to wait her out and see if she would calm down, but the tantrum escalated to a point where I was unable to even get her clothes back on.  Brandon came into the room, lifted her off the floor, into the air, and spoke to her.  Somewhere, somehow she heard him and as he put her in her seat, she calmed.  T gently guided her to clean up the mess she\u2019d made, and she completed the puzzle.  When T held up an animal and asked Rhema what is was, we were surprised (that\u2019s putting it mildly) when she clearly said,  \u201cCow\u2026Mooooooo.\u201d     The great thing about creative destruction is that it always grants the ability to innovate.   Daily, Rhema has to resist the part of her that would rather escape into a screaming fit or some other unreachable place.  Sometimes when someone calls her name, I can literally see the battle in her head.  It takes a lot of willpower for her to turn around, look you in the eye, and give you her attention.   When our children calmly adjust to a change in the order or routine\u2026when they tolerate an unfavorable color or texture of food, when they choose to do something they do not want to do\u2026 when they figure out how to focus and complete a task even though the sensory system is bombarded with distractions, they are practicing creative destruction.  Killing the old way \u2013 the safe and familiar way \u2013 with a new way.   Brave kids. I cannot resist but mention Rhema\u2019s countless, literal displays of \u201ccreative destruction\u201d such as the  Slip N\u2019 Slide  or the  Poop Art  that still occurs more than I would like.  Or, say, her body art \u2013 diaper rash cream in geometrical swirls from head to toe. Then there are those days when I pick her up from Sunday School, and the teachers hand out all of the art projects to parents. They come to me empty handed, with a shrug and a smile, \u201cRhema made a \u2018Jesus Loves Me Necklace\u2019, but then she ripped it up into tiny pieces.  So we made another one with her\u2026 but\u2026 she ate that one.\u201d  We always have a good laugh. Parents of special needs children go through a changing process as well.  In many ways, you become a new, different person capable of things you never imagined.  When your child is diagnosed with a disability, you learn about- \nHumility \nEmpathy \nThankfulness \nHow to rejoice in little things, taking nothing for granted \nHow to be strong when you think all strength is gone \nHow to pray \nHow to stand up under discouragement and sometimes, despair \nHow to give, love, fight, trust and hope against hope We have Rhema to thank for that.  There\u2019s a line from a Sara Groves song:  \u201cThe places that used to fit me cannot hold the things I\u2019ve learned.\u201d   The old me would not recognize the new me.  My dearest friend Cha told me that she believed that God was going to chip away at our family until there was nothing but beauty left.   I think\u2026 I hope we are being re-molded and re-shaped into the people God wants us to be. Because the process of creative destruction in our lives is not always pretty.  Hang out with us for a weekend and you will see that we lose some battles!  We wrestle.  We resist the new, and cling to the old.  We wonder what in the world God is doing.  But the Potter is faithful, and somehow we remain a work of art in His hands.   \n The ultimate creative destruction is found in  2 Cor. 5:17 .  Please ask me about it.

His disciples asked him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\u201d \n\u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cbut this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.\u201d John 9:1-3 When Rhema was\u00a02.5 years old, she was diagnosed with a rare epilepsy. (An official autism diagnosis had come a few months earlier). After the shock wore off, I actually felt a little excited. It seemed that we had found the true culprit in the  LKS .  This  was the reason she wasn\u2019t speaking. Her doctor believed that if we could control the epilepsy with drugs, she would acquire language. (What he failed to mention is that LKS is notoriously hard to treat). He even suggested that she did not have\u00a0autism \u2013 that the aphasia and all the behaviors we were seeing were in fact the result of the seizure disorder. I dared to believe him. I let myself believe that\u00a0she just might\u00a0be cured by\u00a0a magic anti-seizure pill. We called family and friends to share the good-bad news. I sent out a prayer alert to people I hadn\u2019t spoken to in years. I was so hopeful. I had dreams of conversations she, my oldest girl, and I would share. It was hard to imagine, but I envisioned her present,  with  me, those gorgeous eyes gazing into mine. I imagined the clever things she\u2019d say. I imagined learning all about her, her personality, her likes and dislikes. Weeks later, Brandon and I were watching the news on TV. A story came on about an autism school in Massachusetts. Oddly enough, the\u00a0three students profiled in the story all had seizure disorders. As I watched the children intently, I realized then that my Rhema would fall into the \u201cseverely impacted\u201d and \u201clow-functioning\u201d category. I suddenly realized that we would struggle for a long time. I choked out, \u201cThis seizure diagnosis doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t have autism. It just means that she has  really bad autism .\u201d I wept. That moment, that realization was far more painful for me than when I first heard the words, \u201cYour daughter has autism.\u201d I rarely cry openly, and so when I do, it tends to alarm my dear husband. I\u2019m not even sure he understood my blubbering through my tears. But I remember him saying, \u201cLet\u2019s pray.\u201d And I remember us sitting together on our old futon beseeching the God of heaven to heal our\u00a0precious girl. We did not ask for comfort or strength; we just desperately needed her to get better. \u00a0 That was three years ago. Knowing what I know now\u2026\u00a0if I could go back to heartbroken me on the futon that night, I would say- ~You\u2019re right, you will struggle for a long time. But this struggle will force you to the One who is sovereign. ~You\u2019re right, you will see miracles. ~But not always like you think. Instead, they will be  more significant ,  more amazing  than you could ever imagine. ~Your days as her mother will be the greatest and hardest days of your life. ~Don\u2019t be afraid to follow your instincts, your gut, no matter what doctors or teachers say. ~You will learn to trust and  enjoy God , even when your prayers go unanswered\u2026 when your circumstances don\u2019t change. That, my dear, is the beautiful faith. ~You  will  be \u201clow-functioning\u201d at times; and it will crush you over and over again, but will keep you humble. ~You  will  be \u201cseverely impacted\u201d by autism and by a God who teaches you to listen with your heart. ~Her life will be like a song, a sweet devotion\u2026 ~Words will come, words will go.

Talk about learning to trust God with my children\u2026 Hope had allergic reactions to my breastmilk Every time I leave her in the care of others, prayers are whispered that she will be safe. Last week, I got a call from her nursery school:  \u201cWe were tracing letters of the alphabet in flour and\u2026.\u201d  Ugh, I already knew what was coming.

She has learned to be very careful, to question foods that are unfamiliar. When asked, she can list \u2018nuts, eggs, dairy, wheat, soy and sometimes corn\u2019 as the foods she\u2019s allergic to. So I was surprised to hear that she had eaten a chicken nugget without hesitation. When I got to the school to pick her up, my friend Dawn told me that Hope has the same lunch bag as another child\u2019s. Their bags got mixed up and Hope ended up eating the nugget. I understood the mix-up, but was still confused. When I saw Hope, I asked her what happened. (At this point she\u2019d already received a good dose of Benadryl and was doing fine. Thankfully there was nothing in the nugget that would cause anaphylaxis.) She said sadly, \u201cI thought it was my surprise. I thought I wasn\u2019t allergic anymore.\u201d Oh. On school days, I always pack a \u201csurprise\u201d in her lunch. She is such a good sport. I learn a lesson from her every time I watch her at a birthday party.

As Rhema hit her milestones early or on time I actually thought I had something to do with it.  I thought it must be the good mothering, and all those good genes I had passed onto her.  I assumed she would be reading Shakespeare by age two.  It wasn\u2019t until 15 months of age, when she suddenly started falling behind, did I remember that I had very little control. After her diagnosis, I would mentally enter my child into \u201craces\u201d with, oh, say, the neighbor\u2019s baby.  (!)  If Rhema starts talking before Susie does, then we\u2019ll be o.k. , I\u2019d think.  Then I would chide myself: now you\u2019re racing against a newborn???   The competition got turned on it\u2019s head when Rhema\u2019s little sister was born and then surpassed Rhema\u2019s language abilities in a matter of twelve months.  We were relieved and thrilled when Hope began talking.  It has been the most bittersweet thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. I was talking to my friend Carrie who has a beautiful little girl with PDD about competition and comparisons one day and she said, \u201cYou know, I think I grew up in the overachieving town that  invented  the \u201cMy Kid Is An Honor Student\u201d bumper stickers. It would have been easy for me to get caught up in all that, but thankfully, God took that away from me.\u201d  It was simple, and yet profound for me to see that she was completely at peace with the race her family had been marked to run. Along with God showing me how prideful I can be, He\u2019s been teaching me a lesson about running races.  In highschool, I ran track.  I was a sprinter; definitely not a long distance runner.  Any thing over one lap around the track would guarantee me hyperventilating, losing my form, and eventually quitting.   I now know that Rhema\u2019s race, our race, is not a sprint; we have to learn to go the distance.  We have always focused on the speed of her progress; only now are we learning to treasure the slow and steady gains.  Endurance, patience, consistency are exhausting words to me, but no doubt some of the words used by successful athletes. I am also learning that the victory of one does not have to mean the loss of others.  Each one has their own race to run.  Victories can come along the way.   And so, we cheer each other on (thanks family, friends, teachers, therapists and fellow bloggers!).  And we run, sometimes like the hare, mostly like the tortoise, but still in the race. Let us run with patience the race that is set before us  \u2013 Heb 12:1 By the way, I found the perfect Olympic sport for Rhema:  Trampoline ! \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://search.barnesandnoble.com/News-from-the-Border/Jane-Taylor-McDonnell/e/9780395605745", "http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=GT", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/tramp1.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/amazing-race/", "title": "Amazing Race"},

While waiting for my mother to pick me up from school, I decided to run across an open field of snow that was knee-high. I lost one of my beautiful brown boots in the snow and got in big trouble with my mom. My teardrops fell on my shirt, and I\u00a0noticed that I was wearing blue and it was Wednesday. Since then I have never worn blue on Wednesdays. 2.  I am mold-averse.  I will not eat bread or any other baked good (cakes, cookies, etc.) that is older than 2 days. Even though you may not  see  the mold, believe me, it is there. I also will not drink milk if it\u2019s within 5 days of expiration. I check expiration dates like a maniac. 3.  I keep dead flowers in my house.  I am too busy (or lazy) to water the flowers and too busy (or lazy) to throw them out after they die. O.k., o.k., maybe this is not a quirk. But the dead flowers remind me of Miss Havisham\u2019s house in Great Expectations.\u00a0\u00a0 4.

{"date": "August 27, 2008", "body": "\u201cMy love is like to toilet paper \nNo doubt there is much to unroll, \nbut I fear it is flimsy, \nFalling apart in ones hands.\u201d \n-Brian Jones In the morning, I realized that we were out of toilet paper. (I won\u2019t go into why we were out of toilet paper, but it may have to do with my offspring\u2019s habit of dropping whole rolls into the toilet bowl). So Hope and I decided to take a walk to the store to buy some more TP. \u201cLet\u2019s use your stroller,\u201d I said to Hope grabbing the smallest stroller we have. That was Mistake #1. After our hike up to the store I loaded Hope into the shopping cart. I folded our little umbrella stroller and put it in the cart as well. After some deliberation, we got our toilet paper. I decided to go with Scott Toilet Tissue because\u2026 well\u2026 sometimes\u00a0a girl\u00a0just needs her\u00a0TP to be lint-free. (Some of you know what I mean.) That was Mistake #2. We walked out of the store, and as I was reassembling the stroller, it dawned on me that I had a bulky 20-roll pack of Scott 1000 tissue to lug home along with two boxes of Mike and Ike\u2019s candy! Dumb. Dumb and dumber. And upon realization of the situation, my first silly thought was:  Oh no! Now people are going to know that we buy cheap toilet paper! \u201cUh\u2026 Hope baby. I know! How about we push the toilet paper in the stroller (if I can get it to fit)? Wanna push?\u201d \u201cO.K.!\u201d I knew it was going to be a looooong walk home \u2013 down busy streets, over the railroad tracks, across a crosswalk. As we trudged home, Hope, who was really too short to reach the stroller handles, would happily \u201cdump\u201d our 20-pack of TP at the most inconvenient times. At one point she got tired of walking and declared that it was time for her to \u201csit down.\u201d I knew that she was going to get tired, but I was hoping we would be closer to home at that point. Not the case. So I put her in the stroller and tried to hold the TP pack (and my Mike and Ike\u2019s) with one hand against my hip while steering the stroller with the other hand. This was not an easy task on a narrow sidewalk. As we lumbered along I realized that the flimsy plastic packaging of my 20 rolls of TP was ripping. Perhaps because it was cheap, perhaps because it had already been dumped by Hope a number of times, but suddenly the packaging gave way and rolls of toilet paper rolled out into the busy street in a bunch of different directions. I had a vision of Rhema merrily chasing a TP roll into the street, only to rip it into shreds and toss the paper fragments into the air with a \u201cWheee!\u201d But thankfully, she was at school. And thankfully, each individual roll was wrapped in its own paper. I chased rolls (and cars dodged them), as I tried gathering bunches in my arms. I was sweating in the beaming sun, hot with embarrassment, and I desperately had to \u201cgo potty.\u201d Hope, still in her stroller, thought the whole thing was absolutely hilarious. She squealed and giggled as I would pick up a roll, and it would fall out of my arms. \u201cMommy so funnnnyyy!!!\u201d I managed to collect a few rolls in my arms, but I couldn\u2019t carry the toilet paper  and  push the stroller. So finally I piled as many rolls as I could on the sidewalk and left them there. When Hope and I made it home, we jumped in the van and drove back to where I had left\u00a0my monument of\u00a0toilet paper. Later when I got home I noticed the slogan for Scott toilet tissue: Common sense that rolls. Yeah, right. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/stroller2.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/tp1.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/chasing-toilet-paper/", "title": "Chasing Toilet Paper"},
{"date": "August 31, 2008", "body": "The time has come again for us to go to Children\u2019s Hospital Boston for an overnight EEG for Rhema. This is a very familiar procedure to many of us in the autism community, but for those who are unfamiliar I wanted to briefly explain what is involved. A technician measures and marks your head with a red pencil. Then 32 electrodes are glued to your scalp one at a time; gauze is placed over each electrode with some sort of liquid adhesive and then cold air is blown through a small tube over each electrode. Then the head is wrapped in gauze-like material and a meshy cap is placed over\u00a0the head. The whole process takes about an hour. It is not a painful procedure, although Rhema always leaves with small burns on her forehead and scalp from the electrodes and adhesive. And for a child with sensory issues, the smell of the glue, the noise of the air tube, the sensation of being held down and having your head and face handled can be frightening and overwhelming. However, Rhema has had so many EEGs and BEAMs (Brain Electrical Analysis Mapping) in the past 2 years that she is getting to be an old pro at handling this. At her last  overnight EEG  four months ago, she did not even make a peep while the electrodes were being applied. For 24 hours, Rhema\u2019s brain wave activity is recorded and she is confined to one room. Her room is hooked up with video so that technicians can record anything they see physically and correspond that with what Rhema\u2019s brain is doing. The hardest part is keeping Rhema entertained and distracted from yanking the leads off her head. We try to keep her from jumping off the windowsills or doing back flips off the hospital bed or trying to climb up the metal arm that the TV is attached to. 8) At Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, a study that is often performed on children with autism or a regression in language is the BEAM study. The  BEAM  is essentially an enhanced EEG that uses a lot more electrodes than the standard EEG and also has the ability to \u201cmeasure\u201d auditory processing responses. The man who developed the BEAM is a doctor at Children\u2019s, and although we have never met him, he has written countless reports on Rhema. The reports are full of medical jargon that our neurologist tries to explain to us, but there is always a conclusion section written in \u201cEnglish\u201d so that the average parent can understand. The first sentence in the conclusion section for Rhema\u2019s BEAM studies have always said: \u201cThis is an abnormal study\u2026\u201d After Rhema\u2019s last BEAM, I was really hoping to get a good report because of medication changes, dietary changes and the introduction of supplements.  Instead the conclusion read, \u201cThis is a  very  abnormal study.\u201d After a year and a half on anti-seizure meds, the spiking brain wave activity has only increased. In fact, the report stated that Rhema\u2019s brain was spiking so much that they could not get a normal reading for more than 2 seconds. A  friend  explains spiking like this: \u201cSay you\u2019re sitting reading a book and you have a massive seizure that knocks you off your chair. Your whole brain is not functioning due to the seizure and you no longer can read. With \u201cspiking\u201d it\u2019s different. Again say your sitting reading a book, spiking would be someone consistently poking you in the arm taking your focus off your reading because you\u2019re being irritated by the poking.\u201d In Rhema\u2019s case, her BEAM study showed that the brain spiking is occurring 85 \u2013 100% of the time, and it is occurring on both sides of her brain, most strongly in the speech centers of the brain. There has been some speculation that Rhema may have a variant of  Landau-Kleffner syndrome  as her spiking increases significantly when she is asleep. Phew. If you\u2019re still with me, thanks for reading. The doctor that created the BEAM study is supposed to be the attending physician while we\u2019re in the hospital, so we\u2019re really hoping for the chance to finally meet him and pick his brain (no pun intended)! For those interested,  here  is an interesting article on how EEGs are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool for autism.

{"date": "August 25, 2008", "body": "Our  Poo Art  struggles continue. The victim this time (or should I say the canvas?) was the living room couch and the Oriental rug. The artist herself was covered from head to toe when I discovered her, so after giving her a bath (hosing her down, scrubbing her head), and cleaning the bathroom (b/c everything she touched was soiled), I set out to see what could be done about the couch and rug. For some reason, the ongoing Poo Art episodes are very upsetting for the husband and me. It is not necessarily the fact that our property is being destroyed or that we have to repeatedly clean it up (although this is certainly bad enough), it\u2019s the fact that our beautiful little girl seems oblivious to the messes she\u2019s made. She does not seem to understand or care that she\u2019s covered in filth. This time as I cleaned I was determined not to get (too) upset, so I played music and sang as I cleaned. I decided it was time to purge (no pun intended). The rug must go. We bought it in Germany five years ago, before kids, but now it\u2019s been pooped on, puked on, juice-spilled-on, banana-smushed-on, one too many times! I know that not all of my friends who read this blog are Christians. My faith is the biggest part of me. And as I try to make sense of these struggles, I can only return again and again to the One who has been my faithful God for as long as I can remember. I\u2019m always asking, \u2018So Lord, what are you trying to show me or teach me in all this? How can I know how to live, how to respond, how to breathe in the face of daily disaster?\u2019 With that said, I hope that even if you are not a Christian, you will continue reading. While I was scrubbing the furniture , I thought of a verse in the Bible where David, contrite from the sins of adultery and murder, prays \u201cPurge me with hyssop, and I will be clean.\u201d Ps. 57:7 I did not know exactly what hyssop was so I did some Google-ing and found out that it is a plant that was used in ritual sprinklings and is an analogy for cleansing. Today, hyssop oil is used for disinfecting, therapeutic purposes. In the Old Testament, hyssop was used to brush the blood of the Passover lamb over the Israelite doorposts. Hyssop was also used in the cleansing of a leper. Most significantly, when Jesus was dying on the cross, a stalk of hyssop was lifted to his lips to give him a drink: \u201cAfter this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost\u201d (John 19:28-30) How symbolic, how God-like, that in the ultimate act of redemption and forgiveness of sin \u2013 Christ on the cross \u2013 hyssop was used as an emblem of cleansing and purification. So my conversation with God went like this:  What in the world do I need purged? I\u2019m the innocent victim here faced with a lifetime of scrubbing poo! Then the montage played: my arguments with the husband, my murmuring, my complaining, my jealousy, my lack of patience with people, blaming all of my poor behavior on the fact that I have a child with autism. It hit me like a ton of bricks that the thoughts I had about my daughter really applied to me:  I don\u2019t even understand that I\u2019m covered in filth. Well, I had no hyssop to clean my couch. But I asked for a spiritual dose of hyssop to cleanse my soul\u2026 to purge away the dross\u2026 to prune the undesireable. Every time I get angry because these circumstances don\u2019t change \u2013  she still has autism, she\u2019s still non-verbal, she\u2019s still a Poo-Art painter , I feel a swish-swish of the hyssop plant. Every time I give in to my fears about\u00a0her future \u2013 Who will care for her when I am gone?  Entrust her to me. She is mine.   \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d  Jer 29:11 (NIV) Swish. Every time I allow\u00a0bitterness and resentment to invade my heart when the going gets rough.  \u201cKeep a sharp eye out for weeds of bitter discontent. A thistle or two gone to seed can ruin a whole garden in no time. Heb 12:15 (MSG) Swish, swish. Every time I get impatient with people who do not understand what life is like with a disabled child.  \u201cBe  patient, bearing with one another in love.\u201d  Eph 4:2 Swish. Every time I doubt myself \u2013 God, clearly you picked the wrong parents!  I picked you on purpose. \u201cYou can do all things through me who strengthens you.\u201d\u00a0  Phil. 4:13 Swish. Every time I allow discouragement and self-pity to dictate my actions\u2026  \u201cWait for the LORD;\u00a0be strong and  take  heart.\u201d  Psalms 27:14 \u00a0 Swish, swish. Cleaning me and the couch is a process. We\u2019ve hired professional upholstery cleaners to handle the furniture. I had to chuckle because the upholstery care web site promises to apply a protector \u201cto preserve the color, beauty and life of your upholstery.\u201d I imagine God is giving out the same kind of professional cleaning with the intention of preserving color, beauty and life. 8) \u201c\u2026wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.\u201d Psalms 51:7 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/a-hefty-dose-of-hyssop/", "title": "A Hefty Dose of\u00a0Hyssop"},
{"date": "September 29, 2008", "body": "\u201c\u2026You stoop down to make me great.\u201d Ps. 18:35 My friend mentioned that one of her \u201cmommy habits\u201d is that she always stoops before a child now when talking to him. I had to smile because I do the same thing, and I love it. Before I had children, I barely noticed children. Now every young child I see, I get the urge to kneel before them, look them in the eyes and listen carefully to whatever they want to tell me. The gulf between the speaker and the listener must be bridged for real communication to take place. For Rhema, if there is any hope of eye contact and connection, I must stoop.\u00a0 Standing over her simply will not do.\u00a0 If she is lying on the floor, I get down on the floor.\u00a0 I want her to see me seeing her. I want her to know she has my full attention. I want to gaze into her beautiful eyes and let her know that nothing at that moment is more important than experiencing her. God stoops for us. Really, He does. He may seem like this lofty being who is distant, indifferent and uninvolved. But the Bible paints a different picture, one in which God is intimately involved with us and cares deeply about having a relationship with us. So much so that He, the God of the Universe, would stoop down from the royal heavens to the lowly earth to be near to us. It\u2019s like an elephant crouching down to chat with an ant. Who is like the LORD our God, the One who sits enthroned on high, who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth? Psalms 113:5-6 (NIV) In John 8, a woman who had been caught in adultery was thrown to the ground before Jesus. She was to be stoned for her sins. But instead of accusing her, the Son of God stooped down next to the shamed woman and began writing in the sand. He straightened and said to the crowd, \u201cIf any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d Then He stooped  again  next to the woman and wrote in the sand until all of her accusers had dropped their stones and walked away. Even at our lowest points God loves us enough to stoop. There are examples of God  coming down  to deliver us, to shield us, and to lift us up. ( Exodus 3:7-8 ,  Psalm 40:2 ,  2 Sam. 22:36 , and the ultimate stooping:\u00a0 Phil. 2:5-11 ). But the image I love the most is God stooping to connect with me, to meet me where I am. Sometimes when Brandon comes home in the evening, Rhema will be running circles around the living room. He\u00a0gets on his knees\u00a0with arms wide open, waiting for her to notice him and come to him for a hug. It has taken years of stooping, but now Rhema will pause and come over to give him a high-five and a hug. I imagine that God is stooping in a similar way, waiting for us to stop, acknowledge Him and experience His love\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=2&chapter=3&version=31", "http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%2040;&version=31;", "http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20samuel%2022;&version=31;", "http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philipians%202&version=31"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/09/29/stooping/", "title": "Stooping"},

I suspect that the sounds of the kids, the games, the music, the lights, the smells were too much for her senses. She had trouble organizing all of the stimuli. So as not to become overwhelmed, she chose to focus on one thing \u2013 the coin slots. She spent the whole day at Chuck E. Cheese pushing coins into the slots of the various games and rides, not the least bit interested in playing the games or riding on the little merry-go-round\u2026 she just busied herself by running around and inserting coins into every machine. Poor, innocent kids had their cups of tokens swiped by a 2 year old \u2014 she would help herself to their tokens and interrupt their games just so she could stick a token in the slot. She did not seem to  see  most of Chuck E. Cheese, except for all the coin slots in it. The same was true in other places\u2026 if there was a soda, vending or bubble gum machine, she just had to have a quarter to insert. The items for sale in the machine were of no importance. Thankfully, Rhema plays more appropriately at Chuck E. Cheese now, enoying the rides and slides. Her love for slots continues, and she makes use of all the \u201cslot spots\u201d in our house. Here are some: I have baked many a quarter in this oven: \u00a0 The TV and DVD players are always a great target \u2013 there are so many slots! \u00a0 We\u2019ve shred more than just paper in this shredder: Sometimes when I\u2019m driving, coins will shower down from the car vents above the console: \u00a0 But coins are not the only objects that fit into slots.\u00a0 Rhema would PERISH if she were forced to throw her popsicle sticks in the trash can. No, they MUST be slid into the slot between the couch and the fireplace.\u00a0 (We pushed the couch against the fireplace to keep the kids out of it). The popsicle sticks have jokes printed on them.\u00a0 When I feel like a good laugh, I move the couch and sweep up the sticks.

Drawn to the sun, drawn to the light, we often find her gleefully standing on a sill with her body plastered to the pane. The curtains have been brushed aside (or yanked down) to welcome the full rays of the sun. The bigger the window, the better. Even at the  hospital  a few weeks ago, she spent so much of her time standing in the window. On several occasions I have found her, naked as a jay bird, dancing in the window that happens to overlook a busy street in our town. I can only imagine how many people have seen my strange little girl dancing in the buff to her own internal beat. Her arms raised, her fingers keep rhythm with her toes. Sometimes she tilts her head and squints her eyes as she moves. The light shining on her angel face\u2026 oh, she is serene. As her mother, I admit that I do not always understand my window-dancer. She is mysterious to me in so many ways. And of course, she cannot (or does not) tell me why she does what she does. But I try to guess. I try to imagine the world as she experiences it. To see what she sees, and hear what she hears. Feel what she feels. I imagine that the outdoor sounds come muffled to her ears through the windows. She often tries to hum along. Sometimes she can see her reflection, and it seems like the only time she is comfortable with it. There are window tiles in our house with stained glass colors, and as she bounces up and down on her toes, I surmise that she enjoys watching the outside world blur in shades of blue and mix with bright yellows. The diagnosticians have said that she lacks pretend skills. But I believe that as she peers out the window, she is dreaming of the playgrounds she will escape to, the hills she will climb, the roads she will run, the rocks she will unearth, the grains of sand she will study, the blades of grass she will flap, the crisp air she will breathe. And the feel of the sun\u2019s warmth on the face and body? Who can pass up the pleasure of that hazy, bright glow? For some it saps, for some it invigorates. For her, I believe it is a response to intensity, a total sensory experience\u2026 \u00a0 I had sprinted upstairs to grab something. The weight of the world on my shoulders, it seemed.  Weary.  So much work to do, so little time, no time to think, no time to rest. The sunbeams through the bedroom window slowed me. I stood still for a moment. Oh, why not? So I climbed on a bench beneath the window and allowed myself to bask in the glow. I raised my arms, squinted my eyes, tilted my head, hummed a little hum, and danced the Rhema dance.

It was a cold day, but a glorious event. Brandon could not attend because he had to work (the good old Army), but my twin and her husband came to help me manage my two little walkers. I was heartened and amazed to see so many people come out in support of autism awareness and research. Rhema was amazed, too, by one thing. The inflatable bouncy house. Every time we inched a little closer to the racetrack, the little darling would bolt from the stroller and make a bee line to the bouncy house. We let her jump.\u00a0 We loaded her back in the stroller.\u00a0 She escaped.\u00a0 We let her jump.\u00a0 We loaded her back in the stroller.

I know it\u2019s true. ~Take Rhema\u2019s home ABA therapist.\u00a0She\u00a0knew that Rhema could not play with play-doh because of the gluten it contained, so she went out of her way to find a gluten-free recipe and made play-doh for Rhema out of rice flour.\u00a0 ~Rhema\u2019s teachers at school often put up with tantrums, bites, pinches, scratches, and messes and they LOVE her every minute of the day. ~A thoughtful friend I only recently met at church buys me books on autism\u2026 just to be helpful\u2026 and she calls me and encourages me.\u00a0 ~When our health insurance did not cover a speech therapy visit, our speech therapist told us she\u2019d rather come over for dinner than be paid.\u00a0 ~There are bloggy mamas out there whom I\u2019ve never met in person who continually pray for my Rhema and our family.\u00a0 We are blessed indeed.

{"date": "October 27, 2008", "body": "One of our biggest struggles with Rhema is motivation. She has the physical capability to speak and the ability to complete tasks and the ability to interact. But most of the time she simply does not want to. Many of her therapy programs, namely ABA, have a reward component. You do this, and I\u2019ll give you this. The problem is that Rhema has a very short list of reinforcers. And when we do find something motivating enough to get her to participate or respond, that motivating item is only motivating for so long. An example might be a Dora video. A brand new video will not hold her interest \u2013 because it is novel and unfamiliar. But if we play it enough times, pretty soon it will become familiar and Rhema will begin to watch and enjoy it. Soon, however, the familiar will become too familiar and then she is bored with it and no longer interested. Rhema\u2019s therapists and teachers (God bless them!) have tried a myriad of toys and games to try to teach Rhema, to stimulate learning and language. I have wracked my brain along with them, having brain-storming sessions in my head at night when I should be sleeping. Always asking God,  show me, show me\u2026 how to get through to her.  Rhema\u2019s interest and motivation has to be great enough and last long enough for her to \u201cget\u201d the skill her teachers are trying to teach. When it doesn\u2019t, we must go back to the drawing board. Meanwhile Rhema stagnates, or worse, regresses. That\u2019s where we were a couple weeks ago, and I tell ya, it\u2019s a hard place to be. Every therapy visit from start to finish consisted of Rhema melting down and trying \u201cescape\u201d strategies because she simply had to no desire to participate. One of her therapists seemed ready to pack her bags. At night I hit my knees and mumbled that prayer,  Lord, show me, show me\u2026 how to get through to her.  What do I do? Get more OT? Change the seizure meds? Sell her on eBay? I found the answer at Walmart. For $2.26. A squishy lizard toy. At therapy, I slipped the lizard to T, her therapist.  Use this as a reinforcer. \nSuddenly Rhema sat down in her chair, and T gave her the lizard. (We were at the point where we had to reinforce her for just sitting in the chair.) Rhema LOVED the lizard; she enjoyed squeezing it, flapping its arm, and making \u201croar\u201d sounds! When T took the lizard away, we had our Rhema back. She was ready to work. (Insert Angel Chorus of Hallelujahs.) For the past couple weeks, school and outside therapy have been going\u00a0well. Rhema is engaged and attentive. But most of all, she seems to  want  to learn and participate. She\u2019s actually repeating some words and blowing our minds! We pretended that the toy lizard was sleeping, and T got her to say, \u201cWake up.\u201d Thank God. Thank God for that little lizard! What motivates. Sometimes it truly is the little things. What motivates me to get up early on a Saturday morning and drive her to her quadrillionth speech therapy appointment? What moves me to crush a handful of supplements and meds, and mix them in juice, and draw them up in a dropper, and squirt them down her throat every day twice a day? What compels me to pray every night and day that God would heal her and protect her? What drives me to stay up late reading up on the latest\u00a0research and treatments? Rhema is currently motivated by a squishy lizard. I am motivated by my love for her and a never-ending desire to connect with her, but sometimes it\u2019s little things like this: I\u2019ve noticed lately that she is smiling more.\u00a0 It had been a while. I think God is motivated by little things, too: us. We are little, but His love for us is great: \n \u201cThis is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. John 3:16 \nHe goes to great lengths just to \u201cconnect\u201d with us and have relationship with us, just as we do with our children.

{"date": "October 28, 2008", "body": "\u201cOnce I knew only darkness and stillness\u2026 my life was without past or future\u2026 but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living.\u201d -Helen Keller The inability to effectively communicate is debilitating. This past weekend I attended a conference on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). I was particularly interested in learning how electronic speech output devices are being used to help individuals with autism communicate. It was quite moving to see the story of teenaged girl who had struggled with communication barriers all her life gain, through assistive technology, something so fundamental to life \u2013 the ability to express herself. During the conference, we watched a video of a 9 year-old boy named S. S was non-verbal and severely impacted by autism (and most likely other disorders.) He wore thick glasses, and periodically swayed in his chair. He was seated in front of a table-top bowling game. There were little pins and a matching ball on a tray. S had a team of therapists around him: speech language pathologist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, a teacher and an aide. The SLP got S\u2019s attention and demonstrated the game by rolling the ball and knocking down the pins. Everyone cheered. S barely seemed to notice. The therapist, using hand-over-hand, guided S to pick up the ball and knock down the pins. S\u2019s eyes were averted, but the team cheered when the pins fell. The SLP placed a speech generating device in front of him that had a symbol of a ball and a symbol of bowling pin. She demonstrated (using hand-over-hand) touching the ball symbol. The device said, \u201cBall\u201d, and she gave the ball to S. On they went, teaching S to request the ball using the ball symbol on the device. They commanded his attention, and I could see S trying with everything in him to focus, to make his mind and body do what they were asked of him.\u00a0 After many, many attempts, it seemed that S was catching on. I was sitting on the edge of my seat in the auditorium watching all of this on video, and I was emotionally exhausted by the entire process. Each time I willed S to request the ball, as if my own life depended on it. I needed S to give me hope. Finally, the team\u00a0moved on to teaching S to request a pin. They painstakingly prompted him along, each time cheering loudly (and I was cheering, too) when\u00a0he allowed his hand to touch the pin icon. S began to drool. Someone wiped his mouth. Each time S \u201crequested\u201d, we heard the digitized sound, \u201cPin\u201d, and another bowling pin\u00a0was placed\u00a0on the tray. At this point, I was practically sweating and my face was hot.  C\u2019mon S, c\u2019mon, you can do it. You\u2019re almost there! There were\u00a05 pins on the table. I could feel the excitement in the room. Soon all the pins would be up and S could request the ball. Then he would be able to roll the ball and knock down the pins. On the video, S could sense the excitement as well. He began rocking a little, moving his head from side to side, eyes toward the ceiling. The therapist had his hand, prompting him, guiding him to the pin icon. In one swift jerk, he accidentally bumped the tray and all the pins fell. There was a collective groan in the auditorium\u2026 followed by some good-natured laughter. On the video, I heard someone say, \u201cLet\u2019s take a short break, and then we\u2019ll try it again\u2026\u201d \u00a0 Because S needs a voice. As does my daughter, and so many others affected by autism. Just when I was feeling a little weary, S and his team inspired me to keep going. And when the pins fall, we\u2019ll start all over again.

{"date": "October 24, 2008", "body": "When Rhema was younger, she had a little stuffed dog that served as her  security blanket . She would cling to it, hug it, coo to it, and alternately flap and chew on its ears. Like all comfort objects, it served the purpose of being that familiar thing she could hold onto in the midst of change and uncertainty; it provided a sense of security and safety. Rhema loved that doggie to pieces, literally. As time drew near for us to return to the States, the doggie thing grew increasingly threadbare. I tried mending it several times, but also began to search for a replacement; I wanted Rhema to have her doggie for the upcoming move but I didn\u2019t know if the stinky old thing would last. A mega search ensued with me fruitlessly driving an hour back to the store in Germany where I had originally found it, chiding myself for not buying two of them way back when. I searched the Internet for a doggie just like Rhema\u2019s, the lettering on the tag had worn out. (I knew that if I found a new one, Rhema might not accept it, but my plan was to rough up the new one a bit \u2013 take a bat to it, spill some juice on it, repeatedly throw it against the wall,\u00a0drool on it,\u00a0Mike Tyson it). I never found another doggie for Rhema, so the old one came with us when we traveled home. Autumn always reminds me of patterns of change. The children are getting older, we\u2019re preparing for another winter. Even as much as Rhema craves sameness and adheres to routines, she is growing into a tall child whose interests are quickly shifting. Many of the things that finally seemed to work for her at school and home do so no longer, and I feel myself scrambling to find new ways to motivate her, new ways to teach and reach her. My comfort object in the midst of change is \n My love-worn Bible \n This Bible has been with me since my college days. There have been times in my life where I so desperately needed the Word of Life that I would sleep with it on my pillow. I find that when I search the pages I can literally feel the warmth of a security blanket wrapped round my soul.\u00a0 Like Rhema\u2019s doggie, I have tried repairing my Bible, but it always ends up  mending me . The basic meaning of the Biblical word comfort is a \u201ccalling to one\u2019s side.\u201d The idea for me is that the  God of all comfort , the God of the Universe, is One that I can call to my side! Boggles the mind! But He has proven faithful to be with me; His presence a comfort in times of change and uncertainty, in times of fear, in times of sorrow. Like Rhema\u2019s doggie, there is simply no replacement. I find that I must treasure it,\u00a0hang onto it by a thread\u2026 \u00a0 hug it to my heart and never let it go. Current verses of comfort: This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. It is of the LORD\u2019S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Lam. 3:21-24 I will turn their mourning into gladness; \nI will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. Jer 31:13  For I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cand will bring you back from captivity.

I\u2019m Muffin Top.\u201d At one point in our ride, (after doing \u201ckiller hills\u201d) the instructor told us to adjust the setting on our bikes.  \u201cYou want comfortable resistance here.\u201d Comfortable resistance.  What in the world is that?  The only comfort I know is no resistance, baby.  So, being the  non-compliant  rebel that I am, I set the bike at zero resistance.  If you\u2019ve ever ridden a bike in your life, you probably know what happened next.  I began spinning my wheels \u2013 my balance was lost, my legs went out of control and I was bouncing up and down in my elf-seat.  I was literally working against myself. I had to put on my emergency brake and re-adjust the settings. In order to get myself through the rest of the class I pondered the phrase comfortable resistance.  Resistance (in terms of exercise) is meant to increase muscle strength and improve endurance.   Andrea\u2019s recent  post  at Autism Unplugged, inspired me to view \u201cresistance\u201d in my \u201cride\u201d as trials, struggles, disappointment, waiting-on-answer-prayers, heartache, etc.  In the past, I certainly preferred the no resistance setting.  When resistance came, I initially resented it.  Lately I\u2019m learning to appreciate it \u2013 I am almost comfortable with it.  Because I know it\u2019s the only way to increase strength and faith and improve endurance.  Paul writes about being given a thorn in the flesh, which he says prevented him from becoming conceited. While it is not revealed what this thorn was \u2013 some have guessed that it was a physical affliction \u2013 suffice to say that it tormented him.  Paul prayed earnestly three times that it be removed, but God\u2019s answer was, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.\u201d (2 Cor. 12) \u201cThorns in the flesh\u201d help us discover the  strength  of weakness.  I have realized that my own strength is greatly limited \u2013 resistance has shown me that.  It was in Rhema\u2019s room less than a year ago when I threw my hands up and said, \u201cI give up. I\u2019ve done everything I know to do. You take her, Lord, and make something beautiful out of her life. I choose not to be bitter. I choose to trust you no matter what.\u201d I am not enough.  But God \u2013 His strength and grace \u2013 is more than I could ever need.  From my favorite dude, Charles Spurgeon \u2013 \n No flowers wear so lovely a blue as those which grow at the foot of the frozen glacier; no stars gleam so brightly as those which glisten in the polar sky; no water tastes so sweet as that which springs amid the desert sand; and no faith is so precious as that which lives and triumphs in adversity. Tried faith brings experience. You could not have believed your own weakness had you not been compelled to pass through the rivers; and you would never have known God\u2019s strength had you not been supported amid the water-floods. Faith increases in solidity, assurance, and intensity, the more it is exercised with tribulation. Faith is precious, and its trial is precious too. Alas, tomorrow I will drag my sore gluteus maximus back to spinning class. \nIt\u2019s all about Getting Stronger\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismunplugged.blogspot.com/2008/11/high-low-points-or-low-high-points.html"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/11/13/comfortable-resistance/", "title": "Comfortable Resistance"},

{"date": "November 18, 2008", "body": "This past April Rhema had a birthday party. On many of the cards she received, kids from her class had written their names or \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d or some other\u00a0brief note. As I went through the cards, I felt a growing panic.  Rhema can\u2019t write her name. She cannot even imitate a stroke or hold a pencil properly. Oh no. Will she ever learn? Will she ever learn to read and write??  I had forgotten to worry about this. These are the kind of thoughts in which a friend of mine raises her hand (as in a Diana Ross & the Supremes Stop-in-the-Name-of-Love gesture) and quips, \u201cNot helpful.\u201d In other words, \u201cDon\u2019t dwell on the future in which you have no control. Just trust God, girl!\u201d Still learning that this is not a  race , and I don\u2019t have to play \u201ccatch-up.\u201d That I can be truly thankful and cherish every little, precious step forward. Rhema \u201cscribbles.\u201d Sometimes as she scribbles, I hear her mimicking, \u201cDawALine, DawALine.\u201d She has heard the phrase \u201cDraw a Line\u201d from her OT so many times that she associates it with any sort of coloring \u2013 she could be making circles or squigglies or zig-zags. It\u2019s all \u201cDawALine.\u201d Last week Rhema\u2019s school sent me the laminated picture above. The back of the picture is labeled, Pre-Writing. 11/08. It made me feel all weepy. It\u2019s a tiny step, but she\u2019s on her way, y\u2019all. How do I begin to thank the wonderful individuals who work with my little one day in and day out? They teach her, and take care of her, and guide her with loving patience. I am indebted for life. If anyone has figured out how to thank these angels, please let me know. The way B (Rhema\u2019s teacher) is holding her arm up in the picture reminds me of an Old Testament story in which the people of Israel were in a fierce battle. Moses watched the battle from a hilltop, and whenever his arms were raised, the Israelites were winning. Whenever he lowered his arms, the Amalekites prevailed. The passage says, \u201cWhen Moses\u2019 hands grew tired\u2026 Aaron and Hur held his hands up\u2013one on one side, one on the other\u2013so that his hands remained steady till sunset.\u201d (Ex 17:12) And the Israelites won the battle. Thank you to all of the Aaron\u2019s and Hur\u2019s in our life for \u201cholding up our arms\u201d.  You are the teachers, therapists, family and friends who continue to come alongside and hold up our arms when we get tired and discouraged in the midst of the battle. With the blessing of your love, your prayers, your encouragement, your commitment to our family\u2026 we have already won. Thank you, B.

{"date": "November 23, 2008", "body": "There was a young man by the name of Mephibosheth. He was the son of a prince, the grandson of a king. He was a special needs kid \u2013 lame in both feet. His kingdom had been overtaken by David, and Mephib\u2019s father and grandfather were killed during the war. In the book of 2 Samuel 9, Mephib is also facing a death sentence \u2014 it was customary for the new king to protect himself by executing any possible contenders to the throne of a former dynasty. But David asks, \u201cIs there no one still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show God\u2019s kindness?\u201d \n\u201cThere is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet.\u201d Mephib is brought before David. Mephib bows immediately, expecting to be executed. But instead, David speaks kindly to him. \n\u201cMephibosheth! Don\u2019t be afraid for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.\u201d \nMephib replies, \u201cWhat is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?\u201d David\u2019s response is to order that everything that belonged to Mephib\u2019s grandfather be given immediately to Mephib. Instead of getting his head chopped off, Mephib gets the guarantee of a daily feast. David restores his inheritance to him and gives him a permanent place at the king\u2019s table \u2014 honoring him as one of his own sons. Mephib\u2019s disability left him unable to work, but David instructed his servants to farm his land and bring in the harvest so that Mephib would be provided for, and he would always have a place of honor at the king\u2019s table. I love this story. For obvious reasons, I love the beautiful example of David\u2019s mercy and kindness towards this disabled young man who had literally been put out of sight. How very God-like in that no matter how crippled, lost and forgotten we may be, there is a place offered to each of us at the royal table. Instead of being condemned to die in sorrow and sin and frailty, we have been welcomed \u2013 just as we are \u2013 to a \u201cheavenly\u201d table where an abundant feast has been prepared. Years ago, in thanksgiving for his love and sacrifice for me (and out of sheer need), I gave my little life to Jesus. I accepted the invitation to  taste and see that the Lord is good  (Ps. 34:8). With empty hands, crippled feet and all my  special  needs, I came limping to His table of grace. There I found the spiritual nourishment that my soul craved \u2013 healing, forgiveness, purpose, significance. He made me a daughter and blessed me to partake in the sweetest Thanksgiving feast. Hear the good news, you\u2019ve been invited \nNo matter what others may say, \nYour darkest sins will be forgiven \nYou will always have a place. At the table of grace the cup\u2019s never empty. \nThe plate\u2019s always full and it\u2019s never too late. \nTo come and be filled with love never ending \nYou\u2019re always welcome at the table of grace. So come weak, and heavy hearted \nDon\u2019t try to hide your earthly scars. \nIn His eyes, we all are equal \nDon\u2019t be afraid, come as you are. At the table of grace the cup\u2019s never empty \nThe plate\u2019s always full, and it\u2019s never too late! \nTo come and be filled with love never ending \nYou\u2019re always welcome at the table of grace -Phillips, Craig and Dean \u00a0 Mephibosheth, by the way, means  \u201cshame breaker\u201d  or  \u201cone who has overcome shame .\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/11/23/feast-for-the-broken/", "title": "Feast For The\u00a0Broken"},

She doesn\u2019t seem to care that Rhema does not look at her or respond to her cheery greetings. She\u2019s confident and persistent. And since that wonderful day in July, when Hope wants a  high-five , she gets a high five. I remember a time when Rhema was flat on her back in full tantrum mode, screaming and thrashing. Hope stood beside her, over her, completely unfazed. She waved as if she were seeing an old friend after a long separation: \u201cHi Rhema! Hi Rhema!!!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d I used to worry about them. There was a total lack of physical contact between them. Until one day Hope started \u201cattacking\u201d Rhema from behind with bear hugs. Rhema often protests, but Hope holds on for dear life until they end up in a heap on the ground. Then Hope gets up with a satisfied smile on her face and goes about her business. In the evening, when Rhema gets her meds we lay her on the ground, hold her arms to her sides and insert the medications from droppers (-rather crude, I know, but it\u2019s currently the only way that works). Hope often takes advantage of Rhema\u2019s defenseless position by getting on her hands and knees and planting kisses on Rhema\u2019s forehead while we administer the meds. Rhema likes to repeat a phrase: \u201cEh eh caww we.\u201d In fact, she does not speak it. She sings it. We have no idea what it means or even if it means anything at all (\u2013 perhaps she just likes the sounds?) Recently, Hope went over to Rhema and initiated the phrase in the same sing-songy tone. \n\u201cEh eh caww we.\u201d \nI watched with fascination as Rhema dropped her gaze and got the biggest grin on her face. She intoned back, \n\u201cEh eh caww we.\u201d \n\u201cEh eh caww we.\u201d (Hope) \n\u201cEh eh caww we.\u201d (Rhema) And there you have it. Reciprocal play. Turn-taking. Verbal imitation\u2026 One of Rhema\u2019s ABA programs since she was a toddler. Granted, her verbal imitation has been improving in the last couple months, but it is definitely sporadic, and she usually has to be highly motivated. We dangle popsicles or popcorn or rubber lizards and tickles to get a vocal response.\u00a0 I took a whole course by  Hanen  to learn how to get Rhema to imitate. In comes my not-quite-2-year-old and accomplishes the task with ease. But then all her life, Hope\u2019s been at Rhema\u2019s speech, ABA, and occupational therapies. At the end of a session, our home therapist lets Hope participate. When I was pregnant with her, we got Rhema\u2019s diagnosis. Little did I know God was already providing\u00a0us with\u00a0a\u00a0perfect peer model named  Hope . And Hope has one very\u00a0awesome desire that makes her the most unique therapist of all. She wants to be just like her. Like any younger sibling, she wants to know her big sister, and do what she does and go where she goes. \u201cHope, you said \u2018Eh eh caw we\u2019 like Rhema!\u201d \n\u201cI wanna be like Rhema.\u201d \n\u201cYou want to be like Rhema?\u201d \n\u201cYeah!\u201d One day Hope will learn the word  autism . One day she will realize that her cool sis who gives her high-fives and gets to sleep in the top bunk and ride the schoolbus and wear big-girl Dora underwear is  different.  I hope she will know how strong and brave and determined and smart and pure-hearted Rhema is. I hope she\u2019ll always want to be just like her big sister.

{"date": "November 25, 2008", "body": "We found out today that my husband is receiving orders to deploy to Iraq. For fifteen months. A year and three months. Four hundred and fifty-five days. We knew it was coming, but it really feels real now. At least he\u2019s not scheduled to deploy until May 10. At least that gives us 6 months to prepare. Interestingly enough I remembered a Thanksgiving letter he sent to our family the last time he was deployed to Iraq. Rhema was just about 8 months old.  Brandon was in Iraq when she was born , but got to visit us for 2 weeks when she was 6 months old. Then he returned to the war and sent home a Thanksgiving letter. I was not planning on sharing it, but since we got the news today, I\u2019ve decided to post it. [Neally is my family nickname]. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \n As you hear this you will be in the middle of the Thanksgiving day. I wanted to write while you are all gathered together as a family and be able to express my thankfulness with you all from far away here in Iraq.  This year, I have so much to be thankful for. Neally and I have had a year that has been filled with anxiety, fear, questions. It has been a year of great unknowns. A year of disconnect from each other and family. However, I am thankful to the Lord for His innumerable blessings. I\u2019d like to list a few\u2014 First, I am so thankful for God\u2019s gift to us of Rhema. I cannot describe my joy in seeing my daughter for the first time. Thank You, Lord. I am thankful that though away, and as I see many marriages falling apart during this deployment, J and I have grown more passionate about our marriage, more aware of our bond as man and wife. It is truly a supernatural answer to our prayers. I love and appreciate my wife more today than when I left. I am thankful for the Lord\u2019s protection over me and my Soldiers. We had a long combat patrol and almost 10 months on the ground in Iraq and we are all safe and sound today. Forward Operating Base Speicher, where the majority of my guys are located, is surrounded in prayer by many committed Christians and chaplains. We receive very little enemy activity. My Soldiers located in Balad at LSA Anaconda have been hit with nearly 500 rocket attacks, some destroying their bunks while they were not in them\u2026another rocket maiming an airman while my Soldier just 20 feet away was completely unharmed. I am not shy about this fact\u2014it is the Lord who is our Protector. He is our shield and refuge here. I believe with every fiber of my being that we are protected through prayer and because of His mercy to us. The Lord is perfect and sovereign even if we had experienced casualties, but I thank the Lord for His seeing fit to keep us all safe thus far. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful for the Palmers. When I first met Neally, I had my doubts about her authenticity because she was too innocent, too pure, too kind, too patient, too selfless, too caring. I wondered if it were not a dating make-over where she was able to put her best foot forward while around me. I wondered if she had gone off to college and reinvented herself like many do\u2026some for the better, some for the worse. Then I visited her family. I was amazed to see a whole house full of people who God had chosen and set aside, all living lives of innocence before Him, of purity, of kindness, of patience, of selflessness, of caring\u2026of Loving Jesus. I knew then that not only had I found the right woman God had for me, but He had given me the added blessing of the very best family. I am so thankful, and feel undeserving, of the gift of Neally\u2019s family\u2026my family now. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful that I saw the Lord gently and mercifully lift my family out of the pit of hell. I am thankful that I saw firsthand God\u2019s radical deliverance of my family. We were shattered almost beyond repair and God carefully put all of the pieces back together again. I am thankful that the Lord made my parents into Godly examples\u2014with little or no training in how to be a Godly parent, the Lord was faithful to make up the years of destruction in short order so that Lindsay and I were trained in the ways of the Lord. He, HE, is the reason for my thankfulness. I am thankful that the Lord saved me at a young age. Although I wondered what was on the other side of life\u2014the parties, the apparent freedom and pleasure of sin, the culture of \u201cif it feels good, do it\u2026it\u2019s got to be ok if it feels ok\u2026follow your heart\u201d\u2014I am thankful that He kept me from major stumbles along the way. As I left for college, far away with no need of my parents anymore for daily necessities, I was free to choose my path. Although tempted like everyone else, God kept me close and convicted. He saw me through the lonely times when everyone else was out doing their exploring. He was my comfort and my friend. Today I am truly free and at peace because the Lord has kept me from many of the things that I see others still struggling with from their high school and college days. I was reminded in chapel as we studied a portion of Romans 1 that people who do not acknowledge God are missing something on this holiday because they do not have anyone to be thankful to. If one who does not acknowledge God were to be at Thanksgiving dinner today and give thanks for their good things in life\u2014health, family, prosperity, food\u2014and did not acknowledge the God who gave them these things, who are they thanking? It is an empty thanks to no one in particular. I urge us all to be mindful of Who we are thankful to this Thanksgiving Day. I hope you all give a \u201cthankful\u201d Thanksgiving to the One who gives us all good things. Love you all, From Iraq, Brandon \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Thanks so much to all the US service men and women serving away from home this Thanksgiving!

{"date": "March 9, 2009", "body": "Friday morning I woke up and did not want to face the day, did not want to get out of bed. I had yet to put a foot on the floor, and I was already overwhelmed. People were coming to see the house. I had tried to do a little spring cleaning all week, but one of the kids had been sick. Now Friday was here, and there was so much to do. My one consolation was that last week I finished my final class for my Masters degree, so there were no assignments hanging over my head. Brandon came home from work around noon to help me clean. I could not understand why he was not as stressed out as I. Just before the people were to arrive, we decided the house was \u201cpassable.\u201d I stole away to the computer for a few minutes of autism research online. (Don\u2019t want to miss anything, you know.) My friend Carrie, who lives in PA, called. Although we talk on the phone about once a week, we have not seen each other in years. We knew each other before we had little girls with autism, and now we share an irreplaceable\u00a0bond. \u201cHi Carrie.Gotta go.We have these people coming to see the house.Spent all morning cleaning.They should be here any minute.Oh!There\u2019s the doorbell.Gotta go.Call ya laita.\u201d Hung up the phone and rushed to the living room. Brandon was standing at the door. Carrie was standing there and another dear friend, Melissa, whom I had not seen in years, was there also, holding flowers. They had gifts for my children. I could not believe it. Confused. Overwhelmed. So happy to see them. Angry that they had inconvenienced themselves by leaving their families and driving hours to my house. Turns out the whole story about people coming to see the house was a falsehood. Melissa, Carrie and Brandon had been planning this for weeks. They were whisking me away for a \u201cGirls Weekend Out.\u201d My friends had come to minister to me. I said something unintelligible and then started crying like a blubbering fool. Brandon shed tears, too. (That man. After 10 years of marriage, you think you know someone. Days later, I\u2019m still surprised that he can  lie to me with a straight face  act so well. He claims making up that story was the only way he could get me to clean the house. Hhhhmmm.) We had the best time. I cannot recall a time when I have felt so loved by friends, so favored. We went out to a nice restaurant for dinner. We went to Barnes and Noble and they bought me books that had absolutely nothing to do with autism. (To support my  addiction , I had to buy at least one book on autism). On Saturday, we went to the Museum of Fine Art in Boston. We laughed. We cried (well, maybe that was just me). We reminisced. We prayed together. A whole weekend with no perseverating on autism. I mean, I often dream about autism at night. I spend hours researching about autism, reading and writing in online groups about autism. I go to autism workshops and seminars and support groups. I talk about autism endlessly (- my poor friends and family!). And now, Lord help me, I  blog  about autism. But I skipped out on Rhema\u2019s weekend therapy appointments to go to a museum. Yes, this control freak mama left the husband in charge of all that. (I\u2019m reminded of a  post  by  Judith  where her husband quotes Mr. Miyagi:  \u201cYou remember lesson about balance? Lesson not just karate only. Lesson for whole life. Whole life have a balance. Everything be better. Understand?\u201d) In church on Sunday, another precious friend took care of Rhema for us in Children\u2019s Church. It was the first Sunday in a loooooooooong time that Brandon and I actually got to sit together in church (-even other members noticed!). During worship, I cried like a blubbering fool again as we sang,  \u201cWe are the broken, You are the Healer. Jesus, Redeemer, Mighty to save. You are the love song. We\u2019ll sing forever, Bowing before You. Blessing Your name.\u201d I am so thankful that the Lord loves me like that. \u00a0 As Melissa and Carrie drove away, Brandon and I stood on the porch. He asked me, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d The only word I could think of was, \u201cRefreshed.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2008/09/asa-triggers-book-relapse.html", "http://www.parents.com/dgroups/persona.jsp?userId=a97c8a2ce93a301b076ed83ce156e5e9&plckController=PersonaBlog&plckScript=personaScript&plckElementId=personaDest&plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&plckPostId=Blog%3aa97c8a2ce93a301b076ed83ce156e5e9Post%3abe482c7c-a5d6-4668-a230-f8ad3a7e7e5e", "http://www.parents.com/dgroups/persona.jsp?userId=a97c8a2ce93a301b076ed83ce156e5e9&plckController=PersonaBlog&plckScript=personaScript&plckElementId=personaDest&plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&plckPostId=Blog%3aa97c8a2ce93a301b076ed83ce156e5e9Post%3abe482c7c-a5d6-4668-a230-f8ad3a7e7e5e"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/autism-takes-a-weekend-off-part-1/", "title": "Autism Takes a Weekend Off \u2013 Part\u00a01"},

They live in Nashville, and simply put, we just miss them all the time. When they arrived, there were lots of joyous hugs and hellos. Soon after they were seated on the couch, I noticed that Rhema was sitting in between them. She was hugging her knees to her chest. She was giddy, smiling to herself. This caught my attention because she is not one for \u201cgreeting\u201d people. No matter how much commotion\u00a0may be going on near the front door, she usually stays in the other room seemingly uninterested in the people, conversations and activities going on around her.

It could have had something to do with the fact that they came bearing gifts\u2026 But something was different. Periodically, she would jump from the couch, run toward nothing in particular and then find her way back to the couch. She was happy. She was giggling. She was  with  us. I knew that this was her form of salutation, her way of saying,  \u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been all this time, but it sure is good to see you.\u201d \u00a0 We are preparing to spend the Christmas holiday in Michigan. A loving family member (who does not see Rhema often) said, \u201cMaybe she will recognize her grandparents this time.\u201d \u201cOf course she will recognize them. She knows and loves them very well. She just doesn\u2019t always show it in a way we would expect\u2026\u201d And then I had to add, \u201cAnd she has a great memory.\u201d I think it is a common assumption that people with autism do not have close relationships with others. That they are only self-centered. That people are just tools to them. At first glance, it would seem so with Rhema. She does not greet or approach people. She does not look you in the eye. She does not seem to respond \u2013 (\u201cCan she hear me?\u201d is a question I often get by tentative, well-meaning people. Yes, she most certainly can hear you.) She squirms out of hugs faster than the speed of light. She has never given a kiss. She does not seem to acknowledge your presence \u2014 unless you have a hand that can be thrust towards a desired object on a high shelf. But in my heart of hearts I know that she is so much more complex than people\u2019s assumptions. There\u2019s an old book I enjoyed called \u201cNews From the Border.\u201d It suggests that sometimes it is  because of  close relationships and intense feelings for others that people with autism may seem aloof or indifferent. In fact, Rhema may be so excited and overwhelmed by the presence of someone she loves that she does something unexpected, or she looks away or runs away. But did you catch the smile in her eyes? Did you notice the lilt in her repetitive babbling? Did you hear the tiny giggle? \u00a0 We had not seen Rhema\u2019s home ABA therapist, T, for a couple weeks. T owns the animal puzzle that makes animal sounds (as seen in the video  here ). This puzzle is currently highly motivating to Rhema. The other day T came to our front door, and when I answered it, I had Rhema by the hand. When Rhema saw T, she exclaimed, \u201cCock a doodle doo!!! Cock a doodle doo!!!\u201d T and I dissolved into laughter as Rhema continued to crow like a rooster at the top of her lungs.\u00a0She sounded just like the rooster in the animal puzzle.\u00a0She followed T all the way into the living room with her heartfelt cock-a-doodle-doo\u2019s. One might say that she was just cock-a-doodle-doo-ing because she wanted to play with T\u2019s puzzle. And certainly, she did. But I like to think that Rhema was so happy to see T that she wanted to awaken the dawn with her excitement. Who knows? One thing I do know. Her love is not always recognized by us, but\u2026 she always recognizes love. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/recognition/", "title": "Recognition"},
{"date": "March 11, 2009", "body": "Saturday night my twin and her husband came over. We hashed a plan out loud that Carrie, Melissa, my twin and I would go out to dinner first while Brandon and Joel (my twin\u2019s husband) watched the kids. Then, upon our return, the men would go out. A few times Rhema took my hand and dragged me to the door. But I was too busy chatting with my friends, so I would just say \u201cNo Rhema\u201d and appease her with a popsicle or something. It was time to go, and we were rushing out the front door to go to dinner when we noticed Rhema standing by the side door. She had gotten herself \u201cdressed.\u201d Hair disheveled. Shirt on. No pants (of course). She was wearing one of Hope\u2019s diapers and her clunky brown Dora boots. No socks. There she stood with a tear in her eye and her heart on her sleeve. She understood that we were going somewhere. And. She. Wanted. To. Go. Rhema is not always one to make her wishes known. So when she demonstratively requests something, it just melts me. And I appreciated her initiative to put her shoes on \u2013 she despises shoes! \u201cWe\u2019ll take her with us,\u201d I said. I caught Brandon\u2019s look. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just go for a quick drive. Then I\u2019ll drop her off back at the house and we\u2019ll head to the restaurant.\u201d In our minds (Brandon\u2019s and mine), there was no way she could actually go  inside  the restaurant with us. The reasons are many: -She can\u2019t sit still. \n-She\u2019s a flight risk. \n\u2013 She\u2019ll attack some poor diner\u2019s ice water. \n\u2013 She\u2019ll sample another poor diner\u2019s food. \n-She has strong food aversions and is on a gluten-free, casein-free diet which eliminates just about everything on the menu. (Add to that, Hope\u2019s long list of severe food allergies\u2026.\u00a0 We have not been to a real restaurant as a family in \u2026 well\u2026 ever?) We drove around. Rhema was so happy to be with us that I decided we would try her at a family-style Mexican restaurant. My twin and my friends were with me and I was feeling brave. And nervous. Upon entering the restaurant, she tried to climb into a baby\u2019s highchair (the baby was still in it), but I quickly re-directed her and the baby\u2019s life\u00a0was spared. The restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away. Rhema sat down in her chair and began clapping her hands and saying, \u201cQuack, quack.\u201d She was so excited. My  autismometer  (as  Kim Stagliano  calls it)\u00a0was in high gear,\u00a0scanning our surroundings. Could she handle the input \u2013 the sights, sounds and smells? Where were the trouble spots? What could be broken or upturned?\u00a0Where was the\u00a0exit in case we needed to make a fast getaway? I noticed that Carrie\u2019s autismometer was working overtime as well. I had to laugh -oh, someone who understands!\u00a0 She sat on one side of Rhema and I sat on the other. I did not have my usual arsenal of distraction tools with me because we had not planned on Rhema being with us. So each woman discreetly inventoried her purse, and in no time we had a list of items to pull out when we needed them: a small box of Mike and Ikes (box could be shaken, then candy consumed if things got desperate), peppermints, crayons, small toys, key chains, cell phones, and a safety pin (just kidding!). We paced ourselves. Melissa took her for a walk when she got antsy. Carrie let her eat the ice out of her water glass. My twin prevented her from bolting while I used the restroom. I put her in a high chair. She loved it. When the drinks came out, we saw that\u00a0she was interested in the orange wedges. We asked for a bowl of orange wedges, and Rhema devoured them. When she started eating the rinds, Carrie went to the bar and came back with more oranges. So went the night. She did manage to steal one bite of forbidden food (a flour tortilla), and she did bolt once.\u00a0 But I caught her before she could sit in a stranger\u2019s lap or jump up and down on their table. It was a raving, amazing success! \u00a0 Later I said to Carrie, \u201cI didn\u2019t think she was ready for this. But she did so well, I\u2019m going to have to do this again!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cShe did great!\u201d\u00a0 She told me some of her own family\u2019s dining out experiences. (She has four children.) There have been bumps along the way, but\u00a0overall\u00a0her kids\u00a0have learned to behave in restaurants. \u201cEvery time may not go\u00a0as smoothly as tonight,\u201d she concluded. Then, with a shrug and a wink she added, \u201cBut if there\u2019s a disaster at least you\u2019ll have a good story to blog about.\u201d \u00a0 Stay tuned\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-stagliano/if-the-first-child-had-au_b_159610.html", "http://kimstagliano.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/autism-goes-out-to-dinner-part-2/", "title": "Out to Dinner \u2013 Part\u00a02"},
{"date": "May 4, 2009", "body": "Over ten years ago, I took time off from college to work for  Mother Teresa\u2019s Missionaries of Charities  in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. My\u00a0time there was life-changing, to say the least. Lately, in reading  Angie\u2019s  accounts of her mission trip to India, I have been\u00a0drawn back to\u00a0my Ethiopia experience. This is Haylin. As an infant, Haylin suffered a high fever that left her bedridden and unable to speak. Every day it was my job to change her, feed her, bathe her, clean and\u00a0bandage her bedsores, sing to her, love her. Haylin was the first to teach me how to communicate without words ( thank you, Haylin ) \u2013 she spoke with her eyes. \u00a0 This is Nigist. \u00a0 Nigist was a little girl with\u00a0the happiest, most\u00a0infectious laugh and legs that did not work. There was no wheelchair for her, so she got around by dragging herself across the floor. People would often accidentally step on her, and she would respond with giggles. I remember when she lost a tooth, she thought it was hilarious and\u00a0laughed all afternoon. One day I was holding Nigist on my lap. I absent-mindedly held out my arms to examine them. (At night I slept on a flea-infested cot, and I had accrued a myriad of bites on my arms. Nigist gazed up at me, and then clumsily licked her finger and began to rub her finger over each bite.) It was as if Jesus Himself were tending to my little pains. I will not, cannot ever forget Nigist. \u00a0(Many of the children in the orphanage regularly had their heads shaved with a razor blade because of head lice. That is why their hair is short in the above photos). \u00a0 While I spent my days working at the orphanage, I lived and slept in the women\u2019s quarters, where the\u00a0female patients stayed. Many of the women suffered from various diseases such as HIV, malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever (I actually contracted typhoid while I was there). Additionally many of the women suffered from  fistulas , which had a very foul odor associated with it. \n \n \n (I'm in a pink top, third from the left) \n \n \n From Ethiopia, I have a lifetime of stories. Looking at their beautiful faces, it may be hard to believe that these women and children were the forgotten, the discarded, the severely shunned of society. They were often abandoned at the gates of Mother Teresa\u2019s mission with no food or shelter. Never had I seen or could have imagined such poverty, such suffering. Never had I seen or could have imagined such courage and strength. These were a people desperately poor but spiritually rich. But God chose what the world thinks foolish to shame the wise, and God chose what the world thinks weak to shame the strong.God chose what is low and despised in the world, what is regarded as nothing, to set aside what is regarded as something, so that no one can boast in his presence. 1 Cor 1:27-29 (NET) In fact, God often chooses to reveal Himself through those who are not wise by human standards, not strong, not noble. I saw Him do it through the women and children I was blessed to know in Ethiopia. I\u2019ve seen Him do it through my little Rhema and  many ,  many  precious little ones. I\u2019ve seen Him do it through Jesus Christ Himself \u2014 the Son of the Most High God shed his royalty and became a baby in a lowly manger and a smelly stable. As a man, He was despised, beaten, and made to die a humiliating and torturous death on a cross. But in glorious triumph, He conquered death so that we could  know  Him and  live . He can make you a new creation, even\u00a0wise, and strong and noble. Some may not recognize \u00a0it, but others will see His glory in your life, on your face.

{"date": "April 2, 2009", "body": "We missed the \u201cdeadline.\u201d She\u2019s turning five. That magic number in autism world has come. The age where \u201cearly intervention\u201d is no longer early, and brain plasticity is\u2026 not so \u201cplastic.\u201d The age where the \u201cwindow\u201d of opportunity supposedly slams shut. Three years ago we got the memo: For a \u201cfavorable\u201d outcome, she should be talking by age five\u2026 or you can pretty much give up on her ever having functional speech. So with a sense of urgency we have been fighting time, racing the clock, and trying to play catch up with our tails on fire. Three long years and a bazillion therapy hours later, our due date has come. She\u2019s turning five. Many friends have recently assured me that this is just an \u201cartificial boundary\u201d. That some of their children actually made their greatest gains  after  five. (Thank you for the encouragement.) And yet, as I look at her now \u2013 tall, lovely, and other-wordly\u2026 I know that we have entered a new chapter. Ready or not. She\u2019s turning five. We prayed. We hoped against hope. But the truth is, she has the receptive and expressive language of a 12-month old. If that. She will not understand that it\u2019s her birthday. She will not march off to the local kindergarten with her peers. Last month, the neuro said that medicine had done all it could do. \u2026 But I can say with all my heart, that  HOPE did not disappoint . Hope, as in that  knowing  that things will turn out for the best \u2014 that\u00a0hope did not, will not, shame us. Hope taught (and is teaching) us about patience. And faith. And character. And JOY. And perseverance. (Rom. 5:3-5) We yet have hope, and Jesus is the fount of our hope. Hope abounds! So I want to honor Rhema. I want to honor\u00a0the God who fearfully and wonderfully made her. Rhema, on 4/4/04 at 4-something p.m. (I think that\u2019s so cool), God gave you to me. That evening, you were crying a lot. Your father was\u00a0away in a war zone. I whispered in your ear, all business-like, \u201cSo it\u2019s you and me, girl. We gotta stick together.\u201d  And you have stuck with me, my darling. I am so very thankful for you, for this journey. God has blessed you; He is speaking through your life. And lately you seem to be at peace with yourself, even comfortable in your own skin.  I see you . You try so hard. You have a tenacity about you that blesses, challenges and inspires me. When you are determined and motivated, I believe you can do anything.

{"date": "July 6, 2009", "body": "\u201cChildren may be deductible, but they\u2019re still taxing.\u201d ~Mell Lazarus \u00a0 So last week I got desperate. It had been raining non-stop all week, Rhema was home from school and out of her normal routine, and both girls were going stir crazy. They needed to go to that special place \u2018where a kid can be a kid.\u2019 So I did the unthinkable and took them to (gulp) Chuck E. Cheese. As soon as we got to the place, the girls took off in opposite directions. I felt like a guilty boyfriend on a date with two women, running from one to the other, supplying tokens and assisting them onto rides. I was buckling Hope into the Chuck-e-Derby\u00a0when\u00a0I\u00a0saw a commotion near a basketball game. The game  consisted of a big shoe in which the balls come down the front of the shoe and you shoot baskets\u00a0into the top. Apparently Rhema crawled in through the opening in the front and was standing inside the \u201ccage\u201d area where the basket is. Any time someone took a shot Rhema was there to\u00a0happily catch their ball and keep it for herself. She was tossing up balls with a squeal of \u201cWheeeeeee!\u201d. She was like Air Jordan with a couple of dunk shots and some serious hang time from the rim. (That\u2019s my girl!) I\u00a0climbed up the outside of the shoe in my most dignified manner\u00a0(- we had an audience.) And, while balancing on shoelaces, I\u00a0lifted her out. Then Chuck E. Cheese himself appeared. Rhema\u2019s eyes widened with delight as she ran over and held up her hand for a high five. I have never seen such good eye contact and attention from her as I do when a furry, life-sized character is involved. I was amazed at how interactive and engaged she was.  Hhhhmmm, I\u2019m thinking I need to don a big, gray mouse costume and ask all of her teachers to do the same. I had to ration Rhema\u2019s tokens because she  loves slots  and likes to go around inserting her tokens into every slot she can find.\u00a0 She lives by a what\u2019s-yours-is-mine philosophy. If she saw that all the horses on the merry-go-round were occupied she\u2019d simply   climb on the back of some poor child\u2019s horse\u2026 or better yet, that  child\u2019s  back.\u00a0If she saw a baby\u2019s unoccupied car seat, she\u2019d settle in and make herself comfortable. She was instantly attracted to an old lady\u2019s walker because it had a small basket on it \u2013 just perfect for sitting in while pushing yourself across the room. Not long into our adventure, Hope predictably began sneezing a lot. She had been exposed to some sort of allergen and was having a mild reaction. Hope and I sat down, I wiped her nose between sneezes and gave her some Benadryl. I kept an eye on Rhema bouncing around, but realized after several minutes that I did not see her. I did spot a family of four at a booth across the room. The mother, father and two children seemed frozen and all had bewildered looks on their faces. I looked again, and there sat Rhema in the booth with them, contentedly chowing down on their pizza and sipping their soda. She hasn\u2019t learned all her  manners , but, clearly, she believes in  sharing . I rushed over with apologies. Rhema had finished off half a slice of cheese pizza,\u00a0and\u00a0the mother graciously offered me the remaining portion. Never mind the major gluten and casein infraction\u2026 I fought the urge to  giggle . On\u00a0our way out of the\u00a0land of 25 cent fun, I bought myself a big bag of blue cotton candy. After putting the kids to bed, I tore into my cotton candy like a madwoman. Lots of blue sticky goo on my cheeks and fingers and in my hair. It was mind-numbing. It was euphoric. Yes, friends.

While I\u2019m grateful for another birthday, I confess it caused me to contemplate the future again \u2013 when the children are grown, and I am older and grayer than I am now. It is something I try not to think too much. But, like background noise, the questions are always there \u2013  What about Rhema?   When we are gone\u2026 will she be able to live on her own? How will she live, where will she live, who will care for her? \u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s one of the hardest things a special needs parent has to grapple with. \u00a0 Breakfast had been served. Hair and teeth had been brushed. Faces scrubbed, clothes donned, bags packed, and everyone had \u201cgone potty.\u201d We were heading out the door when Rhema entered the bathroom. There\u2019s a not-so-wonderful side effect that comes with the learning of a new skill: obsession. Now that Rhema has handwashing mastered ( almost ), we cannot keep her out of the bathroom sink. She would happily  play in the water and bubbles  wash her hands\u00a0 all day, if we let her. So when she went into the bathroom, we assumed it was to wash her hands for the umpteenth time. Brandon, Hope, and I all stood at the side door and called out in unison, \u201cRhema. Come on!\u201d I heard the toilet lid slam, and Rhema quickly emerged.  She came to us. \u00a0We took a moment to praise her for coming. (The fact that she will now respond to her name and come when called \u2013 most of the time \u2013 is something we try not to take for granted.)

(Sorry if that was too much information). \u201cShe\u2019s gotta go potty!\u201d I declared aloud, unbuckling her seatbelt. As we rushed to the bathroom, Rhema held her stomach. Get a clue!  I muttered, angry at myself. She did her business on the toilet, and we were both  very  relieved (pun intended). I marveled at her obedience and trust in us. Like many ASD kids, Rhema craves order and predictability, due in part to her limited communication. To her, \u2018new and surprising\u2019 can often equal \u2018out-of-control and frightening.\u2019 In this case, she knew we were taking a trip, but she did not know where we were going or what we were doing. Would there be a restroom at our destination? Would the car ride take 5 minutes or an hour? She had no way of knowing. She  did  know she had to go potty.\u00a0 Yet when we called her, she stopped what she was doing and came. I\u00a0think she believed that somehow I would figure\u00a0things out\u00a0and get her to a restroom. Gosh, I love this girl! Most young kids have an abiding faith in their parents to meet their needs. Perhaps that faith\u00a0must be\u00a0even deeper for children who cannot communicate as easily. It\u2019s amazing how much Rhema trusts me to\u00a0understand what she wants and needs, to use my knowledge of her and my mama instinct. I once read that trust is the product of a relationship in which you know you are loved. Rhema gets this. If she did not know we loved her,  really know it , she could not trust us. On this ride, it\u2019s not always clear where we\u2019re going. And we don\u2019t know how long it will take to get there, wherever  there  is. But I want Rhema-faith. I want to know so deeply that God loves me\u00a0\u2013 that He loves my girls more than I\u00a0ever could\u00a0\u2013 that I can trust Him completely in the details of their lives. That He will always go with them, provide and care for them \u2013 even as I make mistakes now and long after I\u2019m gone. \u00a0 And so, we are loved. And so, we trust. \u201cCertainty is the mark of the common-sense life: gracious uncertainty is the mark of the spiritual life\u2026 We are uncertain of the next step, but we are certain of God. Immediately we abandon to God, and do the duty that lies nearest, He packs our life with surprises all the time\u2026 Spiritual life is the life of a child\u2026 \u201cBelieve also in Me,\u201d said Jesus, not \u2013 \u201cBelieve certain things about Me.\u201d Leave the whole thing to Him, it is gloriously uncertain how He will come in, but He will come.\u201d \u2014 Oswald Chamber, My Utmost For His Highest ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/07/12/trust/", "title": "Trust"},
{"date": "October 13, 2010", "body": "There was a photo booth at the indoor play place. While I followed Rhema around, Hope and her two adorable friends took lots of pictures inside the booth,\u00a0wheedling dollar bills out of\u00a0their parents with their irresistable cuteness. Whenever the booth was vacant, Rhema would go in by herself, seeking shelter. I could see her little feet swinging beneath the curtain. I spontaneously dug around in my purse and found three dollar bills. \u00a0. \u00a0 The best 3 bucks I ever spent. It only lasted a minute, but it was a mother-daughter moment in time I won\u2019t easily forget. Just me and my girl, close, together, squirming, giggling, smiling, cheesing for the camera. The cares of the world melted away in that booth, and I enjoyed her and she enjoyed me. I laughed like I haven\u2019t laughed in a long time and wondered if we\u2019d even get one good shot. Not ten minutes later, it was\u00a0time to leave the play zone. Rhema escalated to full tantrum mode, the likes I had not seen in some time. Only now she\u2019s bigger, older and seemingly stronger than someone twice her age. She flopped on the floor and refused\u00a0to move, while an employee held open\u00a0the exit door. Hope and my niece Lexi stood by watching and waiting. I lifted her from the ground, tried to stand her to her feet, but she rolled\u00a0on the floor. We repeated this about 10 times and even my friend Lori\u00a0tried to\u00a0help. It took us a good fifteen minutes to make it to the parking lot, and by then Rhema was beyond upset. We battled all the way to the car. I\u2019d try carrying her and she\u2019d\u00a0kick and\u00a0flail and yank my hair until I couldn\u2019t hold her anymore and she\u2019d land in a heap on the ground. Then she\u2019d try running back to the play place. I\u2019d catch her, she\u2019d plant herself on the ground, and the struggle continued. Was it just minutes ago that we were in the booth having our mother-daughter bonding moment?\u00a0It\u2019s startling how fast things can change, how you can be on top of the world one minute and then it all comes crashing down in the next. It\u2019s the moments when your child is hurting you that\u00a0are most\u00a0distressing.  Judith  and I spoke about this\u00a0recently, and it\u2019s comforting to share with someone whose been there. I have literally said,  God, I think I can handle anything \u2013 even a life where I never have a conversation with my kid \u2013 but I cannot take her physically hurting herself or others. Please, not that.  And although you try to take each day as it comes\u2026 in the middle of a tantrum when aggressions surface, you start worrying about the future. When your child is even bigger and stronger and you don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll handle it\u2026 I could not get Rhema into her carseat. Simply could not. She squeezed her legs together, screamed, fought my hands. Her hair was a mess, her face blotchy. All the while I held on to the image of us\u00a0in the photo booth, convinced that God had given me that time with her to encourage me. It\u2019s just like Him to show us glimpses of His grace in the heat of the battle, in the midst of despair. In\u00a0my own\u00a0season of sorrow and confusion, failures and meltdowns, I have known and seen His hand of unfailing grace\u00a0in my life\u00a0like never before \u2013 dimly at first, then in full view. And it has comforted me, carried me, saved me.\u00a0 Little one, when you are lost and afraid, remember grace.  Hold on to it. It is enough. I loved her and whispered against her red hot cheek, \u201cWe have to go now. I\u2019m sorry, baby, we can\u2019t stay. We have to go now. I\u2019m sorry, baby, we can\u2019t stay.\u201d I kept repeating it until her breathing slowed and the fight left her, and then she wept. She allowed me to buckle her into her seat. I had two copies of our strip of photos. I handed her one, half expecting her to flap it or rip it to shreds, but she clutched it in her\u00a0hands. She held on for dear\u00a0life to our sweet\u00a0snapshots of grace.\u00a0 \u00a0.

Despairing minds call to remembrance every dark foreboding in the past, and dilate upon every gloomy feature in the present; thus memory, clothed in sackcloth, presents to the mind a cup of mingled gall and wormwood. There is, however, no necessity for this. Wisdom can readily transform memory into an angel of comfort. That same recollection which in its left hand brings so many gloomy omens, may be trained to bear in its right a wealth of hopeful signs. She need not wear a crown of iron, she may encircle her brow with a fillet of gold, all spangled with stars. Thus it was in Jeremiah\u2019s experience: in the previous verse memory had brought him to deep humiliation of soul:  \u201cMy soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me;\u201d  and now this same memory restored him to life and comfort.  \u201cThis I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.\u201d Like a two-edged sword, his memory first killed his pride with one edge, and then slew his despair with the other. As a general principle, if we would exercise our memories more wisely, we might, in our very darkest distress, strike a match which would instantaneously kindle the lamp of comfort. There is no need for God to create a new thing upon the earth in order to restore believers to joy; if they would prayerfully rake the ashes of the past, they would find light for the present; and if they would turn to the book of truth and the throne of grace, their candle would soon shine as aforetime. Be it ours to remember the lovingkindness of the Lord, and to rehearse his deeds of grace. Let us open the volume of recollection which is so richly illuminated with memorials of mercy, and we shall soon be happy. Thus memory may be, as Coleridge calls it, \u201cthe bosom-spring of joy,\u201d and when the Divine Comforter bends it to his service, it may be chief among earthly comforters.\u201d -Charles Spurgeon,  Morning and Evening ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/spurgeon-on-memory/", "title": "Spurgeon: On Memory"},
{"date": "January 10, 2011", "body": "\u201cI am autistic but that is not who I am. Take time to know me, before you judge me. I am cute, funny and like to have fun.\u201d \n~ Carly Fleischmann, age 14 . Over the holiday break, we watched a 20/20 segment that my father-in-law recorded about  Carly Fleischmann , the nonverbal teen with autism who communicates through typing. I have always been fascinated and inspired by her story. Until the age of eleven, she seemed locked away in her own silent world and was considered severely impaired. But then she began typing, and as the words poured out, her family discovered a brilliant, expressive, feeling person they had never met. (Carly now has a  blog  and is writing a book.) In\u00a0an interview, Carly\u2019s father said something that hit me like a ton of bricks. He said that when they realized all that was inside her, they were horrified that for most of her life they had spoken in front of her as if she didn\u2019t exist. When you live with someone who does not seem to understand your words and does not initiate interactions or voluntarily speak,\u00a0it\u2019s easy to forget that they\u2019re\u2026 there. But Rhema is always there. We try to be aware of where she is and what she is doing at all times. We talk about her in her presence \u2013 with teachers, therapists and friends. We talk around her \u2013 in the car, in public, at home \u2013 constant conversation is buzzing among the other members of the family. We talk over her (when she\u2019s humming). We talk to her, but it\u2019s a one-sided conversation and often involves directions to do or not do something. So it is. My girl is with us, but not. We make efforts to draw her in, but we get used to her occupying the periphery. And she seems quite content there. A week ago we were loading the van with last-minute items for our drive home from Michigan, and something in Rhema\u2019s ever-present sing-songy tune caught my ear. It sounded like: \u201cUd-byyeee!\u00a0 Ud-byyeee! Ud-byyeee!\u201d She was walking around the house, not looking at anyone or anything in particular, singing her song. I looked at my mother-in-law, \u201cShe\u2019s saying good-bye, isn\u2019t she?\u201d She nodded, \u201cYes, she is.\u201d I watched her as she roamed the house, and I marveled. She completely understood  everything . No one had bothered to sit her down and explain that Christmas vacation was over and that we were leaving Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s house. Although she seemed oblivious, I\u2019m sure she noticed us packing suitcases. But even beyond that, I\u2019m sure she heard us discussing our travel plans and she knew that we were leaving. And she was saying good-bye\u2026 in her own sweet perfect way. So often we autism parents say, \u2018I know he/she understands so much more than they are able to show us.\u2019 When the proof of that statement is revealed I am sometimes \u2013 I mean, always \u2013 left in mouth-hanging-open awe. She really is with us. Right here with us. And then my heart wilted. How many times has she been telling us something through one of her \u201csongs\u201d and I totally missed it? How many times have\u00a0we failed to hear her\u2026 when all the while she\u2019s been hearing us? R, thank you for being patient with us. Forgive us when we overlook you, disregard you, underestimate you, under-believe in you. You are so smart and thoughtful, and we are loving getting to know you. You have so much to share with us.

She\u2019s in her world, sprinting circles through the house. Runthroughkitchen-intolivingroom-turnonlight-crashintochair-racethroughdiningroom-intokitchenagain. It\u2019s one of her patterns, and if you try to\u00a0block her or break the cycle, you will go down. Because, in her mind, the course simply\u00a0 must  be completed. \u201cRhema lost her pants, Mommy!\u201d Hope belly-laughs as a bare bottom whizzes past us. I gather her clothes and call to her \u201cPants on.\u201d I\u00a0make several attempts \u2013 in vain \u2013 \u00a0to\u00a0stop her in the kitchen. She would gladly sacrifice an arm\u00a0 \u2013 pulled right out of the socket \u2013 rather than break the pattern. After many laps around the house, my frustration grows. She doesn\u2019t listen to a word I say. The next time around I catch her and we struggle on the floor in the kitchen. To say she is strong is an understatement. My in-shape, airborne Army husband has a very hard time \u201ccontaining\u201d Rhema. And when she is determined, distressed or afraid, her strength  increases. She wraps her legs around my legs and trips me. She blocks my hands with her hands and drives her head into my stomach. It\u2019s\u00a0WrestleMania in my kitchen, and my 7-year-old is whipping me. \u201cPants on, pants on,\u201d I say over and over. Fifteen minutes of striving \u2013 it\u2019s a battle for control now \u2013 and finally I am able to work the pants up her legs. She is red hot and angry.\u00a0She instantly\u00a0yanks off her clothes and\u00a0blindly rushes\u00a0to the living room to run her pattern. It takes all of my physical strength and energy to get her upstairs to\u00a0her room, and she fights me the whole way. She curls into a\u00a0rigid ball on the floor and weeps. I close her door and sit on the other side,\u00a0broken-hearted and wounded, I catch my breath,\u00a0blink back hot tears of my own. What do I do? About the non-compliance, the obsessive-compulsive behavior? The fact that she\u2019s getting bigger, stronger \u2013 I\u2019m losing my ability to control her. \u00a0Her pants lay\u00a0at the bottom of the stairs, testifying to my failure. My deepest fear looms large in front of me \u2014 that I won\u2019t be able to keep her with me, that she\u2019ll have to go to residential program because I can\u2019t take care of her. God, you gave\u00a0her to me. Help me. Please help me know how to love her and reach her and parent her. Please! I remember how Jacob wrestled with God.\u00a0Jacob fought,\u00a0held on all night, and said  \u201cI will not let go until you bless me.\u201d  (Gen. 32:26) Just don\u2019t let go. No matter how long it takes, just don\u2019t let go. And suddenly I know what to do. I rub calm into her back, the child I was just wrestling. She\u2019s so tight, so lost and afraid. Rhema, Rhema. Mommy loves you, Rhema. Rhema, Rhema. Daddy\u00a0 loves you, Rhema. Rhema, Rhema. Jesus loves you, Rhema. It\u2019s the made-up song I sang when she was running circles in my womb, hoping she\u2019d settle. I\u2019d sing her that, and \u2018Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.\u2019 I like to think she remembers me singing those words to her before she was born. I imagine God  singing over me  as I sing over her, quieting us with His love. Only His song is how He never lets go. How\u00a0we\u00a0 run our desperate patterns, away, away from Him, refusing to hear, and yet He pursues us. How we thrash, flail and fight Him and He loves us anyway. I\u2019ve come to know that place \u2013 on my face, tears on the floor \u2013\u00a0is the best place to be. Because there His song of grace reaches me. Her crying turns to babbling; she\u2019s telling me all about it. Finally she sits up, crawls over to one of the many puzzles on her floor. Feverishly she works the pieces, grunting, sniffling, humming, singing now, too. I come close, and slowly, gently she lets me in. I hand her a puzzle piece \u2013 she already knows without looking where it goes. I realize that she has built a stack\u00a0of\u00a0puzzles, each\u00a0one completed on top of another. My foot knocks a few pieces out of place, and she calmly puts them back, not so frantic anymore. When she\u2019s done, I raise my hand for a high five. She\u00a0never smacks a high five. Instead she lays her hand against mine. Thank you, Lord. She\u00a0looks down,\u00a0but a\u00a0secret smile fills her face. There. There\u2019s my girl. Pants on, Rhema? She stands above me and as I hold out the pants near her feet, she rests her hands on my head. She does it for balance, I\u2019m sure, but it feels like she\u2019s blessing me.

{"date": "January 6, 2011", "body": "I once blogged about our need to avoid casinos because of Rhema\u2019s  addiction to slots . In recent months, the obsession has returned full force. My\u00a0girl can often be found with a coin pressed in her hot little hand. She stealthily (or so she thinks) scrounges around in my purse for a nickel or dime. Then she bolts to the family room where there\u2019s a crack in the floor and she slides the coin inside. I think she may have a future in hacking soda machines. She makes sure to press the change return button, and she religiously checks for wayward coins on or around the kiddie rides at the mall. While she appreciates a snack from the vending machine, and she  loves  the rides, much of the thrill comes from pushing coins into the slot over and over. On several occasions we\u2019ve had to intervene when she\u2019s walked up to total strangers and tried to take money out of their hands\u2026 or dig in their pockets. When blocked from inserting coins, she\u2019s been known to break down in tears. Her world is out of order until each coin finds its home in a slot spot\u2026 Be it the vents in Grandma\u2019s bathroom: or her CD player: There were times\u00a0in days gone by when quarters were accidentally shredded in the paper shredder. Or baked in the oven.\u00a0There was the\u00a0daily experience\u00a0of driving in the car with\u00a0coins raining down from vents above the console: . Last week when we were in Michigan we went to a mall that has a wonderful carousel. (Merry-go-rounds happen to also be one of Rhema\u2019s great loves.) When we arrived the ride was temporarily closed, so we sat down in the Food Court for lunch. While the girls were still eating, the ride opened and the carousel went round and round. Suddenly Rhema jumped from her chair with a penny in hand (I have no idea where she got it from) and ran faster than the Roadrunner to the ride. Just before hurdling the gate\u00a0to the carousel, she stopped to push her penny into a slot (the ride actually took $1 tokens). I was one proud mama. In years past, she would have trampled people and jumped onto the ride in 2 seconds flat. But this time she actually stopped to try and pay before lunging for a horse.  What manners my girl has!

In the past few months there\u2019s been concern that Rhema might be having seizures at school. She suddenly squeezes her eyes tightly shut. She covers her face with her arms as if she cannot tolerate the light. Sometimes she\u2019ll drop and\u00a0huddle on the floor, immovable. Sometimes, after she\u2019s \u201csnapped out of it\u201d, \u00a0she becomes upset and overheated and tries to remove her clothes. At school, her teachers call these episodes \u201cbreaks.\u201d With Rhema, it\u2019s just so hard to know sometimes. Brandon and I have always assumed that these episodes were behavioral \u2013 just the latest odd thing in a slew of odd things she does.\u00a0 For months we\u2019ve gone back and forth, talking with teachers and the school nurse, talking with\u00a0the staff at Children\u2019s Hospital, video-tapping the\u00a0episodes. We\u2019re still not sure. So we scheduled another 24 hr. ambulatory EEG. Sadly, her\u00a0last EEG was\u2026  messy ; her brain spiking on average 40 times a minute. Yesterday my father-in-law went to the hospital with us\u00a0and helped me hold Rhema down while she got the leads on. Rhema has\u00a0had\u00a0more EEGs than I can count since she was two years old. By now she knows the drill, but it is absolutely terrifying , even  painful , to her. \u00a0 As soon as we\u00a0enter the room, she\u00a0is humming nervously and covering her ears. Asking her\u00a0to lay still while a stranger messes with her hair, measures and writes all over her head is like asking a teapot of boiling water not to scream.\u00a0And then we wrap her in sheets and seal her up in a papoose (aka straight jacket.) All she can do is jerk her head back and forth, tears pooling in her\u00a0huge brown eyes. The cold glue that smells like paint thinner, the texture of the gauze, the loud sound of the suction tool near\u00a0her ears \u2013 it\u2019s a sensory onslaught. But she handles it well.  While her head is being wrapped tighly, she says \u201cUh oh, uh oh.\u201d She babble-complains, and I kiss her red-hot cheeks.\u00a0 She calms \u00a0herself with a song\u00a0of words I\u2019ve never heard. This afternoon we\u2019ll go back to the hospital. Rhema has been  so good . She has not tried to rip the leads off her head even once. She kept the backback\u00a0with a\u00a0special recorder on all night long, and she slept peacefully! I\u2019m\u00a0just proud of my brave girl.

{"date": "February 1, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve held off publishing this post because I don\u2019t want it to be sad. My\u00a0aunt wouldn\u2019t want me writing about her in a sad post. We lost her over Christmas rather suddenly, death from multiple health problems. She was a strong Southern woman, mother of three, one with autism. To me she was the Des\u2019ree lyrics: Listen as your day unfolds \n Challenge what the future holds \n Try and keep your head up to the sky Got to be bold, Got to be bad \n Got to be wise, no never sad \n Got to be hard, not too too hard \n All I know is love will save the day Her baby had autism at a time when there was little understanding of it and children like hers were carted off to institutions.\u00a0A time when the  refrigerator mother  theory was still prevalent; mothers were blamed for their children\u2019s delays and odd behaviors. Her firstborn had autism before there were awareness stickers on cars and fundraisers and research organizations. Before the many therapies and treatments and special schools. Before Google and support groups and bloggy communities. But she was  Temple Grandin\u2019s mama  in brown skin. A pioneer because she had to be,\u00a0a battle-tested  veteran . She held on to hope and made a way for her boy in this world. That boy\u00a0with autism is now a man in his forties. My father says he\u2019s asking for his mother, wondering where she is. \u201cShe was his mainstay,\u201d my father says. \u201cShe knew how to reach him and care for him when no one else could.\u201d \u00a0. My sisters and I loved to visit her home in the summer. We were city girls and the cousins called us Oreos \u2013 black on the outside, white on the inside \u2013 and said we talked proper. On my auntie\u2019s land I first learned to take a big bite of watermelon and spit the seeds far. Those Florida days were so humid our pigtails would get puffy and stick straight out. Our skin got so dark, it was a shade of purple. We gathered the corn and shucked it, played basketball with the boys, and looked out for swamp gators that might chew up our baby sister. (Once their dog got eaten by a gator). Then she\u2019d call us, famished, in to lemonade and feed us the best tuna sandwiches I ever tasted. She\u00a0filled us up for the next adventure, and every summer we thanked the Lord for those tuna sandwiches. I really wish I had one right now. I\u2019d sit at her feet and chew on every morsel. I\u2019d hear her hum a hymn. I\u2019d ask her to tell her stories of how she trusted Jesus even when she felt alone in the world with her strange son. How He taught her to mother her boys even though her own mother died so young. How she managed the silence and tantrums and poop-art and picky-eating and dreams deferred. How she found courage in the last days to take her rest; to love them all and leave them to Him. She comes to mind now. On days and nights when autism just seems to make matters worse and everything is hard. I think of her \u2013  mainstay  \u2013 and I\u00a0think\u00a0I can do this. Thank you, Aunt Gen.

{"date": "June 3, 2011", "body": "The girls and I were at the playground. Hope was making all the boys play with her \u2013 appointing one as the evil dragon, another as the ice cream man, and the tall one as her knight. (It goes without saying that she was Princess Pinky of the Play Structure.) Rhema was being Rhema, contentedly running her patterns, only stopping to examine specks in the turf. I stood watching, enjoying the peaceful breeze and a few seconds to be still. Then the quiet was interrupted by a loud shriek. It was a shriek of joy\u00a0from a large boy\u00a0 as he bounded up the ramp and onto the play structure. A young man followed close behind him, chuckling as he went. Clearly the two of them were playing some sort of game. I watched the boy closely in his baggy clothes, baseball cap turned backwards, and hightops. The way he moved, the way he let go of happy sounds as he ran, the way he seemed so out of place \u2013 too old and too big for the space, the way he did not notice or seem to care\u2026 it was all so very familiar to me. Another mother who had only just arrived, declared it time to go and gathered her young before they were run over. She tossed me a look that seemed to say, \u201cSo much for that.\u201d And I realized in that moment that my girls and I were passing as a \u201ctypical\u201d family. I looked at Rhema, and for once, she wasn\u2019t knocking over toddlers as she ran or singing too loudly or eating dirt or  attacking unsuspecting women wearing hair clips . I tried it on for size for a second, only to discover that it just didn\u2019t fit. A woman \u2013 obviously the boy\u2019s mother \u2013 appeared. She tried to tell her son it was time to go. But he resisted, his shrieks growing louder in protest.\u00a0So as\u00a0to avoid a meltdown, she let him play longer and sat down heavily on a bench. I walked over and sat next to her, and as her son let loose a blood-curdling scream I smiled at her hoping to communicate that I loved his happy sounds. Finally I said, \u201cAutism?\u201d She turned to me with a curious look on her face. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cMine, too.\u201d She looked over at Rhema, heard her soft song, saw her repetitive loops. \u201cHow old?\u201d Her voice was gentle. \u201cSeven.\u201d\u00a0 I knew that I could tell her my daughter\u2019s age and not need to say more. I knew she understood that sometimes that\u2019s a complicated question because people see my girl and wonder why a seven-year is acting like a two-year old. She understood how time is moving too fast, how my worries are growing just as tall as my child. \u201cAnd your son? How old is he?\u201d I asked over the shrieking. \u201cTen. He has two words. \u2018Car\u2019 and \u2018Pizza\u2019\u201d, she said proudly. I smiled imagining how celebrated those two words must be. \u201cMy daughter is preverbal, too.\u201d I realized I wasn\u2019t apologetic or sad over that fact (how many times have I intervened on a playground explaining that my girl didn\u2019t understand, that she didn\u2019t have the language?). I was proud like this mama for every little, hard-won word. We talked some more about the schools they attended, and we laughed when her son jumped and let out a new \u201dWhoop\u201d. He sure knew how to have fun. I, without a doubt, loved him. We said goodbye as Rhema took off toward a soccer field of middle-schoolers. In our brief interaction a lifetime of words and stories had been communicated. We were strangers from very different walks of life, yet instantly bonded in our common stories of heartache and joy. There\u2019s a passage in the book of Hebrews that I don\u2019t completely understand but it brings great comfort. The writer describes how Christ himself calls us brothers (and sisters). How He literally came and entered into the humanness of life. He shared, and shares in now, our joys and pains \u2013 bonded to the breast cancer survivor, strapped in with the special needs mama , joined to the single woman longing to be married. That very heart and soul connection I had with the woman at the park, I can have with Him. And how He longs to connect with us! \u2026That\u2019s why he had to enter into every detail of human life. Then, when he came before God as high priest to get rid of the people\u2019s sins, he would have already experienced it all himself\u2014all the pain, all the testing\u2014and would be able to help where help was needed. \u00a0 Hebrews 2:16-18,  The Message As we left the playground I thought of my friend  Andrea\u2019s  description of a gathering of  autism mothers  once: \u201cAll of us had made similar choices, seen beauty in the same light, endured related pangs, been patient for healing, and bear the same badge with pride. Without much explicit sharing or rolling up of any sleeves, we  knew  each other\u2019s life stories\u2013in large part \u2026we left the beach having formed a sisterhood. Women are amazing creatures. And adversity is an amazing bonding agent. Autism is like Krazy Glue. Autism mums can be a diverse lot. Some are angry, some are militant, some are bitter, some are divorced, some depressed. And yet, some glow.\u201d Yes.

{"date": "August 9, 2011", "body": "Rhema was a few months shy of her 2nd birthday when she started receiving speech therapy. There was no autism diagnosis yet, but tests indicated\u00a0a hearing loss due to fluid buildup in her ears. Ear tubes were quickly inserted, and we waited with baited breath for the promised language explosion. Messages to my\u00a0faithful friend Cha: \nDec 2005 \n since she can hear significantly better now, the speech and language should improve. i\u2019m praying to see major improvements very soon\u2026 like NOW. \n Jan 2006 \n she is starting to say some words\u2026 maybe? i still would prefer that she be quoting shakespeare by now. but there goes God teaching me patience and trust again. =) i\u2019ve even enrolled in a speech therapy class\u00a0myself \u2013 i have homework and everything! trying to do what i can to help rhema catch up\u2026 \n March 2006 \n I\u2019m so impatient. I want her to talk, talk, talk and understand everything I teach her. She\u2019s nowhere close to where I want her to be\u2026 Five years and an autism and seizure diagnosis later, Rhema is still pre-verbal. Never has my desire for her to \u2018talk, talk, talk\u2019 wavered. In fact, as she grows older the longing to know her heart-thoughts \u2014 to have even just one real conversation with my girl\u2013 only intensifies. I was thinking about a funny practice we had in my church youth group. The leader would ask if anyone had any prayer requests. Then he\u2019d ask for \u201cunspokens.\u201d Those were prayers requests that you had but\u00a0didn\u2019t want to say\u00a0out loud, so you just quietly raised your hand. Then we\u2019d all pray for the \u201cunspokens.\u201d God heard every word, every request of the heart, even if it was unspoken. It dawned on me that\u00a0Rhema has many unspokens. Oh, how she speaks\u2026 Her big toothy smile and giggles tell me she is so happy to be here Her soft hums say she\u2019s content Her deep gaze with big brown eyes whispers \u2018I know I\u2019m safe with you\u2019 Her spontaneous hug is the only way she knows to say thank you Her shrieks are excitement uncontained Her wailing usually means \u2018I need cheese or a popsicle  stat .\u2019 Her very life is one beautiful, unending song:  God is good! Brandon sent\u00a0the following\u00a0message to\u00a0a friend after Rhema\u2019s ear tube surgery. He could not have known\u2026: She\u2019s BEGINNING to talk\u2026very little, but my estimate is that she was about 8 months behind, so I anticipate a daughter that we can\u2019t get to stop talking in about 5 more months\u2026 You know her name means \u201cGod\u2019s spoken word to the soul/heart\u201d as it is used in the Bible. We always prayed that she would be a witness for Christ\u2026and for months we were afraid that she might not even be able to hear or speak. I quietly thought that perhaps the Lord was going to use her to speak in ways that words might not be able to\u2026that she might have a special gift of communicating or living that spoke of Jesus in speechless ways\u2026but it was ironic that we called her that name and went thru about 1 year wondering if she would ever speak\u2026but she won\u2019t be silenced. Jeneil says we will always tell her of this time and the prayers we prayed\u2026and how special her gift of speaking is\u2026 (Smile). Sometimes God\u2019s plans for our children are even bigger than our own. I daresay, Rhema \u2013\u00a0and the precious ones like her \u2013\u00a0do and will speak of Him in ways that words cannot. And I\u00a0believe there will be a day (if not in this life, then in heaven) when\u00a0she will hear and respond and talk and sing to her Maker forever; she will be unhindered by autism. Until then, there is much to hear. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/unspokens/", "title": "Unspokens"},

{"date": "July 5, 2011", "body": "My Rhema girl has this secret smile. \nI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, but now I know she\u2019s loving. For so long it seemed that\u00a0she could take or leave us. Her only acknowledgement of our existence seemed to be when she wanted something. Never making eye contact, she\u2019d drag me to the refrigerator and thrust my hand toward a food item. She\u2019s never been the kid to greet me with excitement like most children do when a parent arrives at school. In fact, I\u2019m happy if she looks in my direction. People come in and out of her life, and there\u2019s never any indication that she misses them or notices their absence. Nowadays, when she shows affection \u2013 she hugs (kind of) or climbs you like a jungle gym \u2013 but it\u2019s still rather new and random (and back-breaking.) She\u00a0does not\u00a0vocally express care for us. I\u2019ve learned to be ok with that.\u00a0I\u2019ve said before:\u00a0I don\u2019t need her to say or show that she loves me. My mothering is not validated by how she acknowledges me or appreciates my efforts. I do what I do simply because  I  love  her . \u00a0 Still when she demonstrates that we are special to her, when she loves us in her own Rhema way \u2013 it\u2019s deep, pure, spontaneous, sweetly shy yet undeniable, beautiful. The times I glimpse this most is when Brandon returns after a long absence.  A local news station captured it  when he came home last year after 14 months in Iraq. People even wondered aloud if she\u2019d \u201cremember\u201d him. Well. She never said a word, but her  love spoke volumes  as she rubbed her face against his, hugged his neck and belly-laughed. All this time, I did not know. I\u2019d underestimated her capacity for love. The thing is\u2026 not only does she love,  she loves so much , more than I even understand. In the Bible, Paul prayed for us to know the \u201c extravagant dimensions \u201d of the love of Christ. That we would \u201ccomprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth and height\u201d of it. How\u00a0much do we minimize how He loves us?\u00a0How\u00a0often do we live trudging and fighting\u00a0a way through the day, our best solo act, unaware of the greatest life-giving\u00a0 Love , there all along?

{"date": "April 10, 2011", "body": "\u201cGiven the enjoyment that typically developing children\u2026 derive from such engagement [with mirrors], the loss of this opportunity in autism might potentially contribute to further impairments in the development of a sense of self.\u201d \n~ An interesting study\u00a0on autism and sense of self . I feel a little silly writing about this. Such a small thing. (Only not). Rhema has been looking at herself in the mirror. Years ago, I tried to introduce her to herself. Holding a mirror in front of her and pointing to her reflection, I\u2019d say, \u201cSee you? See beautiful you?\u201d But such an activity requires joint attention, which until recently has been severely lacking for Rhema. Additionally, we\u2019ve been working on eye contact for years; if it\u2019s uncomfortable for her to look someone in the eye, perhaps it\u2019s more so to look into her own eyes! When she was two, I was encouraged by an SLP to do \u201cmirror work\u201d with her. I\u2019d sit her in my lap, hold up a mirror, touch her nose and say \u201cnose\u201d, and practice making funny sounds. She would never look directly into the glass, she\u2019d always squirm away. She was so isolated, so hyperactive. I wondered if her disconnection from us and from her surroundings even extended to an utter disconnection from self. Does she even know who she is? Can she recognize her own self? How can she ever relate to the world, to others, if she cannot relate to self? This has long been a concern of mine.  I blogged about it three years ago  and listed some of the things, the most important things, I hope to teach my daughters about themselves: \u2022  I am created in God\u2019s  image  and therefore blessed by Him \u00a0(Gen. 1:27, Gen. 5:1-2) \u2022  God\u2019s hands formed me and made me, and I am fearfully and wonderfully made  (Ps. 119:73, Ps. 139:13,14) \u2022  The Lord has a purpose for me and He will fulfill it  (Ps. 138:8 ) \u2022  God loves me so much that He calls me His child (1 Jn. 3:1-2) and He sent His Son to die for me so that I could live with Him forever  (Jn. 3:16) \u2022  When I am weak, then I am strong. Christ\u2019s power rests on me in my weaknes, and His power is made perfect in my weakness  (2 Cor. 12:9,10) \u2022  I belong to God. I am precious and honored in His sight. God loves me and I am created for His glory  (Isa. 43:1,4,7) \u2022  I am fiercely valued and forever loved by my family . At some point over the years Rhema figured out that the glass reflects her. Still, she avoided looking in mirrors, as if offended by the reflection. I would hold her in front of the mirror, and sometimes she would glance in its direction. But she never looked for more than a second, never tried to interact with it, or babble or touch her image. Unlike her sister who beams and swirls in the looking glass, Rhema derived no pleasure from seeing her own face. Until now. The other day I came upon her looking in the bathroom mirror. Her eyes were so focused, and she stayed there for several seconds. It was so unlike her, so new\u2026 it was like we were both seeing her, recognizing her,\u00a0for the first time. I held my breath, not wanting to interrupt the moment.  My baby is growing up, making so many connections. She is discovering who she is. She continued to gaze into the glass. And then she smiled. At herself. She socially interacted with her \u2018self\u2019 ,  and she liked it! Today I got out the same little mirror I used with her when she was two years old. See what she sees: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 See you? See beautiful you? . The apostle Paul wrote this of the Lord\u2019s return:  \u201cFor now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\u201d (1 Cor. 13:12) \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autistscorner.blogspot.com/2010/10/whos-that-in-mirror-autism-and.html", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/mirror1.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/mirror2.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/mirror3.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/mirror4.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/her-image/", "title": "Her image"},

There are faces and conversations, there\u2019s my job in the city; our comings and goings. But most of the day\u2019s page\u00a0is covered with lines of\u00a0Rhema and me. I see myself dressing her in the morning, helping her in the bathroom, engaging in our daily tooth-brushing battle. I\u2019m giving her her meds, trying to find something she\u2019ll eat, working us both through a meltdown. I see myself talking intently with her teacher or therapist while holding her hand. I hear her sweet voice saying \u201cHi, hi, hi\u201d and \u201cBye, bye, bye\u201d when prompted \u2013 often the only words she ever says to me in a day. And then just as I close my eyes for a brief sleep, I\u00a0spot the little girl in the blank spaces. All day she\u2019s been there, just outside the lines. At age four, she\u2019s\u00a0so independent\u00a0\u2013 getting ready for school, lugging her backpack behind her, buckling herself in. She\u2019s playing I-Spy and telling\u00a0the same made-up knock-knock jokes that make no sense at all\u00a0and laughing like it\u2019s the funniest thing she\u2019s ever said. She\u2019s praying for Daddy to come home soon, praying for her sister to talk, praying for Mommy to catch her train. She\u2019s stooping nearby like a faithful friend while her sister is on the floor and 3 adults are trying to help her stand. She\u2019s hugging my legs while I\u2019m on the phone scheduling another EEG appointment because she  believes  that hugs make everything better. One\u00a0piece of the story\u00a0stands out to me. I\u2019m struggling to get Rhema to keep her shoes on and get in the car. The girls will be late to school, I\u2019ll be late to work. In a moment of frustration I\u2019m not proud of, I cry out loud, \u201cGod, why is this so hard???\u201d Instantly I hear a little voice, on the periphery, praying earnestly: \u201cDear God, please help Mommy. Please help Rhema. Thank you. Amen.\u201d Of course, He hears her prayer. And when her sister begins to cry, she steps over the line and comes to center. She pats a back, offers a hug. Even though she\u2019s pushed away, she doesn\u2019t seem to mind.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Rhema. Mommy\u2019s not mad at you. I\u2019m not mad at you.

I turn back to her big sister \u2013 she needs me more right now. \u00a0 My Hope knows. She\u2019s seemed to know since she was born. She\u2019s used to it.

Friends would comment, \u2018Wow, she\u2019s really in her own world.\u2019 Relatives and strangers would ask me if she could hear. I once joked that we could host a marching band in our living room and she wouldn\u2019t notice. But lately Rhema is  aware . Suddenly she seems interested in things happening around her. She notices other people, too \u2013 children and adults alike, she appreciates them in her space, she is excited by their presence. She smiles, she giggles, she\u2026 wallops them on the head. If she really loves you, she pummels you. Hope is the hardest hit. In recent months, Rhema has  discovered  her sister.

{"date": "July 1, 2010", "body": "A few months ago Rhema\u2019s was blood tested for lead. Her pica was at an all-time high and she was literally eating through the window sills and gnawing on pieces of wood. We live in a colonial style house built in the 1880\u2019s so we knew there was a chance the house had lead-based paint. Rhema and Hope\u2019s lead levels had been tested in previous years and had been within the normal range. On a Monday morning I\u00a0was informed\u00a0that Rhema\u2019s lead\u00a0levels were dangerously high, and that she needed to go to the hospital immediately for tests and x-rays.\u00a0 Doctors at Children\u2019s Hospital\u00a0gave us\u00a02 options: a 5-day hospital stay that included continuous IV chelation treatment through a PICC line or outpatient chelation therapy that would take many months. Rhema does fairly well with hospital stays, but the transition back home is usually a nightmare. And I had visions of fighting my girl to keep her from yanking the PICC line. We decided to go with the outpatient treatment and doctors warned that as long as her lead level did not get over 40 (the normal range is 0-9), she could stay out of the hospital. The highest her level ever got was 39. The state immediately got involved. They did inspections on the house and trained me in \u201chazard reduction\u201d practices \u2013 which basically meant a lot of scrubbing floors and baseboards on my hands and knees. The state even took before and after dust samples to make sure I was cleaning right! They deemed the house \u201chot\u201d (i.e. there\u2019s a whole lotta lead), and the house has to be deleaded. (Thankfully, we just rent the house so we won\u2019t be footing that hefty bill. But I do have to pack up the house in the next two weeks, and the girls and I will be moving into a hotel for a month while the house is deleaded.) Brandon was able to come home from Iraq for a short time in May when we met with doctors. With his heart in his throat he asked, \u201cDid this hurt her?\u201d We were told that \u201cno lead is good lead\u201d, that even small amounts can cause serious health problems. The high level of lead in her body and the amount of time it had been there indicated chronic poisoning. (Doctors conducted a test to measure lead in her tissues \u2013 a normal result is 30 or below; Rhema\u2019s came back at 109.)  Lead poisoning  symptoms include reduced IQ, learning disabilities, hyperactivity, delayed growth, hearing problems, behavior problems, headaches, digestive issues, difficulty sleeping, and my favorite, \u201closs of new abilities, especially speech skills.\u201d I thought of all the ABA and speech therapy\u00a0sessions\u00a0and how hard we\u2019ve worked over the past few years to help Rhema learn and develop. I thought of how we\u2019d finally gotten her seizure disorder under control which meant she\u2019d have a better chance of learning. And all this time she had yet another disadvantage, her poor little body was  toxic . How much time had we lost? What gains were missed because she was poisoned? How would this impact the rest of her life? I hated. I hated the house (so much grief in this darn house). I hated the autism that caused my 6-year old to lick baseboards and put anything and everything in her mouth. I hated myself for exposing her to it, for not seeing the signs, for not getting her tested sooner. I hated having to deal with yet one more thing. The lead problem surfaced\u00a0at a deeply\u00a0painful\u00a0time in our lives, and I don\u2019t remember how I functioned for those first several weeks. I was lost in a sea of discouragement, guilt and despair like I\u2019ve never known, and I wanted to drown in it. But somehow\u00a0the stubborn grace of God\u2026 and an undeniable peace\u2026 would not let me go. In a hospital room years ago I \u201claid my Isaac down.\u201d (I find I have to do this with both my children, but with my\u00a0Rhema it\u2019s more often, almost daily.) Those of you who have put your \u201cIsaac\u201d on the altar know what I\u2019m talking about. You go against every motherly instinct you have\u2026 and you let go. In joy and tears, you take your treasure and you offer her up to the One who made her and loaned her to you. You believe that she is His\u2019. At your core, you believe this. That He loves her far\u00a0better than you do. I trust that He who cannot miss when a sparrow falls, will care for and hold up my little Rhema Amelia Russell. And just as I look back on all the challenges and setbacks in the past years, I cannot help but see the ways the Lord has faithfully provided. At every turn I see His hand, His guidance, comfort and grace. The past few months have involved driving to Boston several times a month to meet with doctors and test Rhema\u2019s blood. She responded extremely well to her first round of treatment, and her levels came down. They have since rebounded and we are looking at another round of chelation. But the changes in her behavior have been astounding. A few months ago she was\u00a0pinging off the walls, eating non-edibles, smearing poop, and regressing in almost every area. Today she is doing so well! She is calm, more attentive and engaged; she is understanding language and saying more words everyday. Yes. God is good. All the time.

{"date": "July 9, 2010", "body": "\u201cClap your hands\u2026 shout to God with cries of joy.\u201d Psalm 47:1 \u00a0 Rhema attends\u00a0a\u00a0small school\u00a0for children with autism that is\u00a0the best kept secret in the state. The teachers are miracle workers. And everybody knows everybody, and it just feels like family there. A few weeks ago I attended a graduation program at the school. Parents, siblings, grandparents and friends huddled into the gross motor room for the ceremony. When the Integrated Kindergarten class came out, I recognized almost all the kids in the class. Many of them started out with Rhema in the public school at the age of three. Oh, to see them now! I felt so proud of them as they sang their songs and received their little diplomas. I exchanged teary smiles with their mothers. Then it hit me that they had autism. I had sort of forgotten. The children standing before me could speak, answer to their names, follow directions, hold conversations, participate in group activities, sing, read, write. My child with autism does none of these things. The contrast was devastating. I looked down at the program and saw my daughter\u2019s name listed under the Intensive School. Such a huge gap between \u201cIntegrated\u201d and \u201cIntensive\u201d, sometimes it seems to make all the difference in the world. Rhema = Intensive. Of course. That\u2019s what she is, that\u2019s what she\u00a0needs. But why does it still\u00a0crush me sometimes? I was anxious. What in the world were they going to do with Rhema? She would not be able to perform as the other children had \u2013 there would be no reading an essay or singing along to a song. Would she even respond to her name being called to receive her certificate? When Rhema\u2019s group came out, she was guided to her chair with one teacher beside her and one teacher behind her. She would not look directly at the audience, but she had a huge smile on her face and her whole body looked like it could barely contain her excitement. She flapped her hands, swung her feet back and forth\u00a0under her chair, knocked her knees, laughed out loud. In\u00a0an instant, my dismay left me. Her joy was catching. A recorded song played: \u201cClap your hands, clap your hands!\u201d With the lightest prompts \u2013 a hand to the elbow from teacher Kate \u2013 Rhema squealed, put her hands together and clapped for all she was worth. (Later Kate told me that Rhema had never done it independently before \u2013 they always had to \u201chand over hand\u201d her. For years Rhema has had\u00a0trouble flattening her hands to clap. Her fingers would\u00a0always curl in.) And I was done for. Lord, if this is it, if this is all there is \u2013  I thank you!  For\u00a0she can hear the words \u201cClap your hands.\u201d She can, with a little assistance, follow that instruction. She has hands to raise and all the motor planning and coordination it takes to put\u00a0them together. And she has pure happines in her heart and on her face. I won\u2019t compare, I won\u2019t count any losses today, I won\u2019t take this for granted. Thank you, thank you, thank you Lord. But there was more. Of course there was more. \u201cStomp your feet, stomp your feet!\u201d Kate helped Rhema stomp her feet. Then Rhema bounded out of her chair and began jumping up and down. The recording followed: \u201cJump up in the air, jump in the air!!!\u201d (This was her favorite part, and she almost jumped herself right out of the room.) Next the teachers sang a song that had each child\u2019s name in a verse. Rhema\u2019s name was first and it was clear she knew they were singing to her. While they sang her verse,\u00a0she tilted her head up and fixed her gaze on a spot on the ceiling, grinning all the while. When the song said, \u201cStand up and take a bow\u201d, Kate helped her out of her chair. But instead of taking a bow, Rhema clapped her hands wildly. (I\u2019m telling you, my girl stole the show. 8) ) She lacks nothing , I thought. At times her challenges may seem so pronounced to me and others; and no doubt autism robs her of many things. But in that moment, I only saw a child, complete, filled to overflowing with love, joy, contentment. And it was so enough. \u201c\u2026And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.\u201d Eph. 3:19 My \u201cdisabilities\u201d are not quite as obvious as Rhema\u2019s, but oh, they are there. In this life I have found my soul in an empty, destitute state\u2026 wanting, needing  something  to make up for my lack. The Bible verse reminded me \u2013 Rhema reminded me \u2013 that only God, full of fullness itself, can fill those places in me\u2026 so as to leave nothing wanting.\u00a0Col. 2:19\u00a0says, \u201cAnd ye are complete in Him.\u201d So I took a cue from my daughter. I raised my hands and clapped and cheered like we\u2019d found the\u00a0hidden treasure.

{"date": "June 12, 2011", "body": "Transitions have become increasingly difficult for Rhema. Be it from the dinner table to the bath, the house to the car, the car to the house, upstairs to downstairs\u2026\u00a0she is not coping well with moving from one thing to the next. When I try to help her along by taking her hand, she resists. Touching her triggers her fight reflex, and she quickly escalates to full meltdown. Thus, her teachers and I have learned that it\u2019s best not to touch her in these transitions. I still have been unable to get respite care. But God has sent us an angel named  Melissa . She was Rhema\u2019s aide last summer, and is helping us again this year. She\u2019s had to meet a long list of requirements to be recognized by the military program as a respite care provider. One of these is a background check by the FBI. (!) So down to the police station we went \u2013 Melissa, Rhema, Hope and I \u2013 to get Melissa\u00a0finger-printed. We waited nearly an hour in a sectioned-off area at the front of the station. Finally Melissa\u2019s fingerprints were done, and we were ready to go. Rhema was not. I think she wanted to walk through the station. We had waited all that time \u2013 there must be something to do or see \u2013 we couldn\u2019t just leave. So Melissa and I tried everything to coax her from her chair. \u201cRhema! It\u2019s time to go bye-bye! All done!\u201d We said with exaggerated cheerfulness. We dangled reinforcers \u2013 the iTouch, pen and paper to scribble on, bottled water. Melissa ran outside into the rain and waved and called to Rhema through a window. I held out my hand \u2013 careful not to touch her \u2013 and urged, \u201cC\u2019mon, baby. C\u2019mon.\u201d This went on for some time, but nothing worked. At one point Rhema inched toward the door and then\u00a0rushed back to her seat. I dug down deep for patience and calm. I crouched\u00a0down in front of her chair, \u201cPiggy back ride?\u201d She climbed on, and I booked it to the door. Outside, Rhema realized she\u2019d been duped. She flipped off my back and\u00a0headed toward the station. I intercepted her. She dropped to the ground flailing, struggling with me in the wet grass. I asked Melissa to take Hope to the van. Unfortunately we were parked around the corner. Rhema bolted to a stairwell\u00a0leading down to a\u00a0cellar. There was a chain blocking it, but she ignored it and raced down the dark stairs. I followed her, scared to death that we\u2019d encounter a rodent. \u201cRhema,\u201d I pleaded, holding out my hand. \u201cPlease come. Please come. Time to go.\u201d Moments later she bolted past me, up the stairs, across the grass. Again I tried to stop her, fearful now that she\u2019d run into the street. Instead she ran down the sidewalk \u2013 the opposite direction of where I\u2019d parked. I caught her and tried to steer her toward the van. Cars zoomed by, she sat down in the rain, held onto my leg for dear life, and refused to move. I looked into her glazed eyes \u2013 she\u00a0was so lost, so confused, so, so scared. Rhema. She jumped and blindly raced up another set of stairs \u2013 this time into an apartment building. Two rather tough-looking women were standing on a small porch at the top of the stairs, smoking. They had witnessed our struggle on the street. I tried to explain, \u201cShe has autism\u2026\u201d Inside, Rhema attempted to open every single door. The mat in front of one door said \u201cPolice Line Do Not Cross.\u201d Before I realized it was a joke, I thought, My kid\u2019s breaking into a halfway house! As we raced back out, past the women, one of them called out to me softly, kindly, \u201cShe\u2019s really pretty.\u201d If I could have stopped\u00a0I would have certainly thanked her\u2026 and dissolved into tears on the spot. Somehow I managed to carry\u00a0Rhema all the way to the car. We were dirty and soaked. Melissa helped me try to get her into her car seat, but she was too strong. She wrestled herself away and ran all the way back to the police station. I found her humming and rocking, sitting in that same chair inside the station. And that\u2019s when I cried. I had a sense at that moment that we\u2019d entered into a new phase of our journey, one that I\u2019m not prepared for, one that is infinitely harder than I ever could have imagined. Where my biggest wish is not that my child speak or make it into a mainstream school setting; my goal is simply that we make it through the day. It feels like autism \u2013 this older, bigger, stronger form \u2013 is slapping me around and breaking my heart. In desperation I asked an officer to help me get my girl to the car. He was  not  helpful, but he did let us walk through the station and go out a back door, shortening the distance I\u2019d have to travel to the van. After some time, Melissa and I were able to get Rhema into the trunk of the van. Melissa sat quietly with Rhema in her arms. We gave her a drink. Slowly Rhema began to calm, and to weep. Eventually we were able to\u00a0get her into her car seat. Compliant, she let us buckle her. As I drove her home Melissa said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know if those were Rhema\u2019s tears or yours. Were you crying?\u201d My smile was sad. \u201cMaybe\u2026 just a little.\u201d . \u201cBe careful, keep calm and don\u2019t be afraid. Do not lose heart\u2026\u201d  ~Isaiah 7:4 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mat.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/detained-at-the-police-station/", "title": "Detained at the Police\u00a0Station"},

Rhema had no school for the day. Hope had a dance class at the YMCA.\u00a0While we waited for Hope, Rhema sat by the window the whole time, staring at the pool, yearning to be in the water. (The fact that she sat at all is noteworthy!) There was a time when Rhema\u00a0was so far away, so lost in her own world. She did not seem to feel strongly about anything or anyone in her environment. Only objects that made repetitive noises or could be flapped held her interest. She could care less about the kids\u00a0and toys and activities around her. So nowadays, when\u00a0we see that\u00a0she really wants something\u00a0\u2013 or (joy, joy!) she communicates\u00a0it to us in some way (a PEC symbol,\u00a0a verbal approximation) \u2013 well, of course we jump through hoops to get it for her. So when I sent the picture to B, I did not bother to write a caption. I knew he\u2019d know what I wanted to say.\u00a0\u201c Does this picture not capture \u201clonging\u201d? And look at her! She *wants* something! B, she loves to swim. I hope she understands. I hope she knows how much I wish I could let her get in the pool.\u201d B\u2019s response: \u201cI look at this picture and am comforted.\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0comforted because I know with all that this life has for us in terms\u00a0of challenges or desires or whatever, I WANT Rhema to go swimming\u2026 as her father, I WANT nothing more than to take her myself.\u00a0Our heavenly Father sees us looking through the window at life,\u00a0and WANTS good things for us.\u00a0Just like I see Rhema looking and innocently desiring to jump in that water, so too He watches us\u00a0and CARES\u00a0about our desires.\u00a0I have to TRUST Him that He will give us what we need and, when it is\u00a0good for us,\u00a0He truly wants us to have what\u00a0we desire.\u201d So many things I desperately  want \u2026 my Rhema to speak, my Hope to be allergy-free, my marriage to thrive, my sister to be well, my friends to heal. But in the wanting and the waiting, sweet comfort is found:  He gives good gifts . Our longings, God sees. Our hearts, God knows. And He loves even more\u2026 than a father who would move heaven and earth to go swimming with his girl. . Ed note: I wrote most of this post last fall when Brandon was stationed in Iraq. Since he\u2019s been home, he\u2019s gone swimming with Rhema. =) Another  special father  sent me a message\u00a0with the lyrics to this  Bob Carlisle song , and reminded me of the\u00a0extravagant love of the Father. \u201cNow to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think\u2026\u201d Eph. 3:20 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/pool.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWGq9z5lccs", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/pool.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/father-i-want/", "title": "Father, I want\u2026"},

{"date": "March 22, 2011", "body": "\u201cI slept and dreamt life was joy, I awoke and saw life was service, I acted, and behold, service was joy.\u201d \n ~Rabindranath Tagore . We limp into church. It\u2019s been a rough weekend for many reasons. My oldest girl is one reason. She\u2019s out of sorts, non-compliant, hard to control, destroying everything in her path like a bull in a china shop, and\u00a0pinging off the walls since 12:30 am. I\u2019m longing for heaven not because I want to see Jesus but just because I\u2019d like to escape life. \u00a0 . A young woman, B, sits in the front of the church, as she does every Sunday, with her elderly parents. B has some developmental delays and a number of health issues, including a seizure disorder. She worships in the sanctuary with all her heart. In the middle of the sermon B suddenly makes a loud, hacking noise. The preaching stops abruptly; it\u2019s eerily quiet. All eyes settle on B as she proceeds to vomit in the front row. For a moment all that can be heard are the helpless sounds of retching. The sound of\u00a0her suffering fills the room. Instantly Brandon is on his feet, as are a few others. Someone retrieves B\u2019s walker and gently, lovingly helps her out of the sanctuary. With each slow step she takes, she looks up, and people pray for her. Piano music is playing softly now. Others quickly come in with towels and, without a word, clean up the mess; one on her knees wipes the floor. Tears burn the back of my eyes. Because when you have a child with special needs,  every  child with\u00a0special needs\u00a0is your child. There are moments in life when you know that you are witness to something holy, something bigger than yourself and bigger than the moment. When words don\u2019t suffice, and all you know is that God has something to say. I live in such a moment as I watch these people serve B, hold her up, clean her up,  love  her. I once heard it said and now know it\u2019s true:  Christ is present when the weak are loved and served. As lovely Rhema sits beside me in the pew, humming away, seemingly oblivious to what is happening around her, I drop my head and\u00a0hear the message: Just like this. Just like this, I have loved you.  You, weak and needy and hurting and helpless. I, your God, kneel down and wipe away your horrible mess. I help you up and walk with you, every painful, limping step. I uphold you in my hand. Lift your head. Do you see? Do you see\u00a0how I love you? I love you with an  everlasting love .  Now, I have blessed you and entrusted you with a very precious, very special one. And you get to spend your life pouring yourself out for her. It\u2019s not easy or glamorous or even acknowledged, but when you serve her \u2013 when you get up with her in the middle of the night, when you clean her poop, when you drive her to speech therapy every Saturday, when you go to great lengths to keep her safe and help her grow \u2013 you serve me! So do it in\u00a0gladness and patience, and I will be your help. I hug Rhema, my gift, close to me. My heart gives in to joy.

In the late afternoon, as soon as we get home from work and school, she makes a mess in the bathroom. My back was turned for a minute, my coat still on, trying to find something for dinner. But now the walls, the sink, the rug, her hands, her hair are covered in poo. Carrying her up the stairs without soiling anything else is\u2026 tricky. I tell a hungry Hope she\u2019ll have to wait a little longer for dinner. \u201cHow do you say HUNGRY in sign language?\u201d she calls out to me. She\u2019s in the tub, and I think about the mess downstairs. She\u2019d gone into the bathroom at least, and that was something. \u201cYou tried, Rhema girl,\u201d I tell her.\u00a0\u201cI know you tried.\u201d I scrub her clean. Throw rug in washer. Wash walls. Cook dinner. She eats. At the age of 3, they\u00a0diagnosed her with\u00a0a feeding disorder and I took it personally. She no longer has feeding issues. But I\u2019m always so relieved when she eats. \u201cUse your spoon.\u201d She ignores me. I hand-over-hand her, guiding the pasta shapes onto her spoon. But she takes her free hand and scoops the food off the\u00a0spoon and into her mouth. Hope needs more milk and more ketchup and her tummy hurts and \u2018how do you spell spaghetti?\u2019 and I still haven\u2019t changed and I\u2019ve got to start dinner for the husband.\u00a0No time to sit with Rhema and help her use her spoon. She wipes spaghetti sauce into her freshly washed hair. \u201cNapkin! Use the napkin!\u201d She is startled by my raised voice. But she splays her fingers across the napkin; it seems to take all her concentration. Then she goes back to eating and back to not using her\u00a0spoon and back to wiping her hands in her hair. Back upstairs we go. I wash her clean. She did use the\u00a0spoon. Once. Kind of. She did use the napkin. Once. Kind of. And that\u2019s something. \u201cYou tried, Rhema girl,\u201d I tell her gently. \u201cI know you tried.\u201d The rest of the evening is a struggle. Clothes on. Clothes off. She tries\u00a0to eat Q-tips out of the trash can. She breaks\u00a0a light bulb and doesn\u2019t seem to notice her bloody fingers. Lots of non-compliance and lots of distressed humming and it\u2019s finally bed time. She\u2019s a heap on the floor and won\u2019t get up. \u201cCome on, babe. Time for bed.\u201d She just won\u2019t come. I try to lift her off the floor, but she\u2019s too heavy for me now. And\u00a0my heart and soul are weary\u00a0tonight. I leave her and escape to the bathroom. I briefly imagine myself mother to a neurotypical Rhema. Why, God, why? Why, why, why? I give myself permission to grieve for a minute. (Because leaving her unattended for more than a minute is asking for trouble.) She\u2019s still on the floor. It\u2019s been a long day with so many demands and she\u2019s had about enough of it all. I sit down next to her and haul her into my lap. Her forehead touches mine, and I tuck a ringlet behind her ear. She\u2019s growing. Gosh, she\u2019s growing so beautiful. Her big front tooth is loose and sticking out and I\u2019m not ready for her to turn into a snaga-toothed 7-year old. I savor her nearness. We\u00a0know God\u2019s much-needed grace, and our spirits calm. \u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cHi, hi, hi,\u201d she says mechanically. It\u2019s the first real conversation we\u2019ve had all day, and I love the sound of her sweet voice. \u201cI love you,\u201d I remind her. \u201cI\u00a0luh yew, I\u00a0luh yew,\u201d she repeats quickly. It\u2019s been a  long time  since I\u2019ve heard that, and it\u2019s just a whisper and it\u2019s still not clear. But I know she tried. And oh yes, it\u2019s something.

{"date": "March 24, 2011", "body": "Rhema has a Family ID program at school. I got myself all worked up when she  first started this program . She is presented with 3 pictures \u2013 one of Hope, one of her Dad, and one of me.\u00a0 And her teacher says, \u201cRhema, touch Dad.\u201d It started with full prompts. Her teacher\u00a0would guide Rhema\u2019s hand to the picture of Dad. Over time the prompts faded to a touch at the elbow.\u00a0 And now, after a year and a half of working on this every day at school, Rhema can do it independently!!! At her IEP meeting last week,\u00a0we were\u00a0told that she has even said our names when she touches the pictures. Brandon and I could hardly believe this. We have yet to see it with our own eyes, hear it with our ears. But after the meeting I was \u201csuper excited\u201d, as Hope would say. Rhema\u2019s never called my name. She\u2019s never called me anything. If she ever did, well, then I missed it. And I\u2019ve kind of been on the look-out for it for 7 years. So I don\u2019t think I missed it. But Rhema has progressed so much in terms of language that \u2013 with a little work \u2013\u00a0we can get her to repeat just about any\u00a01 or 2-syllable word. Yes. HUGE! So I thought, I\u2019ll teach her my name! What should I have her call me? Hhhhhmmmm. Mom? That\u2019s a nice, short, one-syllable word. And that\u2019s what they use at school. But  my  mother was not crazy about \u201cMom.\u201d She preferred we call her \u201cMommy\u201d. Because \u201cMom\u201d made her feel old. And then in 7 th  grade I started taking Latin and decided to call my mother \u201cMater.\u201d \u00a0(And I still do to this day. \u201cSalve, Mater,\u201d I say. She loves it. I think.) My Mommy/Mater and me in 1985, living in Panama My mother called her mother \u201cMama.\u201d While I like calling myself Mama in writing, it\u2019s a little too country for me in the real world. Similarly, Brandon calls his mother \u201cMa.\u201d Yeah. Not happening. This ain\u2019t Little House on the Prairie. So after much contemplation, I led Rhema to her room and stood her in front of me. I gripped her shoulders, gazed into her eyes. It was a historic moment. \u201cRhema,\u201d I said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Mommy!\u201d And then I fell down laughing. (My kid must think I\u2019ve finally lost all my marbles). I got myself together. \u201cRhema. Say \u2018Mommy.\u2019\u201d Silence. \u201cSay \u2018Mommy.\u2019\u201d Nothing. I needed reinforcements. I\u00a0pulled out\u00a0a popsicle. \u201cRhema. Say \u2018Mommy.\u2019\u201d \u201cPop.\u201d \u201cNoooo. That\u2019s my Dad.\u201d \u201cPop. Pop.\u201d \u201cOh. Pop. You want pop?\u201d \u201cPop.

Finally, later that night, it. happened. I don\u2019t know if she was congested or just had trouble with the sounds or what. And she always says words at least twice in a row.

An old soul, so perceptive and sensitive to the feelings of others, always quick to encourage.  Will you, God, foster these gifts in her as she lives life with her special sister? Will you keep her from becoming cynical, jaded and burnt out? Will she see her sister not as a bother or burden, but as valuable teacher and inspiration? Will you hold her during times of fear, frustration, embarassment\u00a0or disappointment? Will you give her a deep bond with her sister \u2013 one that does not depend on spoken word or touch. Will you teach her to love without conditon and grow\u00a0it in her,\u00a0true and patient? Will you bless their relationship\u00a0to last\u00a0long after\u00a0we are gone? \n~  my prayer , one year ago A couple times a week I must pick Rhema up from school first, and then we pick up Hope.\u00a0 This\u00a0is always a challenge. Racing the halls (knocking down anyone in her path), dumping buckets of toys, charging into classrooms, eating someone\u2019s science project, taking every single glue cap off\u2026 these are just some of Rhema\u2019s antics at Hope\u2019s school. I try to keep a firm hold on her, but it\u2019s nearly impossible to do that and get Hope packed up to leave. And once\u00a0we are\u00a0ready to go, Rhema is fully engrossed in some activity and has no intention of leaving. Cue meltdown. Today as I was struggling with Rhema on the floor, Hope stood patiently off to the side. I\u2019d asked her to hold everything \u2013 her backpack, her coat, Rhema\u2019s coat, a bag of winter clothes. A girl, about Rhema\u2019s age, stepped into the hall with what appeared to be her mother. The girl said loudly, disdainfully, \u201cHope\u2019s sister is  crazy !\u201d The woman said something to the girl, and they disappeared. I looked at Hope and saw a strange\u00a0expression on her face \u2013 an  awareness  I\u2019d never seen before. And then, just as quickly, it was gone. Normally, I am not too bothered about the things children say. Kids have often made comments about Rhema, and it\u2019s given me opportunities to talk to them about autism. But today felt different. For one, Hope was not oblivious to it. And neither, I believe, was Rhema.\u00a0Rhema may not understand the words, but she certainly understands tone of voice. She may not show that she hears it, but I know that she is always listening. At home, I gave Hope a baggie full of pretzels and we had a heart to heart. \u201cSo,\u00a0let\u2019s talk about what\u00a0happened\u00a0at school today.\u201d \u201cYou wanna\u00a0talk about\u00a0G? She said my sister is  crazy .\u201d \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s true,\u201d Hope said in her slow, matter-of-fact way. Oy. \u201cYour sister acts differently than other kids, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cYeah. Because of her awe-tism.\u201d \u201cWhat does she do that\u2019s different?\u201d \u201cUm\u2026,\u201d she said munching her pretzels. \u201cShe likes to poop in the\u00a0 tub, she doesn\u2019t play with us, she rolls on the floor a lot, she goes \u2018Eeee oooo Eeee oooo\u2019 a lot.\u201d \u201cYep. She\u2019s different like that. And I know sometimes it\u2019s hard. And sometimes other people don\u2019t understand. But it is never right to say unkind things to her or about her. Right?\u201d She nodded. \u201cWhat are some things that Rhema does really well?\u201d \u201cUm\u2026\u201d \u201cShe has really good balance, right?\u201d \u201cYeah! And she\u2019s really good at puzzles and the iTouch and putting movies in the DVD player and sitting on every bench\u00a0at the park!\u201d \u201cSo the next time someone says something that\u2019s not nice about her, you can tell them all the things she\u2019s good at.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cMommy, you be G and I\u2019ll be Hope, ok? \u201cUm. Ok.\u201d \u201cSay, \u2018Hope\u2019s sister is  crazy !\u2019\u201d \u201cO\u2026 ok. Hope\u2019s sister is  crazy !\u201d \u201cNo, she\u2019s not. She\u2019s my sister. And she\u2019s not crazy.

I am grateful for all of the autism mamas who have shared their stories and taught me how to  listen  and to talk to my daughter about her sister\u2019s autism.) She finished her\u00a0snack and informed me that she needed to\u00a0find Rhema right away\u00a0and tell her that she\u2019s special.

Yeah.) We\u00a0keep watch over Rhema with a\u00a0monitor when she\u2019s in her bedroom at night. For a while it worked well, but then she started yanking the plug for the camera. So we set a ledge up high in the new house, and Peter actually put an outlet near the ceiling. Locks, locks, locks on almost every door including the closet in her bedroom\u2026 Sure, she\u2019ll find a way. Eventually she\u2019ll slide a chair over, climb atop and undo the latch. But at least this buys us some time, and there are alarms on the main doors\u2026 . Rhema  loves  to  dance in windows . I wanted her to have the room with the best windows in the house. But of course there is the problem of our little  escape artist \u00a0jumping out. The men came up with a clever way to secure the windows \u2013 let\u2019s just say, she won\u2019t be getting out. Many of the outlets in the bedrooms are connected to light switches. But a lamp in Rhema\u2019s room is a disaster waiting to happen.\u00a0(In the past, we\u2019ve had to\u00a0remove all the light bulbs from her room.) So we put in a ceiling light. I look\u00a0 forward to the day when she can safely have more than just her bed in her room. For now, less is more. We are planning to rip out\u00a0her carpet and put down a wood floor ( \u2013 makes cleaning poop art easier). We are installing a fence around the house in the next couple months. All of this in an effort to keep safe this precious child that God has entrusted to us. (And, yes,\u00a0to protect some property as well!). I am keenly aware of the fact that in spite of all these things, my girl can still find danger and mishap. \u201cYou who sit down in the High God\u2019s presence, \nspend the night in Shaddai\u2019s shadow, \nSay this: \u201cGod, you\u2019re my refuge. \nI trust in you and I\u2019m safe!\u201d \nThat\u2019s right\u2014he rescues you from hidden traps, \nshields you from deadly hazards. \nHis huge outstretched arms protect you\u2014 \nunder them you\u2019re perfectly safe; \nhis arms fend off all harm. Yes, because God\u2019s your refuge, \n the High God your very own home, \n Evil can\u2019t get close to you, \n harm can\u2019t get through the door. \n He ordered his angels \n to guard you wherever you go.\u201d \nPsalm 91, The Message . And so I pray. For freedom and joy for my family. For His truth and light to invade every room. For mercy and grace to flood the halls of this house.

{"date": "February 16, 2011", "body": "\u201cThis is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\u201d \n(Ps. 118:24) . I\u00a0wear two watches\u00a0\u2013 one because it lights up and has an alarm and the other because it\u2019s pretty \u2013 and check them both. Got less than an hour\u00a0to get\u00a0the girls\u00a0cleaned, clothed, fed and off to school. Got to board that express train to Boston. Rhema immediately goes into, what we call, the \u201cblind girl routine.\u201d She puts her arm over her face and squeezes her eyes shut tight. She stumbles around crashing into things, refusing to open her eyes. Nevertheless\u2026 clothes are donned, curly heads are brushed, bags are packed, faces are wiped (only a ketchup smudge of Hope\u2019s cheek remains), socks, boots, coats, hats and mittens are put on. Rush down the stairs and into the car because we\u2019re running late. Where\u2019s Rhema? I rush back up. She\u2019s huddled in a corner at the top of the stairs, her eyes squeezed shut. Pants, boots and socks are\u00a0off. I re-dress her and lead her, un-seeing, down the stairs. Clock\u2019s a-ticking. First stop, Hope\u2019s school. In\u00a0the parking lot Rhema opens her eyes. S-N-O-W!!! Her favorite food. White snow, brown snow, yellow snow \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 she loves it all. She\u00a0is\u00a0Ms. PacMan, the parking lot is her maze, she\u00a0shovels fistfuls of snow into her mouth. Inside Hope removes her coat while I get out her snack, her lunch, her folder and her item for Show and Share. \u201cRhema, stop!\u201d Hope giggles, trying to keep her balance. Rhema is munching the snow off the bottom of Hope\u2019s boot. Someone walks past us, and a few pieces of snow are left behind on the carpeted hallway. Like a parched traveler in the desert, Rhema dives to the ground and eats the snow out of the carpet. My\u00a0quick conversation with\u00a0Hope\u2019s teacher\u00a0gives\u00a0Rhema the chance to throw off her coat and mittens and run to the art table. I\u00a0bid\u00a0Hope goodbye and turn to find Rhema wielding scissors and a glue stick. \u201cTime to go, babe,\u201d I say cheerfully, gathering up her coat and mittens. Where in the world is that hat? But she doesn\u2019t want to go. She hits the floor and covers her face. She kicks off her boots. We struggle,\u00a0my girl\u00a0and I. I manage\u00a0 to get her clothes and shoes\u00a0on. She doesn\u2019t cry or make a sound. She just refuses to get up. She\u2019s strong and bulky, and\u00a0I cannot get her to stand. I hear choo choos in my head.\u00a0My\u00a0train is\u00a0going to leave me. Then I remember a technique her teachers at Futures taught me called the Pre-school Sweep.\u00a0 Get her in a seated position. Stoop behind her with your knees pointed to the side (not into her back). Slide your arms under hers and\u00a0wrap your hands over her wrists. Then lift. She\u2019s much bigger than a preschooler, but it works. We take a few steps, and she\u2019s down again, eyes squeezed shut. So it goes all the way out of the classroom, down the hallway, down the steps. I\u2019m vaguely aware of people watching our strange waltz out the door. It\u2019s a quick drive over to her school. I blast  this song , and think I still might get to work on time. I jump out the car to unload\u00a0her, and then I scream. It\u2019s the Snot Monster!!!!!!! (Rhema is very good about using a tissue if you give her one within .000000001 seconds of sneezing. Any longer than that and she finds inventive ways of using the wad. This morning it\u2019s\u00a0good for\u00a0hair gel on the front of her head.) Choo choo. Chucka chucka choo choo. I clean her up best I can with some old wipes before\u00a0running into school. Her teacher prompts Rhema to say bye to me. Every morning we do this, we wait her out. Kneeling in front of her, I wave.\u00a0\u201cBye Rhema!\u201d She squirms. She looks up at the ceiling, out the window, anywhere but me. \u201cBye Rhema.\u201d Time passes. The crickets chirp. The sun sets and rises again. The snow melts. The grass grows. \u201cBye Rhema.\u201d \u201cBye, bye, bye.\u201d I make the train, a\u00a0frazzled mess, shocked that I made it. It\u2019s 8 am. I put the morning on rewind. I see Rhema face down in the hallway eating snow out of the carpet and can\u2019t help but laugh. That girl.  My  girl. I see Hope, chattering non-stop through it all, steady as a rock, wise and strong beyond her years, and I wish I\u2019d taken an extra second to hold her close and tell her how I love her and thank God for her. I hear Hope praying in the car and Rhema saying Bye, bye, bye. Already I miss them. I\u00a0am intensely joyful, weary, crazy, wistful, hopeful. It\u2019s just another ordinary autism day.

Ever hear the opening notes of a song and\u00a0get goosebumps? Before the words even come, you\u2019re crying. Happens to me. Happens to my twin. And I think God totally gets it.\u00a0 My sister  was diagnosed with MS just a couple months before Rhema was diagnosed with autism several years ago. We\u2019ve often noticed how\u00a0the two of them\u00a0seem to be on similar journeys. Once Rhema was in the hospital for long-term EEG monitoring, and my twin was in a neighboring hospital being treated for an MS exacerbation. I remember numbly walking\u00a0a long corridor that connects Children\u2019s Hospital to Brigham and Women\u2019s, and wondering where the carefree days of life had gone. My daughter\u2019s place or my sister\u2019s place, I wished I could take either one. My twin has been undergoing painful monthly infusions of a drug called Tysabri for the past 2.5 years. It\u2019s an experimental drug with some unpleasant side effects \u2013 mouth sores, nausea, headaches, itching, etc \u2013 but it\u2019s\u00a0been the only thing to help\u00a0her\u00a0in terms of \u201cdisease activity.\u201d\u00a0 All along, we\u2019ve known the biggest risk of the medication is\u00a0a\u00a0fatal brain\u00a0infection called  PML . Last week she\u00a0tested extremely positive for the virus that causes PML.\u00a0 Her drug therapy for MS was immediately halted, and she will never take the drug again \u2013 it\u2019s simply too dangerous. \u00a0 Upon hearing the news, I bawled at work. Words can\u2019t describe how relieved\u00a0I was to\u00a0know that they\u2019d caught the virus in time. But I was also so afraid. I\u00a0know\u00a0about every\u00a0MS drug on the market, and my sis, she\u2019s just about tried them all. Because of the risks associated with Tysabri, it\u2019s generally only recommended\u00a0when\u00a0most other options have been exhausted (as is the case for my twin). And now Tysabri is no longer an option. The scenario is a sadly familiar one. Rhema\u2019s done time on a slew of anti-epileptic meds. The only one that worked no longer does, and we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s next.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are we going to do, J?\u201d I whispered. These past\u00a0several years have been marked with so much heartache, and crisis and disappointment one after another. At that moment, I\u00a0was ready and willing to sink to the bottom of the sea of despair. I wanted to scream it\u2019s not fair and ask God if the pain will ever end. She was quiet for a minute. \u201cI know that God has saved my life,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate.\u201d And so we did. \n(Look, Cha. Cupcakes! Gone in seconds.) Collasped veins, brusies on arms, mouth sores, the emotional stress of infusions month after month, year after year\u2026 we celebrated the end of it! We celebrated that in spite of medical reports, she  is  well. We celebrated her husband and daughter for their strength of love. We celebrated the fact that even though we don\u2019t know what tomorrow holds \u2013 we know the end of the story. But I hold on to this hope and the promise that He brings \nThat there will be a place with no more suffering \nThere will be a day with no more tears \n No more pain, and no more fears \n There will be a day when the burdens of this place \n Will be no more, we\u2019ll see Jesus face to face (~ Jeremy Camp\u2019s  There Will Be A Day  based on Rev. 21:4) We celebrated the Good News ( \u201cAnd this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son . 1 John 5:11) that always trumps\u00a0the bad news.

I have two recollections of my biological father. The first, I was about five years old, sitting in his car. The second, I was eighteen, a freshman in college. I\u2019d taken a Greyhound bus through several states to visit my twin and \u201cmeet\u201d my father. It was such a strange and surreal experience that I somehow forgot to ask him all the things I wanted to know. And then, just like that, the meeting was over and I never spoke to him again. That night in a dorm bathroom\u00a0I stared at myself in the mirror. I saw me in his face. I saw him in my face. It was quite a transforming\u00a0experience, like finding a part of myself I didn\u2019t know was missing. Those two moments are all I have of my natural father, but I have a lifetime of beautiful memories shared with my  Dad . The man I love to call Daddy\u00a0has been supporter, protector, provider, hero, teacher, friend \u2013 everything a daughter needs her father to be. He didn\u2019t have to, but he adopted my sister and I, made us a family, and gave us his name. Never for a moment have we felt or been anything less than wholly his. And I\u2019m so proud to be his. He has loved\u00a0God\u00a0and my mother with all his heart. He has served all of my life \u2014\u00a0his family, his country as\u00a0an airman and a soldier, his God as a founding pastor of an amazing church. He has a faith in God so strong \u2013 He simply  believes  \u2013  and it\u2019s radical. He bought me a diamond ring when I was a little girl and told me I was even more precious. Years later he walked me down the aisle and just before he gave me away, he whispered a secret that only we share . Still years later he held up my baby girls and dedicated them to the Lord.

When I\u2019m gone, will they understand her need to be\u00a0close to that light, to move in the warmth of the sun? Last week I had a wonderful opportunity to meet with an incredibly caring public servant and some amazing mothers. I hope I\u2019ll\u00a0get a chance\u00a0to write more about the night some time in the future. Much of the conversation centered around the issue of housing and jobs\u00a0for\u00a0adults with autism. My heart was stirred as I listened to the needs for support, which\u00a0seemed so great. Rhema is\u00a0only almost\u00a0seven, but I could see her in their stories, and I was momentarily overwhelmed. We\u2019ve just been trying to get through today. I\u2019ve not spent much time thinking about Rhema as an adult  on purpose . For one thing, imagining her then as she is now would be a disservice to her. Daily, monthly, yearly she amazes us with her ability to learn and do more.\u00a0I\u00a0still want to\u00a0believe\u00a0that anything is possible for her. I will not let my limited imagination shortchange her. I\u2019ve also avoided thoughts about the future because it\u2019s simply too much. Thoughts of my baby living without me?  Cannot go there.  Too many worst case scenarios. Still, there are certain realities that exist and we need to be as prepared as we can be.\u00a0And the conversations of last week and the  passing of my aunt  have forced me to think on these things\u2026 It\u2019s even caused me to stop and stare at her, to put my cheek against hers, to hold her longer, to memorize each strand of hair.\u00a0Time is moving\u00a0so fast, I can\u00a0barely lift her in my arms anymore, and\u00a0it just dawned on me that she won\u2019t be with me forever. In my parent\u2019s home yesterday, I tried to put to words my fears. \u201cRhema is such a content child. We have worked hard to give her good things, to help her know and feel that she is safe and loved no matter what. We love the way she trusts us completely; she doesn\u2019t worry about her needs. Yes, I know most children who are blessed to grow in a loving home don\u2019t worry about their needs. But with Rhema, it\u2019s even more so. Never once has she declared, \u201cMom, I\u2019m thirsty\u201d or \u201cMy finger hurts\u201d or asked \u201cCan I have a snack?\u201d She  depends \u00a0on us. What\u2019s going to happen to my baby when I\u2019m not able to care for her?  Should I be freaking out right now? Am I a fool to just think it\u2019s going to be alright? How can this possibly be alright? Should I be doing more to prepare \u2013 saving more money, adding more therapies, launching a non-profit?\u201d My father did not\u00a0say much, only this:\u00a0 \u201cGod is going to take care of Rhema.\u201d And then I remembered. I remembered how we needed\u00a0to get her\u00a0into a special school, and God made it so. I remembered how we  battled the Department of the Army  so that she could continue to get the services and medical care she needs here, and God made a way. I remembered how I prayed for something silly \u2013 a  velvet leotard \u00a0for my girl \u2013 and  God gave , just because He could.\u00a0 If He can deliver a velvet leotard, I\u2019m thinking He can handle the future\u00a0and\u00a0a little\u00a0window-dancing requirement. That\u2019s why she can dance in the light, so free. Trust me like that. Depend on me completely. You know her needs even when she cannot speak of them, in the same way I know what you need before you ask. Breathe, love, I got this. So again I lay\u00a0her down, offer her up, and give her back to the One who gave her to me. He will take care of her. Yes, very good care.

On cue, Rhema rips the heart off the front of the card and wipes her nose with it. Me: Oops. \u00a0. Hope is a  good   sister . I mean, a really good sister. She prays for Rhema to have good days at school. She attacks her with hugs. They take baths together and Hope\u2019s a real sport about fudge in the tub. She cheers every time Rhema says a word or completes a puzzle. She thinks she is smart and beautiful. She always tries to protect her: \u201cMom, Rhema\u2019s doing something dangerous!\u201d . So once, a long time ago, Hope was going potty. Rhema, who does not have particularly strong convictions about using the toilet, showed up in the bathroom. Fidgeting. In one quick motion, I yanked unsuspecting Hope off the seat and yelled, \u201c Hold it! \u201d Then I whipped Rhema\u2019s pants down and plunked her on the potty. Both girls were rather startled. But Rhema went. And as soon as she was done, I returned Hope to the throne. One clean floor, two relieved girls, one slightly guilty mama. But as I said, that was a long time ago. The other day I came upstairs to find\u00a0the girls standing in the bathroom, both\u00a0with their pants around their ankles. Now Rhema seems to always be partially undressed \u2013 that\u2019s nothing new. But Hope likes a little privacy in all her 4 year-old glory. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I demand. Hope points as her sister settles onto the toilet. \u201cI\u2019m holdin\u2019 it for Rhema!\u201d Hope is a good sister. I mean, a really good sister.

See, my little girl has been having these horribly violent meltdowns for the past few weeks. Every day. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and I don\u2019t know exactly what happened. Like why? She\u2019s just not herself, and it\u2019s impacting our ability to complete simple tasks or leave the house. So I called her doctor, and after days of thinking it over, well, here we are holding up the drive-through line. Yes, she\u2019s been on all sorts of anti-epileptic meds. And ok, once, she ate a birth control pill\u2026 I guess you could say she was protected that day. Ha! But she\u2019s never taken such a strong change-the-effects-of-the-chemicals-in-your-brain drug. You know? And the side effects. Significant weight gain? My friend\u2019s son gained 16 lbs in the first month on this medication.\u00a0Ugh. Constipation? Insomnia? Well, we\u2019ve already got those problems. Impaired thinking\u00a0and reactions? Lord knows we don\u2019t need  that . If she\u2019s experiences other side effects, how am I to know? She cannot tell me if something hurts or feels weird. She has a seizure disorder, you know, so we have to be very careful with\u00a0a new\u00a0med. Can you tell I\u2019m a bit scared? It is gut-wrenching to watch your child struggle and fight and hurt, and realize that you\u2019re helpless and it\u2019s all out of control. Really, there are no words. As I said, she\u2019s totally not herself right now. Will this drug make her even more not herself? I\u00a0need her moods to stabilize, yes, but I don\u2019t want to dull her personality or lose her\u00a0sweet spunk. I know you don\u2019t have the answers, but since you asked\u2026 really what I want to know is\u2026 Am I doing the right thing?  Is the stuff in this little bottle going to give me my girl back?? \u201cDo you have any questions for the pharmacist?\u201d The woman at the window\u00a0asks again, waiting. \u201cUm\u2026\u00a0no. Thanks.\u201d I reach for the bag.\u00a0 . Rhema has been on\u00a0this new medication for a week now. So far she hasn\u2019t grown horns or changed colors or anything. Thankfully, the tantrums and aggressions have decreased, but she still struggles a LOT each day. Once again I\u2019m reminded not to pin my hopes on a drug, but only on the One who made her and knows her down to the number of hairs on her head. She is not a mystery to Him. So we\u2019ll keep taking our prescriptions of hope to Him for filling,\u00a0praying that He guides us and\u00a0holds us through these days. . * Photo credit:  http://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photos-liquid-medicine-bottle-image34278 .

{"date": "June 20, 2011", "body": "Last week my dear friend  Jess  suggested that we take our daughters, Katie and Hope, out for some special fun. It would be just for them \u2013 and us! \u2013\u00a0with no autism to think about. We called it \u201ctypical time.\u201d It was to be Hope\u2019s first  American Girl  experience (and mine). So we got dressed up, just the two of us, and met our friends for\u00a0dinner in a\u00a0VERY girly, very pink house of dolls. If you know anything about Hope you know that\u00a0this scenario had her\u00a0over the moon. Truly, it was all too much for her to take in at times. The girls were long lost sisters. Hope absolutely adores Katie, and Katie\u00a0showered\u00a0her with attention and showed her all the American Girl ropes. Even a store clerk called them sisters, and I couldn\u2019t help but think\u00a0of their  other  sisters at home.\u00a0We have them \u2013 Brooke and Rhema \u2013\u00a0to thank for these\u00a0friendships, for bringing us together. Katie and Hope\u00a0were silly and sweet\u2026 they\u00a0laughed and explored\u2026 and ate way too much pink sugar\u2026 Katie patiently helped Hope pick out a doll. They got her glasses. They got her hair done. They got her ears pierced. (Yeah, I\u2019m talking about the doll.) Hope tried to keep a straight face, but she could barely contain the Wheeeeeee!\u00a0inside.\u00a0\u00a0 . Jess and her family have heaped blessings upon my family. They have a way \u2013 every single one of them \u2013 of stepping in and  creating magic  and giving my\u00a0girls the  sweetest   memories .\u00a0And then, as they go on their way,  changing the world , \u00a0 they thank  me.  (Huh?) I am stunned by the way they care for us, the way they generously give to us. Often, I find myself standing back just praying that God will bless them as they have blessed us. Our outing could not have come at a better time. We have been in an all-out crisis at home, with autism impacting every aspect of our lives, nearly every moment. The dinner, the dolls, the pink, the fun and laughter, the\u00a0chocolate and raspberry sorbet\u00a0\u2013 it was all\u00a0meaningful and refreshing and even healing for Hope and me.\u00a0Down to\u00a0the rainbow sprinkles on our marshmallows. For us mamas, it seemed like\u00a0God\u2019s little way of whispering comfort and love:  I see you. I know it\u2019s been hard.

I told her I go flying at night for exercise. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked wide-eyed. \u201cYep. After you fall asleep, I grow a tail and feathers. My nose curves into a beak. And I flap my wings and soar through the air.\u201d \u201cWhere do you go when you fly???\u201d \u201cOh, I just\u00a0fly around the neighborhood.

She hears the door open, but she doesn\u2019t bother to look up. For the third time in as many nights, she\u2019s peed in the same spot on the carpet. She\u2019s huddled over the mess, silently rocking on her heels as her hands swirl around in the puddle. I will try to lift her from the mess. She will fight me. She will grab my legs and refuse to move. Eventually we\u2019ll make it to the bathroom. I will bathe her \u2013 in the tub I only just scoured hours earlier. I will throw soiled clothes in the washer, fetch all the cleaners, and on hands and knees scrub the rug. I will chalk it up to another sleepless night now that she\u2019s wide awake. But before I do that, I will stand in her doorway. I will look upon her, seven-year old beauty \u2013 so lovely it still takes my breath away, makes me wistful\u00a0when I think about what might have been. (How close and yet how far away we are from the life I\u2019d planned for her, for us.) I will close my eyes and wish it away. Then I will pray for God to work in my heart \u2013 to keep the bitterness and anger and complaining from taking root and blinding me to all that is good. I will try to remember that this\u00a0is not \u2013 and has never been \u2013\u00a0about me. I will ask for strength to care, to clean the poop and pee day after day, for all of my days with not a word of\u00a0thanks, if this is\u00a0what it means to serve and love my God, love my girl, love my family. I will not deny there is\u00a0heartache and longing (it will always be there to some degree), but I will give it to God and still trust Him to do something\u2026 extraordinary. \u201cBut before I go, I wan t once more to tell you how good He is, how blessed it is to suffer with Him, how infinitely happy He has made me in the very hottest heat of the furnace. It will strengthen you in your trials to recall this my dying testimony. There is no wilderness so dreary but that His love can illuminate it, no desolation so desolate but that He can sweeten it. I know what I am saying. It is no delusion.

Her MS has relapsed. She\u2019s in a lot of pain; trouble standing, walking. She\u2019s facing several days of\u00a0grueling infusions at the Multiple Sclerosis Center in Boston. I\u2019m telling her my plans, how Hope and I will visit her first thing tomorrow. (Hope can bring cheer to any place.) \u201cCan I\u00a0tell you\u00a0something, J?\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m still thinking through this but\u2026 well, you know the story about Joseph? We\u2019re studying it in my Bible study. Remember how his brothers hated him and sold him into slavery?\u00a0He was taken to Egypt, separated from his family for 24 years, wrongfully accused, thrown in prison. At the end of the story, when he\u2019s reunited with his brothers he comforts and forgives them, saying, \u2018You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good\u2026 (Gen. 50:20)\u2019 I\u2019m trying to find the words, make sense of it all out loud. \u201cThe phrase, \u2018 But God meant it for good.\u2019  It\u2019s been in my head for days. Last week\u00a0I heard\u00a0a story about a young girl who was hit by a car. She was paralyzed and suffered years of painful rehabilitation and therapy.\u00a0The case went to trial, and\u00a0the young girl was concerned that the woman who caused the accident would feel guilty for the rest of her life. Afterwards the girl approached the woman and said, \u2018Don\u2019t live your life in guilt. God meant this for good. I have come to know Him as a result of this pain.\u2019 \u201cThat story and Joseph\u2019s story have challenged me to look at my life, particularly, the hard stuff \u2013 losses, disappointments, times when I\u2019ve been wronged or hurt, and dare I say, even autism \u2013 and see God\u2019s goodness in it. Some people touched by autism might be enraged by my daring to say,  God meant it for good.  There are times when I\u2019m angry at myself for even thinking such a thing. Because the part of autism that causes my baby to suffer and struggle and miss out on so much? Make no mistake. I will never be o.k. with that. I will never get  used  to it. And I know you can relate because of MS. You think you\u2019re doing fine and all of a sudden reality slaps you in the face, literally knocks you down. Happened to me today when a colleague casually asked what grade Rhema is in. Grade? I have no idea what grade she\u2019s in \u2013 she\u2019s in an intensive special needs school \u2013 we don\u2019t even bother with grades. Or when our private speech therapist tested Rhema, and she scored the receptive language of a two-year old. Bam! Knock me down, down. But you know what the therapist said? She said, \u2018For years Rhema\u2019s been experiencing mini-seizures in the speech center of her brain. Her last EEG showed she\u2019s  seizing\u00a058 times a minute ! One would think that she could not process anything at all with that kind of electrical activity\u2026 But it seems like her brain has found a way\u2026 some other way!In spite of it all, she\u2019s still learning \u2013 learning to attend, learning to understand, learning to learn. It\u2019s been tough, but there\u2019s still a lot of good!\u2019 \u201cGood , J. So much good. And of course I cannot begin to list all the ways we\u2019ve grown and learned and loved because of Rhema. So I know I\u2019m rambling and I turned this into a conversation about autism. \u201cBut you get me? J, as you face these days  again  \u2013 the fear, the grief, the pain, the uncertainty (\u2013 and I\u2019ll be right beside you, I promise) \u2013 can you still believe that God is always for you? Can we, even when\u00a0so much\u00a0seems lost, say, His goodness has never lapsed. Not once. ? And while we pray and wait, and wait and pray for healing, can we dare to look at our brokenness and see God\u2019s good in it? In all of it?\u201d Gulp. Pause. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, uplifted and brave. \u201cBy grace, through faith.\u201d Then she adds, \u201cWhen I think about Rhema, her life\u2026 well, I just\u00a0 know  God meant it\u00a0for good.\u201d Oh my sister, your life, too.

{"date": "May 4, 2011", "body": "\u00a0. Because Rhema is preverbal I am often delighted and amused to get a glimpse of what she understands, to see how she sees the world. She has such a sense of order. Like many ASD children she thrives on predictability and routine. And when she gets something, she  gets  it. And she sticks to it. Here\u2019s one example. At school, she has learned to clean up after eating lunch. Throw away napkins, wrappers, etc. At home that translates into clean up  everything . She happily dumps her napkin, plate and utensils in the trash can. She\u2019ll even help\u00a0by throwing away everyone else\u2019s silverware. I have lost more spoons than I can count. . So I have a bunch of those hair claw things. Even when my hair is down, I\u2019ll stick one on the side of my head should the need arise to put it up. (I\u2019m sure this is a fashion  don\u2019t  so if anyone wants to nominate me for  What Not To Wear , feel free.) Whenever\u00a0Rhema finds a hair claw in the house, she stops what she is doing, finds me, and without a word clamps it in my hair. It doesn\u2019t matter if I already have one in my hair. She associates\u00a0these clips\u00a0with me, and I love it! I love that she noticed. I love that she is being \u201chelpful\u201d by ensuring my hair is in constant supply of hair clips. So when we were at the playground recently and she spotted a woman with a hair claw\u2026 well, you know where this is going\u2026 (And the plot thickens.) Out of nowhere, unsuspecting, hair-claw-wearing woman is jumped by a 7 year-old kid. Kid\u00a0snatches the clip out of\u00a0bewildered woman\u2019s head and races off. Said kid runs urgently toward mother. The mother\u00a0fights the\u00a0impulse to run the other way, pretend\u00a0she doesn\u2019t know said kid. Kid scrambles up her mother, affixes the clip on the top of\u00a0mother\u2019s head. There . Satisfied that the world is as it should\u00a0be, kid takes off for the monkey bars.

One day she\u2019ll\u00a0speak them again. \u00a0.

{"date": "May 16, 2011", "body": "For years we\u2019ve been eligible for respite care for Rhema through our military health insurance. For years we have been unable to access that care. I won\u2019t bore with the details but suffice to say the system\u00a0is sort of steeped in\u00a0bureaucracy. Unfortunately, whenever\u00a0we mention our health insurance to anyone in the know, we are met with  groans . But God bless my husband who\u2019s never taken no for an answer. Once, a couple years ago, we arrived at the hospital for long-term EEG monitoring for Rhema. Somehow we thought that\u00a0we\u2019d be seeing a world-renowned neurologist. We were quickly informed that that was not at all the case. It was explained to us that this important expert very rarely came on the ward. I imagined the good doctor tucked away like a mad scientist in Harvard Medical School working to rid the world of epilepsy. Silly me to think he\u2019d have time for us.\u00a0\u00a0 After we were settled into Rhema\u2019s room, Brandon stepped out into the hallway with his cell phone, a pen and pad of paper. Sometime later, he came back into the room and stated, \u201cDr. D is taking on our case. He\u2019ll be here to meet with us in about an hour.\u201d Even the nurses on the floor were shocked. Brandon has this\u00a0remarkable ability to make stuff happen, to get people to see things his way. I learn from him because so many times I\u2019ve been ready to wave the white flag, and he keeps pushing, fighting, trying. And I\u2019m so thankful that he does. As I\u2019ve blogged before, my girl is  strong . She\u2019s not the little toddler anymore that I can chase down in a public place or lift off the floor in the midst of a meltdown. She is older and seemingly aware of the fact that her physical strength is a source of power. She receives intensive one-on-one support all day every day at school. But at home, well, that\u2019s just not possible. She has many, many good days. But then there are days when everything seems to fall apart and\u2026 I need help. (So hard to say that, but it\u2019s just the truth). So when Brandon left a couple weeks ago I was a tad bit concerned. A simple walk to the park \u2013 just me and the girls? Not possible. Not safe. So he\u00a0spent hours on the phone talking with supervisors of the ECHO (Extended Care Health Option) program, a supplemental program for special needs families. In short, the respite care regulations required that such care could only come from a certified medical professional employed by a home health care provider in the network. (I suspect that this plan works better for families requiring specialized health care from a home nurse or nursing assistant, not a family with a child with autism). It seemed no organization could be found in the entire state that provided the behavioral support and safety support we needed. He wrote emails, called Congressmen in various states, had conversations with military liaisons. Portions of his letters: First, I want to make clear that I am addressing this issue not as a complaint, but as an issue that I suspect many military families with special needs children face.\u00a0While the TriCare ECHO respite care benefit is not predicated on separations (deployments/TDY/etc.),  the unmet need and inaccessible respite care benefit becomes an even bigger issue for military families during deployments or TDY assignments when the 24/7 care burden shifts from 2 parents sharing the duties to 1 parent absorbing the entire load of round-the-clock care. \u00a0So, I am bringing this issue to light for the general knowledge of the Representatives and the benefit of the general special needs military community\u2026 In our particular case, we are currently stationed in Massachusetts due to my daughter\u2019s medical and educational needs.\u00a0Our ECHO case manager has been unable to find (over 4 years of trying) any qualified agency to fill the respite care hours for our daughter due to the very specific/high standards for caregivers.\u00a0As I leave again for a 4 month TDY assignment, we are trying once again to cobble together respite care for my daughter.\u00a0Tricare ECHO should provide a portion of the respite care my daughter is entitled to, but like many families we are unable to access the benefit due to the language contained in the Tricare ECHO manual.\u201d . Well, somebody finally listened. Because a couple days later, after nearly 5 years of trying,\u00a0not one, not two, but *three*\u00a0state agencies were in contract negotiations with our health insurance. And last week I just about hit the floor when someone from XYZ Agency called: \u201cHello, we have a home health aide who\u2019s prepared to work with your daughter 4 hours a week. We\u2019d like to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss your needs, but your aide is ready to start this Saturday.\u201d \u201c\u2026 Huh? Wha-? Seriously?\u2026 Well, Hallelujah!\u201d .

{"date": "May 8, 2011", "body": "So thankful today. My Hope girl made Mother\u2019s Day gifts for me at school \u2013 including a lollipop flower that she only licked once. She dramatically declared her undying love for me all weekend: \u201cMommy, I love you  so  much. I couldn\u2019t stop loving you even if I  tried !!!\u201d Um, thanks Hope. She drew me this: \n \n \n Hope has rainbow hair, and I look\u2026 bloated. (Those dots are our bellybuttons.) \n \n \u00a0 Mush! This child brings me heart-bursting JOY. Incredible girl, she is. \u00a0. On my very first Mother\u2019s Day as a mother, I was in rough shape. Husband deployed to Iraq. Colicky 7-week old baby who cried and cried and never seemed to sleep. But on Mother\u2019s Day she slept for 6 hours straight, and when she awakened, I picked her up and twirled her around. \u201cYou gave me a Mother\u2019s Day present!!! Wow! Thank you, Rhema. Thank you for letting me sleep!\u201d I believed that somehow she just  knew , even as an infant, that it was Mother\u2019s Day. And she wanted to show me some love, give me what I needed. (And it definitely was a rare gift. Seven years later and\u00a0she still doesn\u2019t sleep through the night.) This day she blessed me, yet again, with the\u00a0sweetest gift. About 4 in the morning, she was up. So I took her to the bathroom and brought her back to her bed. As I rose to leave, her arms reached out and caught me around the neck, and she drew me near. I thought it was a trick. Sometimes she\u2019ll do this. She\u2019ll draw you close and then bite off your hair. Seriously, it doesn\u2019t feel good. So I was leery. But she just held me there for a minute, forehead to forehead, nose to nose. I treasured each second and prayed she knew how much I love her. I felt her little mouth against my cheek. No pucker. Just the lightest touch. I sat back. \u201cRhema, did you just give your Mommy a kiss??????\u201d She made a clicking sound repeatedly. \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d Incredible! She is. I believe that somehow she just  knows , even now, that it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. And she wanted to show me some love, give me what I needed. I am one blessed mama.

{"date": "May 31, 2011", "body": "Rhema\u2019s got as much love for sleep as I do for field rats. The latest boycott on sleep started about a month ago, around the time Brandon left (perfect timing!). Waking at 1 or 2 am, she\u2019s wired and ready for the day. Per doctor\u2019s order, she\u2019s on quarter tablets of a sleep aide twice  during  the day. And then a full tablet at night. One would think all this would help her sleep at night. Of course, one would be wrong. (And did I mention I have a job now? I\u2019m a zombie with a smile.) I\u2019m most concerned for Hope \u2013 that Rhema\u2019s midnight antics disturb her sleep as well. When I tuck her in, Hope often encircles herself with books in her bed. She simply explains the need for all the reading material: \u201cFor when Rhema wakes me up.\u201d This past weekend Brandon came home for a weekend visit (yah!) and we headed north for an overnight trip. My frugalness landed us in The Roach Motel \u2013 a tiny room with two beds. 10:00 pm. \u201cPlease, Lord, let her sleep,\u201d I pray. The sleeping pill takes effect, and she dozes. I instruct the others: Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t sniffle, don\u2019t breathe. If you have to pee during the night, hold it. (Just kidding, I gave them permission to use the bathroom if they absolutely had to, but if they flushed the toilet they would bring down the Wrath of Mama). 12:35 am. Rhema\u2019s loud, ceasless sing-songy tune pierces the air. \u00a0 I\u2019m still praying, \u201cPlease, Lord, let her sleep. Please.\u201d She sits up in bed and begins the Concert of the Hum in fortissimo, with crescendos and decrescendos that could rival Pavarotti. Then she coughs. She likes the feel of it in her throat, and turns it into a guttural hacking. The louder, the better \u2013 hacking interspersed with humming. 1:30 am. Brandon takes her to the bathroom. I put Hope in the bed with him, and I try to settle in with Rhema. 2:30 am. She\u2019s jumping on the bed, her voice at a fever pitch. She jumps off our bed and climbs into Brandon and Hope\u2019s. She starts jumping up and down on  them,  and\u00a0I catch her and drag her back to our bed. I try to holding her, but she\u2019s offended by my closeness. She grunts and hits herself, and she continues every few minutes, grunting and hitting. My eyes hurt. Desperate for sleep, \u00a0I stumble up in the dark and fish through my bag for the iTouch. I turn down the volume, and for the next hour she plays games, but she is not silent. She laughs. She jumps. She babbles and sings. She hits herself. 3:00 am. I contemplate the puffy bags and dark circles under my eyes. What to do? Vitamin K, cucumbers, laser surgery, beheading? 3:30 am. All hope of a good night\u2019s sleep gone, I am left to think, and\u00a0I am spitting mad at\u00a0autism. That day, we\u2019d tried to have a typical family day at a small amusement park. We\u2019d done it, but it had been a struggle. Within minutes of being in the hotel room, we were scrubbing poop out of the tub and off the floor. Now we would listen to her fight, battle the storm in her head all night. Before we had children we used to love to travel. Brandon and me, that was our thing. At 6 \u00bd months pregnant, I hiked up to Neuschwanstein Castle in Garmisch, I boldly climbed the 350 steps to the dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The year before she was born we\u00a0stayed in\u00a0Munich, Barcelona, and London. There was Paris and Poland, and Christmas in Rome. I wasn\u2019t worried about a child cramping our style. \u201cShe\u2019ll be my easy-going, travelin\u2019 baby,\u201d I\u2019d say, sure of it, images of her slung in a carrier on my back. I exhale bitterly.What a cruel joke. Thank goodness we traveled when we had the chance. Now look at us. We can barely manage a trip 100 miles from home. And the future feels as dark and stifled as this motel room. Beside me, Rhema begins to weep. Just minutes earlier she\u00a0was laughing hysterically. Now she\u2019s sobbing, and we quietly listen, our beds on a sea of tears. I am so tired, my hands automatically reach out to comfort but I don\u2019t understand anything. I don\u2019t know what she fears, why she laughs and cries and fights, why her brain never stops racing. Her sadness \u2013 with a source I cannot name \u2013 brings me low. I go back to that night in Rome. I had jumped into a subway, thinking Brandon was behind me. As the doors closed I\u2019d reached out for him and the subway doors clamped on my arm, behind my wristwatch. I couldn\u2019t open the doors, couldn\u2019t pull my arm in. I was in absolute panic and terror thinking the subway would jet through a tunnel and chop off my hand. He-man, aka Brandon, saved the day by prying the doors apart before the subway could take off. But I remember vividly my pounding heart, and how Rhema seemed completely upset inside me. She did not settle for hours.  That   was it. That must have been the moment her brain development went off course. My fault, my fault. (Now I honestly don\u2019t believe that. This is the silly talk going on in my sleep-deprived head, and in moments of discouragement and trying to make sense of hard stuff on long nights, I\u2019ll tell myself just about anything.) 4 a.m.  Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. (Ps. 30:5) Really, God? Really?  Something in our darkness dries tears like a gentle breath on the cheek. Amazingly, the beautiful child beside me closes her eyes, at peace at last.  My dreams of her are sweet . 5 a.m. She\u2019s moving beside me again, her knees digging into my back. She\u2019s got her iPod Touch. She\u2019s had it for almost a year and until now she\u2019s never figured out how to turn up the volume. Somehow she\u2019s found one of the bajillion songs I downloaded on the thing eons ago \u2013 a  Sara Groves tune . And I laugh. As the words fill our small room and the early sun lights up a new day, I shake my head in wonder and laugh with Rhema, with God. \u201c It\u2019s going to be alright . It\u2019s going to be alright. I can tell by your eyes that you\u2019re not getting any sleep And you try to rise above it, but feel you\u2019re sinking in too deep Oh, oh I believe, I believe that It\u2019s going to be alright I believe you\u2019ll outlive this pain in your heart And you\u2019ll gain such a strength from what is tearing you apart Oh, oh I believe I believe that It\u2019s going to be alright We\u2019re going to be alright.\u201d \u00a0. Really. .\u00a0 All of us, all four of us, pull ourselves up for another day. Ready to face whatever it holds. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll do it, but I know we\u2019ll do it together. And with the Lord\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to be alright. Along with the song, a  verse  and a promise fill my heart, give me strength: This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. It is of the LORD\u2019s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness!

{"date": "May 23, 2011", "body": "Not so long ago Rhema was\u00a0learning to  use a stamp with her name  on it because it was not likely that she would ever learn to write independently. But  Heather , her OT, and all of her teachers have an against-all-odds, inexhaustible supply of belief and hope in my girl. Last summer they taught her to  trace the letters of her name , and I cried because it was a taste of faith-becoming-sight, and I was so grateful and so amazed and I\u2019ll never forget how hard she worked and how God comforted us with the gift of it. \n \n \n Rhema\u2019s \u201cR\u201d, traced with no prompt! \n \n Heather told me she had a dream that she came to work one day and Rhema was independently writing her name. In\u00a0the\u00a0dream, she is so happy and excited that she calls another teacher over and they record it all on video. \u201cOne day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will happen.\u201d . A couple weeks ago I observed Rhema at school. Her teacher was working with her on writing letters in boxes beneath her name. Rhema was humming and drawing horizontal lines repeatedly. She needed a  lot  of physical prompting and guidance. And even then, if she managed to draw a letter it was in the wrong box, out of order. For some reason, learning to write the name has\u00a0been an emotional journey and I feel like God has been teaching  me  something along with Rhema.\u00a0Maybe it\u2019s because people told us it couldn\u2019t be done, and I went home and buried the dream. Maybe because writing is communicating. If her spoken words are few, perhaps she\u2019ll learn to write her heart?\u00a0 Maybe because once upon a time I just took it for granted that I\u2019d have children who could write their names, and now we fight and try and work for every little thing and now we want it so much more.\u00a0I cannot express how deep my hope, my desire is for\u00a0her to pick up pen and write. And even with the amazing gains she\u2019s made, watching her that day a couple weeks ago, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she was\u00a0really ready for this.  But they must think she\u2019s ready,  I thought.\u00a0 Well, this is going to take a looooonngg time.\u201d But Rhema has always laughed at my time tables. When I picked her up from school last week, Heather was waiting for me.\u00a0Beaming, she handed\u00a0me a\u00a0piece of paper. Look what she did, friends. 100% independent! Look! what! she! did! . .

{"date": "April 15, 2011", "body": "\n Thank you so much for your comments and emails from my last post. Your prayers and encouragement mean so much. It\u2019s a strange thing \u2013 to receive that kind of news about your child. It gives us a better understanding of what\u2019s going on with her, but it doesn\u2019t really change anything. Rhema\u2019s still Rhema, filling our days with challenges, joys, lessons in love\u2026 so it\u2019s hard to know how to \u201cmourn\u201d it. Here, on this blog, I find a place to process it, and here I find so much support and love. I can\u2019t say thank you enough. \n . \n \n \n I just found out these chairs have been recalled. \n \n The trouble started when I decided to act on my need to go potty. It had already been a DAY, with an early morning meeting at Rhema\u2019s school, then off to the hospital where we met with her neurologist for hours. I\u2019d rushed back to her school in the pouring rain, dropped off a newly signed seizure care plan and scooped up the kids. As we stumbled into the door, Rhema charged into the playroom downstairs. I should have followed her, but I\u2019d been holding it in all day. Literally.\u00a0My bladder was begging me for mercy, and I headed upstairs. Just as I entered the bathroom, I stopped.  Better check on her first. I hear shrieking before I get to the door. Rhema has managed to put her head through the bottom rungs of a children\u2019s folding chair. Only now the folding chair has closed up and the rungs are\u00a0clamped around her neck. Her face is flushed,\u00a0and she\u2019s\u00a0starting to gag. And Hope is oh-so-casually playing with her dollhouse. I\u2019m screaming. Rhema\u2019s freaking out. And Hope is playing with her dollhouse. Try as I might I cannot get the chair off Rhema\u2019s head, and she\u2019s not making it easy by flailing and fighting me. I get worried that she\u2019s going to stop breathing. I call Brandon. Then I call 911. Less than ten minutes later (which seemed like hours to me), four firemen and\u00a0two EMTs arrive. They try in vain to get Rhema un-stuck. They finally grab wire-cutters and cut off the rungs. Rhema, relieved, drops like a sack of potatoes. I\u2019m a babbling fool. Ohmygosh, ohmygosh. Oh. My. Gosh. Hope steps in and asks the paramedics what their names are. She then informs the crew that her name is Hope, and that\u2019s Rhema her sister. \u201cThank you for saving her. Can you fix my doll?\u201d She goes on to tell them that how Rhema lost both her front teeth and the toothfairy came and left her a  princess puzzle  (!!!) but the toothfairy also decided to leave something for her, the little sister who has not lost any teeth yet, but the toothfairy left her  bunny bubbles  (!!!), in fact, because she\u2019s been so\u00a0good at school and has not gotten any strikes in a week! I thank the firemen profusely, and the paramedics stay behind to examine Rhema. She has broken blood vessels and brusies on her neck and shoulder, but she\u2019s ok. The EMT tries to ask her some questions, \u201cRhema, how are you? Are you feeling better now?\u201d She does not seem to hear them. She does not look at them. They try to take her blood pressure. They try to check her ears for bleeding. Not happening.  \u201cIs this her normal?\u201d one EMT asks. Rhema is sitting on my lap, staring off into the distance, humming. It\u2019s a peaceful hum. \u201cYes, this is her normal.\u201d \u201cSo you don\u2019t think she needs to go to\u00a0the hospital. You think she\u2019s ok?\u201d His voice is kind. \u201cShe\u2019s just fine. Thank you. Thank God. She\u2019s just fine.\u201d Mama, however? Needs a few drinks. But even before that? She needs to go potty. . Thank you to  Babble  for putting this blog on their  Top 25 Autism Blogs List !

{"date": "April 14, 2011", "body": "At the hospital, we wait to see Rhema\u2019s neurologist. On this particular day he\u2019s moved his office to the\u00a0Orthopedic floor. It\u2019s a hard, hard floor. To see little bodies broken, wounded, palsied and withered. The waiting room is bursting at the seams and children are crying. A team of\u00a0medical workers rush by us, pushing a hospital bed. There\u2019s a baby. In a carseat, on the bed. And the baby is covered with a hospital sheet. The parents follow quickly behind, fear etched on their faces.  Oh Lord,  I pray. I don\u2019t understand why children suffer. I don\u2019t. But I believe He  bottles tears , and one great day  there will be an end to the pain  in this hurting world. Brandon murmurs, \u201cIf you ever need some perspective, a\u00a0lesson in\u00a0thankfulness, come to Children\u2019s Hospital. That\u2019s what I need to do, just come and sit here for a day.\u201d It\u2019s exactly what God has been speaking to my heart.  This book  has challenged me to take a good, hard look at\u00a0my grumbling, my self-absorbed-ness, the ingratitude of my heart. And to write down continuously the gifts God gives, to document the ways He loves me personally in a day. Finally Dr. C calls us back. We walk into his office, and I notice my racing pulse, an old\u00a0Rich Mullins song in my head:\u00a0 \u2018So hold me, Jesus. \u2018Cuz I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u2019  Oh, we\u2019ve been here, done this. We\u2019ve sat in the doctor\u2019s office and received bad, shocking news before. This go-round, we already have a strong suspicion the EEG is not favorable. But ask any mother in that waiting room, no matter how many times\u00a0you come back to this place, it never gets easier. And discussions like these, with a doctor, about  your  child, the one you held in your womb and under your heart for nine months and now love everyday with a crazy mother-love \u2013 it alters you on some level and you never\u00a0see the world the same again. No matter how many times\u00a0you put on a brave face and calm smile and talk about the options,\u00a0your mama\u2019s heart still breaks.\u00a0You still feel like\u00a0you could lose it on the spot and curl up in a corner somewhere. Last November, tests showed Rhema\u2019s brain was spiking 40 times a minute. Today we learn her brain is spiking 58 times a minute. I cannot believe it. I\u2019ve seen the graphs with the spikes and waves, the images of her brain.  But I seriously don\u2019t understand.  I cannot wrap my head around  58 times a minute . \u201cIs her brain gonna fry???\u201d We talk about trying meds that you can\u2019t get in the US. We get a second opinion from one of the best epilepsy doctors at Children\u2019s. He urges us to try high dose steroid therapy even though there are nasty side effects (like weight gain, high blood pressure, stunted growth, behavior changes, gastro problems, immune system suppression) and it may not even work. (My first response is Thanks, but no way, dude. But I am so desperate to help my child, and I just wish I knew how to do that). We\u00a0leave with a 3-month plan to wean her off the current med, and a 3-month plan to think and pray. (Oh, and then there\u2019s a\u00a0Rhema-accident at home\u00a0that involves\u00a04 firemen and 2 paramedics\u2026 but that\u2019s another blog.) I endeavor to take the good days and the\u00a0hard days with thanks. I\u00a0record how I\u2019ve been blessed today with:\u00a0 ~One giant\u00a0blueberry pancake ~Perspective in the waiting room.  ~Rhema\u2019s toothless grin  ~Her brain is not a  mystery  to God, her deepest parts known by Him, and every wild hair is counted  ~Brandon\u2019s forgiveness  ~ Carrie  texting me a picture of herself with a margarita, \u201cdear sister, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy.\u201d  ~Hope wanting to know what\u2019s so gross about the gross motor room at school.  ~My Bible study sisters praying for wisdom in our decision-making  ~Walking out of that hospital, my girls happy and well at home ~My dear group of mama friends \u2013 determined to help me know I\u2019m not alone \u2013 sending\u00a0love and prayers all day  Thank you, Lord! It\u2019s true. Just being simply thankful, truly thankful, isn\u2019t changing\u00a0the circumstance, but it\u2019s changing  me. \u00a0 I find\u00a0myself\u00a0bumping into peace. Even joy.

The other reason is, well, Rhema.\u00a0Dining out\u00a0would require waiting, sitting down, sitting still, not trying to scoop the ice out of someone\u2019s drink, not trying to eat the shredded cheese off their salads, keeping the funny noises to a low volume, and did I say, waiting? But over the past year, Rhema\u2019s teachers have taken her on community outings. They\u2019ve hit the mall, the grocery store, and even restaurants. So this past week I was feeling dare-devilish when I proposed to the husband that we, imagine it!, go out to dinner as a family. And the Red Sox won. And when the Red Sox win, kids eat free at our restaurant of choice. So if we had to high-tail it out of there, I reasoned, because Rhema stripped on the table or Hope went into anaphylactic shock, well at least we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for their dinners. So we put on open minds and smiles, held our breath, and bravely dared to go where we\u2019d never gone before. French fries are usually fried in the same fryer as other foods containing gluten, so we asked the restaurant to bake rather than fry Hope\u2019s fries. They also boiled a hot dog separately for her, bun not included, and gave her a side of mandarin oranges. . Because Rhema has a tendency to eat crayons like candy, we don\u2019t have them in the house. So she was overjoyed to find crayons at the restaurant and colored a kids menu so feverishly that tiny pieces of crayon flew everywhere. She also had her own cup full of ice that kept her occupied until she started trying to color all the ice cubes. She was perfect! She ate her food, even though it was somewhat new and different. She acted like she\u2019d been dining out for ages. (Thank you, Rhema\u2019s teachers!) And Hope\u2019s face didn\u2019t blow up or anything. She was able to safely eat everything she was given. I was so happy, so proud, so thankful. Such a simple thing. Yet it\u2019s something I have wanted to do as a family for years\u2026 \n \n \n We let Rhema have ice cream. No spoon needed. \n \n . This journey we\u2019re on\u2026 sometimes it is so hard and the challenges just seem insurmountable. But it\u2019s days and moments like these where God blesses in such a specific way and I think, I  know \u2026 we can do this.\u00a0 We  are  doing this. We\u2019re getting better. All of us. . So look out eating establishments of America! We\u2019re all brave and encouraged now. We\u2019re actually thinking about trying to do this again. Next time the Sox win, of course. .

{"date": "April 28, 2011", "body": "\u201cHave you told them yet?\u201d Brandon looks up at me from across the table and shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve started talking with Hope. Just a little bit,\u201d he says. Every night, honestly every night, when Hope prays she says: \u2018Thank you God that we\u2019re all together.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what she knows. I don\u2019t know what she senses. But she seems to understand \u00a0\u2013 better than me sometimes \u2013 that our family is God\u2019s grace-gift to each of us, our togetherness is a blessing. Brandon is leaving again. Less than six months after returning home from a 14-month deployment, the Army is sending him\u00a0away\u00a0for training. He leaves in a few days and will be\u00a0gone four months\u2026 until late August. He\u2019ll miss another summer at home. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not Iraq,\u201d I\u2019ve been told. \u201cAt least he\u2019ll be in the same country, same time zone.\u201d It\u2019s true. But he will not be  here . He will not be here for afternoons in the sun, hours of splashing at the mushroom pool, days at the park, trips to New Hampshire, summer evenings on the back deck of the new home. He will not be here for Rhema\u2019s middle-of-the-night antics and doctor\u2019s appointments in Boston and meetings and birthdays and end-of-year school programs. In practical terms, we\u2019re just about ready. Got neighbors on the look-out, got special locks on the doors and windows, the 6-foot tall fence is installed so Rhema can\u2019t get out. My work schedule is set and summer programs for the girls are in place. We\u2019re concerned about Rhema \u2013 she needs constant, one-on-one support, and\u00a0she\u2019s going through a med withdrawal and some difficult behaviors have cropped up. But we\u2019re working on getting respite care, hoping the funding will come through. And still, of course, we\u2019re not ready. Not ready to tell Hope her Daddy is going away again. She has basked and glowed in his attention these past months, delighted\u00a0to\u00a0awake every morning and find\u00a0him still here. (When he first got back from Iraq\u00a0she\u00a0cried if he just left to go to the store.) And Rhema\u2026 I can\u2019t pretend to know what she thinks or understands. But I know she feels his absences deeply, and I know she is more sure of herself, more settled, when he is near. No matter how many times he leaves, it hurts his heart to miss so much time with his family. And as\u00a0for me, I will do this. But I kind of don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to do this. Again. I\u2019d finally just found my way, found my rhythm with my mate. God\u2019s been teaching us something about what it really means to treasure one another. My husband. I have enjoyed him, I have enjoyed me with him, so much. And this feels like a very impolite interruption. So many friends \u2013 some of whom I\u2019ve never even seen face to face \u2013 have prayed for us.  Thank you.  I\u2019m asking, would you pray for us again? Four months should seem like a breeze compared to the year-long deployments we\u2019ve endured. But truly,\u00a0for many reasons, this separation is the hardest. It\u2019s funny (not really), but last year\u2019s long and lonely summer was bearable only because I was counting on the fact that  this  summer would be different. Now I wonder if perhaps there are lessons I need to  learn again  in the heat of day and on dark, quiet nights\u2026\u00a0that\u00a0I can\u00a0trust the Lord to fill the voids in my life, to indeed be my joy and strength, my enough. I would do well to\u00a0review lessons in humility and contentment and thankfulness and how to ask for help. And maybe, most of all in this school of some hard knocks,\u00a0I need to know absolutely that  He\u00a0 is  here , wherever  we  are,\u00a0and all\u00a0that we need.\u00a0\u00a0 Again and again. . \u201cI am with you always\u2026\u201d Matt. 28:20 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/again/", "title": "Again"},
{"date": "July 12, 2011", "body": "\u201c\u2026And I\u2019ll never turn away the one who comes to me.\u201d \nJohn 6:37 My father pastors a church that\u2019s a good distance away from where we live so we don\u2019t get to visit as often as I\u2019d like. But when we go there, we\u2019re home. At the end of the service, the \u201cdoors of the church are opened.\u201d This means that anyone who wants to can come -just as they are \u2013 to receive prayer, to join the church, to give their life to the Lord. It is a powerful, heartfelt time of decision. A few weeks ago when the doors\u00a0of the church were open,\u00a0we all stood to our feet and sang a hymn. Rhema slid out of the pew and into the aisle.\u00a0(We always sit in the last rows in case we need to make a fast getaway.) She had\u00a0her iTouch in hand, and she\u00a0did a little\u00a0tip-toe dance in the aisle. I whispered her name and held out my hand attempting to coax her back to her seat. But she ignored me, hummed a little tune and hopped further down the aisle. I knew that if I tried to lead her back to her seat, skirts were bound to fly, and the pastor\u2019s daughter and granddaughter would end up in a wrestling match in the middle of the aisle while the choir sang \u201cCome To Jesus.\u201d \u00a0 So I resolved to do nothing but quietly follow her\u00a0ambling steps down the aisle. As people noticed her slow progression I could almost hear a collective\u00a0intake of\u00a0breath. One woman said softly, \u201cLet her go.\u201d Another whispered, \u201cPraise the Lord.\u201d Others encouraged, smiled and nodded. These friends \u2013 sisters and brothers \u2013 have prayed for our family, for our Rhema, for so many years. They rejoice over every \u201cinch\u201dstone she acheives and celebrate every utterance and happy noise she makes. They love and accept her\u00a0completely as she is. But I couldn\u2019t just let her go. She might do something inappropriate like strip and jump into the baptistry behind the pulpit. So, meekly,\u00a0I followed. As we neared the front a thought crossed my mind that left me rather panicked. Oh no. Maybe  I\u2019m  supposed to go up front. Maybe, just maybe, right now God is leading her, and she is leading me. To that sweet throne of grace. Maybe right now\u00a0 I  need prayer. Maybe\u00a0I need\u00a0to fall on my face and cry  Lord, I need you.  Maybe\u00a0I\u2019m the one who\u00a0needs to open my clenched fists, examine my heart, and give it all to Jesus again and again\u00a0\u2013 my burdens, my sin, my shame, my pride, my hopes and waiting-on-answer prayers,  me . Finally we reached the front. We were only there briefly. She hummed and rocked a\u00a0little. Then she resumed her iTouch game and meandered back down the aisle. Afterwards my parents and I chuckled about it. We agreed that you just never know how God might be speaking into the hearts of our young ones. Even though\u00a0Rhema cannot\u00a0sit through a Sunday school lesson or sing in the children\u2019s choir or even articulate what she knows, I\u2019m trusting she  knows ;  God is developing a special relationship with her. And it\u2019s just like\u00a0that girl to push me closer, too.\u00a0(Although there were no public demonstrations from me that day, later I spent some much needed time pouring out my heart in prayer\u2026 in my closet.) \u201cThey say that I can move the mountains \n And send them crashing into the sea \n They say that I can walk on water \n If I would follow and believe \n with faith like a child. They say that love can heal the broken \n They say that hope can make you see \n They say that faith can find a Savior \n If you would follow and believe \n with faith like a child\u201d ~Jars of Clay One thing I know.\u00a0 She\u00a0is not afraid to come. She\u2019s not hindered by the details \u2013 the tradition or position or what anyone else thinks. When the Spirit of God moves her, she moves. She just seems to\u00a0trust that she will be  received \u2026 into\u00a0arms wide open. I\u00a0must, I must\u00a0follow her lead. \u00a0 Jesus said, \u201cLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u201d Matthew 19:14 . *We visited a new\u00a0church last week with my dear friend Cha. Again Rhema felt the need to go to the front of the church. Only this time she did so in the middle of the sermon.\u00a0The pastor did not miss a beat.

It wasn\u2019t her fault really, but\u00a0somehow\u00a0the floor, the sink, the toilet and the humans were covered in the brown stuff in a matter of seconds. I washed her hands\u00a0and tried to do damage control. There were not enough wipes in the world. She stood off to the side and hummed excitedly. I ran and grabbed cleaner and a roll of paper towels. Rhema casually came over and ripped off a couple paper towels. Then she bent down, awkwardly\u00a0wiped at the toilet seat and threw the paper towels in.

But I was minding my own business, taking in some rays, \u2018chillin\u2019 out, maxing, relaxing all cool\u2026\u2019 When out of nowhere, this girl, seven or eight or nine or ten maybe, comes over and climbs into my lap! She makes no introductions, no sounds. She just plunks on down, and there we are face to face. And she\u2019s particularly intrigued by the texture of curly hair on my impressive gut!

And then she starts humming a really strange song. The mother races over. She apologizes and tries to pull her daughter up. The kid won\u2019t let go of me! I\u2019m totally baffled. The mom explains that the girl has autism and that they\u2019re, uh, \u2018working on boundaries.\u2019 Yeah, no kidding.

{"date": "July 22, 2011", "body": "I\u2019m told the girl\u2019s got some new academic programs at school. I\u00a0am excited\u00a0because this means progress! One of her new programs is learning to answer a social question. The question? What is your name. What is your name?? Reality flattens me, the air rushing out of my balloon like a high-pitched whine. Rhema cannot answer that question. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand or maybe she just doesn\u2019t know how to respond. I\u2019ve heard her say her name once or twice in all her life. She was only mimicking, and\u00a0she didn\u2019t say it like it\u2019s pronounced:  RAY-MAH . It was fast and repetitive, the R and M sounds running together, with a stress on the second syllable. The way she said it, I remember it was beautiful. Another of her academic programs is to name body parts. When she was two years old, I\u2019d read that naming 3 or more body parts was a skill she should have. There were many missed milestones at that point, but this one I felt we could tackle. I was determined to  make  her learn. I\u2019d rub my nose against hers until I was dizzy and exclaim \u201cNose!\u201d I\u2019d read The Foot Book by Dr. Suess every night, and tickle her \u201cfeet, feet, feet!\u201d Now, five years later we\u2019re still working on it. And in fact the immediate goal is to focus on naming just  one  body part. In a matter of minutes\u00a0the pendulum swings from high high to low low.  Oh my gosh, she\u2019s seven . And she needs intensive academic programs with one-on-one ABA trials and data collection and prompts and reinforcers\u2026 just to learn how to name a body part and answer the question, What is your name?? I look at the charts and graphs of collected baseline data.\u00a0I only see zeros \u2013\u00a0hinting that these are very long term goals. We\u2019ve been on the journey for a little while now. I think\u00a0I should be used to this.\u00a0But there are times when  I cannot believe this is happening . Still. I leave the school trying to practice a thankful heart, trying to resist discouragement\u2019s pull. Rhema\u2019s ongoing struggle to communicate has caused us to give the whole process of speech and language acquisition much more\u00a0attention than one typically would. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to learn to speak is to listen. Then you imitate what you hear with your mouth, trying out the sounds. (Rhema is here. She is constantly babbling, humming, playing with the feel of sound on her tongue and in her ears.) The sounds become familiar, take on meaning,\u00a0you use them to consistently name something \u2013 a body part, an object, a Truth, yourself. So I listen to the Word:  \u201cThe  word  is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the  word  of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is LORD\u201d, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d ~Rom. 10:8,9 \u201cWe\u2019re really excited that we can add these expressive programs to her academics now,\u201d her teacher had said. This girl of mine\u00a0is ready for *expressive* programs \u2013 ones\u00a0that involve spoken language! In the same way we prompt\u00a0her to speak: \u201cRhema, say\u00a0\u2018pop'\u201d, I feel prompted: \u201cJeneil,\u00a0say \u2018thank you'\u201d. But sometimes it\u2019s hard to find your voice in the face of\u00a0endless disappointments and weariness\u00a0and doubt and the charts with all the flat lines,  but sometimes your strength only comes when you speak gratitudes on exhaled breaths.  Sometimes the only way to get through is to say it out loud until you mean it. For sweet  babblings  and\u00a0spoken words, Lord, I thank you.  \n For her  name , Lord, I thank you!  \n For teachers who keep loving, keep hoping, keep trying; never tiring. Thank you. \n Thank you for the way you speak through a child with few words. You are amazing, God! \n God, thank you for \u2018stomach\u2019, her perfect stomach, the first body part she will learn to name. \n Thank you for being right where we are \u2013 in this space and time, on this spectrum \u2013 trusting there\u2019s good purpose in the waiting.\u00a0 \n Thank you for every small step, for things that don\u2019t come easy \u2013 the celebration is sweeter . And so, this is how I\u2019m learning to speak. .

Seriously I thought I\u2019d avoided this kind of \u201chumor\u201d by having girls. Last week Hope had a field trip to the beach. She wanted to wear a cute purple dress (her favorite color), but it was a little short. So I sent her to camp with a pair of shorts on under the dress, and her bathing suit and towel packed for the beach trip. The story Hope told me later is that after the beach trip she could not find her  underpants!!!  and shorts in her bag. So she donned her (short) dress and went commando for the rest of the day. (A day which involved sliding down slides at the playground\u2026 oy). It wasn\u2019t until much later after I picked her up from school and noticed her squirming in her seat, did she mention her lack of unmentionables. At first I was appalled. And then I laughed my head off.  \u201cUnderpants!!!\u201d  I yelled in my evil voice. But Hope was surprisingly a bit embarrassed by the whole incident. \u201cOh Hope, it\u2019s ok.\u201d I said recalling other underclothing mishaps and wardrobe malfunctions\u2026 (Insert harp music and wavy images) It was 1984. My twin and I were in grade school, and she wore old undies. You know the kind. Where all the elastic in the waistband is AWOL. She also wore a little pleated skirt to school that day, and a pair of brown boots with the faux fur on top. Me? I still proudly wore\u00a0my  Wonder Woman Underoos  (just the bottoms). Remember those? Anybody? Anyway during recess,\u00a0my twin\u2019s\u00a0underwear fell down and settled right on top of her boots. So petrified was she that she lost all mobility; unable to pull them back up. She just stood there with her underwear around her boots in all her glory and denial. Finally a boy went and told the teacher. The teacher instructed her to go to the ladies room. And so my sister waddled all the way to bathroom with her drawers on the top of her furry boots. And I hung my head \u2013 not because I felt bad for her but because I was the identical twin and people would forever mistake me as The Girl Who Stood in the Middle of Recess with Her Drawers Down. These things have a way of coming back to haunt you. (Insert more harp music and wavy images) It was 2011 when I stooped to an all-time low during a family trip. On the morning of the 2nd day of our trip I realized that I\u2019d remembered to pack a change of underwear for everyone except me. We had a long day planned \u2013 it was opening weekend at the amusement park \u2013 simply no time to stop at a store for replacements.  What am I going to do? , I wailed about my about my absence of undergarments. What I would have given more my faithful underoos right then. That\u2019s when the husband valiantly stepped\u00a0forward and selflessly offered a pair of  his . I wish I could say they were boxer shorts. They were not. Desperate and feeling out of options, I did the unthinkable: I sported tidy whities under my shorts for the rest of the day\u2026 And that\u2019s all I have to say about that. \u201cSo you see, Hope,\u201d I said, back in the present, capitalizing on a teachable moment. \u201cThe moral of the story is this: Semper ubi sub ubi, babe. Semper ubi sub ubi. Words to live by.\u201d \n . Note: \u201cSemper ubi sub ubi\u201d is one of the great phrases I learned from years of hard study in Latin. It\u2019s an admonition that (loosely translated) means \u201cAlways wear your underwear.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/underoos.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/07/26/semper-ubi-sub-ubi/", "title": "Semper ubi sub\u00a0ubi"},
{"date": "August 11, 2011", "body": "It sounded so simple as she handed me the cup. \u201cOK! We just need a little urine sample and you can be on your way.\u201d The nurse was a cheerful one. I stared at her for a minute wondering how on God\u2019s great green earth we were just going to get a \u2018little urine sample\u2019 from Rhema. The girls and I packed ourselves into the small bathroom. All the years of toilet training \u2013 the breaking\u00a0down the process into small steps, the reinforcers, the PECS symbols, the sign language, the blood, sweat and dirty laundry, and the tears\u00a0when she finally \u201cgot\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0bathroom ritual\u00a0\u2013 it all seemed to converge on this one moment in time. And I had a sense that I was about to rock her ordered, routine-loving\u00a0world. She settled onto the seat. I casually slid my hand in and held the cup under her. Now I\u2019ve been wiping this child for all seven years of her life. But she looked at me like what the H-E-double-hockey-sticks do you think you\u2019re doing, woman! \u201cCup, Rhema!\u00a0Go potty\u00a0in the cup!!!\u201d She grunted and pushed my hand away. I put my hand back. She pushed it away. I put it back. She grabbed the cup, peered inside and tried to drink out of it\u2026 (Cups are for drinking out of, not peeing in. Duh.) Back at the nurse\u2019s station, I placed the empty cup on the counter. \u201cYyyyyeah, this ain\u2019t gonna work,\u201d I said. \u201cUm. OK. Let\u2019s try this!\u201d she said, still cheerful. \u201cYou can pour what you collect in this bowl into the cup. We just need a little sample.\u201d Hope then confided\u00a0in the nurse with a not-so-loud whisper, \u201cSometimes\u00a0when I go potty, I\u00a0pee  HOT  pee pee!!!\u201d We packed ourselves into the small bathroom. I carefully placed the bowl under the toilet seat. \u201cRhema! Let\u2019s go potty!\u201d At this point, Rhema really had to go and she did not appreciate all the shuffling back and forth to the restroom. But when she approached the toilet\u00a0she was appalled and deeply offended by what she saw: No way, Jose. \u00a0(I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she said.) The next ten minutes was a battle of the wills. Me placing her on the throne. Rhema abdicating. Hope begging me to let  her  pee on the happy potty. I thought about it. They\u2019re sisters after all. Hope\u2019s sample had to be pretty close to Rhema\u2019s. I also contemplated removing the smiley bowl and letting Rhema go the regular way. Then I could scoop a cup-full out of the toilet and call it a day\u2026 Back at the nurse\u2019s desk, I handed her the bowl. \u201cYyyyeah, this ain\u2019t gonna work.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026 well. You can take the cup home and bring it back later.\u201d But Rhema was fidgeting. She really had to go. I decided to give it one last try. I put her on the seat\u00a0while hiding the cup behind my back. Then I took one for the team. After she started going,\u00a0I plunged my hand in and caught some pee. \u201cI got some! I got some!!!\u201d Hope clapped. But Rhema was so upset by it all\u00a0that she stopped producing. She simply could not go anymore. Quickly I set the cup on the sink and helped\u00a0her off the toilet. We washed our hands. Rhema liked the soap dispenser and\u00a0reached for more soap. In so doing she knocked that precious cup o\u2019 pee right off the sink. I\u00a0let out\u00a0a blood-curdling scream as it hit the floor, the contents spraying my sandaled feet\u2026 Back at the nurse\u2019s desk, I put the cup on the counter. The top was screwed on now and there were a\u00a0few little yellow drops inside. \u201cIs this enough?\u201d I said every bit as cheerful as her. She peered at\u00a0our sample and then looked at me. \u201cYyyyeah, this ain\u2019t gonna work.\u201d . .

{"date": "July 28, 2011", "body": "Your love is a symphony \nAll around me, running through me \nYour love is a melody \nUnderneath me, running to me \n~Switchfoot, Your Love Is a Song . My friend  JoyMama  has a darling daughter Joy who is Rhema\u2019s \u201csister across the way.\u201d Both our girls are  window-dancers  and are usually up to the same antics. They are\u00a0the same age, and both have autism and epilepsy issues.\u00a0Months ago JoyMama sent me a piece\u00a0about the comorbidity of  autism and epilepsy . According to the article, roughly one third of individuals with autism also have seizures. JoyMama\u00a0pulled the following quote: \u201cDuring development, the brain is trying to set up all these connections,\u201d notes Ann Berg, research professor of biology at Northern Illinois University.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got these little neurons trying to sing to each other and then this crashing cacophony comes down over them.\u201d Then JoyMama wrote something that made my eyes smart and gave me goosebumps: \u201cBlessings on our beautiful girls and their hard-won songs\u2026\u201d . I\u2019ve written about it many times here. Rhema.  Her language , her life is a song. Hope calls it \u201ctalking with music.\u201d We don\u2019t know or understand the words, but her serenade is ever present. Like a long musical, she\u00a0intones her heart-thoughts; she sings every emotion. It seems to be a melody for her, for us, for the morning and night,\u00a0for toilet paper and rain and air\u00a0and\u00a0macaroni and\u00a0blades of grass; she hums to\u00a0the world. And when I think about it, it kills me and inspires me that she keeps singing. To date, Rhema\u2019s epileptic condition has proven untreatable. She must endure several EEGs a year, and for a child with\u00a0autism and\u00a0the communication paralysis and anxiety and all the sensory sensitivities that tag along, the EEG hookup\u00a0can\u00a0be sheer\u00a0agony. So it was yesterday, and I\u2019m convinced she fought harder than she ever has. Can I say? I wish we didn\u2019t have to keep doing this. For 24 hours a device in her backpack will record every spike and wave, every electrical blast in her brain.\u00a0Just a few months ago the EEG revealed that the \u201ccrashing cacophany\u201d occurs on average\u00a0 58 times a minute  for my girl. She repeatedly takes my hand and puts it on her head. It\u2019s her way of pleading with me to take those awful leads off her head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sweet girl. We have to keep it on.\u201d \nThis is\u00a0the face of autism and epilepsy. .\u00a0 And this is the face of\u00a0a brave\u00a0little soprano\u00a0opening her mouth, . and singing through the storm her hard-won song. .

Rhema\u2019s school is so awesome like that \u2013 they take her swimming once a week and she L.O.V.E.S. it. This morning as I made my way down to the pool I saw Rhema and a few other kids from school getting out of the water and toweling off. It was still early and I wondered what was going on. Then I overheard a staff member explaining to someone that the pool had to be closed for cleaning because someone had pooped in the pool. Ohhhh. My heart sank. Rhema\u2019s been super constipated. And sometimes, as other  friends  can attest, the\u00a0water serves as that all-natural, super-power, no-fail laxative. Yes, some\u00a0casual frollicking in the pool can be quite purgative. (Just ask the hotel guests and staff at\u00a0our nearby\u00a0 Residence Inn .) As Kate and Rhema were heading into the locker room, I caught up to them. \u201cBummer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to get out because someone pooped in the pool.\u201d My face lit up. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d She grinned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t us!!!\u201d \u201cWoohoo!!!!!!\u201d I said. We had a brief conversation as Kate held Rhema\u2019s hand and they stood there dripping wet. And I couldn\u2019t stop smiling, thankful that my girl has teachers who care so much that they\u2019re willing to casually chat with me about Rhema\u2019s bowel activity on the side of the pool. We parted as everyone was making a beeline out of the pool. I waved at them, gave a little fist pump. \u201cSo glad it wasn\u2019t us!\u201d I yelled. Oh, the things we get to celebrate.

{"date": "August 16, 2011", "body": "I don\u2019t even pray this time. Instead I nurse a really bad attitude as we sit in Boston traffic on a bleak, rainy afternoon. We\u2019re on our way to yet another neurology appointment to discuss the poor results of yet another EEG. I\u00a0am already picturing the schlep from the parking garage across the busy city streets into Children\u2019s Hospital. Rhema will bolt toward some unknown destination as I hold on to her for dear life with one hand. With the other hand I will drag Hope along as she stops to compliment a passerby on\u00a0his/her choice of umbrella. I imagine how much easier this would all be if he were here. Brandon\u2019s been away on deployments and TDY assignments 18 months out of the past 2 years. I won\u2019t pretend: it\u2019s taken a toll. This go-round there\u2019s been an all-out war to keep bitterness and discontentment from taking root in my heart, and I have felt so utterly alone. This marriage needs him home, but he keeps getting sent away. This child needs this seizure activity to cease, but it will not. I have prayed and prayed, but these circumstances, they don\u2019t change. God, are you with me? Because I don\u2019t see you and I can\u2019t feel you. And this darn traffic is making us late! A small voice from behind pipes up: \u201cMommy, can you feel this hug?\u201d I glance back and Hope is wrapping her arms around herself. She\u2019s squeezing so hard she\u2019s shaking a little, her eyes are tightly shut. Just the other day I had a conversation with Brandon about a song called  Held  by Natalie Grant. We both happened to be driving (albeit 700 miles apart) and both heard the song on satellite Christian radio. It caught our attention because this wasn\u2019t a song with a nice, neat happy ending. By the last note, there is no deliverance from the present pain and struggle. Just a promise that God is\u00a0 here . With us in it all, through it all, holding us. The song made me think of  Tahni  and her message to me that very day, in the midst of her own grief: \u201cTruly God shows us what it feels to be held.\u201d \u201cThis is what it means to be held, when the sacred is torn from your life and you survive.  This is what it is to be loved and to know that the promise was that when everything fell, we\u2019d be held.\u201d \u201cMom, can you feel it? My dinosaur hug? Grrr. Can you even breathe???\u201d And this is how I hold you. \u201cThank you, sweet girl. I feel it now.\u201d \u00a0 As we park, I get a text message from my twin: \u201cWe\u2019re here, girl. Gonna wait 4 u in garage exit.\u201d And this is how I hold you. \u00a0 I\u2019m so grateful. My sister takes Hope so I can devote all my attention to Rhema and the doctor. He sends us to another floor to get an EKG done. Anyone who knows Rhema knows that\u2019s not happening. Still we go through the motions of trying and trying and fighting and finally one of the technicians writes on the EKG paperwork: \u2018Impossible.\u2019 We head back upstairs, and I have to wrestle her back onto the elevator every time it stops. (Our floor is the 11th floor). By the time we reach Dr. C\u2019s office with our \u2018Impossible\u2019 paperwork I\u2019ve already taken the express train to Pityville. We discuss the EEG results while Rhema hums and plays. The numbers are not great, but surprisingly, they are better than the last time. That\u2019s something! We go through the list of anti-epileptic drugs we\u2019ve tried, all with no success. For now at least, we\u2019re pretty much out of treatment options. Dr. C. gives a resigned shrug. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d I nod. I accept this. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d Rhema scrambles onto the examining table and jumps up and down, knocking a piece of equipment off the wall. I stand and hold out my hand for her to come down. She jumps into my arms, wraps her arms and legs around me, buries her\u00a0face in my neck. I turn around and lean against the table. Rhema doesn\u2019t let go, and I close my tired eyes. And this, my love, is how I hold you. .

Understanding the seriousness of the situation, my twin called right away and talked me through the options. There were the standard, nondescript, go-with-everything pairs. I couldn\u2019t lose with those. If I wanted to live on the edge\u00a0I could get the blacks ones with the little, colorful umbrellas. But rain boots with umbrellas on them? Kind of overkill.

The husband texted: don\u2019t come home without pink ones So I grabbed the only pink pair left (for $19.99, YES, that\u2019s 10 bucks a foot!) and ran to the register before I could change my mind. In the middle of the night I realized I\u2019d totally made the wrong decision. They would have to go back.\u00a0They were completely impractical and\u00a0so  not  me. I figured I better go downstairs and try them on one last time. As I\u00a0studied my funny feet\u00a0in the mirror, I suddenly\u00a0remembered why I really had\u00a0no choice but to keep the boots: I am Hope\u2019s mother. Duh! And as Hope\u2019s mother I simply  must  array myself in pink and white polka dots every chance I get. I imagined her reaction upon discovery of the boots. She would squeal and swoon and beg for a pair for herself and declare me\u00a0the coolest mom on the planet. I giggled and spun in the mirror like she would do. I kicked up my heels,\u00a0and suddenly I  loved  my new boots! Young, bold, cute, fun. Whee! That\u2019s me. Before the storm... When I sat down to remove them I couldn\u2019t get them off. I pulled and pulled and twisted until I was sweating and out of breath. My\u00a0ankles hurt and I pulled something in my back. I couldn\u2019t move. It was past midnight and I wondered if I was going to lose circulation in my feet, if I would meet my Maker in my polka doot\u00a0boots. Someone would find me there on the basement steps the next day. They\u2019d have to use the jaws of life to cut me out. Some time later I woke up on the stairs and was finally able to work those boots off my feet. I limped to bed. Young, bold, cute, fun. Whee! That\u2019s me.

Some have only just begun to talk; some never seemed to have trouble speaking at all. Some script, some have poor articulation, some are monotone and echolalic. But to hear their voices, it just  gets  me. They charm me with their glorious sounds, and honestly, there are times I could dance. I know, I know what a miracle it is. A few of the sweetest sounds I\u2019ve ever heard: Joy.  I dare you to hear her and not smile; no words necessary, her joy is catching: \n http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/09/yawns-are-funny.html . Brooke.

He lives up to his name and this is the sound that reminds me anything is possible: \n http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2010_11_01_archive.html . Reid .  Reid wrote and sang\u00a0this song at his baptism years ago. It\u2019s a powerful, beautiful statement of faith that still brings on the tears and goosebumps. (Scroll down to the 2nd youtube clip), \n http://autismunplugged.blogspot.com/2009/03/praying-with-lior.html . And always on the list is the sound of  Rhema speaking  words of her Bible verse, the one I have said to her every night since she was a baby. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve heard those words, but we believe they\u2019re there in her heart, and we will hear them again. Today we were blessed with another sound, a new song. We were all sitting in the living room having what we call \u201cfamily devotion time.\u201d Brandon prayed, Rhema began to hum softly. Anyone who reads this blog knows that Rhema hums constantly. This time was vastly different because for the first time in almost eight years we recognized a tune. Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star!!! B stopped praying, no one moved and we held our breath as Rhema\u2019s soft song filled the air. She seemed to notice that we\u2019d all gone silent and she stopped humming. B\u2019s voice was thick with emotion as he said, \u201cWe hear you, Rhema.\u201d And then, just for us,\u00a0she hummed the song again. \nJust a little nursery rhyme, but there are no words to describe the beauty of it. We are amazed as she shares with us little by little all that\u2019s inside her,\u00a0all that\u00a0she knows and understands.  Thank you, Lord, for ears to hear Rhema\u2019s song.

{"date": "September 15, 2011", "body": "Many churches have them now\u00a0\u2013 soundproof rooms where parents retreat with their babies so as not to disturb the rest of the congregation. In our church, the crying room is above the sanctuary and has large windows enabling us to hear everything and look out over the whole congregation. Usually parishioners cannot hear the\u00a0happenings in the cry room, but my darling girl has managed to turn that notion on its head. Once a friend came up to the cry room and told me that Rhema\u2019s table-jumping and foot-stomping  could  actually be heard. We\u2019ve been regulars in the cry room since 2004. Like living in a time warp, we\u2019ve seen acquaintances come in with their sweet infants and do their time, a year or so of Sundays. The babies age out, move on to the toddler room and Children\u2019s Church. Some parents return for another stint with a second or third child. We remain. Rhema and me. Or Brandon and Rhema (when it\u2019s his turn). She\u2019s a whirlwind with a curly ponytail. Standing on chairs, crawling under tables, chirping like a bird, coloring feverishly and breaking, peeling,\u00a0eating crayons.\u00a0I\u2019m singing\u00a0a little\u00a0when the congregation sings, praying with one eye open, hearing snippets of the sermon over the noise. We occasionally peer through the window from our \u201cbalconey seats\u201d\u00a0as the worship service flows, catching bits and pieces. I don\u2019t know what she knows. But I wonder if this is how she feels, always on the other side of the glass looking in. Only a fraction of the experience, life\u2019s experiences, never the whole. It doesn\u2019t feel right, my big 7.5 year old darting between nursing mamas and dozing 6-months old and wobbly 1-year olds. And yet it\u2019s where we are. In this room. On this spectrum. She begins to cry, and I don\u2019t know why. But hey,\u00a0we\u2019re in the right place. I sit on the floor, pull her into my lap and whisper:  It\u2019s OK, I\u2019m here.  God whispers:  It\u2019s OK that you\u2019re here. I\u2019m here. Said an elderly Paul the apostle, at the end of life, imprisoned in a Roman dungeon: \u201c\u2026For I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength.\u201d   ~Phil 4:11-13 And I\u00a0know for me\u00a0there\u2019s still more learning, more growing up in,\u00a0more fighting for this secret of\u00a0contentment in the room for crying. .

Wazzup?\u201d And then I collapse. Because the Spirit is willing to blog, but the flesh is sleepy. My mother says I\u2019m \u201csleep depraved.\u201d That\u2019s about right. Rhema went for weeks waking every night around 1 or 2 am. Thankfully, the past few days have been better. At the dinner table Brandon thanked the Lord for Rhema sleeping better this week. Then he added, \u201cOh and Lord if she just heard and understood that, I pray she doesn\u2019t get any ideas.\u201d And, on cue, Rhema snickered. Seriously??!!! Not so long ago I arrived early at Rhema\u2019s special needs school and sat in the parking lot. I watched a teacher help a student walk to his waiting bus. The teacher was a young man and I didn\u2019t know his name. The boy had trouble walking to the bus \u2013 he flopped, he limped, he resisted, he made gurgling noises in protest. He began to tantrum, but the teacher managed to calmly get him to his seat. The teacher did not see me, but I watched him speak kindly as he buckled his student in. Then he gently wiped the drool away from the boy\u2019s mouth. I could have cried. Oh, may there always be people in my girls\u2019 lives who\u00a0are good to them like that when no one\u2019s looking. A friend asked me what we\u2019d been reading when Rhema started humming  Twinkle , Twinkle Little Star. Philippians 2. \u201cDo nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.\u201d I\u2019ve been chewing on that, wondering what it really means to \u2018consider others better\u2019.\u00a0And how it looks in my life at home, at work, in a smelly Boston subway. I see Jesus, and there are not enough words to describe His glory, washing His disciples\u2019 feet, and  stooping  and washing me. And I see the drool wiper upper. .

{"date": "September 27, 2011", "body": "Autism, our autism at least, is about extremes. For years Rhema\u00a0was tactile defensive. Touch  averse . Any time we tried to hug her she would squirm and run away like we\u2019d just eaten garlic pizza and onion rings. But these days we are experiencing such deep, emotional connections with her \u2013 it\u2019s amazing! One of her teachers wrote me: \u2018She\u2019s letting us all in and it feels really great\u2019. Now she loves to give and receive hugs!!! OK, maybe too much. Especially when it\u2019s the \u201cclimb up your back and swing by your neck around to the front and lock legs and maybe take out an eyeball and grab a fistful of your hair as you fall over from the weight of me\u201d hug. At school we\u2019ve discussed that this behavior is something we may need to address. Because you can\u2019t just go hugging anybody (which is kind of sad). And when she won\u2019t stay in her seat and finish her work because she wants to bear hug a teacher walking by, well, it\u2019s endearing but sort of a problem. I blame Hope. She has always demanded hugs from Rhema; she was never daunted by the refusals, only inspired to hug  more . In fact if anyone can be said to exhibit inappropriate hugging it would be Hope, the neurotypical\u00a0one! Her modus operandi is to hug you to death. \n \n \n Hope getting a taste of her own medicine \n \n Last month we planned a \u201cplaydate\u201d with  Jess  and her family. Our friend  Drama  was visiting, and Rhema, Hope and I would be meeting Drama\u2019s beautiful daughters, Miss M and Roxie, for the first time. Miss M is remarkably generous, talented, courageous, and wise beyond her 12 years. She happens to be on the autism spectrum, and over the past couple years she has felt especially close to Rhema \u2013 she has prayed for her, read about her on the blog and even helped her mother send us a care package, picking out a musical toy that she knew would soothe Rhema. (To this day, Rhema loves that toy.) On our drive over to Jess\u2019 house I explained to Hope who we would be meeting and reminded her of the wonderful gifts they\u2019d sent the year before. I had no idea if Rhema was understanding or even listening to our conversation. It was raining when we arrived and my dear friends were crowded at the door \u2013 Jess and Drama, Katie, Brooke, Miss M, Roxie \u2013 and everyone was talking excitedly. Rhema saw no one but Miss M. She walked past the others, reached up and tenderly wrapped her arms around Miss M\u2019s neck. Somehow she  knew . She just knew. And they hugged. No words. Just an embrace of sweet recognition like  I\u2019ve found my sister. It was a moment. I looked at Jess in the doorway, our eyes huge, like  Whoa . Weeks later and we still can\u2019t get over it. We call it The Hug. And everything about that hug was beautifully, gloriously appropriate. .\u00a0 These days I am blessed to see a lot of firsts. Without a doubt, The Hug was the first time I\u2019d ever seen Rhema connect in such a way with another child (besides Hope, and even that is rare). It gives me such joy and hope, you see.

We\u2019ve traveled to visit extended family during the holidays, yes. But we\u2019ve never taken a trip, just us, just to have fun. The girls and I visited\u00a0 Storyland  with my sister last summer \u2013 it\u2019s perfectly suited for a younger crowd. This year I could not wait for Brandon to  experience  Rhema and Hope. To see and feel and never forget Rhema\u2019s uncontainable-missing two front-teeth grin of sheer glee accompanied by a little giggle and a little wiggle just as the roller coaster plummets. (That look on her face is a comfort to me on harder days. I know my girl has known joy.) To witness the stuff of fairytale dreams and magic shining in Hope\u2019s eyes as she rides in the pumpkin coach up to the castle and hugs Cinderella. Holding her Daddy\u2019s hand, she believes she\u2019s a beautiful princess, too. \u00a0 I told him about the \u201cDisability Pass\u201d. The one that allows children with disabilities to avoid waiting in long queues. I felt a smidge of guilt using it at times \u2013 like we were cutting the line. Brandon pointed out that it was actually called a VIP pass. And that\u2019s about right. The amusement park staff treated us \u2013 the whole family \u2013 like \u201cVery Important People.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m romanticizing things a bit, but it almost seemed like an acknowledgement\u2026 like they were saying, \u2018We get that life can be extra challenging sometimes. But here, well, just have a good time as a family.\u2019 I looked at my Hope and thought of all the big-little sacrifices she makes as the sibling of a special needs child. This time she held her sister\u2019s hand. And got to go first. It had me thinking about a heavenly VIP pass. One in which the broken, the needy, the disqualified, the guilty and ashamed\u2026 are given a pass, invited in. The King Himself takes the hand and puts\u00a0a ring of grace on my finger. He makes me a daughter \u2013 a princess, adorning me in mercy\u2019s robe and sandals for dancing free. The use of these passes at parks have generated some controversy. I\u2019ve heard some people complain. I\u2019ve heard others have abused the passes. But at that little park on that special day, we were grateful for the VIP status. We made a point of going to the office and saying \u2018thank you, you have no idea, we couldn\u2019t have done this day without your help.\u2019 We rode on every ride together, we acquired funny-colored tongues from rainbow snow cones, we inhaled powdered sugar off fried dough, each of us storing up the memories as treasures in the heart.

Hope places our order: \u201cWe need some French fries!\u201d We drive up to the second window, I quickly hand the woman the money, and the race is on. Gotta get home fast.

But once they\u2019re cold, they\u2019re inedible. I\u2019ve heard of people using a microwave to reheat them. This is  no bueno . Soggy, limp fries are like a cake with no\u00a0frosting \u2013 such a waste! Fries must be vetted. They need to be crispy. But not so crispy that they are approaching burned. And not the ones with the dark shriveled ends. McDonalds fries that are hot, salty and perfectly crispy are tolerable without ketchup, but Burger King and Wendy\u2019s fries always require ketchup.)

It\u2019s a quick visit \u2013 he\u2019s been away on a military assignment for months and has two months left to go. He did the planes, trains and automobiles to get home. The girls and I were to pick him up at the train station. But Rhema was in meltdown mode. She had been tantrumming in the kitchen for nearly an hour. And now I was asking her to do something outside the normal routine. I just knew I was going to have a hard time getting her shoes and pants on and getting her to the car. \u00a0 If only I could communicate with her! If only she could understand. I could explain that we\u2019re just going for a ride \u2013 she won\u2019t even have to get out of the car. \u201cRhema, we\u2019re going bye-bye!\u201d I reached out to her and she resisted.

Let\u2019s go!\u201d \u201cRhema, we\u2019re going to go get Daddy!\u201d What happened next was nothing short of amazing. Her expression changed, she stopped resisting. She was  listening . I said it again, slowly, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Daddy, Rhema. We\u2019re going to get Daddy.\u201d Instantly she stood up and went down the stairs and headed to the garage. I just stood there for a moment with my mouth open, letting the realization sink in.  She understands!!! Before I could even get her pants and shoes on, she ran out the door, jumped in the car and buckled herself in. I drove to the train station amazed and overjoyed.

He went to Rhema right away, and they shared such a sweet reunion. As they held on to each other, my heart filled. Truly, it felt like waking up.\u00a0 And I\u00a0probably sounded\u00a0silly but I couldn\u2019t stop saying, \u201cI told you, baby. See? We got Daddy. I told you. I told you.\u201d .

{"date": "September 5, 2011", "body": "Wow. We still have many situations when Rhema cannot express what she wants and needs, or tell us what hurts\u2026 when her lack of language is heartbreaking and frustrating for her and us. But slowly a page has turned, and we\u2019ve entered a new phase of discovery. On previous pages was a child hyperactive and isolated. Seared in my memory is the time a group of clowns came into a small hospital waiting room and called her name, blew bubbles, tossed toilet paper, while my girl ran in circles and never seemed to hear or notice them. But now, here is a girl who demonstrates appropriate affection, is teachable, has  relationships  with her family and teachers, understands words and directions and tries her best to follow them. Of late,\u00a0this same child\u00a0is discerning, so very present and participative, so with us. She\u2019s always enjoyed the ocean breeze on a late summer day. But now when she grins and squeals, she  shares  it \u2013 for just a moment she looks our way and we get to see her eyes dance. Her growth, in spite of all the challenges,\u00a0is changing our family\u00a0heartbeat, bringing\u00a0unexpected joy. Two quick stories. Yesterday morning I got to sleep in. You know. Until 6:30 am. Rhema burst into my room, making her happy sounds, moving all around. I figured she was probably hungry, ready for the day to begin. But I didn\u2019t move. I wanted to see if she would acknowledge my presence, approach me. She wandered the room in ceaseless \u201csong\u201d, flapping an old cheese wrapper in her hand. She chewed her shirt. She found a water bottle and guzzled it. She went into the bathroom and flushed the toilet. She jumped up and down on the bed. But I waited, pretending to be asleep. After a while her humming stopped, and I sensed her beside me. I could feel her breath while I held mine. I was in a precarious position and wondered what she would do \u2013 jump on me? stick her fingers up my nose? push me out of bed? But anything she did \u2013 even if I lost an eyeball \u2013 was better than nothing at all ,\u00a0 the nothing that used to be. And then\u2026 then\u2026 ever so lightly, like an anointing, she laid a wooden puzzle piece on my forehead. Then she bounced out of the room, humming as she went. Hooray! She acknowledged me in her own special way. She gave me a piece of her; treasured puzzle. . We have locks on the refrigerator and freezer doors. I like to think the locks may prompt her some day to come and ask for what she wants. But really the locks are to keep her from engorging on cheese and popsicles. I grabbed something out of the freezer for dinner and forgot to lock the door. I ran upstairs to throw in a load of laundry. When I came back I found Rhema chowing down on an Italian ice cup. When she saw me she dropped her spatula. She slinked out of her chair and put the half-eaten Italian ice back into the freezer. Can I tell you how unbelievable this was?? The fact that she understood that she shouldn\u2019t be in the freezer, should not be eating sweets before dinner (?).  The fact that she bothered to get a utensil \u2013 albeit a big plastic spatula- and used it!  The fact that her face registered something like guilt. (Until recently, she\u2019s had the moral compass of Swiper the Fox, always grabbing, snatching other children\u2019s food, toys, etc.) The fact that she understood she did something wrong and tried to, oh so typically, remedy the situation. I laughed until I cried. Goodness. This girl of mine, she\u2019s keeps growing up. It\u2019s beautiful and hope-filling and amazing  and just about the scariest thing I can think of.  But watching her and experiencing her now, this blossoming, I feel strangely braver than ever before. And I like her. I really like her.

No matter how I try to\u00a0compartmentalize, I still seem to see\u00a0 everything  through the Mommy lens\u2026 which leads me to that fact that\u2026 ~I solved a medical mystery! Hope\u2019s asthma has been pretty bad lately. We started noticing that whenever she took a bath she\u2019d have an asthma attack. Hope is a bubbly, happy girl who is usually too excited about life to complain about anything. But\u00a0during\u00a0her baths her lips would turn blue and she would panic and gasp and wail and beg for her medicine. Once I was alone with the girls in the tub, and I worried that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to get her to the hospital. It\u2019s the only time her asthma has ever really frightened me. Well, I finally figured out that mold in our ooollllldddd bathroom must be triggering the attacks. She\u2019s allergic to mold. \nSo then the question became do we remove the mold or just\u00a0stop bathing her? \nWe stopped bathing her. \nJust kidding. \nBut we won\u2019t have to deal with the mold anymore because\u2026 ~We\u2019re moving in a week! About 3 miles up the road. In all the sorting and purging and packing, it occurred to me that I had done nothing to prepare Rhema for the move. (She doesn\u2019t seem to grasp social stories.) So while we were at Sears buying a new washer and dryer, I sat on the floor, pulled her into my lap and had a heart-to-heart with her. \u201cRhema,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving.\u201d \nIn response, she picked her nose. \nThen she sprinted off to make sure all the dryer doors in the store were closed. \n Phew .  That went well\u2026 ~Speaking of things going well, I got to see my J-girlz at the  Doug Flutie  Bowl last week \u2013  Jersey ,  Jess  and  Judith ! (Jersey came all the way up from guess where?)\u00a0Any time spent with these dear friends just does my heart good. How can I begin to explain the bond \u2013 the sisterhood \u2013\u00a0between us autism mamas? I think my friend  Andrea  says it best: our  invisible tattoos match .

{"date": "January 28, 2011", "body": "We\u2019ve been packing up the house and have comes across many of my handwritten notes\u00a0about Rhema. The notes date all the way back to 2005 when we were living in Germany and\u00a0she was only 19 months old. I recorded when she stacked blocks, when she led me to something she wanted, when she clicked her tongue in imitation. All of the notes highlight my fears and worries and my hopes in her progress. Finding the notes has stirred a quiet\u00a0ache in the husband and\u00a0me \u2013 we didn\u2019t have a diagnosis back then; we did not know what\u00a0was ahead. While cleaning today, Hope brought an old yellow notebook to me. I absent-mindedly flipped it open and\u00a0the memories\u00a0were so heavy I had to sit down. I had lists. Every word she ever approximated, repeated, whispered, said or maybe said, I wrote it down.  How careless we are with our many words. Every word counts. There was\u00a0a year\u2019s worth of notes. Each day I\u00a0recorded something new or amazing about Rhema. Some days it was hard to find a positive story to tell:  Today Rhema recovered from her tantrum\u2026 quickly\u2026 relatively speaking\u2026 I\u2019ve known parents who receive the life-changing\u00a0news that their child has autsim\u00a0with calm, courage\u00a0and grace. I wish I could say we took it well. We did not.\u00a0We were\u00a0absolutely devastated .  The first page in the notebook was a letter I\u2019d written to Rhema\u00a0on the day I finally knew she had autism \u2013 we had not even see a developmental pediatrician yet, but I could no longer deny the truth.\u00a0The pain of that day came rushing back and tears burned my eyes. All I wanted was to talk with my daughter, but I could not. I desperately needed to know her, to hear how she felt, what she thought. But as I read the letter I found again\u00a0the comfort and hope that has carried us the past five years. Rhema still has autism; we still fight for words. But the Word has been poured into her. It\u2019s the only Word that really speaks. \u00a0 \u00a0  Excerpts of a letter from a mother to her daughter: My Rhema, On this day I live with the revelation that all is not well with you, sweet baby girl. You have a significant speech delay, and you exhibit behaviors and delays consistent with an autistic child. But let me try to write of how our God is an awesome God, how his Rhema Word has heartened my grieving spirit.\u00a0 Simply put, my dear, we have Jesus. He is our hope of\u00a0glory. Psalm 61:1-2 \u201cHear my cry, O God: attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.\u201d  O my girl, what a comfort there is in Jesus. Without\u00a0Him I would surely\u00a0fall. I can say that even if things are the absolute worst, it is still somehow O.K. when you have Him. Psalm 62:1,2, 7-8 \u201cTruly my soul waiteh upon God: from Him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense, I shall not be greatly moved\u2026 pour out your heart before Him: God is a refuge for us.\u201d  I know Him like this, Rhema. I know Him to be the very rock of my strength; my salvation, my glory, my strong tower, and all at once my refuge. By and by, He\u2019s teaching me to trust Him at all times, and I finally feel a revival beginning in my heart in the midst of trial. Psalm 28:1, 6-7 \u201cUnto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock; be not silent\u00a0to me\u2026 Blessed be the Lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in Him and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise Him. Simply by trusting in Him, we are helped. And our hearts rejoice. My Rhema, know that when you can read and understand this letter, that our Lord\u00a0is faithful and He has worked an amazing work in you, for His glory. Until that day\u2026 I love you always, Mommy\u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/notes1.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/notes2.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/notes-about-god-and-a-girl/", "title": "Notes about God and a\u00a0girl"},

{"date": "October 25, 2010", "body": "\u201cAnd even when the trees have just surrendered \n To the harvest time \n Forfeiting their leaves in late September \n And sending us inside \n Still I notice You when change begins \n And I am braced for colder winds \n I will offer thanks for what has been and was to come \n You are autumn\u2026\u201d \n~ Every Season , Nichole Nordeman . \u00a0 It\u2019s October, and we are in a sort of  crisis mode  just as we were  last year  this time. When the weather turns, Rhema turns. There\u2019s resistance to extra clothing. The shift from T-shirts and shorts to long sleeves and pants is never appreciated. In the morning I must coax (and sometimes fight) her into her clothes, and she strips as soon as she gets home. If she gets frustrated or upset in public, the clothes start flying off. Donning pajamas is pointless. A\u00a0switch is flipped in October, and eating habits change. The picky eater gets pickier and\u00a0favorite foods suddenly become offensive. She\u00a0does away with\u00a0breakfast all together. I\u2019m left scrambling to find some food item that she may deem\u00a0tolerable. In autumn, she starts soiling her pants again and the\u00a0Poop Art Show rolls back into town. (Weary sigh). Meltdowns, non-compliance, unusual stims return with a vengeance. There\u2019s always the issue of light. In the fall and winter, it\u2019s just too dark.\u00a0Over the past two years it\u2019s become clear to me that she misses/craves the sunlight of summer. She insists on having the lights on in her room all night. She has a dimmer switch, and the lights are turned to the brightest. While colder weather and shorter days might cause some to \u201chibernate\u201d, these months are marked by insomnia for Rhema. Her nightly antics include shrieking, banging the walls and pounding the door, humming, laughing, crying, breaking down her bed, ripping books to shreds and painting her room in  brown.  Last year, her neurologist prescribed a rather strong sleep aid. It did not work. The doctor prescribed another, stronger medication, but I\u00a0worried and never gave\u00a0it to her. Then in early spring she began sleeping much better on her own, and it continued throughout the summer. Difficult\u00a0behaviors are heightened in September and October and persist throughout the winter (albeit to a lesser degree).\u00a0I joked with Rhema\u2019s therapist, T, that we needed to move somewhere where it\u2019s \u2018summer all the time.\u2019 She suggested that I try a lightbox for Rhema \u2013 the kind used to treat individuals with  Seasonal Affective Disorder . It got me wondering if Rhema does indeed suffer some form of SAD and if this is common among people with autism. Rhema does not\u00a0experience \u201cwinter depression\u201d, but it absolutely amazes me how cyclical and predictable these behaviors have become \u2013 starting in September and abating at the end of March\u00a0and beginning of April. Oh, a part of me felt so discouraged this time. I hoped that she had outgrown it somehow. But just as we\u00a0retreat inside when the leaves change and fall, so it seems does my girl. I feel it, too, the chill and dread of the coming season; the need to brace myself against\u00a0its barreness and\u00a0darkness. I know what winters past have brought. And just when\u00a0I think\u00a0I\u2019m past it, the same old battles and\u00a0fears come creeping in. All the more reason to fall on my knees and cling to Jesus, the same yesterday, today and forever. I\u2019m reminded of how desperately I need His Light. Season by season, day by day, moment by moment. And \u2018 faith  never looks so grand in summer weather as it does in winter.\u2019 It seems that Rhema and I are not alone in this\u00a0seasonal disorder. A couple years ago,\u00a0 Tim  from  Both Hands and a Flashlight  wondered if autistic persons might have a greater probability of having SAD than the general population. Last month, on a rare girls night out with  Jess  and  Judith  (woohoo!), they both shared that their children experienced regression during the change of season. Also in  peak stim season \u00a0is Joy, Rhema\u2019s window-dancing  sister across the way .\u00a0I\u2019d be really curious if anyone else has noticed such a link? Do some\u00a0ASD behaviors\u00a0vary by season? . . *Picture source:  http://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/download/4-seasons-1-tree.jpg ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SqG50ynfdw", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/4-seasons-1-tree.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder", "http://www.spurgeon.org/daily.htm", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2008/11/13/seasonal-affective-disorder-and-autism/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/", "http://autismville.blogspot.com/", "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/10/peak-stim-season.html", "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/09/similarities.html", "http://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/download/4-seasons-1-tree.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/on-autism-and-seasons/", "title": "On Autism and\u00a0Seasons"},

Friday morning I began receiving scripted phone calls that\u00a0my husband\u2019s unit\u00a0would be arriving at Fort Stewart, Georgia with a homecoming ceremony scheduled for 11:35 that night. I was not surprised to get the calls \u2013 I knew Brandon was making his way through Iraq and Europe because I had not spoken to him in days. Weeks earlier we had discussed the homecoming and decided that the girls and I would not attend. We could not be exactly sure when he\u2019d arrive \u2013 it was too expensive to fly to GA\u00a0on short notice\u00a0and just too hard to plan for. But as the calls came in, I suddenly knew I had to be there. It meant booking a last minute flight, making hasty arrangements\u2026 and asking for help. I called on friends to make grocery store runs and take 4-hour shifts of babysitting\u00a0throughout the weekend. They gladly blessed me by caring for Rhema and Hope\u00a0 \u2013 (Thank you so much Gail, Amalia, Melissa and Yoon!). My sister spent the nights with the girls at home so as not to disrupt Rhema\u2019s routine. It was a BIG DEAL for me to spontaneously leave my girls for a whole weekend.\u00a0But\u00a0it was important and necessary\u00a0for me to\u00a0put\u00a0 us  first. Those of us who are blessed to be married \u2013 whether you\u2019ve been at it for 5 days or 50 years, whether you\u2019ve been apart for a year or you think you see way too much of each other \u2013 we all have a chance to do something new. Show more grace, serve in love, build up instead of tear down. (Thank God for second, third, fourth, fifth chances.) For me, this day,\u00a0it meant finally letting go of some things and  running  to my man. . I made it there\u00a0just in time, only to\u00a0learn that the group of three hundred and fifty-four soldiers had been delayed and the ceremony would not begin until 1:05 am. Around 1000 people gathered on the field: mothers, fathers, spouses, children. There was such a sense of excitement and anticipation \u2013 understandably so \u2013 as these families have been waiting fifteen months for their soldier to come home.\u00a0Kids ran back and forth across the field, babies were bounced and bundled. There were large, homemade signs, red-white-blue balloons and flowers everywhere. A not-so-good band played patriotic tunes, and murdered hits like \u201cMustang Sally\u201d and \u201cSuperstition.\u201d But\u00a0we danced anyway. Someone handed me a flag. We waited. And we waited and waited. My toes grew numb from the cold and I had to use the bathroom but I dared not leave. Instead I walked the Warriors Walk \u2013 a memorial to Soldies killed in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom- that surrounded the field. I prayed for the families of soldiers who\u2019d been lost. I thanked God for keeping this\u00a0husband and father safe and bringing him home. I thanked God for the long, hard year. It felt surreal to finally make it to this point,\u00a0the deployment\u2019s end.\u00a0I thanked God for all of the people who have loved us and supported us and prayed for us these past many months \u2013 I named every one I could name, knowing there are\u00a0some whose names I don\u2019t even know. After my walk, it was announced that the buses carrying the soldiers were minutes away. I turned and saw people lining the streets, cheering, waving signs and flags. It was 2:30 am. White buses with soldiers leaning out the windows made their way down the streets, and they\u00a0received a hero\u2019s welcome. So many young ones. They had done their duty, and  they were home . My heart was gripped, and I was\u00a0honored to be in the number cheering for them. Lonely, painful scenes from the past year filled my mind, but I wasn\u2019t bitter. I thought, maybe just maybe all of the hard stuff was worth it. For this moment. The buses pulled around the back of the field, out of sight.\u00a0There were tears and cheers as everyone waited\u00a0for the soldiers to get in formation and come onto the field. The not-so-good\u00a0lead singer\u00a0crooned  \u201cSoooooldier. Get on off that bus. I said, get on off that bus.\u201d  Finally\u00a0they marched onto the field, and the crowd went wild. Someone sang the National Anthem. Men and women\u00a0in uniform\u00a0on the field\u00a0and in the bleachers stood at attention. An older man standing next to me, in his Harley Davidson leather jacket, doffed his hat and belted out the words with tears streaming down his cheeks. The chaplain prayed. The general gave a speech.\u00a0The Army song was\u00a0sung. And then family and friends were ordered to \u201cattack the formation\u201d, and\u00a0people raced onto the field. A friend of Brandon\u2019s who had served with him in Iraq for a time motioned for me to follow him \u2013 we had not seen Brandon yet. I spotted him first. His head was down slightly as he walked quickly off the field. I saw a mixture of emotions on his face \u2013 relief, exhaustion, happiness, a little sadness that his family was not there. His friend embraced him. Then he said, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got someone here to see you\u2026\u201d The look on his face when he saw me\u2026 well, then I knew it had all been worth it. All of it. . One of the things that has always moved me are the signs at homecoming ceremonies. They are always colorful, personal and wonderfully decorated. When Brandon came home from his first deployment in 2005, there were signs that said \u201cGod Kept You Safe\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re Our Hero\u201d, \u201cJob Well Done\u201d, \u201cWe Love You, We Missed You\u201d, \u201cYour Country Thanks You.\u201d\u00a0At this ceremony, a little girl wore a shirt that said \u201cOutta my way, I\u2019ve got to get to my Daddy.\u201d Another rather busty woman wore a tight T-shirt with hearts and lips all over it that said, \u201cWelcome Home, Baby.\u201d A little boy, about five or six, carried a sign that read \u201cWelcome Back, Mommy!\u201d (That one got me). The Harley-Davidson dude held a poster that said, \u201cI\u2019m So Proud of You, Son!\u201d Last week when I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be at the ceremony I made a simple sign and got my sis to take a picture. It\u2019s not colorful or fancy at all, it took me 2 minutes to make. But it means everything in the world. Believe me, more than you can know. And so I carried it with me on the plane all the way from Massachusetts, and when I saw \u2018my soldier\u2019 I stepped back and held up my sign.

{"date": "October 27, 2010", "body": "I\u2019ve collected lots of photos over the years of her\u00a0in the hospital for EEGs. I\u2019ve kept time in my heart and mind on all the effort spent making sense of the seizure activity in her brain. \u00a0 \u00a0 The pictures remind me of our history, the long trail of medications in treating Rhema\u2019s Landau Kleffner syndrome. Depakote, Keppra (aka Kepp\u2019rage\u2019, nightmare drug), Lamictal, Diazepam and combinations thereof and countless EEGs. \u00a0 We\u2019ve recently had a long period of respite in terms of Rhema\u2019s epilepsy. But it has not been without cost. Just before Brandon deployed we made the  difficult decision  to put her on a high dose diazepam/valium protocol \u2013 the only drug that seemed to calm the continuous spikes in her brain. The medication can be highly addictive with long-term use. In fact, she went on it a couple years ago in the hospital and even though she had a clean EEG for the first time ever, doctors weaned her from the drug immediately and put her on  another  (non-addicting) anti-seizure med. The seizures came back with a vengeance. We decided to go back on the diazepam long term, not knowing what \u201clong term\u201d meant but knowing it probably could not\u00a0mean forever. We just knew this was a  chance  for Rhema. With her brain  quiet ,   she could really learn and even gain language. So it\u2019s been over a year and I have not given much thought at all to spikes and absence seizures and EEG\u2019s. Such a relief. In fact, only when I come across an old picture every now and then do I remember that we are on \u201cborrowed time\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 Last month when I called for a new authorization on Rhema\u2019s anti-seizure med, her neurologist got antsy. Time\u2019s up. Time to deal. Time to re-evaluate.  There\u2019s always something,  isn\u2019t there? We are at the  crossroads  again\u2026\u00a0facing what seems to me in my freak-out moments like an almost impossible decision. Is the med still as effective as it was a year ago? Is she good and addicted now after a year on the drug? Will she go through some frightening withdrawal if we take her off? Will the seizures come back again? Will she lose all that she\u2019s gained? Do we dare take her off? Zero hour is almost upon us. 24-hour ambulatory EEG on Monday. . \u201cO our God\u2026 we have no power to face this\u2026 We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon you.\u201d\u00a0 2 Chron. 20:12 \u00a0 \ufeff .

{"date": "November 17, 2010", "body": "The first year of Rhema\u2019s autism and epilepsy diagnosis I felt gripped by an ever-present, distracting sadness. I no longer feel such a sense of loss. But lately, as things have been more difficult for my girl, I feel the old grief catching me off guard and threatening to spill from my eyes. (And I\u2019m not a crier. It\u2019s an emotional time in general around here. Maybe that\u2019s it.) \u201cDoes she count anymore? She used to count.\u201d Brandon\u2019s only been home a few weeks. He missed a year of her life. Apparently there were things she could do a year ago that she is no longer doing. I remember well the day she started \u201ccounting.\u201d Hope was only weeks old, and I had my six-week postpartum appointment. My mother stayed with Rhema in the waiting room, and when I came out my mother could barely contain herself. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this. She counted for me. She  counted!!!! \u201d And then Rhema counted for me to five with the perfect voice and intonation of Dora the Explorer. Nevermind that I knew exactly which Dora episode she was mimicking (and I thought, note to self: find a Dora video where she counts to 12 or 20)\u2026 my Rhema was saying her numbers! I was relieved. I felt, I  believed  that everything would be alright. She could say numbers. Surely she would be talking up a storm soon. \u201cShe used to count,\u201d Brandon repeats emphatically. \u201cTo 5, at least. Maybe 10.\u201d I don\u2019t tell him that I have not heard Rhema say any numbers in years. That somewhere along the way we stopped working on it constantly, and she lost it. I don\u2019t tell him that once upon a time she would sing a little of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star \u2013 I have the video to prove it \u2013 but no longer. I don\u2019t speak of the impossible exhaustion I feel in knowing that every single darn thing she might learn has to be reinforced and practiced every single day or it might go away. And what breaks my heart the most\u2026 what I don\u2019t want to say out loud\u2026 is that she does not say the words in her  verse  anymore. That day was one of the happiest of my life, they were the  sweetest sounds I\u2019ve ever heard . It\u2019s the moment on which I hang my hope. And I don\u2019t want to take anything away from it, by facing the fact that, now, somehow the words are lost. I think I know some of what it\u2019s like to lose what you know, to lose  you . When you\u2019ve fallen a thousand steps back and no longer recognize yourself. When confusion, despair and shame have their way with you until there\u2019s nothing left but a numb soul. You stumble in the darkness and cannot recall the words to get out. In desperation I whisper, \u201cGod, teach me again! Speak to my heart! Give me the words that will bring new life.\u201d And He, the Speech Maker,\u00a0surrounds with songs of deliverance. And I find that I never really lost it. The Word was always there. As I learn to\u00a0speak the words\u00a0again, in the midst of waiting-on-answer prayers and unchanging circumstances, I know them better now. They were once in my head; now experience has painstakingly etched them on my heart. The Word is sharp, true, alive\u2026 able to penetrate soul and spirit, able to save. Forever stands. So we\u2019ll start over. Again I\u2019ll teach her, and we will learn. Word for word.

This week Rhema\u2019s doctor decided to stop treating her for lead poisoning. Her lead level is currently at 17, which is still higher than the normal range of 0 to 9. But chelation therapy has its risks and doctors don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary to treat her unless her numbers go up into the 20\u2019s. They will continue to monitor her every couple months. When Rhema began chelation therapy I read up on it. Those of us\u00a0in the autism community are familiar with the  controversy  surrounding its use. (In our case, of course, it was used to treat lead poisoning,  not  autism.) Chelation is based on a Greek word which means \u201cclaw.\u201d During treatment a chemical grabs and binds to heavy metals in the blood/body (hence the word \u201cclaw\u201d). The metals\u00a0are then flushed out (in the urine). How this reminds me of the nature of Christ \u2013 to bind Himself to us and our corrupt, broken-down places.\u00a0A Divine\u00a0chelating agent, able to filter and wholly cleanse the blood with His Own. \u201cSurely He took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows\u2026 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.\u201d Is. 53: 4,5. . The company hired to delead the house also finished the job this week, and the house passed its final inspection by the state. Windows were replaced, walls were scraped and covered with encapsulating paint, woodwork was stripped on the inside and out, doors were dipped, the stairs were re-carpeted. Rhema\u2019s room was completely redone with new trim, and the lead-filled box beneath her window that she liked to climb in has been replaced with a sealed bench. The entire house was cleaned, purged, and specially dusted multiple times to make sure all traces of lead were removed. We have moved back in, and it\u2019s a relief to know that the house is safe for my girls. I don\u2019t have to fret every time Rhema puts her fingers in her mouth. The house feels different, simpler, less cluttered. The wall hangings and drapes are still packed away in boxes. I have joked throughout this process that nobody worried about the poor mama. Rhema\u2019s blood has been tested a bajillion times for lead. Hope was tested. Inspectors spent hours and hours testing every nook and cranny of this old\u00a0house. But no one bothered to see if the crazy mother was poisoned. (Brandon assured me that as long as I stop licking the baseboards I should be fine). Even so, I am being deleaded. \u00a0 My home, my family, my marriage \u2013 everything I have\u00a0has been subjected to\u00a0a decontamination process.

It feels like tradition now \u2013 to go to Children\u2019s Hospital when the halls are less busy and Dr. C can spend extra time with us. I\u2019d done my research before the appointment. We\u2019d talked over the pros and cons of keeping Rhema on her current anti-epileptic med. (I\u2019ve written before about diazepam being the only drug to keep Rhema seizure-free. The downside is drug dependency with long-term use and Rhema has been on it for over a year). But when we walked into Dr. C\u2019s office, I was ready. And then the curve ball socked us in the gut. \u201cHer latest EEG was not clean. Far from it. In fact, her brain is spiking 40 times a minute, increasing during sleep.\u201d Hope was climbing over me, fighting Rhema for a toy. Huh? \u201cIt would seem that the medicine is no longer working. Her EEG results are even worse than before.\u201d We stammered.  Really? Brandon even asked if there was some mistake. Dr. C assured us that the test was accurate. \u201cI, I mean, we\u2019ve seen some challenging behaviors lately\u2026 and some poor sleeping and it seemed like she\u2019d  lost some skills . But, but, overall she\u2019s been doing well.\u201d Dr. C was scribbling notes, so I rambled on. \u201cEver since she started attending Futures School her language has greatly improved. She understands so much more now, she\u2019s  learning to trace her name , and she can say single words when prompted!\u201d Dr. C was quiet while Brandon skimmed the report and I numbly searched for a snack for the kids in my bag.  We\u2019ve lost our trump card , I thought,  her brain is now resisting the only drug that\u2019s ever worked. \u201cWhat\u2019s background slowing?\u201d Brandon asked, looking up from the report. Dr. C looked at us as if we should already know. \u201cWell\u2026 it can indicate structural damage to the brain. And, you know, developmental and cognitive delay.\u201d \u00a0 I laughed at this. I really didn\u2019t know what else to do. That very morning I had dressed her in stylish 6X jeans and then scrubbed her mouth out after she ate a bunch of crayons while my back was turned. Yes. Developmental delay. But everyone else who knows and sees my girl \u2013 they see her in the context of the autism and the delays and the behaviors. They don\u2019t know her apart from it. But I still see something different. I still see an angel baby in my arms with the world at her fingertips. I still see her singing in the children\u2019s choir, playing sports, going shopping with me, learning to drive, going on her first date, kicking butt in college, giving me a grandson. I still see my dreams, I still see my future, my very life in her. So when you say \u2018permanent background slowing is associated with poor cognitive prognosis\u2019, it still knocks the wind out of me. Sometimes I still don\u2019t understand how this can be. We discussed our options with the doctor. We\u2019ve exhausted the anti-epileptic drugs. There are only two things we have not tried: ACTH steroid therapy or seeing if she\u2019s a candidate for a brain surgery called multiple subpial transection (MST). The steroid therapy has a host of  very  unpleasant side effects and seems to only be effective for short periods of time. And I\u2019m just not in the mood right now to be slicing up my kid\u2019s brain. I gave an emphatic \u2018NO\u2019 to both. We made plans for another EEG in a few months, but I felt like a chapter was closing. We\u2019ve wrestled this seizure disorder since she was two years old. We\u2019ve put\u00a0her on drug after drug. At least for now, Mama says, No more. We took the girls home. \u00a0. That night while Brandon was reading the Bible to Hope, Rhema crawled into my lap. She  never  does this. We\u2019d given her a sleep med, and as I held her head in my hands, she slept. It was a gift. I looked at my watch and counted to 40.\u00a0 Forty times a minute, her brain is seizing. Have mercy!  Dr. C has explained that it\u2019s like a radio station that keeps losing signal or a computer that reboots endlessly. He said that when she sleeps, the quality of her sleep must be very poor. Most of us just take\u00a0sleep for granted. But drowsiness alone sets off an electrical storm in Rhema\u2019s brain. I want to scream at the LKS monster that punishes my daughter every time her body needs to rest. I\u00a0just stared at her. So achingly beautiful,\u00a0my little girl. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat\u00a0you\u2019ve been able to do, what\u00a0you\u2019ve been able to learn considering everything that\u2019s working against you.\u00a0You\u2019re amazing.\u00a0You\u2019re amazing.\u201d Brandon read from Psalm 4:8. \u201cI will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.\u201d Peace. Please? In the storm, You are our peace, Lord. Thank you. .

She expected all of the plebians in her life to address her as Princess Strawberry (or Aurora or Anneliese or Ariel or whatever name struck her fancy). She memorized the book \u201cWhat Is a Princess?\u201d At the\u00a0supermarket she\u2019d wave her wand at a watermelon and\u00a0command it to \u201cturn into a coach.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Her mother took her to see Cinderella at the North Shore Music Theater. The little girl was so excited she even wore blue Cinderella undies.\u00a0 When they arrived they saw that the music theater\u00a0had been\u00a0overtaken by a fairytale\u00a0convention. In\u00a0a sea of little-girl princesses, Hope did not need make-believe, she  was  Princess Cinderella. From the moment the curtain opened she was entranced, this was better than a dream! When the Prince came on stage the mother was sure she heard her\u00a03.5 year old\u00a0 swoon . The\u00a0mother enjoyed watching\u00a0the little princess more than she did the show. Then she glanced at her watch and realized in a panic that they would have to leave in fifteen minutes to pick up Hope\u2019s sister from school.  Ooops.  She had not expected the show to last\u00a0so long! This was an  emergency . Desperately the mother scanned the audience, looking for someone she might know, someone\u00a0who could\u00a0watch the girl while she went to pick up her other child. But there was no one. The mother contemplated calling someone, but she couldn\u2019t use her cell phone in the middle of the show. They would have to leave the show early\u2026 right at the part where Cinderella runs from the ball and the clock strikes midnight (or really, 2:15 pm). The mother carried the royal child\u00a0out of the theater, a mass of pink lace and taffeta, her\u00a0arms and legs outstretched toward the stage. In the aisle, her  glass slipper  sparkly shoe fell off her foot. The mother grabbed it, but did not try to put it back on. Even the ushers looked horrified as they exited. How could they leave now? Her highness, stunned, said nothing as she was buckled in, her gown threatening to overtake her through the carseat straps. Crown crooked, wand dangling, huge crocodile tears spilled down her fairy cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, Princess.\u201d The\u00a0girl sobbed. \u201cOh,\u00a0fair princess. Look! I have your glass slipper!\u201d The child\u00a0looked up and wiped the tears from her angel face,\u00a0eagerness in her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s start at the beginning of the story, o.k.? I\u2019m Cinderella.\u201d \u201cO.K.! And I\u2019ll play the Fairy Godmother!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she sighed,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the evil stepmother.\u201d Clearly. . The End.

Brandon will be coming home from Iraq sometime in October or November. (Thanks to all of you who have asked!) We\u2019re on the home stretch of a 15-month deployment! In December we will move to the DC metro area. This is not what I wanted. This has been our home for four years. Hope was born here; it\u2019s the only home she\u2019s ever known. My family is here \u2013 my parents and younger brother.\u00a0My dear twin sister and her family are here- we\u2019re just not meant to be apart. Our community and church are here. It\u00a0breaks my heart\u00a0to\u00a0leave behind people I love dearly. . And then there\u2019s Rhema. (Isn\u2019t that always the line? She will always be my subject to approval, my special consideration, my exception clause.) After three years of tweaking it\u00a0and\u00a0working at it she is in\u00a0an outstanding\u00a0learning environment. Her school, Futures, is the best of best. Her therapists outside of school are excellent; they know her, teach her and love her so well. Her neurologist of four years  cares  and understands a little-understood seizure disorder and how it affects Rhema better than anyone. Everything is in place, and Rhema is thriving. It is finally as it should be. But we are moving. We\u2019ve tried just about everything to stay, but, apparently,\u00a0it\u2019s time to go. I\u2019ve done my research, I\u2019ve called schools and admissions people in Maryland and Virginia. It\u2019s been discouraging to say the least. Friends, I\u2019m being called to task on everything I\u2019ve said on this here blog. And I need to not forget ~That, simply,\u00a0I believe God loves my daughter more than me and He\u2019ll take care of her. ~That He has always faithfully provided for our every need. ~That if I rehearse His gracious deeds\u00a0of the past, I will find light for the present.\u00a0Hope for\u00a0the future.

(We got in in three months). \n \u201cGod, our little girl has a rare seizure disorder and we need to find a way to treat it.\u201d Check! \n \u201cGod, we want therapists who are willing to work with her on weekends. Oh, and we need some money to pay for it.\u201d Check, check! \n \u201cGod, Brandon is deploying for a year. We need help!\u201d Check, check, check! \n \u201cGod, we need a respite care provider. Oh yeah, and some insurance coverage.\u201d Check! \n \u201cGod, now we need to move Rhema to another new school. Can you do it?\u201d Check! ~That He will do it again. ~That His plans are\u00a0better than mine.  \u201cIn his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.\u201d   Prov 16:9 ~That a bad attitude is not helpful. ~That cherry blossoms in bloom are, admittedly,\u00a0pretty cool.

So do not fear, for I am with you; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do not be dismayed, for I am your God. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I will strengthen you and help you; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

{"date": "August 17, 2010", "body": "I keep this little stamp around as a reminder\u2026\u00a0 that anything is possible. . At an IEP meeting a year and a half ago, a member of Rhema\u2019s team stated that she would be taught to use a stamp with her name on it. It sounded great, but at the risk of sounding completely clueless I had to ask, \u201cWhat exactly is the purpose of teaching her to stamp?\u201d Someone explained that Rhema would probably never learn to write so she needed to learn to use a stamp with her name on it instead. The meeting continued. More goals and strategies were discussed. But I couldn\u2019t tell you what they were. I was still shell-shocked by the words \u201cprobably never learn to write.\u201d Brandon and I had been so focused on trying to help Rhema communicate vocally \u2013 it had not occurred to us to think about writing. I just assumed that she would learn to do it in her own time just like everything else. I did not know that the possibility had been ruled out behind my back.  She won\u2019t be able to write? Really? At some point I found my voice and brought up the stamp goal again. They assured me that they weren\u2019t giving up on writing. It was just that her pre-writing imitation skills were not progressing as they\u2019d hoped. With a stamp she could learn to label her papers and other items. It  felt  like they were giving up to me. She was just five years old then \u2013 how could they already know that she wouldn\u2019t write? But what did I know? I went home, licked my wounds, tried to re-adjust my expectations. Fast forward to this year\u2019s IEP meeting. Rhema is in a new school. Heather, the occupational therapist, presents some testing results and goes over Rhema\u2019s OT goals. One of them is: Rhema will trace her first name, using age appropriate lettering\u2026 I am surprised.\u00a0I feel unsteady as\u00a0all of the emotions from the meeting at Rhema\u2019s old school come back full force.  Where did I put that dream? That she would write? I had long since packed\u00a0it away in my suitcase of \u201cDreams Deferred\u201d for my girl. Heather has no way of knowing how much this IEP goal means to me. There is much discussion over the goal, and a liaison from the school district challenges Heather about it several times. She says that she does not want us to have unrealistic goals on the IEP. I feel\u00a0the tension in the room. It seems to me that Heather\u2019s professional\u00a0reputation is\u00a0on the line, and I\u00a0think that she\u2019ll back down or at least agree to adjust the benchmarks, lower the expectations. But Heather is not intimidated. She calmy and confidently says, \u201cRhema can do it.\u201d  I keep my poised face on, but I\u2019m all kinds of crying inside. Ready to bust out\u00a0in a tearful rendition of\u00a0\u201cTo dream the impossible dream\u201d from Man of La Mancha. Because this is it. This is what I\u2019ve been hoping for, praying for. Because all Rhema needs is for people to believe in her and think big for her. (Her mama included.) . It\u2019s been six months since that meeting, and Rhema is learning to trace the letter \u201cR\u201d. Today I observed Heather working with Rhema. She\u00a0started off by prompting Rhema gently at the wrist. By the end of the session, Rhema was tracing the \u201cR\u201d independently!! It was amazing and thrilling to watch. full prompt no prompt Heather told me she had a dream that she came to work one day and Rhema was independently writing her name. In\u00a0the\u00a0dream, she is so happy and excited that she calls another teacher over and they record it all on video. \u201cOne day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will happen.\u201d \u201cYes. One day,\u201d I say. I have no doubt. \u00a0. And I keep a little, \u201cretired\u201d\u00a0stamp around.

{"date": "August 31, 2010", "body": "This past spring, my sis and I took the girls to a park. It was a gorgeous day after a few days of rain, and Rhema was ready to run free. Before I could stop her she tore across an open field. The ground was still wet and she splashed through mud with abandon. I watched for a few moments and then gathered my energy for the chase. In the far distance I could see two figures lying on a blanket, and Rhema was making a beeline for them. I took off running across the field, calling after Rhema in vain. I knew I was not going to make it in time. When I reached the couple on the blanket, they just sort of stared at me, dazed and confused. They seemed frozen by surprise. The man was lying on his stomach. And my silent, six-year old, muddy girl was straddling him, sitting on his back. I half expected her to dig in her heels and say, \u201cGiddy up.\u201d As I pried Rhema off the man\u2019s back, I did not offer an explanation. Just a quick apology to the woman for\u2026 \u201cinterrupting.\u201d\u00a0Before either could say a word, Rhema took off, and I raced her back across the field. Oh the looks on their faces! My sister and I laughed\u00a0until our sides hurt. . Soon after that I got serious about finding someone to work as an aide for Rhema for the summer. We needed someone to just  be  with us. To go to the park or the zoo or the pool with us; to help keep Rhema engaged at home or in the backyard. I interviewed a number of people for the job, and knew within seconds that Melissa was our girl. She had no experience working with a child with autism, but her compassion made up for her lack of knowledge, and she naturally seemed to know how to relate to Rhema. She quickly became a student of Rhema, observing her, making note of her patterns, asking me lots of questions. I told Melissa about Rhema\u2019s tendency to bolt and wander, and her lack of a sense of danger. \u201cI need you to stick with her,\u201d I said. Has she ever. When Melissa is with us, Rhema never plays alone. If Rhema goes down the slide, Melissa goes down the slide with her. If Rhema jumps in a bouncy house, Melissa jumps in the bouncy house with her. At first I wondered how Rhema would handle the \u201cintrusion\u201d, having to constantly interact with someone outside of school. But it\u2019s been great for her. And great for us. Instead of chasing Rhema, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to carry on conversations with other mothers at birthday parties or give Hope more attention or just take a deep breath. We\u2019ve been able to embark on many summer adventures because Melissa has been with us. She\u2019s dodged puke two out of three times, and she keeps coming back. Once we picked her up on the way to the park. Our plan was to just get our feet wet on the beach, and Melissa was dressed to go out on a date later that evening. I was discussing snails with Hope when I looked up and saw Rhema hightailing it into the ocean. A moment later I watched Melissa recklessly plunge in after her. When she caught up to her, Rhema jumped in her arms and they both stumbled in the water. They emerged completely drenched.  Ahh, love her , I thought.  She sacrificed her date hair and outfit just for us. Recently, after a long day at the pool, we dropped Melissa off at home. Hope, whose\u00a0level of understanding never ceases to amaze me, said in her three-going-on-thirty way, \u201cThanks Melissa. We couldn\u2019t have done this without you.\u201d Yes. Thanks, Melissa, for a great summer. We couldn\u2019t have done it without you! Happy Birthday!

{"date": "August 27, 2010", "body": "One year ago, Brandon sat on the couch with Rhema before she left for school. He held her and explained that he was going away for a while. Rhema seemed completely oblivious \u2013 it was just another day. She had no idea that she would not see him for so long. Brandon was thinking ahead to when she would realize he was gone. He wanted her to know somehow that  he had not left her . When her school bus came, I let him take her out. I stayed back, not wanting to intrude on his goodbye to his girl. But I know he was praying that God would keep her safe. I heard the driver call out, \u201cYou\u2019re in our prayers!\u201d, and the bus pulled away. I cannot pretend to know how difficult that goodbye was. The night I went into labor with Rhema, I was alone in a bedroom in my parent\u2019s house and I journaled my way through contractions. Brandon was deployed then to Iraq for a year, and I was concerned that he would miss out on key bonding moments with his firstborn. I wrote a prayer in my journal: May she be the apple of her father\u2019s eye. As he is apart from us, Lord, give him a supernatural, blessed connection to Rhema that will always be. Thank you, thank you, oh thank you my Lord for giving her to us. Despite the frustrating barriers of autism, the lack of spoken language, and two years now of separation, God has honored my prayer. Rhema and her father have a uniquely special bond. Sometimes I think she understands the idea of  father  better than anyone simply because of who he is. He settles her, and in an unpredictable world that does not often make sense, she trusts him. If he is there to love her, she\u2019ll be o.k. They always just pick right back up where they left off \u2013 as if no time has passed between them. When he came home last May for two weeks of R & R, we met him at the train station. I let Hope run ahead to greet him while I stayed with Rhema in her carseat. Rhema was fiddling and fighting with her buckle, ready to bolt. For a moment she did not notice the hands trying to help her undo her buckle. But then she stopped, looked up and saw him. A wave of laughter overtook her; she threw her head back and giggled herself right into his arms. Brandon's homecoming in 2005 \n \n Brandon's visit in May 2010 \u00a0 That morning a year ago, Hope and I watched Brandon load his bags into the car. He had already explained to her why he had to go away for a while \u2013 \u201cTo pre-tect us!\u201d she would squeal enthusiastically. To us, Hope has always been like a prized exhibit in a museum. Too precious. A rare, irreplaceable gift. She brings us inexpressible joy, and when you\u2019re away from her you feel like you\u2019ve missed out on something. I don\u2019t know how to go a day without her Hope-ness. I didn\u2019t know how my husband was going to manage a year without it. When it was time to go, he said, \u201cGive me a hug, Hope,\u201d arms outstretched. She came running, and as she wrapped her arms around his neck as tight as she could, she said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you a big DINOSAUR hug, Daddy!\u201d And I watched the man hold her and weep. In over a decade of marriage I\u2019d never seen\u00a0a hooah-hooah-fly-helicopters-jump-out-of-airplanes-soldier cry like that. This past year\u00a0Hope had her first first day of school \u2013 lost her baby fat and grew tall\u00a0\u2013 turned three \u2013 had asthma, swine flu and pneumonia \u2013 learned to write her name- learned to swim \u2013 turned into a princess and became a fashionista \u2013 prayed for her Daddy everyday.

She throws her head back, her eyes dance and her shoulders shake with giggles. You can\u2019t help but smile at her laughter, one of my favorite sounds. But it\u2019s an inside joke; she doesn\u2019t need me to laugh along. Then there are times when she, without warning, is overwhelmed with emotion. I look over and see her face twisted in sadness, silent tears streaming from huge, brown eyes. It\u2019s the most melancholy cry I\u2019ve ever seen, and I want so much just to be able to\u00a0talk with her, know what\u2019s on her mind. I wonder if she\u2019s sad that I don\u2019t know what she knows. I wonder if it makes her feel lonely. Years ago, she did not want to be held or touched or comforted the way I give comfort. But now, more times than not, she is most cuddly when she\u2019s sad.  What a gift!  A friend once told me to take advantage of these times, and so I stopped hurrying and sheltered her in my arms. Because I need her to know, really know, that I\u2019m her mommy. Quietly I told her, \u201cSo little girl, I\u2019m your mommy, you know? You may spend hours a day away from me \u2013 with people who teach you and care for you, help you go to the bathroom, help you eat, help you play. And when I drop you off, let you go, pick you up, you might not look at me, you might not say hi or bye. But I\u2019m the one who loves you best. I\u2019m the one who was with you in the beginning. Just you and me, remember? You came out looking like a sunburned Sumo wrestler with a bad hairstyle. I am always with you. Whatever you need I will try to be. You need a knee-healer, a spaghetti-maker, a hand-holder in the night, a hiding place? I\u2019m yours, again and again. If you never have a friend, I\u2019ll be your closest friend. And when you can\u2019t speak or call my name, when you barely have the ability to come, baby, I\u2019ll come to you. You will learn you can make use of me.\u201d As I held her, I suddenly saw myself in her. Trying to go it alone.\u00a0Not enlisting the help of an ever-present, ever\u00a0faithful Source:\u00a0my awesome God. Not comprehending the depth of His love. Not daring to believe that I really could find all I need in Him. The words played over again: \u201cBecause I need you to know, really know,\u00a0that I\u2019m your God. Little girl, do you know what that means? You may spend hours a day away from me \u2013 with people who teach you and care for you. And when I drop you off, let you go, pick you up, you might not look at me, you might not say hi or bye. But I\u2019m the one who loves you best. I\u2019m the one who was with you in the beginning.  I AM  the Beginning, the End.  I AM.  Always with you, always for you. You need a heart-healer, a way-maker, a song in the night, a hiding place? I AM. yours. I\u2019ll be your closest friend, true lover of your soul. And when you can\u2019t speak, when you barely have the strength to come, I\u2019ll run to you. So make use of me.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/here/", "title": "Here"},
{"date": "September 17, 2010", "body": "So I consider myself pretty tech-savvy. I worked for years as a software developer. And these days, when I\u2019m feeling particularly self-injurious, I\u2019ll try to teach graduate level courses in database\u00a0management at a\u00a0Boston university. But I tend to resist the hype over the latest electronic toy and gadget. I was a whopping 27 years old when I got my first cell phone (-and I\u2019m not  that  old, they\u2019d been around for years)\u2026 so I\u2019m still a little shocked that we bought my 6-year old an iPod Touch. Rhema has not spent much time on a computer. Some time ago I tried working with her at the computer but ended up discouraged pretty quickly. The keyboard was a toy to pound. She could not make the connection between the cursor movement and my hand guiding her hand. She lost interest in less than 30 seconds. When we visited my friend  Carrie  last month, she gently approached Rhema with her iPhone. I was afraid Rhema was going to take the thing and use it as a frisbee. Or dance on it. Or lick it. Even when\u00a0she did not destroy the device, I still had my doubts. Whatever Carrie wanted to show her would require that Rhema attend to the screen. It might require fine motor skills and movement she for which she was not ready. And while I believe Rhema can figure out just about anything I did not know if she was going to get this in a weekend. But Carrie knew exactly what she was doing. She had the perfect game for Rhema \u2013 a  shape builder game  in which shapes are dragged and dropped into a puzzle. Once the puzzle is completed, the image is revealed and the word for the image is spoken in a clear voice.  Perfect. Rhema instantly understood the concept of the game. (She rocks like that!) But it took a little bit for her to learn how to manipulate the shapes with her finger. She kept pressing too hard, and the pieces would not move. I was worried she\u2019d get impatient and frustrated, but Carrie urged her on, showing her how to touch the screen lightly. Before long, Rhema was completing puzzle after puzzle. I. was. thrilled.  Here is something my baby can do!  And it\u2019s something she seems to enjoy! \u00a0 So I dropped a couple hundred on an iPod Touch. And then there was 20 bucks for the two-year warranty. And 20 bucks for the silicone case. And then I laughed out loud to discover that the gotta-have-it-perfect-for-my-girl app was a mere 99 cents. I know I\u2019m late to the show. I\u2019d heard about the  app s being made for children with autism. I\u2019d read the blogs about  iPods  making it  easier  for our  kids  to navigate an overwhelming world. I\u2019d even imagined the possibility of nonverbal individuals  using iPhone applications to communicate . But watching my daughter succeed at that 99 cent game  got me hooked . Consider me converted. On to the next app! Any suggestions? \u00a0 rhemashope@gmail.com . . .

I feel I am with you now, whatever that can mean\u2026\u201d \n~Marilynne Robinson . \u201cAnd now I live and I breathe for an audience of One\u2026\u201d \n~Sara Groves \u00a0 One of the first blogs I ever read was  Autismville  by  Judith , and I had a \u201cKilling Me Softly\u201d experience. I felt like\u00a0she had \u2018found my letters and read each one out loud\u2019 (only she said it better than I ever could). But I thought, I\u2019ll try my hand at this \u2014 keep account of Rhema\u2019s growth and development, write about the highs and lows and God\u2019s fingerprint in the midst of it all. Somewhere along the way I started noticing stats, linking the quality of my writing and my value to a hit counter. The affirmation and applause, the cyber pats on the back became a little too important. There were times when I went a few days without blogging and literally felt unsettled until I published a post. I began to wonder how much of my endeavoring was for a comment-worthy post rather than a  worthy  post. Not that I have some ginormous readership or something, but I missed the early days when I didn\u2019t compare or care about measuring up or keeping up (- shoot, my first post ever was about Rhema on the toilet.) Earlier this year I found myself in a horrible pit. I realized I needed to pause and take stock of my life, search my heart. I stepped down from a number of things, including blogging.  Why do I say what I say, do what I do. Why do I write? Why do I blog?  Life is precious and time is short, and if I\u2019m going to spend any of it on this blog, I want to make sure that it comes from a pure, honest place. When I returned to\u00a0this space\u00a0I disabled comments and hid the stats meter, and it has helped me remember what and who I\u2019m writing for.\u00a0 But one of the best things about blogging for me has been the community, the conversation.  And I dearly love the community in this corner of the blogosphere! (I read a blog the other day and went to add my two cents only to discover that the writer had disabled comments. I felt muted, shut off from the discourse. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel that way here). All that to say, I\u2019ve turned comments back on. (Yes, I\u2019m psychotic.) I may very well turn comments back off when I feel that self-imposed bloggy pressure coming on or I find the old competitive, prideful self creeping back in. I so enjoy words. I love reading them, writing them into stories. Rhema\u2019s every little word whispered or approximated is priceless. Hope\u2019s words amaze and amuse. Words in cyberspace are superfluous. Every time I log in, the WordPress tool boasts \u201852,539,835 words today.\u2019 Countless words are recorded in chats, emails, blogs, Facebook and Twitter pages. My friend  Stefan  wrote once, \u201cWith the sheer volume and pace of words and words and words, it is  unnatural and counter cultural  to slow down enough to  read or write words that matter .\u00a0And here is this blog adding more to the lightly edited, rough draft VOLUME, like more\u00a0teardrops in the rain\u2026\u201d I want what I do and say to  matter . What I say about my days with autism. What I say about my days as a wife and mother, as a friend and sister. As one who fell, and falls, and was saved, as is saved by grace alone. If I write something that matters or resonates with you or frustrates you, or if you have advice to share or just want to encourage me, please do comment. I thank you.\u00a0In the meantime,\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0trying to learn that\u00a0God\u2019s comment on my life is the only one I need, it\u2019s only His \u2018Well done\u2019 that counts. . *Rhema and I are off on a reconnaissance mission to the DC area this week. We\u2019ll be scoping out schools in Maryland and Virginia, looking for a place to live. (Thank you to all who sent recommendations and referrals.) I\u2019m a little anxious about Rhema handling all of the travel, but the Electric Slide is cued up on the  iTouch  so we should be good. The director of Rhema\u2019s current school is going with us to tour potential schools and help me make a decision about which is best. Yeah, we got it like that.

I imagine I sound like a broken record on this blog, but we continue to be amazed by the generosity, love and support\u00a0we\u2019ve received from so many. 1. The blogging community has wrapped its arms around us.\u00a0We have received e-mails, cards, packages and prayers from all over the country \u2014\u00a0from people we\u2019ve only met through cyberspace. I am at a loss as to how to express my gratitude\u2026 that you would take the time to care for us in such thoughtful, meaningful ways.

Babysitting, laundry, meals, moral support\u2026 and they would help even more if I let them! I\u2019ve often\u00a0written about Rhema\u2019s habit of painting her walls in poop (sorry about that). Her room\u00a0had this unique, old wallpaper and every time I scrubbed her walls, pieces of the wallpaper came off.\u00a0Some time ago, Rhema\u00a0began peeling off more\u00a0pieces of wallpaper and eating them. (Lead, anyone?) Right after her lead poisoning diagnosis in March, a few men from our church stepped in to help me redo Rhema\u2019s walls. Mr. Steve  (LOVE him!) and I stripped all of the wallpaper. It was NOT an easy job, and Mr. Steve ended up doing most of the work: Mr. Steve Others spent hours sanding the walls and painting the room with a highly washable paint.

My sister and her husband \u2013 who I can always count on \u2013\u00a0were out of town. My husband was waaayyy out of town\u2026 unreachable\u2026 on a mission in Kurdistan (wherever that is).

{"date": "September 23, 2010", "body": "How cool moms like Angelina, Heidi and Victoria do it. I look EXACTLY like this when I travel: \u00a0 . I once tried to pitch the good Lord an idea. It went like this: Dear God, I was really impressed with the breastfeeding thing. Love the supply and demand idea \u2013 the more you nurse, the more milk you produce. And there\u2019s the weaning process \u2013 during which the body actually secretes a hormone that sends a signal to the brain that the milk isn\u2019t needed and milk production gradually shuts down. Genius! God, I propose that mothers of two or more young children and/or mothers of children with special needs  grow an extra arm!  With a hand attached.\u00a0 It can grow right out of the elbow. When the kid(s) get older and the extra arm isn\u2019t needed you can treat it much like the weaning process. The extra arm can just wither up and fall off the elbow. Amen. Brilliant idea if I do say so myself. And Monday at the airport is my case in point. I had a backpack, a carry-on suitcase and a booster seat. If I put the backpack on and balanced the booster seat on the suitcase that left me one free hand to hold on to Rhema. \u201cIt could work,\u201d I said to my brother-in-law, Joel, as he dropped us off at the airport. Rhema is not fearful of new situations like some kids on the spectrum. She doesn\u2019t always know where she\u2019s going or why she\u2019s\u00a0going, she just knows that she must. get. there. So it was at the airport. \u00a0Me, with the luggage in one hand while holding on to Rhema for dear life as she sprinted up and down the escalators. Escalators are on her obsession list and Logan Airport was paradise, she was bent on riding every single one. Joel went with us as far as he could \u2013 to the security check point. The poor man (so dear to me) looked like he was dropping us off at the edge of Hades. I gave him a quick, brave smile and nodded goodbye. I had our boarding passes out, but my ID was in my wallet in my purse in a pouch in the backpack on my back. I could slide said backpack off my back onto the floor and even stoop down while holding the carry on suitcase and the carseat and Rhema-trying-to-escape all with my pinky finger. But to open said backpack and fish out my purse and then my wallet and then my ID\u2026 well, that would take two hands. At which point Rhema broke free and took off running like she was late for a popsicle handout. She slammed into a metal signpost and cut her ear, but she barely slowed down. I had to leave all of our stuff in the line, run and catch her and bring her back. She got away from me twice. Try as I might, I could not manage to get my shoes off, her shoes off, the laptop out of the backpack and into one of those trays, and the carseat and the carry-on luggage onto the belt and get us both through security. I\u2019d told one of the security dudes that Rhema had autism, but no one was helping us. Then Joel was at my side. \u201cI got a pass. I can go with you to the gate.\u201d  Oh thank you, BRO! A woman in line who had witnessed the whole ordeal was very perturbed. She said to Rhema in a huff, \u201cYou need to learn some discipline. You need to learn to listen to your parents!\u201d My nerves were already frayed.\u00a0 \u201cShe has autism,\u201d I informed her as Rhema yanked me away. By the time we got to the gate I had to check the suitcase and the carseat. I had wanted to avoid going through baggage claim (for obvious reasons), but there was no way I could handle it all. I should have known, should have planned better. But I just thought/hoped that she would be calmer this time (she\u2019s flown before). On the plane our struggles continued. It was a \u2018full flight\u2019, and\u00a0Rhema kicked the living daylights out of the seat in front of her. She slid the window shade up and down, up and down\u2026 and then the tray table in front of her, up and down, up and down. The entire flight. (When the flight attendant calmly explained to her that all tray tables and seatbacks had to be stowed in their upright and locked positions for takeoff and landing, Rhema was unmoved.) For good measure, she dumped her apple juice in my lap. As the plane descended I wondered which was a more frightening prospect: the plane blowing up or Rhema and I trying to get through baggage claim. Of course we couldn\u2019t stand there and wait for our luggage like \u201cnormal people.\u201d Of course we had to run up and down escalators, during which Rhema scraped the back of her leg. Of course we were the last two souls at the baggage claim area late at night with no suitcase or carseat in sight. Rhema was at the end of her rope, and I could not make her be still or sit down. She fought me. She kicked me. She pushed me. I had to go potty, I was famished, I was weary in body and spirit. And then she got up and ran toward a group of soldiers. She had been running all afternoon, not seeming to see anything or anyone around her. But she saw soldiers in desert fatigues and ran to them.  Is she looking for her Daddy? Is that what she thinks this is all about?   I will not cry, I will not cry . After we finally found our luggage, we went to the restroom. Now normally I never go to the bathroom (myself) when Rhema\u2019s with me. Too risky. But this time I couldn\u2019t hold it. So while I sat on the germ-infested potty-chair, I held Rhema\u2019s hand and begged her to \u2018stay with me.\u2019 But my darling child managed to undo the lock on the stall door. The door bust open, and she\u00a0bolted\u2026 with me in  mid-stream . Now, I ask you,\u00a0what\u2019s a girl to do? This girl kicked the door shut, finished her business and hoped for the best. Thankfully, I found Rhema drinking soapy water out of the sink. I won\u2019t bother to mention  all  of the gory details. Like the fact that we had to wait 20 minutes for the shuttle bus for the rental car to come. (Rhema has a waiting ABA program at school \u2013 she\u2019s up to a whopping 3 seconds. Do you know how many seconds are in 20 minutes?). Or that I tried to feed her some rice while we waited outside for the shuttle\u2026 and she spilled it\u2026 and tried to eat pieces of rice off the pavement like she was starving\u2026 and burst into tears when I stopped her. Or how one of the businessmen observed that she was\u00a0\u2018quite a handful.\u2019 Or that she tried to climb into the shuttle bus driver\u2019s lap  while  he was driving. When we finally stumbled into our hotel room at 11 pm, I had a message from my husband that simply said Ps. 34: 17-18. \u201cThe righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 he delivers them from all their troubles. \u00a0The LORD is close to the brokenhearted \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\u201d It was late, but I pulled up  Kari Jobe\u2019s My Beloved  on the iPod, gathered my girl in my arms. And we danced.

As soon as we arrived we did some\u00a0Rhema-proofing: -Removed all the wall hangings -Removed the lamps -Removed the phone -Put child safety locks on the doors -Installed a video monitor in her room -Removed the swivel chair (after she spun herself silly all night long) -Removed the clock radio (after she jammed to hard rock at 2 am) . Rhema\u2019s teacher Courtney created a \u201cPortable Picture Activity Schedule\u201d for us. It consists of a large bin containing\u00a0five shoes boxes with some of her favorite activities \u00a0\u2013 books, puzzles, legos, etc. The outside of each shoe box is labeled with an icon for a particular activity. Rhema has a binder that has a matching icon for each activity.\u00a0She has learned to take the icon from her book, match it to the icon on the shoe box, and then open the box and play with the contents. Most of the activities are close-ended so that\u00a0she knows when the activity is complete (for e.g., once she\u2019s assembled a puzzle she knows she\u2019s done and needs to clean up ). After she cleans up, she returns the icon to her book and moves on to the next activity. \u00a0  I\u2019m enthralled watching Rhema go through her Picture Activity Schedule. She can do this  independently . She rarely needs any prompting from me, and\u00a0she is so focused and purposeful as she works her way through the schedule. I can sense that she\u2019s proud of herself as she does it, and she appreciates the order and predictability. I\u2019m grateful to her teachers for patiently teaching her how to follow a schedule because there was a time when Rhema did not know what to do with herself at home. Anything she did required my supervision and direction which I just could not always give. The lack of structure at home resulted in a lot of stimming and a lot of messes. We have big plans for capitalizing on activity schedules and helping\u00a0her become more independent. We\u2019re thinking of an activity schedule for the morning routine that includes brushing her teeth and dressing herself. Yeah, BIG plans. It may take a while, but I\u2019m confident that she can learn to do it. This girl is always surprising me\u2026 Speaking of surprises, we found one in the\u00a0hotel pool the other day\u2026 I\u2019m not naming any names. But I should have been prepared after reading  JoyMama \u2018s post about the all-natural, super-power, no-fail laxative a few weeks ago\u2026 and what my friend  Carrie  refers to as \u201claxa-swim.\u201d It seemed like all of the hotel guests were out at the pool that afternoon. Kids played water games and beamed each other with Nerf balls. The old folks conversed with one another in their lounge chairs. Others quietly sipped iced tea and lemonade in the hot sun. Then Hope announced dryly, \u201cMommy, there\u2019s poop in the pool.\u201d I laughed self-consciously and dismissed her. Rhema and Hope take baths together and poor Hope has grown quite used to the fudge in the tub. Now the poor child thinks every brown thing she sees is the evil, smelly stuff. \u201cSurely,\u201d I said loudly, \u201cthere\u2019s just some debris in the pool.\u201d \u201cNope. It\u2019s poop,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. I waded over to where Hope was pointing for a closer look.

{"date": "September 30, 2010", "body": "So I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what to say about our trip to DC last week. By far, the highlight was seeing one of my dearest friends and college roommie,  Cha . One of the schools we visited advised me in advance to bring a caregiver for Rhema. Cha took off work and spent the day with us serving as Rhema\u2019s \u201ccaregiver\u201d while Jill and I met with admissions people and toured the schools. (Jill is the director of Rhema\u2019s school and has been a HUGE blessing to us! Her professional input is/was invaluable. I\u2019m so thankful she came with us.) In terms of schooling, we were not able to find an appropriate fit for Rhema in DC. It\u2019s not for lack of trying\u2026 I\u2019ve spent hours going over referrals, making phone calls and even visiting schools. I won\u2019t bore with details, but suffice it to say this mama is riled up and we are duking it out with the Department of the Army. We are desperately trying to get an assignment where we\u2019re confident Rhema can get the education and medical care she needs. We have been around and around and up and down so many times in recent weeks. One minute I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll get to stay in Boston. The next minute I\u2019m told it might be Pennsylvania. Or New Jersey. Yesterday it was Kansas City. Today, it\u2019s looking like DC again. Who knows what tomorrow will bring? All I know is that I have a child with significant needs, and I have no idea where we\u2019ll be living in 2.5 months. I\u2019m pretty used to adventures by now, but this is a bit unnerving. God is doing something in my heart, though. I feel all unworthy and risky sharing this for many reasons, but here goes: On my wedding day \u2013 before 9/11 and deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and children and autism happened to us \u2013 I said to my husband these words from the book of Ruth: \u201cEntreat me not to leave thee, \nor to return from following after thee: \nfor whither thou goest, I will go; \nand where thou lodgest, I will lodge: \nthy people shall be my people, \nand thy God my God: \nWhere thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: \nthe LORD do so to me, and more also, \nif ought but death part thee and me.\u201d Over the past month, I have whispered and rehearsed those words. My heart is here in Massachusetts. And I believe that this is, without a doubt, the best place for Rhema. And I will always fight for what is best for her. But I want the spirit of Ruth. She went on simple faith, believing that wherever she went, God would make a place for her and her family. And maybe this post is rambling and\u00a0more for Brandon (and me) than anyone else. But I have friends like me. We get in Mama-Bear-Mother-Warrior mode and nothing else matters but the fight.\u00a0I dare say there is something even more important than the IEP meeting or the right therapy or the right school\u00a0program.\u00a0 The relationship with your husband \u2013 do not neglect it.\u00a0 \u00a0 My husband is not necessarily well-versed on TEACH or Floortime or ABA or the latest debate\u00a0and trend in autism treatment.\u00a0But he trusts me to tell him what\u00a0Rhema needs and then he does everything in his power to get it for her. If I\u00a0read a book and tell him Rhema needs to see  that  doctor \u2013 the one who wrote the book \u2013 he makes it happen. If I decide\u00a0she needs to listen to Gregorian chant at high frequencies to improve her auditory system (seriously), but it\u2019s not covered by insurance, he scarfs up the money. He is one of Rhema\u2019s best advocates. As we battle the Army right now over military orders, he is literally putting his own career on the line. It is not lost on me how blessed\u00a0we are to have a husband and father who is  determined to be there, \u00a0to have our back, to protect and provide.\u00a0There\u00a0is\u00a0certainly nothing I have done to deserve such a man; only God\u2019s grace. I don\u2019t know where Uncle Sam is going to\u00a0send him\u00a0next, but wherever it is, \u00a0 I am so there\u2026 even if it\u2019s (gulp) DC.

{"date": "July 26, 2010", "body": "As Rhema remained silent and distant, I continued my research about speech delays and autism until one day I found the end of the Internet. I was sure I\u2019d read every article and visited every discussion board that existed on the topic. There was no blood test for this thing. And there seemed to be a lot of other mothers out there in cyberspace doing the same thing as me \u2013 wondering, worrying, comparing their child\u2019s behaviors with another\u2019s. I let myself entertain the idea that maybe, just maybe Rhema might have somehow gotten a little sprinkling of autism-like dust on her.\u00a0But I reasoned that if we could get her to age three without any professional saying the A word out loud, then we\u2019d be home free. I learned the screening questions for autism and came up with good excuses for why she did not point or play with her toys appropriately, why she was fixated on string. We moved back to the States and spent time visiting my husband\u2019s family, and it became painfully obvious to me that Rhema was very different from her cousins. There was no denying the significance of her delays. I called my sister on the phone and finally uttered the word out loud, \u201cRhema\u2019s acting like she\u2019s  autistic.  I\u2026 I just can\u2019t seem to reach her!\u201d My sister cried with me on the phone. (I\u2019ll never forget it \u2013  June 4, 2006  \u2013 that same day my dear sister hung up the phone with me, drove herself to the ER and was diagnosed with MS.) A couple months later I met up with a couple other mothers at the park. Their children played together, walked and talked nicely and ate healthy food for lunch. Rhema never seemed more hyperactive and isolated. I was uncomfortably pregnant, and a sweet friend would get up and chase Rhema down for me every time she bolted. I stood among the others and watched my girl. It was such a beautiful day, the sun was shining, the fields were\u00a0velvet green. Rhema ran in dizzying circles on her toes, her head cocked to the side, her eyes half-closed. And I knew. Finally, I knew. It was time to stop fighting the truth and instead fight for her. Time to stop fearing the label. Time to get the help she needed. That night, in the middle of the night, I woke up my sweet husband. He knew she was a little different, he had been concerned, but he didn\u2019t  know . I didn\u2019t want to break his heart. I didn\u2019t want to tell him that something was wrong with the precious girl I\u2019d given him. Another baby was growing inside me, and there was a chance she could have  it , too. It\u00a0did break\u00a0his heart. But he did what he\u2019s always done well. He took my hand, prayed to Jesus, made a plan, and loved his girls as best he could. A month later we had an official autism diagnosis. A few months after that Rhema was diagnosed Landua Kleffner syndrome, a rare epilepsy. (I write about that  here .) I\u2019d love to say I handled it well. I plastered on a smile, went through the motions. But I spent a good year angry, bitter, and disappointed in God. I felt like the child I thought I had had been stolen from me; my dreams for her shattered. I did not lean on my husband enough, the man God perfectly gave to walk beside me \u2013 instead I grieved alone. I was jealous of typical mothers and their typical children and their typical lives. Slowly God began to\u00a0demonstrate His faithfulness to us in the midst of the pain. He\u00a0provided a community of friends, teachers, therapists, doctors that have stuck with us like glue. He began to teach us about\u00a0compassion and perseverance and thankfulness and real faith \u2014\u00a0lessons through our nonverbal daughter that resound loud and clear.\u00a0Certainly, there\u2019s still heartache, but there\u2019s more grace\u00a0and strength to bear it. There is much struggle and work, but there is genuine joy in the journey. There is acceptance, but there is also\u00a0 expectation  that God\u2019s got a bigger, better plan than we can imagine. That\u00a0He\u00a0is going to boggle our minds through this little girl! He already has.\u00a0 . . .

{"date": "July 23, 2010", "body": "\u00a0 \u00a0****** I met a mother the other day whose child was recently diagnosed with autism. Talking with her brought back a slew of memories and emotions.\u00a0I wanted to hug her, but I didn\u2019t. I wished I had a printed\u00a0copy of  this post  by Jess Wilson to give her. I would have pressed it into\u00a0her hand and said, \u201c\u2018Nuff said.\u201d I\u2019ve always intended to write about the beginning of our autism journey, but for some reason just couldn\u2019t go there\u2026 Perhaps what stands out in my mind the most is this pit I had in my stomach for over a year \u2013 this secret fear that something was wrong, very wrong with my\u00a0sweet baby. Or maybe it\u2019s\u00a0the countless hours I spent worrying and reading and searching the Internet. And then once I found the answer, all the time I spent frozen in denial. Rhema had difficulty from the start. She was a colicky baby. She barely slept for months; she would cry and scream and spasm and stop breathing and turn purple. The softest clothes seemed to bother her baby skin. She drooled incessantly, soaking a bib in a matter of minutes. Her sucking reflexes were poor and so breastfeeding was a bit of a nightmare. But we\u00a0survived the rough start, and by six months she was doing much better. I had my \u201cWhat To Expect the First Year\u201d book and was proud to note that not only was\u00a0she reaching all the developmental milestones, she seemed ahead of schedule. At 12 months old, she was bright-eyed and interactive and had a\u00a0few words. She  captivated  me. Like most first-time moms I took lots of pictures and, because Brandon was deployed during the first year of her life, I recorded numerous videos. (It still tears our\u00a0hearts to watch some of those videos now and see the contrasts.) Over a three month period, we seemed to \u201close\u201d Rhema. When she was 15 months\u00a0old I took her to the doctor and said, \u201cShe stopped saying \u2018hi\u2019.\u201d The doctor brushed aside my concerns, reminding me that children develop at their own pace. Some months passed and I took her to another doctor. He had her hearing tested and she was diagnosed with conductive hearing loss due to fluid accumulation in her ears. It made sense.\u00a0We noticed that she never\u00a0startled\u00a0when the doorbell rang at home, and she did not respond to her name. Perhaps a hearing loss explained everything \u2014 the head-banging, the tantrums, the spinning, the lack of engagement with people in her world. Surgery was scheduled for ear tubes. I remember the surgeon patting me on the shoulder. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom\u201d, he said, \u201cAfter this she\u2019ll be talking so much you\u2019ll wish she would shut up!\u201c But why won\u2019t she look at me? Why can\u2019t I get her to look at pictures in books when I point them out?  If I wanted her to see something, I had to repeatedly wave the object in front of her eyes. After the surgery, we patiently waited for the promised language explosion. It never came. She was a few months shy of her second birthday when I started scouring the internet late into the night. My Google searches included: \u2018my child doesn\u2019t eat\u2019, \u2018my child doesn\u2019t sleep\u2019, \u2018my child doesn\u2019t speak\u2019. It didn\u2019t take long for the dreaded A word to pop up. If you don\u2019t say it out loud, it doesn\u2019t exist. I thought of my\u00a0older cousin with autism \u2013 a strange, isolated\u00a0boy who flapped his hands and made funny, high-pitched\u00a0noises all the time. As kids we were both scared of him and intrigued by him.\u00a0To my sisters and I, he was our Boo Radley, only we nicknamed him Crazy.\u00a0He grew up and was put in a \u201cspecial home.\u201d Autism? No way. God wouldn\u2019t do that to us. To even entertain such a notion felt like a betrayal to my little girl. I got angry at the computer and shut it down. I peeked in on Rhema, finally asleep in her crib. She was on her knees, her pajama-ed bottom sticking up in the air. Long eyelashes on an angel face. She\u2019s perfect , I thought.

{"date": "July 28, 2010", "body": "(My husband informed me that all these years I thought the Tooth Fairy was Black, I was wrong. This one\u2019s for you, babe). My\u00a0big girl lost a tooth this weekend. Happens all the time, I know. Babies grow into toddlers and toddlers grow into \u201cbig boys and girls\u201d\u00a0and then teenagers (Lord, help) and then adults. It\u2019s\u00a0a miracle, a gift we sometimes take for granted, a blessing to see our children grow before us. We\u2019ve been anxious about this stage. Just brushing her teeth is a project. What will we do about loose teeth? Will she swallow them? Will it be a sensory nightmare? How will she react to such a change? I was working on a puzzle with her when I noticed a large bloody space where her bottom front tooth used to be. I shrieked. Rhema lost a tooth! Woohoo!!! And then, Rhema lost a tooth. Boohoo. \u00a0 A\u00a0host of emotions hit me at once. First, I chided myself \u2013 brushing her teeth has been extra difficult lately.\u00a0She and I have\u00a0had some battles in the morning\u00a0with her fighting\u00a0me any time I come near her mouth. I\u2019d resorted to wrapping her arms in a towel, laying her on the floor and straddling her to get the job done. Duh! Poor girl had a loose tooth. Rhema is a saint for putting up with her clueless mama. She\u2019s not a\u00a0baby anymore. I mean,\u00a0the lost\u00a0 baby  tooth represents lost babyhood. (Sniff). It\u2019s like the last \u201cbaby\u201d thing to go.\u00a0I remember exactly when that little tooth first popped through her gooey baby gums. And now it\u2019s gone forever. And now, she\u2019s going to get a permanent tooth that will be there\u2026 well\u2026 permanently. Watching a child grow up is\u00a0poignant for any parent, but for a special needs parent it\u2019s particularly bittersweet. For with every little milestone, every last \u201cfirst\u201d,\u00a0you feel\u00a0a bit of panic and fear. You watch her body\u00a0grow tall and\u00a0change and mature in a hundred different ways\u2026\u00a0while her cognitive, social and emotional development lags far behind. You\u00a0stand by\u00a0helplessly as time marches on; she gets older and\u00a0the gaps get larger.\u00a0You feel \u201cThe End of Cute\u201d looming \u2013 people often excuse the outbursts or strange behaviors of a toddler; they are less forgiving of an older child. You are aware that\u00a0you cannot protect her like\u00a0you once\u00a0could.\u00a0 Her\u00a0Daddy missed another \u201cfirst.\u201d He was not there when she was born, his first child. He was then, as he is now, serving our country in Iraq. He missed her first breath, her first smile, her first bath, her first crawl, her first Christmas. Not a big deal, I say.\u00a0But you know\u00a0these are the moments you never get back. These are things I call tell you about, but, well, you just had to be there.  (B,\u00a0click  here  for\u00a0my favorite Daddy post about losing teeth.) Rhema was completely unfazed by losing a tooth. True to form, she didn\u2019t miss a beat. But for once, I wish she had. I  wanted  this to be a big event. I wanted her to show some emotion \u2013 excitement, distress, curiosity \u2013 anything! Like mothers and fathers before me, I wanted to do the Tooth Fairy thing. But she has no knowledge or understanding of the Tooth Fairy process, and she could care less. I read a  short article  that ruffled my feathers \u2013 it said that if you have a nonverbal child with autism don\u2019t even bother with the tooth fairy. Ohhh, that got me. Just because she has autism doesn\u2019t mean\u00a0her mama\u00a0can\u2019t put on some wings and fly, sprinkle a little fairy dust, make a little magic! I decided. My girl lost her first tooth, dagnabbit, and we\u2019re going to celebrate! \u201cSo, girls. I know it\u2019s been a couple days, but don\u2019t worry, the Tooth Fairy is on the job! She told me she\u2019s narrowed the whereabouts of\u00a0the tooth down to Rhema\u2019s belly or the tub drain! I bet she\u2019s going to leave a special treat under her pillow tonight!\u201d ( I know. I know. WAY too many words, but just go with me).

I\u2019ve noticed that I am less patient, easily frustrated. I am short with her; her name a loud groan on my lips,  \u201cRhema!\u201d   It\u2019s happening more and more. She seems to show\u2026 something I\u2019ve never seen before\u2026 what is it? Remorse? A sadness over the fact that she\u2019s done something wrong even if she doesn\u2019t quite understand it. She drops her head, her bottom lip trembles, and\u00a0tears come to her eyes. And every time I break a little piece of my heart. I turn away\u2026 these are not my best moments.  All the while\u00a0I am keenly aware of\u00a0our little audience of one, who sees\u00a0everything and hears everything\u00a0and forgets nothing. My attitude, my tone, my words \u2013 have mercy \u2013 she takes her cues from me.\u00a0  What of my youngest, Lord?  Will she be o.k.?  She\u2019s been given such a tender heart. An old soul, so perceptive and sensitive to the feelings of others, always quick to encourage. Will you, God, in spite of me, foster these gifts in her as she lives life with her special sister? Will you keep her from becoming cynical, jaded and burnt out? Will she see her sister not as a bother or burden, but as valuable teacher and inspiration? Will you hold her during times of fear, frustration, embarassment\u00a0or disappointment? Will you give her a deep bond with her sister \u2013 one that does not depend on spoken word or touch. Will you teach her to love without conditon and grow\u00a0it in her,\u00a0true and patient? Will you bless their relationship\u00a0to last\u00a0long after\u00a0we are gone? .

{"date": "March 8, 2010", "body": "\u201cIn God\u2019s economy, the weak, the marginalized, the disenfranchised, the overlooked, the voiceless, the vulnerable, the sick, the oppressed, the grieving, the bullied, the exhausted, and those at the end of their rope are the ones who get into the VIP section. They are the ones who gain the attention and compassion of the God of the Universe.\u201d ~ Ginger Taylor , Adventures In Autism A few weeks ago, I spoke to a gathering of women on the topic \u201cHow the Church Can Help Families of Special Needs Children.\u201d It had been a difficult week, and I felt unprepared. In fact, I had to leave my house in the middle of cleaning Poop Art just to make the luncheon on time. I was able to speak with Brandon on the phone just before giving my\u00a0speech and I told him I had absolutely no idea what to say. He said simply, \u201cTell them about Rhema. Tell them what a day is like trying to care for her and\u00a0teach her and love her the best we can. Tell them about the  pica , the sensory integration issues, the hyperactivity, the medications, the stubborn seizure activity, the bolting\u2026 even the poop art. Tell them. Tell them that some days  everything  seems hard \u2013 eating, sleeping, dressing, toileting. Tell them about the financial burdens, the endless hours of therapy. But be sure to tell them about the joys and the victories, too. Tell them that it\u2019s only by God\u2019s grace we\u2019re still standing. Tell them there are others like us\u00a0who often feel isolated and afraid\u2026 who want and need to bring our families to church, but it just seems too hard.\u201d And so I told them. I read a parable from Matthew 25:31-46 in which Jesus describes what it means to serve him. He condemns people for not caring for Him while they lived on earth. He says, \u201cFor I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u201d The people respond with \u201cLord, we never saw you in such a place of need.\u201d And Jesus answers,  \u201cWhatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u201d I have heard this \u201cleast of these\u201d passage associated with the special needs community more than once. I want to be clear that we in no way think of Rhema as \u201cleast\u201d in terms of worth. Although some in society may deem her as less productive and therefore less valuable, God, in fact, views her in the exact opposite way. Brandon always says, \u201cPeople may not see her worth automatically. It takes \u201cKingdom eyes.\u201d\u201d We have been blessed with friends and teachers who see her as God sees her\u2026 His workmanship, fearfully and wonderfully made. It does not matter how many speeches we give or blogs we write, or knowledge we acquire or money we make, in the end, what matters to God is the help we have given. He is literally challenging us to think of everyone we come in contact with as  Christ . Any help\u00a0given is\u00a0given to Him. Any help withheld is withheld from Him. In loving a child who appears difficult or rude or strange or hard to reach \u2013 in loving the \u201cleast of these\u201d \u2013 we are loving God Himself. In one of the first autism blogs I ever read,  Ginger Taylor \u00a0wrote that in God\u2019s economy, friends, families, churches and communities would receive the following notice upon a child\u2019s diagnosis: \n \u201cCongratulations! Some one you love has autism! You have just been given a chance to serve The Creator God, up close and personally! Run\u2026 do not walk\u2026 to your loved one and seize the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the little life that is on the fast track to stardom in God\u2019s Universe!\u201d That is the spirit in which I shared some of the following\u00a0ideas at the women\u2019s luncheon: Churches:  Set up a buddy program in which teen volunteers from the youth group befriend and shadow a kid with special needs in church. We have a small team of helpers at our church that rotate in taking care of Rhema on Sundays so that I can attend service. They walk with her, play with her, assist her in the Children\u2019s program, etc. It\u2019s a huge blessing. Churches:  Host a prayer gathering for families, teachers, therapists, bus drivers\u2026 anyone who cares about someone with special needs as  Andrea\u2019s  church community has  done . Churches:  Offer a free babysitting night to parents of special needs children in your community. (I LOVE this one). Parents:   Educate.  Ask to give a brief talk/presentation on your child and their particular needs as  JoyMama  did. Sometimes the issues are easily resolved. For example, Rhema used to always have trouble with circle time in the Children\u2019s Program. It\u2019s always circle time first, followed by craft time. Upon entering the room, Rhema would instantly see the scissors, markers, paper and play-doh out on the table and wild horses couldn\u2019t keep her from it. I asked the volunteers to wait until after the circle time to set out the craft supplies. Something as simple as that made a world of difference. One last thing to say:  don\u2019t let fear or your child\u2019s challenges deter you from finding a church home.  In the months since Brandon has been deployed, I have learned that the church  needs  our children, our families. She has few words and many, many\u00a0needs, but God\u00a0speaks to\u00a0me  so much  through my curly-haired girl. And whether it\u2019s her \u201csong\u201d in\u00a0the sanctuary\u00a0or the comic relief she brings, I\u2019m beginning to see her touch the lives of people around her in her own Rhema way. As my sister-friend  Andrea  so beautifully wrote, \u201cIn the name of self-preservation, I have robbed our friends and community of powerful, life-changing interactions that God may have intended for their personal growth. Biblically speaking, my son (and everyone of us) is indispensable to the body of Christ. For a time\u2013 in my exhaustion, isolation, and vulnerability \u2013I bought the lie that it was selfish for me to ask for extra staff, a buddy, or modifications in order for Reid to participate in church events. I am beginning to see that without realizing it, I may have denied others the opportunity \u201cto receive the gift of Reid\u201d\u2026\u201d Thank God for the gift of the \u201cleast of these\u201d and for the churches willing to serve. *Some resources: \n http://www.logansfriends.org/churches.html \n http://www.nathhan.com/church.htm ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/04/autism-in-gods-economy-least-of-these.html", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/nhccoa_006a_ezr.jpg", "http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/behavior/pica.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/05/autism-in-gods-economy-friends-and.html", "http://autismunplugged.blogspot.com/2009/03/happening-in-my-neck-of-woods.html", "http://www.concertofprayersd.org/Concert_of_Prayer/welcome.html", "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/top-ten-things.html", "http://autismunplugged.blogspot.com/2009/04/hide-or-see.html", "http://www.logansfriends.org/churches.html", "http://www.nathhan.com/church.htm"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/03/08/autism-at-church-part-2/", "title": "Autism at Church, Part\u00a02"},
{"date": "March 4, 2010", "body": "Not less than a year ago, we were sitting in church having a hard time keeping Rhema quiet and still. I knew we only had about 15 minutes before the children would be dismissed from the service for Children\u2019s Worship \u2013 and I would accompany Rhema \u2013 but it might as well have been fifteen years. It was a very off day for Rhema. She was making her \u201cnoises\u201d \u2013 loudly humming and babbling. She was even more jumpy than usual and the least little movement could set her off. So when someone in the pew got up and brushed by her, I nearly had to wrestle her back into the seat. When she started ripping pages out of the hymnal, I took her out of the service. We hung out in the bathroom, and I let her stim in the water in the sink, until it was time to attempt Children\u2019s Worship. They combined all the children\u2019s classes into one, so there were a lot of children.\u00a0I didn\u2019t know some of the teachers. The children sat down for circle time, while Rhema  ran  circles around the room with her head tilted to one side and her eyes half-closed. I knew there was no way she would sit still for the circle time lesson. I felt  tired . I found a small dry erase board and markers against a wall, near the circle time group. I \u201ccaught\u201d Rhema and directed her to the dry erase board. She eagerly began coloring with the markers, yanking caps off, and making her happy vocalizations. I was not too concerned about her \u201cnoises\u201d because I thought most of the kids at least knew of her and were used to it. I knew that as long as no one made any big movements, Rhema would stay focused on the coloring long enough to get us through circle time. Then a woman walked over to us and whispered loudly, \u201cShe\u2019s distracting the other children.\u201d For a second I was confused. And then I got it.  Oh. Her noises are distracting the other children from the lesson. Before I could respond, the woman picked up the dry erase board and moved it to a corner at the other side of the room. \u201cShe can color over here.\u201d Of course, that was enough to distract and upset Rhema, and in seconds, she was running circles again, babbling louder than ever. I was stunned. I grabbed Rhema by the hand and walked out. The woman chased me down the hall. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave!\u201d she said. I could tell she realized she might have made a mistake. I shook my head and said shortly, \u201cShe\u2019s not going to be quiet.\u201d I turned on my heels and left the woman standing there, dragging Rhema with me. I didn\u2019t even know if she knew Rhema had autism. Surely, she had to know something was different about Rhema, but I was not about to explain it to her. I was too emotional to speak to her for another minute. Brandon came out, we grabbed Hope out of her class, and we quickly left the church. The rest of the day I struggled with discouragement and anger. These are the passages that ministered to my hurting heart and smoothed my ruffled feathers. \u201cBe patient, bearing with one another in love.\u201d Eph 4:2 \u201cKeep a sharp eye out for weeds of bitter discontent. A thistle or two gone to seed can ruin a whole garden in no time. Heb 12:15 (MSG) If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Romans 12:18 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. Romans 12:21 That evening my friend Meredith called to say, \u201cI was so glad you guys were sitting behind us in church today! I loved hearing Rhema\u2019s sweet song.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I said, fragile. She had no idea what had happened in Children\u2019s Church. She did not know that her words were a healing balm at just the right time. I thought about my life before autism. I was so removed from the special needs community. I was so very clueless; I had no inkling of the challenges faced by children with autism and their families. I imagined how my lack of knowledge might make me hesitant to work with a child like Rhema. I decided to forgive the woman\u2026 and anyone else who did or said a thoughtless, ignorant thing. I planned to have a conversation with her about Rhema\u2019s unique needs. But I would not hold a grudge or allow it to sour our relationship. It turns out that months later, Brandon was able to go before the whole church and share about Rhema and our family. This same woman signed up with her daughter to spend Saturday afternoons helping me with the girls during Brandon\u2019s deployment. God did a total healing work in both of us. I have found that when we are able to educate people about autism and how it affects Rhema, they are more than gracious and willing to help. I\u2019ve certainly seen that in my church. I continue to encounter people who just don\u2019t get it. It doesn\u2019t get to me like it used to. I understand that they don\u2019t understand. And I try to tell them more about autism and how it affects my girl. A\u00a0few other moms and I have a vision of forming an inter-church \u201cteam\u201d that goes around to local churches to promote inclusion and help them teach/minister to our precious little ones and their families. I\u2019ve had many, many conversations with others about how churches can love and support the special needs community\u2026 and how we can help them do that. I\u2019d love to continue that conversation here and post some ideas in my next blog. \u201cLet\u2019s see how inventive we can be in encouraging love and helping out, not avoiding worshiping together as some do but spurring each other on\u2026\u201d \nHeb 10:24-25 (MSG) \n. \n. \n Autism at Church, Part 2 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/nhccoa_006a_ezr.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/autism-at-church-part-1/", "title": "Autism at Church, Part\u00a01"},

{"date": "December 13, 2010", "body": "A couple years ago Rhema was hospitalized for her seizure disorder. Doctors decided to give her a bolus \u2013 an extremely high dose of diazepam/valium \u2013 in an attempt to shock her system out of seizure mode. The medication accomplished its purpose, but initially had a paradoxical effect sending Rhema into a violent fit. She was disoriented, aggressive, out of control, inconsolable. I\u2019ve never seen her so agitated, and she reminded me of\u00a0a Bible story in which a boy would hurl himself into fire. It was so dramatic that the attending physician ordered a medication to counteract the effects of the diazepam. But before the nurse arrived with the new med, Rhema collapsed like a zombie into Brandon\u2019s arms. Fast forward to today. The diazepam protocol is  no longer working  to quiet Rhema\u2019s brain. In a couple months we will most likely begin a long process of weaning her off the med. It\u2019s quite possible that Rhema has\u00a0grown dependent on the drug so we intend to go S-L-O-W. Before we go down on the dose however, we have actually gone up. In a last ditch effort, (I had to be talked into it) we have actually increased the dosage to the highest we can \u2013 based on her weight \u2013\u00a0without having to hospitalize her. We wanted to try one last dose increase to see if it has any impact on the spike-wave activity in her brain during sleep. The nights have been rough. We\u2019ve seen rages \u2013 smaller in scale but similar to the one we saw in the hospital years ago. There\u2019s shrieking, grunting, rolling on the floor, thrashing, stripping, total non-compliance. She\u2019s put a hole in the wall, she\u2019s barricaded the door with the bed \u2013 still the only object in her room for safety reasons. It\u2019s quite disturbing, and at times it\u2019s been really hard not to lose my cool. When she\u2019s like this, I\u00a0have to remind myself that it\u2019s the medication, not her.\u00a0 Rhema does not have the words to express how she feels or what she needs, and it is incredibly frustrating for her.\u00a0Trying to\u00a0comfort her or hold her does not work \u2013 I\u2019ve been pushed away, kicked\u00a0or head-butted one time too many. But it\u2019s so\u00a0important to me that she know she\u2019s not alone, that I\u2019m there, that she is safe. I think about what it means to love someone at their most unlovely moments. And what it means to love someone when it seems they\u2019ve rejected you. And what it means to show love without words or touch. My daughter teaches me. Some nights, loving her means sitting in her room at a distance and\u00a0singing to\u00a0the walls\u00a0as she tantrums. It\u2019s our time. Eventually she calms, and I\u2019m able to put her in bed. I climb in beside her. She whimpers and hums almost nervously, incessantly, \u00a0and I tell her I love her. I tell her how proud she makes me. Whether she hears or understands me, I\u2019m not so sure. Her face never changes expression; she stares at nothing, she continues to hum. Every night I try to imagine what it\u2019s like to have sub-clinical seizures firing in your head as you try to sleep. I so wish I could fix it, but I can\u2019t. But I\u2019m her mother and I have to  do  something. I give her my arms around her whenever she can stand them, my head next to hers, my voice quiet in her ears. The other night was a surprisingly good night. She got her medication and did not fly into a rage. I planned to dump her in the bed and be on my way. But then she did something that made me know that the time we\u2019ve spent together over the past couple weeks were not lost on her.  I had reached her ; she had felt my comfort, known my love. At the doorway, she took  me   by the hand  and led me to her bed. In that simple gesture, our roles were reversed and it seemed like  she  mothered  me . My heart soared. We climbed in, pulled up the covers. I whispered her verse. She hummed her hum. Peace in the room. Then she drifted to sleep to the sound of her mama saying over and over, \u201cI love you, Rhema.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 . *Picture Source:  http://bringbirthhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mother_s_love.jpg ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/mother_s_love.jpg", "http://bringbirthhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mother_s_love.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/a-silent-night/", "title": "A Silent Night"},
{"date": "December 9, 2010", "body": ". Occassionally I see them. An older woman holding her almost-adult daughter\u2019s hand, gently leading her, guiding her, walking with her. As a mother of a special needs child, I feel an instant connection to this mother and I imagine that it will be my pleasure to hold my little girl\u2019s hand like that even when she\u2019s grown. Rhema has never been able to just walk beside us. She\u2019s a wanderer and a flight risk, oblivious to dangers around her. If left to her own, she can quickly get into trouble. Her understanding of language is still limited as is her ability to follow simple commands. In parking lots, stores, school, parks and even at home, we must always take her hand. She used to resist. But now she is usually content to let us lead. And we hold on for her dear life. It really is a  gift  to feel her warm, little hand in mine. . I\u2019ve been doing an in-depth study of Genesis with a group of dear, dear women. This week we read about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Chapter 19. It\u00a0is an especially ugly chapter and I struggled to know what I should learn from it. Basically two angels go down to the city to warn Lot, Abraham\u2019s nephew, about the impending destruction. The whole region is going to be wiped out with burning sulfur because of the rampant wickedness of the people. The angels\u00a0urge\u00a0Lot to get his family and evacuate the city immediately. But Lot lingers. Disaster he cannot begin to comprehend is about to rain down on his head. And he lingers. The people of the city he once called friends have failed him and mocked him. And yet he hesitates to leave. Darkness and depravity taunt him, surround him, and God gives him an out. And he pauses. Then the Bible says: \u201cWhen he hesitated, the [angels] grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city,  for the LORD was merciful to them .\u201d Gen. 19:16 I don\u2019t understand His mercy, I don\u2019t. But I know God has been so merciful to me. I have learned in a most painful way that left to my own, I can quickly get into trouble. My ability to follow simple commands is limited. I\u2019m a flight risk, sometimes unaware\u00a0of dangers within and without; I\u2019m\u00a0 prone to wander  and prone to leave the God I love. And when I was neck deep in destruction, sitting in my own ashes, face streaked with soot and tears,\u00a0and I could not leave, it would have been amazing grace for God to wave a finger and deliver me. But instead this Great Rescuer literally came and took me by the hand and led me away from\u00a0sin\u2019s punishment. By the hand He brought me \u2013 because I wouldn\u2019t go on my own \u2013 to a place where His grace, healing and forgiveness pour out. Such a love I cannot escape. I write about\u00a0Jesus so much because  I am grateful . He saved me. And is saving me still. \u201c He reached down from on high and took hold of me;  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he drew me out of deep waters.  \n He rescued me from my powerful enemy,  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from my foes, who were too strong for me.  \n They confronted me in the day of my disaster,  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but the LORD was my support.  \n He brought me out into a spacious place;  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he rescued me\u2026 he delighted in me.\u201d\u00a0 ~Psalm 18:16-19 . I think that every time I have the privilege of walking with my Rhema and taking her hand, I will remember Lot (\u2026and his wife. But she\u2019s a whole \u2018nother blog post. And  this post  says it far better than I ever could.) \u00a0 And I will\u00a0remember the Christmas Savior who\u00a0comes down, who grasps my hand, who loves me enough to hold on for dear life. .

{"date": "December 15, 2010", "body": "It\u2019s the time of year when we special needs parents\u00a0try to find a way to say thank you to the teachers and therapists who teach and care for our children in the form of a meaningful holiday gift or card. How do you say thank you? How do you convey gratitude to the people who work with your precious one day after day, do the dirty bathroom work, rejoice over the big-small gains, and never give up? How do you appreciate the ones who have\u00a0given you back your dreams and fueled you with new hopes and helped make your whole family better?\u00a0\u00a0(Seriously, I want to know). I\u2019m always at a loss. Someone once told me, \u2018When you enter the special needs world, \u00a0you meet a whole new class of people.\u2019 Brandon and I have found this to be true; those who have come into our lives as a result of Rhema\u2019s\u00a0autism have been\u00a0huge blessings to us. My girl is a cutie, no doubt, but she can be quite a challenge and I\u2019m grateful (and sometimes shocked!) that people besides me care for her so much. I met the parents of one of Rhema\u2019s teachers a\u00a0couple months ago at a fundraising benefit for Rhema\u2019s amazing-no-place-like-it-in-the-world  school . Their daughter, Heather,\u00a0 loves  my girl. She  believes in her when others don\u2019t , she is teaching her all of those important OT things I don\u2019t know about, and  how to trace her name . When I met her parents, all I could say with all of my heart was, \u201cThank you for Heather.\u201d Later, Heather\u2019s father sent me an e-mail that I will cherish because he made me feel special and proud to be Rhema\u2019s mom. I share some of it here because (1) \u00a0it demonstrates the great\u00a0 treasure  these teachers are and, (2) it gave me a different perspective, that is, our children are a gift to their teachers. . Dear J, I was very moved by your comment \u201cThank you for Heather\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ve been thinking about these words quite a bit since you first\u00a0said them and each time I am filled with pride.\u00a0 But upon deeper reflection I want to thank you for Rhema and Hope. You see, we have the same dreams for our children.\u00a0 That is, we want them to reach their full potential and nothing less.\u00a0 We also want to surround them with caring, loving people who will allow them to reach that potential. Now, [her mother] and I have guided Heather as best we could and as a young adult she needs to find other caring, loving people to bring her to that next stage.\u00a0 In order to reach that full potential, Heather needs: Young children in her life because God has given her the gift to work with children.\u00a0 Rhema is a beautiful child! Young children who want to learn because she has the ability to teach.\u00a0 Rhema wants to learn and is willing to be taught! Young children with determination to meet seemingly unreachable goals because she believes in pushing people to \u201cbe all you can be\u201d.\u00a0 Rhema is determined and will reach her goals! Young children that can love because she needs to be loved.\u00a0 Rhema is lovable! Rhema, wow, what a gift.\u00a0 She is helping Heather reach  her  full potential\u2026 Thank you for entrusting your daughter\u2019s growth and development to Heather.\u00a0  May they continue to push each other to continue to be God\u2019s gift to those who know them. A short story:\u00a0 In Heather\u2019s short career she has the following routine.\u00a0 When she leaves work she calls her mother, or me if Mom is unavailable, and tells us about her day. When she speaks of Rhema she typically says \u201cMy Rhema, I love my little Rhema\u201d.\u00a0 Your beautiful Rhema has become a blessing in our lives.\u00a0 Thank you again for Rhema. Respectfully, Heather\u2019s Dad \u00a0 Thank you  to all of the Kates, Courtneys, Jills, Tims, Sarahs, Jennys, Cerissas, Katelyns, Terres and Heathers of the world  for your life-changing work.

She directs us to take Rhema to the ER. My Rhema is drugged, out of it, can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t stand. I carry her backpack, her meds and all 52 lbs of her into the hospital as if she\u2019s weightless. She needs to be monitored right away. She\u2019s going to be alright.  Thank you, thank you Lord.

Why are these strange people trying to wrap a band-aid with a red light around my finger? Forget that! My head is pounding, pounding.  Oh, now they\u2019re trying to get the band-aid thing on my toe?

{"date": "August 5, 2010", "body": "\u201cSing, O barren, break forth and cry aloud.\u201d Isaiah 54:1 . This past Sunday I stood in the church that my parents founded twenty-two years ago. It was \u201cAnniversary Sunday\u201d \u2013 \u00a0and there was lots of singing \u2013 there are five different choirs! The tambourines were shaking, the piano keys were blazing and the drums were rocking a beat in celebration. Young, old, Black, white, Latino \u00a0\u2013 everyone was on their feet with hands and voices lifted up in song. And I was taken back\u2026 to \u00a0a cold New England morning\u00a0when I was twelve years old\u00a0and we had our first church service. I stared out the window of the front door \u2013 much like Rhema gazes out of windows \u2013 hoping, wishing that someone would come to church. My three sisters and I were the choir. And my mother was the choir director. The choir loft was positioned behind the pulpit, and we\u2019d stand there and sing our songs to an empty church. Then the four of us would march down from the choir loft and sit in a row in the first pew\u2026 so that my father would have someone to preach to. Over time the church grew so fast that we needed a bigger space. One day my parents brought home a picture they\u2019d taken of a large building they wanted for the church. But the space was not available and financially out of the question. My father put the picture on his bureau, and my parents prayed that one day the church would own the building. After five years of praying, we were able to buy the place. It took another year to renovate and build the sanctuary. I was away at college by the time worship services were held in the new church. But I know there was much rejoicing and singing that Sunday. Months later, the day after Easter, the building caught fire and burned to the ground. Hymnals, choir robes,\u00a0musical instruments, furniture\u00a0\u2013 everything was lost, save a Bible in the pulpit. The story made the local news, and I watched on TV as\u00a0people\u00a0\u00a0gathered at the site. They stood in the ashes and prayed and sang to the Lord. It was an image I will not soon forget as their sacrifice of praise rose like incense to the throne of heaven. I\u2019ve been standing in the ruins of my own self-destruction. Holding ashes in my hands. My Rhema, she sings. When she wakes in the morning, when she falls asleep, when she\u2019s happy, distressed, bored, excited \u2013 she sings songs in  her own language . Her speech therapist calls it self-singing. She comforts herself with her familiar sounds in the midst of unpredictability.  The sound of her song in her ears reminds her that she\u2019s still here. I wish I could go back to the twelve year old version of myself when my song was pure. When I didn\u2019t know what I know now. But tonight I\u2019m hoping, trusting that He\u2019s still listening and that the song really is deeper, sweeter when sung in the smoking remnants. And so I sing: Before the throne of God above \nI have a strong, a perfect plea: \nA great High Priest, whose name is Love, \nWho ever lives and pleads for me. My name is graven on his hands, \nMy name is written on his heart; \nI know that while in heaven he stands \nNo tongue can bid me thence depart \nNo tongue can bid me thence depart. When Satan tempts me to despair, \nAnd tells me of the guilt within, \nUpward I look, and see him there \nWho made an end of all my sin. Because a sinless Savior died, \nMy sinful soul is counted free; \nFor God, the Just, is satisfied \nTo look on Him and pardon me \nTo look on Him and pardon me Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the One, \nRisen Son of God!  Behold him there, the risen Lamb \nMy perfect, spotless righteousness, \nThe great unchangeable I am, \nThe King of glory and of grace!  . . (This video was recorded with my cell phone so the quality is poor, but this is Rhema\u00a0dancing \u2013 check out her foot! -and singing to music at church.) \u201cThere are songs which can only be learned in the valley. No art can teach them; no rules of voice can make them perfectly sung. Their music is in the heart. They are songs of memory, of personal experience. They bring out their burden from the shadow of the past; they mount on the wings of yesterday\u2026 The father is training thee for the part the angels cannot sing; and the school is sorrow. I have heard many say that He sends sorrow to prove thee; may He send sorrow to educate thee, to train thee for the choir invisible.\u201d \n~George Matheson, Streams in the Desert ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xUK2Dx5RkY"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/self-singing/", "title": "Self-singing"},

A couple weeks ago I blogged about Rhema learning to trace the letter \u201cR\u201d. I wrote about  Heather , her OT, believing in her and the dream she had that Rhema would one day write her name independently. I believed with all my heart that that \u201cone day\u201d would come, but I knew it would be in the far-distant future. I settled in for the long haul (-standard procedure where Rhema\u2019s concerned), happy to have a reason to dream again. \u00a0 . So I was totally not ready for a miracle when I picked Rhema up from school. Jenny, one of her teachers met me at the door. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve gotten an e-mail yet. But you\u2019re going to receive a video we recorded.\u201d She paused. \u201cRhema traced her entire name independently today.\u201d I stared at her, confused, and my heart started pounding. She must be mistaken. Rhema is still just learning the R, and that took months! Maybe I heard her wrong. Or maybe I heard her right. But, oh, don\u2019t make me hope\u2026 because in this moment I want nothing more than this. She was wiping away tears, and wonder and gratitude\u00a0filled me up and began leaking from my eyes. \u201cCome back to the classroom. They\u2019re going to have her do it for you.\u201d I cried. I did. Right there in front of people. Nose running and everything.\u00a0 . \u00a0 There\u2019s a song that our old youth choir used to sing based on Habakuk 2:1-4. \u201cWrite the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.\u201d I\u2019ve always loved the phrase \u201cwrite the vision\u201d, and even dared to hope that blogging might be something like that. The writing out of faith like a prayer, recording the good, hard lessons, waiting, and then watching Him give what we don\u2019t deserve and do\u00a0\u201cimmeasurably more than\u00a0all we\u00a0ask or imagine.\u201d  Thank you, Lord. . Some may watch the video clip of Rhema tracing her name and think it insignificant. They won\u2019t know the hours and hours it took to get her there, and that some said it couldn\u2019t be done. They won\u2019t know the happy tears her teachers and I shed as we watched her trace with no physical prompts at all. They might not even notice that her pencil grip is still immature and her E needs a lot of work. They won\u2019t realize that we still have a long way to go before she can write (instead of trace) independently, but that she just took one super-sized leap toward that goal. They won\u2019t understand how my girl wrote the vision, made it plain. And gave us a little more hope to run on. .

And you\u2019re covered with the fingerprints of God\u2026\u201d \n~Steven Curtis Chapman \u00a0 \u00a0 It\u2019s Friday and Hope has a dance class. Rhema gets\u00a0to tag along because there\u2019s no\u00a0school that day. We\u2019re the first to arrive and Hope\u2019s dance instructor comes over and\u00a0greets Rhema, \u201cHi, you must be Hope\u2019s big sister!\u201d Silence. Nothing. Rhema stares away blankly. Hope, always one to fill the silence, declares, \u201cThat\u2019s my sister Rhema!!!\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d replies her teacher, leaning over. \u201cHow old are you, Rhema?\u201d Pause. \u201cDo you like to dance?\u201d My hands are firmly on Rhema\u2019s shoulders, and she begins to fidget. The teacher tries again, \u201cDo you like to dance?\u201d We stand there a moment longer, and although I\u2019ve been in this situation many, many times before, I still wonder how best to handle it. What do I say? Do I give her the long or short version? Do I bother to explain at all? I  resist  explaining \u2013 sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making excuses\u00a0or apologizing for Rhema. If I offered an explanation with every awkward public encounter I\u2019d sound like a broken record in no time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do I just answer for Rhema? Yes, she likes to dance. To her own beat. Do I tell her that when Rhema was three years old \u2013 when the pain of it was all too fresh \u2013 \u00a0I would come to the Y and watch the little girls her age dressed in their leotards and tutus prancing around the studio and their mothers talking casually, beaming proudly, snapping pictures. And I felt so sad that my girl and I weren\u2019t in that club. (Kind of silly because I never needed Rhema to be a ballerina. She\u2019s definitely more of an extreme sports-rock-climbing-bungee-jumping kind of girl.) It\u2019s just because I couldn\u2019t have it that I suddenly wanted it. And now, look, God has given me Hope, a fairy-princess who oozes girly-girlness and positively lives for dance class. And on Fridays when Rhema is normally in school, I watch Hope in her leotard and tutu prancing around the studio. And I talk casually, beam proudly and snap pictures. As if we are typical, as if I\u2019m in that club. Even though I\u2019m not. Because when another Mom remarks, \u201cHope is so verbal!\u201d, she cannot possibly know what that means to me and that I had absolutely nothing to do with it. Because when I hear others comparing the milestones their babes in arms have reached, I still feel anxious. The teacher looks up at me with a questioning look. This time, I just smile. Another student comes in and while I\u2019m sliding on Hope\u2019s ballet slippers, the little girl sweetly stands next to Rhema. She seems to be impressed because Rhema is bigger, older, taller. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she whispers. Rhema is humming,  Ee oooh. Eeeee oooh. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u00a0the girl\u00a0says louder. \u201cHello? Hello???\u201d I stand up. \u201cHer name is Rhema. She\u2019s still learning how to talk,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cShe has  awe -tisms!\u201d Hope supplies. We just attended the  Walk  last weekend and there were bouncy castles and mazes and a horse and Hope had a blast and she\u00a0LOVES her sister fiercely and so \u201cawe-tisms\u201d is pretty darn cool. Thanks, Hope. The girls run off and class begins. As I\u2019m wondering what Rhema and I will do for the next 45 minutes, she sees a baby being lifted out of a car seat and rushes over as if she\u2019s been waiting for a seat all day. She settles her 6 year-old body into the baby\u2019s car seat and tries to buckle up. No doubt Dora the Explorer is running through her head:  Seatbelts! So we can be safe! Love. Oh, how I love my girl. I love her ways. I know what we\u2019ll be doing for the next 45 minutes. No apologies, no excuses\u2026 \u2026we\u2019ll be talking about her awe-tisms. .. \u00a0 Addendum: Welllll, after\u00a0a rough morning which included her eating a suppository for breakfast, I must say there are times when I\u2019m not loving her ways. Thanks Rhema, for keepin\u2019 it real.

I quickly licked my finger and rubbed out a snot smudge near the top button. \u201cNoooo,\u201d Hope protested. \u201cI wanna just wear my pink coat.\u201d \u201cBut your pink coat is too small for you now.\u201d\u00a0Then I gasped\u00a0in horror. \u201cLook! The tags says 3T!!!\u201d Her face registered the shock. How could she, the big 4 year old, be caught dead or alive wearing something for a lowly 3 year-old?? I grabbed Rhema\u2019s old purple coat with a flourish, ready to show her that this coat was indeed age appropriate. But all the writing on the tag\u00a0had faded away. Brandon and I talked up the wonders of the purple coat. We reminded her that purple was her favorite color. We ooohhhed and ahhhed over the cool, furry hood. But the kid was not convinced. Until Grandma picked up the coat, walked over to a drawer, pulled out a Black permanent marker and wrote a big  \u201c4\u201d  on the tag. And just like that the coat became brand spanking new. Hope shrugged off her 3T outerwear and lovingly adorned her big-girl purple coat. \u00a0 . It\u2019s a new year, a new chapter for us here \u2014 this month we move into a new home, we start new jobs. Brandon is home from Iraq \u2013 our marriage, our family, new in many ways. I gave my life to Jesus at the ripe old age of eight. I believed with all my heart, then as I do now, that He has the power to  re-make  us. To breathe  life into dry bones  and\u00a0give  beauty for\u00a0ashes . He leaves His mark upon us,\u00a0calls us\u00a0 new creations , and we are. There are times, though,\u00a0many times when I feel cloaked in hand-me-down sorrows and failure. The same-old, same-old ho-hum\u00a0baggage across\u00a0the shoulders. I\u2019m faded and jaded and\u00a0stained. How do we  do  this, be new in old skin? On the 16-hour drive to Michigan we passed huge, flat fields of corn and sugar beets that stretched as far as the eye could see. Covered in smooth, white snow, I imagined the land was a never-ending plate of whipped cream. Here and there brown, dead-looking corn stalks kept popping up in my fields of\u00a0sweet cream. The stubborn corn stalks reminded me of a Promise: \u201cI\u2019m about to do something brand-new.  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s bursting out! Don\u2019t you see it? \n There it is! I\u2019m making a road through the desert,  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rivers in the badlands.\u201d \u00a0 \nIsaiah 43:19, The Message On the hard days, when the old sins plague, the husband and I cling to the belief that God is  making us new . And grace teaches us to  do  new, put it on like a coat. Anyway, it\u2019s a good\u00a0start. It\u2019s an exciting start.

{"date": "October 7, 2010", "body": "\u00a0 Asthma attacks and pneumonia had us at the doctor\u2019s office a lot the past two weeks. The nurse asks the standard questions directly to Hope. \u201cHow are you feeling today, Hope?\u201d, \u201cAre you breathing better?\u201d, \u201cDoes anything hurt?\u201d And then comes the question that I hold my breath for because I never know what\u2019s going to come out of my little girl\u2019s mouth. \u201cHope? Is home a good place?\u201d \u201cWellllll,\u201d she says thoughtfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t like\u2026\u201d She pauses. We wait.  Oh boy,  I\u2019m thinking. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the new rug on the stairs,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI wanted to go back to the hotel because I don\u2019t like\u2026 I don\u2019t like the rug \u2026 on the stairs now.\u201d She hunches her shoulders. \u201cWe lived in a hotel while the house was being deleaded this summer. They put a dull gray carpet on the stairs and Hope is none too pleased.\u201d I explain. \u201cOh,\u201d says the nurse. \u201cBut Hope, besides that, is home a good place?\u201d \u201cWelllllll,\u201d she says thoughtfully. I roll my eyes. \u201cGod comes down to our house. But we\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re going to go to His house. And it\u2019s better than our house.\u201d I\u00a0grin at the nurse.  Got that? \u00a0. Later I thought about Hope\u2019s words. I knew she was talking about heaven when she said that we were going to His house and it\u2019s better than ours. We had a conversation about it once, but I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d remembered. But the part that got me, the part that she and I had never discussed is that \u201cGod comes down to our house.\u201d It reminds me of the Old Testament story where God tells Moses that he wants to save the Israelite slaves out of Egypt. He says, \u201cI have surely seen their affliction\u2026 and have heard their cry\u2026 for I know their sorrows;  And I am come down to deliver them\u2026 \u201d (Exodus 3:7). I think it\u2019s a foreshadowing of God in human flesh \u2013 the Savior \u2013 come down to deliver. He could have\u00a0chilled in heaven and\u00a0waved His pinky finger to perform the rescue, but instead He came down to do it. This house is never as clean as I want it. Not even close. There is spilled juice on the floor, dishes in the sink, butter on the alarm keypad and laundry piled to the ceiling. And I\u2019m so glad the walls don\u2019t speak of things said and done within. The thought of the Most High God loving\u00a0us so much as\u00a0to come into\u00a0this space and\u00a0invade our homes and hearts is mind-boggling. Makes me embarrassed and grateful all at once. Because we greatly need the joy\u00a0of His deliverance, the\u00a0comfort of His presence. Every moment. \u00a0. At bedtime, Hope prays the same prayer: \u201cPlease let Daddy have a good day at Iraq. A-ah-men.\u201d \u201cI have  heard  their cry: And I am come down\u2026\u201d \u00a0. Rhema\u2019s agitation is expressed through\u00a0midnight antics. She strips, she shrieks, she turns on the light, she pounds the floor and kicks the door. Her brain cannot, will not slow down. But then finally, in the early morning, she settles into rest. \u201cI have surely  seen  their affliction; And I am come down\u2026\u201d .\u00a0. Lonely nights give way to hectic mornings, and I check myself, and the ache is still there. It\u2019s another long day and Hope is whining and I\u2019m PMS-ing and I don\u2019t know what to cook for their gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, nut-free, soy-free dinner.\u00a0 And Rhema is out of sorts again, doing the limp noodle on the stairs, and I bend over and try to lift her. She head butts me, and the pain is blinding, and I think I can\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cFor I  know  their sorrows; And I am come down\u2026\u201d \u00a0. Via skype, the husband and I talk over hard things \u2013 from MMR shots to moving details to  us \u2013  all over a bad connection. But He sees, He hears, He knows. So we pray, because we don\u2019t know what to do. . And God comes down to our house. \u00a0.

{"date": "October 11, 2010", "body": "\u201cRhema, want pop?\u201d I ask. \u201cPop. Pop!\u201d she says. We\u2019ve been doing this for  forever , it seems. It was time to change it up. Just for kicks, I held two Mighty Mini popsicles in front of her, one was orange and one was green, and I asked, \u201cRhema, what color do you want?\u201d Without missing a beat, she replied, \u201cGwee! Gwee!\u201d Omigoshomigoshomigosh! Rhema wants green! She knows her colors. I can\u2019t believe it!!! I grabbed her and kissed her. I did the happy dance and couldn\u2019t wait to tell her teachers and therapists. She\u2019s learned her colors! I was so excited that when she finished the popsicle, I got out two more. One red, one yellow. \u201cRhema, what color???\u201d \u201cGwee! Gwee!\u201d (Insert record scratch.) Ok, hold on, kid. Let\u2019s try again. I waved the red and yellow popsicles in front of her eyes. \u201cRhema, what color?\u201d \u201cGwee! Gwee!\u201d I got out two more popsicles, this time orange and purple. \u201cRhema, what color?\u201d \u201cGwee! Gwee!\u201d \u201cIs\u2026 is that your final answer???\u201d She lunged for a popsicle, and with that my green balloon burst and made a whining hiss as it deflated.  She\u2019s 6.5 years old. You\u2019ve been working on this stuff almost every day for 5 years, and she still doesn\u2019t know her colors, shapes, letters, numbers. You\u2019re toast, you\u2019re nothing but green, moldy toast. I gave her all of the popsicles and walked away. Later when her therapist T came to the house, I watched her work with Rhema on a coloring activity. T has often said Rhema knows so much more than she\u2019s able to show us. T, like me, simply believes that Rhema is brilliant. \u201cDo you think she knows her colors, T? Sometimes I\u2019m sure she does. But it\u2019s so hard to know what she knows. Maybe she gets a certain word or idea stuck in her head and it\u2019s hard to get past that. Maybe\u00a0she\u2019s trying to say one thing and\u00a0thinking another?\u00a0 What do you think? Does she know her colors?\u201d T said thoughtfully, \u201cOne thing is for sure. She\u2019s getting there.\u201d I thought back to a year ago when a doctor fired simple questions at Rhema that she could not answer. And he asked us, \u2018what question does she answer?\u2019 And I had to say,  \u201cNothing.\u201d Well, now, look at my girl. She can listen to a question, \u201cWhat color?\u201d And she can  answer  it.  With a color, an appropriate response!!!  My mind is racing with the possibilities of the questions she\u2019ll learn to answer, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the sum of all the positive integers?\u201d, \u201cWhat is Shakespeake\u2019s favorite breakfast?\u201d (The answer to the last one is Green Eggs and Hamlet. Get it?) Oh, how far she has come. How could I forget to be thankful?  Thank you, Lord! Yes, she\u2019s getting there.\u00a0 .

We took her to Storyland last weekend and we only lost her once. Just once! What happened? Well, she went into this big tree house thing\u2026 and I was waiting for her to come down the slide. After she did not come down for several minutes, I went into the tree house and she wasn\u2019t there. I called my twin. We spread out searching the park, calling her name. It didn\u2019t take long to find her happily riding on a merry-go-round. But the thing is, I would not have  dared  take her to an amusement park a year ago. She\u2019s come so far! Yes, this poor heart of mine beats a little slower these days. In fact\u2026 in fact I think it\u2019s time to retire the old descriptors \u201c bolter \u201d and \u201c escape artist \u201d and \u201cHoudini\u201d. Those terms are just so  unfair  to Rhema now.

I saw Rhema sticking her very lovely head out the  top  of the upstairs window next to her air conditioner. Smart as a whip she is! She\u2019s figured out how to undo that window from the top.

{"date": "February 1, 2010", "body": "Rhema started at a new school in January, and we are absolutely thrilled. She received after-school therapy there for years, and the teachers and staff know and love her well. They  get  her, and just have\u00a0an amazing way of helping Rhema growing and learn. Her transition to a full day student has been seamless. The past month a number of assessments have been performed. From previous experience I know that these tests tend to knock me off my feet. I\u2019ve been mentally preparing myself for a while not to get upset or discouraged by the results. I had a meeting with Rhema\u2019s team last week. Sometimes these meetings leave me in a\u00a0strange, emotional\u00a0place. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I now attend so many of these meetings without Brandon. Perhaps it\u2019s because I never imagined that I would be at one of  these  meetings \u2013 ballet, violin, gifted and talented \u2013 sure, but not this. We went over some of the assessments. Everything was tested from Eating to Safety to Imitation. The results were presented in charts with particular skills listed along the bottom and then the percent independence (from 0 to 100) along the side. As expected, her numbers were low in many areas. For example, \u201cEye contact in response to name\u201d was 15%. We all chuckled when we got to the Gross Motor chart \u2013 she scored 100% in \u201cExercise.\u201d Then we got to the chart on Expressive Language. There was nothing\u00a0on it \u2013 no bars or lines or anything. I flipped the chart vertically. I turned it over. Just to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing anything. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not a typo,\u201d  Mr. Tim  said gently. Blank page. Goose egg. Zero percent.  No  expressive ID of objects.\u00a0 No  expressive ID of pictures.\u00a0 No  expressive ID of familiar people.  No  expressive ID of objects in the environment. Not a shocker. But a shock, nonetheless, to see it there (or not there) in black and white. As I stared at the page, memories from the past few years filled my head. The countless hours of speech therapy on weekdays and weekends, the doctors in Boston and New York, the non-conventional therapies, the diets, the supplements \u2013 from methylB-12 shots in the rear end to a smelly foot cream. And oh, the prayers and prayers for speech, our only biggest request of all time. And here we are, she\u2019s almost 6 years old, and there\u2019s not a single, solitary 1 percent of expressive language on the chart. I felt the silence of the long, unanswered prayer. I sat with it for a minute in that meeting room. And did my best to smile. I felt like David the psalmist.  How long, O Lord?  And  why???  Why would you not give us what we ask? I remembered the\u00a0reflections of\u00a0 Ann Voskamp . And God\u2019s\u00a0words to Abram\u00a0in his many years of pain and waiting for the promise, and said, \u201cI am God Almighty, El Shaddai.\u201d Meaning \u201cI am God Almighty who is all sufficient, the God who is More Than Enough.\u201d More than enough. Meeting after meeting, day by day, moment by moment. \u201cBut it is precisely when we  do not  have what we would ask for,  and only then , that  we can clearly perceive His all-sufficiency \u2026. Is it so? When I  do not  have what I would ask for\u2014peace, certainty, painless days, settled nights \u2014 when I don\u2019t have all that my soul cries for,  it is then  I stumble into the mysterious, buoying truth:  He is enough. In the midst of these hard, tiring days, and unanswered prayers, He says,  \u201cI am enough. Come and know me, the all-sufficient God.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 God, there\u2019s no way\u00a0I can do this life on\u00a0my own.\u00a0 May we\u00a0find Him to be\u00a0El Shaddai, our more than enough. . The meeting ended. Mr. Tim looked at me and said simply, \u201cI have faith in her.\u201d I thought of my crazy, curly-haired girl. I thought of her  speaking words  from her verse. Yes. Faith in her, faith in Him.

{"date": "February 3, 2010", "body": "On the day that I watched Rhema tilt her head back and gulp down my contact lenses and saline solution right out of the case, I knew it was time for us to get out of the house. My twin and my neice Lexi showed up and we were off to Bonkers, an indoor funhouse with lots of rides, mazes and games. It\u2019s not the place for anyone who dislikes germs, but it\u2019s a dream come true for a kid like Rhema. It had been a long time since we\u2019d dared to show our faces there. The last time we were there, Rhema was in full-blown stripper phase. While she was playing in a huge tunnel-tube-maze-thingamajig up in the ceiling, she decided to get \u201cindecently exposed.\u201d She slid down the bumpy slide in her birthday suit. She gleefully\u00a0ran around inside the gated area, completely oblivious to the fact that she had no clothes on. We watched her run toward a group of kids, and then we watched the kids scatter and scream as N@ked Girl approached. We tackled her, but Rhema did not understand why she had to stop playing and went into meltdown mode. Meanwhile employees went inside the tunnel to try and gather the clothing that had been deposited in various parts of the maze. Someone loaned us a T-shirt, but I could not get it on her because she was tantrumming so much. I finally just decided to carry N@ked Girl out to the car kicking, screaming and flailing the whole way. Brandon came to the car with Hope and then ran back in to collect Rhema\u2019s clothes. When he climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, we just sat and stared out the window for a while, our hearts pounding. He cleared his throat, \u201cWell, I think it was really bonkers in there tonight\u2026\u201d And, because I think I could have cried,\u00a0we laughed. A lot. The girls had a blast on our return trip to the funhouse. Rhema was in heaven running from ride to ride, sprinting through the maze, jumping up and down. She wanted to ride a small ferris wheel, and I tried to help her wait in line. When it was her turn, she scampered into a car and buckled herself in. I had not paid to ride any rides myself, and I was uneasy about her riding alone. But I decided to let her try. I nervously watched from the sidelines.\u00a0She giggled and did a little dance in her seat. I watched her lean over and snap and unsnap the empty seat buckle across from her repeatedly.  So far so good , I breathed. Then the ride ended, and I waited as the operator stopped each car to let out the passengers. Rhema was in a car at the top of the ferris wheel \u2013 I worried that the starting and stopping of the ride was going to bother her. I strained to see her \u2013 she was fiddling with her seat buckle. And then, in an instant, she was climbing out of the car. Oh Lord.  The operator saw her the same time I did. \u201cNO! Get back in there! You have to sit down!! Oh no!\u201d the woman screamed. \u201cUmmm. Ma\u2019am? She has autism. She doesn\u2019t understand \u2013\u201d Immediately the woman lowered her voice. \u201cOh.\u201d We watched Rhema as she briefly checked out the view from the top  outside  the car, and then she casually climbed back in and snapped her seatbelt. (I actually was not very afraid. Rhema is incredibly coordinated and loves heights.) The operator quickly advanced the ride to Rhema\u2019s car, and I grabbed her out. She squirmed out of my arms and ran off to the next thing. I said a quick thank you to the woman before chasing Rhema to\u2026 (insert hallelujah chorus) The. Merry. Go. Round. I think she almost paused for a nanosecond to admire it before jumping over the rails. The girl is  obsessed  with Merry Go Rounds. I told the operator about her autism right away (should have done that back at the Ferris Wheel). He offered to let me go on with her. And that\u2019s how it went for the rest of our day at Bonkers \u2013 everyone was extremely kind and accommodating. The rule on the Merry Go Round is that you cannot change horses in the middle of the ride. Well, Rhema didn\u2019t get that memo. And she could not decide on a horse, so the operator stopped the ride and everyone waited patiently while Rhema methodically tried out each unoccupied horse (and a few occupied ones as well). She finally settled on one, and the ride resumed. In the end, Rhema had to ride every horse on the Merry Go Round. For many rounds she was the only child on the ride. Each time she would purposefully\u00a0slide off one horse and move to the next. She enjoyed every minute of it. I loved the kindness of the Bonkers staff. I loved the fact that she was able to have fun, and run and play freely. I loved that she kept her clothes on the whole time. It did my heart good to see her giggle and smile. Small-big things to be thankful for. And the reminder that we\u2019ve come a long way, and  we can do this.

I loved the pictures of the families\u2026especially those families who have walked with us through these hard times\u2026and those who share our struggles. I am grateful for the messages of encouragement. I am grateful that you all gave me something to look forward to each Saturday when I rolled in from the Iraq/Syrian border and picked up mail. I am thankful for the hard earned money many spent on sending expensive packages. I am thankful that while I missed my family during the holidays, I always had a ton of letters and cards that somehow eased the loneliness of the times.

{"date": "February 11, 2010", "body": "This is the most personal blog I\u2019ve ever written, but I felt\u00a0strongly about posting\u00a0it. I\u2019m thankful for my good friend Jess for setting the  example . . \u201cMarriage is a crucible; it forces you to lay down your life for another a little bit at a time, which is good for those of us too cowardly to do it all at once.\u201d  ~ Andrew Peterson Every morning when I drop Rhema off for school, we go through a routine of saying goodbye. I stoop. She squats in a corner. Her teacher stands her up, holds her still. I come close, try to get her to look my way and say with exaggeration, \u201cBye, Rhema. Bye.\u201d Her teacher puts a hand at the side of Rhema\u2019s eyes, \u201cRhema say Bye!\u201d Lately,\u00a0she will give\u00a0us a\u00a0sweet \u201cIiiii. Iiiii.\u201d And then sometimes we get, \u201cHhhhi. Hi. Hi.\u201d Wonderful sounds to my ears. But this is not acceptable, because she needs to say Bye and we know she can do it. But for whatever reason, at 8:30 in the morning, Rhema can\u2019t seem to find the \u201cB\u201d sound. Sometimes we\u2019ll be there for 10 to 15 min. Over and over we model the sound, we direct her gaze, we stand her slouching body, we offer reinforcers and encouragement, \u201cC\u2019mon buddy, you can do it. Say \u201cBye.\u201d We fight until finally the sound is there, sometimes whispered so faintly you might miss it. We hear \u201cBuh\u201d in front of \u201ciii\u201d, and we cheer and she bounces down the hall. Every morning, every day, all her life I fight for the little and big things for Rhema. I pour my time, energy, heart and soul into helping her learn and grow. Along the way I\u2019ve realized there is an equally urgent, and dare I say,  even more important  fight: the one for my marriage, my husband. Recently I woke up to the fact that the demands (and joys) of motherhood,\u00a0 friendships and work and life had crowded out my purpose of loving my husband. Nothing dramatic or drastic \u2013 just a slow, chipping away from our foundation. The thing is I was too busy to notice. I had stopped fighting. (And then my line of thinking: Oh. I need to fight for us. Oh. But I guess I\u2019m off the hook. I don\u2019t have to fight because he\u2019s deployed a billion miles away\u2026 he\u2019s not here. Phew. Huh? That means I have to fight for us all the more??? Oh God, how in the world do I do that? Please show me how.) Some ways I\u2019m making changes: \n1. Praying each day for a greater love for him. Praying for him as much or more than I do my children. \n2. Being intentional and creative about expressing affection (for e.g., cards, letters). Two dear friends of mine set up a cyber meeting place where only Brandon and I can go to connect, share concerns and triumphs, talk about just us. My friend, Shanda, had one of the most  radical ways of re-connecting with her husband . \n3. Going to him first \u2013 before or instead of going to friends. \n4. Date nights (for us, for now, it\u2019s over Skype). The greatest gift I can give my children is to prioritize, honor and nourish my relationship with my husband. For us, I know, the key will be to put the Lord first. Honestly, the end goal is to make him my highest priority. Easier said than done, but so worth it. My husband is good  good , generous and strong. And by God\u2019s grace he is committed to not just being here. But to watering, feeding, tending to our marriage as it grows. And I am re-dedicated to the same, come hell or high water. After eleven years of marriage, I can assure you that hell and high water have come and will come again. The Lord is faithful. Will Christ sustain us? Yes. But not only that.\u00a0He\u2019ll make it better than we could ever imagine. Happy Anniversary, B.

In recent months that fixation has grown into a real problem. Rhema\u2019s room has 5 large windows, 3 of which are bay windows. She would spend all night standing in the windows, going from one to the next in a continuous loop. Eventually she would tire and collapse on the floor just under the windows. Then a few hours later she would climb back up and resume her pattern. These are the old-style, double-hung rope and pulley windows with stained blue panes. The ropes have long been broken, and every night\u00a0Rhema would pull down on the ropes. I could hear the counterweight inside the frame screech up to the top and then come crashing down. Rhema liked the sound, and she particularly liked to hear it over and over in the middle of the night. The noise would drive me crazy. Cra. zy.\u00a0 Recently she upped the anty by jumping down from the window  with the rope in her mouth , and then letting it go so that the weight could crash down. Last month a concerned neighbor contacted me. She said she could see Rhema in the second-story windows at night and worried that she would fall out. \u201cOne night,\u201d she said, \u201cI started shouting to her from my kitchen, \u2018Rhema get down from the window. Get down!\u2019\u2026 And then you appeared out of nowhere and pulled her down. How many times a night do you have to do that?\u201d For a moment I wished I could just  tell\u00a0 Rhema to stay out of the windows, and that she would actually listen and understand. If only it were that simple. I talked it over with several people \u2013 Brandon, my father, my brother-in-law, friends. We thought of putting up bars (on the inside) or even boarding up the windows altogether, but worried about fire codes. Completely replacing the windows was also an option, but a very costly one. What to do? Enter an angel by the name of Mr. Steve. Mr. Steve, whom I\u2019d only met weeks before, offered to work on the windows. First, he tried vinyl screens. But we thought Rhema could push right through that. Then he decided to place plexiglass in front of the windows, and it worked like a charm. But Mr. Steve did not stop there. Before putting in the plexiglass, he observed Rhema in her patterns as she made her way around the room, climbing up and dancing on the sills,\u00a0touching different surfaces, spinning pulley wheels. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite brilliant,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2026what she does.\u201d As her mother, naturally my concerns have been\u00a0centered\u00a0on her safety (and yes, peace and quiet at night). But Mr. Steve\u2019s\u00a0comment gave me pause, and\u00a0for once I was able to see Rhema through new eyes. I no longer saw a child with autism stuck in an aimless pattern. Instead I found purpose and wonder in the way she hummed and moved throughout her room, the way\u00a0she\u00a0communicated with light and sound, the way she experienced every surface.\u00a0 Mr. Steve installed various \u201ctoys\u201d around the room to replace what she lost in the windows. A cord to pull, wheels to spin, handles to help her climb. For years Rhema has had nothing in her room except her bed \u2013 no dresser, no toys or books, no lamps\u00a0(for safety reasons). I never imagined that her room could be a place she could enjoy. And Mr. Steve has big plans to make her room even more enjoyable (-there are even rumors about a rock wall!) \u00a0\u00a0  At my request, Mr. Steve nailed shut a bench beneath a pair of windows in the room. (Another  midnight pasttime of Rhema\u2019s is to open and slam the lid repeatedly.) But Rhema was able to pry open the bench\u00a0in no time at all.\u00a0A friend and I\u00a0removed the lid from the bench altogether, and in so doing, created Rhema\u2019s dream bed (aka casket)! Maybe, just maybe she will sleep better now, beneath her beloved windows, having the feeling that she\u2019s surrounded on all sides. . I\u2019m so thankful again for the many, many ways God provides for us through the love and kindness of friends.

The image is interrupted by Rhema pushing him out of his rotating chair so that she can spin in it. As I pull her out of the chair, she taps on the keyboard on his desk. I make a joke: \u201cShe\u2019s pulling up her results. The suspense is killing us.\u201d He laughs\u2026 kind of. Then he tells me her EEG showed no seizure activity during sleep. Good news. Wow! The med is working. Then he goes on explain that the EEG did indeed show sub-clinical seizures during the day and during drowsiness.

{"date": "December 3, 2009", "body": "\u00a0 Rhema has\u00a0had lots of trouble with toileting lately. She\u2019s had accidents on the bus, at school, in her bed,  everywhere. \u00a0 Car seat covers, sheets, blankets, clothes, socks, shoes \u2013 I could not keep up with the laundry (well, nothing new there), and I felt my frustration growing. No matter how much I put her on the potty she was having accidents on the hour, it seemed. Last night, after bathing her for the third time that day, she climbed into a toy box and\u00a0wet herself again. She did not even seem to notice what she was doing. And Momma lost it. I grabbed her by the arm, dragged her upstairs to the bath tub, and then yelled at her,  \u201cWhat are you doing to me, Rhema!!??\u201d Growing up, no matter what kind of trouble my sisters and I found, my father  never  yelled at us. He never once\u00a0raised his voice to us. And here I was screaming at my little girl. She stood there by the tub, arms at her sides, head dropped. Her sweet face was contorted, her little lips trembling. And I died. All at once my anger dissipated leaving only sadness and shame that I could hurt her like that. I dropped to my knees and gathered her in my arms, tears on both our cheeks. It takes so much \u2013 a\u00a0big voice, an exaggerated tone, an animated face, lots of movement \u2013 to get a response out of Rhema. I\u2019d succeeded in getting a response, but it was so not the way I wanted it. I just held her. Those minutes holding her I finally started really thinking about what was going on. And then the pieces to the puzzle started coming together \u2013 frequent urination, wetting herself even though she\u2019s toilet-trained, rash\u2026 and there were other signs. A urinary tract infection. That was it. Suddenly it made so much sense. A trip to the doctor this morning confirmed it. It\u2019s just a UTI. No big deal, really. But this is my beef with autism:  My girl has no possible way of communicating to me if something is wrong.  She can\u2019t tell me if something hurts, she can\u2019t tell me how she feels\u2026 and she doesn\u2019t seem to have the inclination to tell me even if she had the words. The not knowing  if  or  what  is wrong is one of my biggest fears. She\u2019s been having symptoms of a UTI for weeks now, and I\u2019m just figuring it out. (If you\u2019ve ever had a UTI, you know how uncomfortable they can be.) I forgive myself for that \u2013 some of the signs could have easily been blamed on \u201cbehaviors\u201d, the new drug she\u2019s taking, changes at school, etc. What is hard to forgive myself for is the way I yelled at her last night. The image of her standing there by the tub trying not to cry is seared on my memory, and it breaks my heart. Today a friend reminded me of something new I got when I woke up this morning:  mercy . \u201c It is of  the LORD\u2019S mercies that we are not consumed, because  his  compassions fail not.

The shots were extremely painful, and caused a number of unpleasant side effects. Every day, every shot was an emotional battle, and for a while, she was losing. She came up with a game plan. She would rotate injection sites on her body over a week \u2013 Monday would be the right arm, Tuesday the left arm, Wednesday the stomach, Thursday the right hip, Friday the left hip, Saturday the right thigh, Sunday the left thigh. She assigned a loved one to each site \u2013 for e.g., \u201cright arm day\u201d was my day and she would spend the day praying for me. A few times a week I would go and administer the shot to her. Afterwards, the pain would hit hard and fast for several minutes and she would spend the whole time, with clenched fists, praying for whosever day it was. I would spend the time\u00a0willing her pain to pass, amazed that she would focus on someone else in the midst of it. (But then again, she loves the One who was flogged, stabbed, ridiculed and crucified\u2026 the One who endured the pain of the cross and, all the while,  thought  of  us .) .

As I got the girls ready to go, I caught a whiff of\u2026  smelly pebbles . I checked pants (the girls\u2019, that is). Clean. I put them on the potty for good measure, and we were out the door. It was nice out, so we didn\u2019t even bother with jackets. What I thought was going to be a quick run to the grocery store turned into a full blown shopping trip. With Rhema in the front and Hope in the back, I filled the cart. Midway through the shopping I sniffed The Smell again. I checked the girls\u2019 shoes for dog poo. Clean. Gosh,  someone\u2019s  really got to go. Better get home. But there was a long line at the check out, and as we waited, The Smell seemed to get stronger. Especially when I bent over\u2026 to get my 24-pack of bottled water under the cart. But I could not determine The Smell\u2019s origin. I even turned around in the line to see if it was coming from someone else. Once in the parking lot, I could no longer detect the troubling odor so I decided to tempt fate and make a couple more stops. We picked up a couple prescriptions at CVS. We stopped in the Hallmark Store for some thank you cards\u2026 but it was there that the odor seemed to re-surface. As soon as we\u00a0got\u00a0home, I made the girls go to the bathroom.

{"date": "December 15, 2009", "body": "**Thank you so much for the cards to Brandon. I think he\u2019s going to be the most popular soldier in Iraq! I know it means so much to him that people are thinking of him during this time. Thank you!** \u00a0. A few weeks ago, after Rhema\u2019s Special Olympics gymnastics practice, I stopped to get the mail. It was 5:30 and already very dark outside.\u00a0Our mailbox is located next to a fairly busy road, at the end of a long semi-circular driveway. I put the\u00a0van in park, grabbed the keys out of the ignition and jumped out to get the mail. (Getting the mail was Brandon\u2019s jobs and now that it\u2019s mine\u2026 well, I\u2019m doing good if I check the mail once a week.) It crossed my mind that it was risky to leave the\u00a0van with the girls in it, but the mailbox was only a few steps away. We had lots of mail and it took me a few extra moments to gather it all. As I climbed back into the van I saw that\u00a0Rhema\u2019s car seat was empty. I\u00a0scanned the vehicle fast\u00a0\u2013 maybe she had climbed into the back seat or the trunk? Not there. I felt sick to my stomach. \u201cHope, where\u2019s Rhema???\u201d I said desperately. My heart was pounding so loudly, I could barely hear myself speak. \u201cDid she get out???!!!\u201d I demanded. \u201cYeah, she got out!\u201d After a few minutes of frantically searching the streets and calling her name, I heard her soft, happy hum. She was obscured by a huge evergreen tree, but I knew she was making her way down the other side of the driveway. I grabbed her in my arms,  Rhema , and led her back to the car. The thing I found most troubling about this particular escape is that Rhema seemed like she was on a journey of which I could never be a part. Completely oblivious to the danger or the cold, she was contentedly on her way, her eyes seeing things I could not see. She did not need me or anyone else \u2013 she was making her way, enjoying herself, her thoughts and her freedom in the dark. It seemed like if I had not stopped her, she would have just kept walking and walking and walking.\u00a0\u00a0 It reminded me of something I read in the book  Jewel  by Bret Lott. A young man\u00a0tells his mother that his sister who has Down Syndrome will always need someone to take care of her, to follow her as she walks through her life. \u201cMomma, there\u2019s somebody going to be following her the rest of her days,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u00a0 And I see myself following, chasing Rhema constantly, continuously\u2013 be it to prevent her from putting some non-edible in her mouth or getting into a mess or running into a busy street. And our lives, hers and mine, stretch out before me. And I will not grow weary; I will\u00a0readily follow for as long as it takes. For\u00a0I love her more than life. \u00a0. In this Advent season, I cannot help but think of God the Father chasing after us, longing to share the journey with us. From the first page to the last, the Bible tells the story of the Lord pursuing relationship with us. But all we like sheep had gone astray\u2026 turned our backs, took our own path\u2026 got lost. So great was His desire to bring us back to Himself, He sent His son to walk our road in\u00a0this world. C.S. Lewis wrote of his encounters with this\u00a0 \u2018Hound of Heaven\u2019 : \u201cYou must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all  England  \u2026The Prodigal Son at least walked home on his own feet. But who can duly adore that Love which will open the high gates to a prodigal who is brought in kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance of escape?\u201d Why would He choose to pursue me again and again? Me with my fickle, wandering heart and stubborn pride. How could He still want me as I am, and then bathe me in new mercies and\u00a0healing forgiveness? I cannot understand why, but  grace  is the story of His pursuit of me. When I think of myself chasing my daughter \u201cacross the margins of the world,\u201d I think of the compassion of the\u00a0Lord of Christmas, come down from heaven to be our Emmanuel,  God with us . He will not grow weary; He will readily follow for as long as it takes. For He loves more than  life .

{"date": "May 3, 2012", "body": "\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just the jolly green giant!\u201d A woman at church said that to me twenty-five years ago. Worse has been said, surely. Although to this day I can\u2019t put on a pair of heels without hearing her voice. Have you ever wanted to take back your words? That was the question posed to my Bible study class this morning. We\u2019ve been reading the book of James; chapter 3 talks about taming the tongue and\u00a0the power of words. I thought of Rhema, who all her life, we\u2019ve been trying to get words out. I wondered, Will she ever have a moment where she actually says too much? \u2013\u00a0wants to take her words back? Somewhere between age one and two I\u2019d convinced myself that \u2018all she has is a speech delay\u2019.\u00a0I would tell her one day, I thought, when she could talk, how the language had been slow to come. How huge the silence had felt. How she\u2019d spent countless hours in therapy doing oral motor exercises just to become aware of her lips, to strengthen her tongue and produce sound with her mouth. I\u2019d tell her we\u2019d learned never to take it for granted. Words. That speech is a gift. That she should always remember to speak well; use her words for good, not bad; bless, not curse. Perhaps the lesson was always intended for me \u2013 I grieve my many sins with my too much talk, the rivers of damage springing from my own tongue. Life with Rhema has often prompted me to consider what I say, what I write. Words in cyberspace are superfluous. Every time I log in, the WordPress tool boasts \u201952,539,835 words today.\u2019 Countless words are recorded in chats, emails, blogs, Facebook and Twitter pages. My friend  Stefan  wrote once, \u201cWith the sheer volume and pace of words and words and words, it is unnatural and counter cultural to slow down enough to  read or write words that matter . \n~Excerpt from  On Comments , 9/2010 Is there not more silence in our lives because we are afraid? \n \nAfraid that when we aren\u2019t talking, aren\u2019t connected, aren\u2019t piping in on conversations around tables, water coolers, comment boxes, aren\u2019t messaging or emailing \u2026. that we don\u2019t matter. That we will be forgotten. \n That we\u2019ll become invisible. \n And maybe more than anything else, we want to be seen, known\u2026 \n~ Ann Voskamp I heard two words for sure from my girl today, the 2 nd  of May 2012. She said \u201cHi\u201d to me when prompted by her teacher. She said, \u201cChee, chee, chee\u201d after I said \u201cCh-\u201c and held out a piece of cheese. And I told her that her speech is a precious gift, graciously given by the Speech Maker himself. And I told her that it\u2019s ok. I am finally ok in this loud world, even happy to sit with no words. I admire the beautiful  meditation  of her heart, her wisdom in the silence, her quiet contentment \u2013 she knows she is seen, she knows she is known. This child whose very name means \u201cword\u201d is to me a living reminder that there really are no words, only The Word, the  Spirit and Life Word . God\u2019s whispering  come and listen . \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m speechless, in awe\u2014words fail me.  \n I should never have opened my mouth! \n I\u2019ve talked too much, way too much.  \n I\u2019m ready to shut up and listen.\u201d ~Job 40:3-5 Search your hearts and be silent. ~Psalm 4:4 Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God.

Oh but I will give you my song, give you all of my praise\u2026\u201d \n~Rita Springer,  Worth It All I try to hear her, grateful she has so much patience with me, with this world. Every day Rhema is learning to speak our language. She must continuously be prompted to say and approximate words, and every once in a great while a word will come out so crystal clear and spontaneous that it bowls us over. But her preferred  language  seems to be one of repetitive intonations, humming and \u201c self-singing \u201d (or so it sounds to us). In public, people often don\u2019t realize there\u2019s anything different about her until the vocalizations flow out of her mouth like a river. On the phone once while I sat next to her as she made her babbling sounds, the pharmacist asked if that was my baby in the background. Hope tells me in dramatic detail how she bit her tongue while chewing a Starburst and how it hurt so bad she couldn\u2019t even cry. Her language is so descriptive, she\u2019s eager for me to commiserate. And suddenly it hits me that Rhema\u2019s probably bit her tongue before and I didn\u2019t know. And she\u2019s probably had a sore throat and I didn\u2019t realize it or been too cold or too hot or afraid or anxious about something. And she couldn\u2019t tell me. And while I try to anticipate her needs \u2013 (I am constantly thinking about these things \u2013 Does she need a sweater? Does she need to go potty? Is she thirsty?) \u2013 I cannot imagine how many things I\u2019ve missed. I try to hear her, grateful she has so much patience with me, with this world. She struggles, too, and I hear it but I don\u2019t understand it. \u00a0I often have no idea what\u2019s in her head, how to reach her?  Lord, please show me how to be her mother. It\u2019s our last gymnastics practice of the season. Tomorrow is the Summer Games, and all of the girls on the team are working hard for the big day. I\u2019d gotten my hopes up that Rhema would be able to participate, but weeks ago the coaches gently told us she was not ready. And as she darts around the gym and her coach tries to communicate with her, the blinders are off. I see how positively not ready she is, how disabled she seems even among her teammates on a Special Olympics team. (Amazing how alone you can feel even in a group of mamas and children with special needs). I am so thankful that she is able to run, jump and move so well, I am. But \u201cnonverbal autism\u201d puts us at a loss that feels too heavy \u2013 does she feel it, too? \u2013 and I let disappointment and discouragement ripple through me, invade. On the way home we have to make an unplanned stop at a grocery store bathroom. I peel off her leotard, have no choice but to throw away her soiled underpants. She stands there as I clean her up with wet paper towels, and she hums a peaceful song into my soul. I hear her, grateful she has so much patience with me, with this world. Soft soprano in a dirty bathroom, floating high, and it\u2019s so pure and lovely and full of faith it breaks me. I want to  sing like her .

{"date": "May 7, 2012", "body": "\u201cShe is your mirror, shining back at you with a world of possibilities\u2026\u201d \n~Barbara Alpert Rhema and Hope, ages 8 and 5. \u00a0 Early Sunday morning I was half asleep as I helped Rhema in the bathroom. My plan was to stash her in her room and race back to bed. But then Hope popped out and begged me to let Rhema come into her room. I hesitated, thinking of the many ways it could all\u00a0go wrong. Fast. Rhema\u2019s room is Rhema-proofed. Hope\u2019s room is not. Any number of things could get broken. Or Rhema might \u201cescape\u201d Hope\u2019s room and be left unattended for a period of time. I remembered a recent conversation with Hope at the playground. A fun time for Hope, by definition,  must  include friends. And that day she was lonely,\u00a0lamenting the fact that she didn\u2019t have anyone to play with. I\u2019d told her to remember that she has her sister as a friend, she always has someone to play with. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cRhema just runs away.\u201d I have two children. Sometimes it seems like I have two only children. I\u2019d stooped down and gazed into her eyes, loved her long eyelashes.\u00a0 \u201cI know it\u2019s not the same. But keep trying, ok? Rhema might want to play with you just as much as you want to play with her.\u201d So on an early Sunday morning, looking again into those pleading eyes, I agreed to leave the two of them alone in Hope\u2019s room. Rhema has grown and matured in so many ways. As has Hope. We\u2019re able to do and try more things, things\u00a0that would have seemed impossible just a year ago. I\u2019m thankful that even just the trying is possible now. As I crawled under the covers, I whispered the arrangement to Brandon. And then neither of us could sleep. I was tempted to go in and confirm that Rhema wasn\u2019t swinging on the light fixture, and I wanted to remind Hope not to be too bossy, and I thought maybe I should go help them play. Then I thought of my own sisters and the hours and years of our perfectly imperfect unforgettable wonderful childhood play. And I knew I should just let my girls work it out. Let them be. Let them be sisters. We smiled and chuckled as we listened to the sounds of our children, playing together. Their own sister way. There was the comfortable harmony of Hope\u2019s ceaseless chatter and Rhema\u2019s self-singing. There was, \u00a0\u201cRhema? Wanna play dress up?\u201d And then, amazingly, the sound of Hope coaxing Rhema into full Cinderella garb. \u201cArms in. Now stand up\u2026 turn around. Hooray!!!\u201d Because for her, for her sister, Rhema will wear an itchy\u00a0princess dress. There was jumping on the bed. There was laughter \u2013 perhaps they laughed at different things \u2013 but they laughed together. There was the joy of answers to\u00a0prayers I didn\u2019t even realize\u00a0I was praying.

But I was feeling ambitious, daredevil-ish, killing two birds with one stone and all that jazz. The second we got there my Rhema-girl\u00a0turned into a\u00a0skittish pony, ready to kick and bolt. Taking the temp, standing on the scale, putting on the blood pressure cuff? Not. happening.\u00a0in. a. million. years.\u00a0 So she sat in a chair with her iTouch and sobbed and wailed while the doctor conducted Hope\u2019s physical. It was a chaotic scene. Doctor: \u00a0How\u2019s Hope\u2019s asthma these days? Hope: Dr. W., what\u2019s that thing called that you use to look in my ears?\u201d Rhema: Sccrreeeeeeeeeccccchhhhhhhh!!!! Me: \u00a0Pretty good. Doctor: Is she still taking the Flovent twice a day? Hope: Dr. W., why did God make ears? Rhema: (Snotty sobbing) Me: Yes. Doctor: Do you need any refills? Hope: Can I wear your stethoscope? Can I listen to your heart? Is your heart bigger or smaller than the Easter Bunny\u2019s? Me: Hope, stop jumping on the table. Rhema: Eeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!! Me: No. Hope: Can I have 10 stickers??? And that\u2019s when Rhema bolted out the door. I followed close behind as we weaved through a maze of corridors. I tried taking her hand and coaxing her back to the office. But she wanted  out. \u00a0We got\u00a0lost as she speed-walked down various hallways looking\u00a0 (I assume) for the exit. She found the medical records room instead.  Uh oh . I reached for her just as she dove under a rolling table stacked with files. The table tipped over and the files crashed to the floor. Quickly I stood the table up.\u00a0 A woman in the records room, none too pleased,\u00a0helped me pick up the files. Rhema was already halfway down the hall. At one point she collapsed into a heap on the floor and would not budge. I rubbed her back, urged her to walk with me. Then, minutes later she was up and running again. I could hear Hope calling me. My sweet Hope \u2013 I\u2019d just left her with the doctor. We turned a corner and there they were \u2013 Hope, the doctor and a nurse standing in the hallway. But Rhema didn\u2019t stop \u2013 she ran right past them. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d I called. It took 10 minutes for Rhema to calm, and another 5 before she allowed me to lead her back. \u201cCome on, sweet girl. Let\u2019s go get Hope. Then we\u2019ll go home. I promise.\u201d  \u00a0I said it over and over, not knowing if she even understood me. By the time we found Hope I was thoroughly ruffled, discouraged and embarrassed. I had expected Rhema to do so much better at the appointment. I felt horrible for just leaving Hope behind \u2013 something I\u2019ve had to do one more than one occasion \u2013 when Rhema\u2019s safety seemed more at stake. Many people witnessed me trying to soothe, coax and lead Rhema \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 I looked like I had absolutely no control. I felt silly for the tears of frustration threatening to spill. With my one free hand I took Hope. Rhema was already getting upset again and pulling me away. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said apologetically to the doctor.\u00a0The doctor did not know me well, but had surely seen me frazzled and overwhelmed before. He quickly handed me some paperwork which I stuffed under my arm. \u201cI just want to tell you I admire your patience. You\u2019re a great mom, and I think you\u2019re doing a wonderful job with these girls.\u201d At first I wanted to laugh that he could say that to me in light of our mega-fail afternoon. Wonderful job? It was the exact  opposite  of what I\u2019d been thinking. And then I thought I might cry. You know how it is \u2013 when sometimes, on a tough day, a simple kind word or deed \u2013 is all it takes to undo you. It\u2019s all you need to keep going. \u00a0. * This particular doctor\u2019s visit actually happened last fall. But I will not forget how how his words helped me bravely hold my girls\u2019 hands and lift my head a little higher. How often we think we\u2019re botching the whole motherhood thing up, but maybe someone else sees the love, the glory in our mess. It reminds me of something another desperate mother named  Hagar \u00a0called God after His words comforted her. She said, \u201cEl Roi.

{"date": "June 12, 2012", "body": "We\u2019ve been off the leads for a while, but the 25 gluey electrodes are coming for Rhema\u2019s head again. It\u2019s EEG time. For those who may not know, Rhema was diagnosed with a rare seizure disorder at age 2. Landua Kleffner Syndrome is notoriously hard to treat, and Rhema has endured numerous hospital stays for long-term monitoring, countless EEGs and a myriad of anti-epileptic medications. Last year it was determined that she was not improving on a high dose diazepam protocol. In fact, her EEGs were getting worse with tests showing her brain spiking  58 times a minute . We decided along with her neurologist to take her off all anti-seizure meds and just see what happened. What happened was God\u2019s amazing grace. Instead of regressing, Rhema has made tremendous gains this past year \u2013 emotionally, socially and academically. Perhaps more importantly she\u2019s been able to  retain  what she\u2019s learned \u2013 that has not always been the case. \u00a0Many children with LKS suffer seizures during sleep. But she has had more nights of great sleep than ever before \u2013 a huge cause for rejoicing in our household! There have been very few outward signs of seizures of any kind. For a whole year! Gone is the girl in a fog. So, friends, my prayers as we head into this 24-hour EEG: 1)\u00a0 That the technologist, Brandon, Rhema and I all survive the 90-minute EEG hook-up. It\u2019s at least a 3-person job. Even though she\u2019s been through it many times, Rhema gets so upset and scared \u2013 she fights us with everything\u2019s she got. When she\u2019s frightened she turns into the Incredible Hulk and can break out of those straight-jacket papoose things no problemo. Once a technologist nearly gave up mid-way through applying the leads and asked me to try another hospital. Today I plan to bring cupcakes for the EEG team, oh yes I do. But it\u2019s torture for my girl. The glue, the vacuum, the gauze, the sights and sounds, the lying down, the handling of her head. Torture. I\u2019ve tried talking her through it, singing to her, kissing her hot cheeks, never knowing if I\u2019m helping or hurting. I just hope she feels a little comfort knowing I\u2019m there. 2)\u00a0 That we would get a good result. We desperately want to avoid another cycle of endless EEGs and drug trials. .\u00a0 \u00a0 It dawned on me while writing this that I\u2019ve never really asked for prayer outright on this blog. People have just prayed for us without me \u00a0even asking. So many children and families have touched my heart through blogging; I\u2019m praying with you, too. So comforting to know we can lift even the simplest concerns to the Father, and He hears.

{"date": "June 17, 2012", "body": "When I had my own babies, something tugged at me like an undertow, to know and be known by my own father. I could count on one hand the number of times I\u2019d seen him in my life, all as a child really. And I wanted a do-over, the chance to take a photograph of him with my mind, hear his voice, see in him what\u2019s in me. I wanted to\u00a0tell\u00a0him about everything I\u2019ve seen and done, and for him to see how God has blessed my life with the most generous man, my husband, and my greatest treasures, my daughters. Unexpectedly, there came the opening for a relationship. And then just as quickly the opportunity was lost as I learned things I did not want to know. A political scandal. A very public trial. I read about him, saw his face, heard his voice more than I ever thought possible. Only it was through press clippings and news stories. Surreal. And days before Father\u2019s Day, off he went to jail. He has always been beyond my reach. I sat one night trying to figure out how to not feel fatherless. How to sort through the sense of loss again, the disappointment, anger, loneliness, compassion, aimlessness and shame. My  Daddy , the one who took me as his own and raised me with my beautiful mother\u2026 he used to strum a toy guitar and sing \u201cDance, Neally, dance\u201d until I spun myself dizzy. The one who recited Greek verbs with me as he drove me back to college on weekends. The one who bought me a breast pump when Rhema was born and with a smirk on his face gave me pointers he\u2019d\u00a0learned from a lactation consultant on how to use it. The one who gave me a secure, happy childhood for which I am eternally thankful \u00a0\u2013 he\u2019s the one who taught me you are never without your Father. He told us kids, people will fail you. You will fail you. But your Abba Father, your Rock, will never leave you, never forsake you. He holds all this world with His Word, and yet He\u00a0pursues you and longs for relationship with you. He calls you His own. He covers you with His wing, He clothes you in grace. He loves you with an everlasting love, a\u00a0love that can reach wherever you are. Run to Him, He runs to you. (Well, he didn\u2019t say it quite in those words. Like me, he never really knew his biological father. But he knows his Father, and he\u2019s dedicated his life to telling others about Him.) Needing to connect with him, I texted my Dad. Like a little girl again,\u00a0I just wrote, \u201cThank you for being my Daddy.\u201d The words meant,  Thank you for wanting me.

{"date": "June 14, 2012", "body": "Armed with a plate of \u201cthank you\u201d brownies and the prayers of many friends we walked onto a Children\u2019s Hospital campus for Rhema\u2019s EEG on Tuesday. Compared to the risky life-saving surgeries involving major organs performed every day at Children\u2019s, an EEG is a uncomplicated, relatively pain-free procedure. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. (And I am grateful that all Rhema needs is an EEG now and then.) Still, I cannot begin to express how much it meant to know that people would care about a little girl and her little EEG. How did it go? My description here will surely fall short, but I want to try and share it. I learned to pray 30 some years ago to the God of gods, yet I am still absolutely amazed by the power of prayer, how He hears, how He moves. So. It was HORRIBLE. The minute we entered the room my child L.O.S.T. it. Screaming, clawing, fighting \u2013 it was primal. It took four people \u2013 after several failed attempts \u2013 just to get her on the bed. I was sure we\u2019d never get through it, and I was sure there were not enough brownies in the world to make up for it. Somehow with all hands on deck we managed to wrap her body in sheets, and then Velcro her into the papoose so that only her head and feet were sticking out. Even wrapped in the papoose Brandon and I had to hold her down with the full weight of our bodies. Rhema in a papoose a few years ago. All the while she screamed and rocked her head back and forth. The problem with this\u00a0is you\u00a0need to hold your head still\u00a0while it gets measured and marked and then the 36 leads applied (and I thought it was only 25!).\u00a0Further complicating things\u00a0is Rhema\u2019s hair. Have you seen it? It\u2019s the thickest, curliest stuff around. Getting to her scalp is like\u00a0digging\u00a0for a ring in\u00a0beach sand. We tried calming her with music\u2026 we tried a DVD\u2026 we tried sips of juice. All to no avail. So Brandon had to force her head still, and then she bit him really good and the technologist wanted to call a nurse to attend to  him. About an hour into it we hadn\u2019t made much progress. She was screaming and writhing and sweating so much that the colored markings (the measurements) that the technologist made on\u00a0her head faded away before the electrodes could be placed. My poor girl. And B and I were both trying to contain our emotions and he started questioning everything like what is the purpose of this, really? And inside I was getting mad at him for questioning  anything.  \u00a0And I knew people had/were praying for us but we were not doing well at all. And Hope was sitting against a wall, refusing to look, trying to block it all out. And then B was questioning why did we bring Hope in here\u2026? And then God showed up. That\u2019s probably not theologically correct. God is always there. But\u00a0it\u2019s the only way I can say it. There was a shift. We literally felt it. Rhema calmed. I kinda had a vision for my prayer for sweet Rhema. That God\u2019s Spirit, His Spirit of Peace, would rush through her body like a wall of wind\u2026reaching her right down to the cellular level\u2026.!!!\u2026. and she would be overcome by calm, stillness, His Peace. \n ~E-mail from Lori \n . \n Prayers needed for our sweet, incredible-hulk-of-a-girl and her superhero family. \n ~FB post by Judith yesterday (with responses of \u201cPraying!\u201d from people I\u2019ve never met) \n . \n I am praying\u2026 that you will see God in every face, in every hand, in every moment, doing what is best for you and for your sweet Rhema. \n ~Jett Wren \n . \n Praying for you right now and throughout the day. Go Rhema\u2026.you can do this girl. May God\u2019s hands cover this appointment with His awesome power. \n ~Crystal \n . \n I just prayed that God will comfort Rhema through this whole process \u2013 that he will give her peace and help her to understand that he is holding her and caring for her. I just prayed that God will give you and and Brandon and the hospital staff guidance and patience as the leads are being placed. I will continue to pray for you all today. \n ~Beth \n . \n The first time my son (on the autism spectrum) went to the dentist, he was so frightened by the experience that we couldn\u2019t get another dentist to take him for four years. My daughter\u2019s dentist met him at a time when I was desperately researching special needs pediatric dentists, and pleaded with us to let her try. He went in and sat for an entire office visit \u2013 x-rays and a full cleaning, with the aid of a small amount of understanding and show and tell from the dentist. When it was his time, it was his time. May this be Rhema\u2019s time. \n ~Michele She stopped fighting. She stopped crying. She stopped screaming. She merely whimpered here and there. She let me stroke her feet. A peace settled over her, and she gave into it. And then it seemed like the time passed quickly, and we were done. She kept every lead on her head for 24 hours without incident. In the car in the parking lot, we prayed again. We were physically and emotionally exhausted. Just sad. So sad\u00a0for our little girl, that she has to go through this. It takes a toll on the heart. But we are also buoyed in our faith. And so blessed, encouraged, covered, carried, grateful for friends who lift us up. Thank you.

{"date": "June 22, 2012", "body": "The husband is away on military assignment for most of the summer. I posted the following photos on Facebook- Hope\u2019s attempt to keep her Daddy home: \u00a0 . One of the things I already miss are our late night conversations about the rugrats. Just before falling asleep we can\u2019t help but replay (and laugh all over again) at something funny Hope said. Or marvel at the small-but-huge something Rhema did for the first time. It\u2019s not lost on me \u2013 that this is a gift. That I have him to share with, all of this. Lately, as Rhema\u2019s been\u00a0having some hard days,\u00a0many of our discussions have centered on our concerns for Hope. What she sees and how she\u2019s processing and handling what she sees at the ripe old age of 5. She loves her sister so completely, she is always considering her, always celebrating her, she is willing to sacrifice for her without reservation. When Rhema is struggling \u2013 really struggling \u2013 my enthusiastic, talkative Hope usually copes by cocooning, turning inward, blocking out the sights and sounds. When I try to talk with her about it she is surprisingly very hard to read, seems to avoid the conversation. B and I wonder how she\u2019s really doing. I believe we have been careful and diligent in teaching Hope, and responsive to her needs, but at times I feel the nagging guilt. And we worry \u2013 as so many parents do \u2013 if we\u2019re missing something when all of our attention and energies are on Rhema. We ask again, Will she be o.k.? During the worst of Rhema\u2019s EEG hook-up last week, we were keenly aware of Hope huddled against the wall, but we could not help her. Brandon said something about wishing he could shield her somehow. She\u2019s always there \u2013 whether it\u2019s an earth-shattering tantrum on the playground or an ambulatory EEG or a Saturday morning speech therapy appointment \u2013 trying to carry it on her tiny shoulders best she can. The technician said, \u201cI know it must be hard. But I think these things make her stronger. Thank goodness for kids like Hope\u2026 they\u2019ve learned true compassion and empathy. \u201d We\u2019ve heard it before. We\u2019ve said it before: Our special needs children bring out the extraordinary in their siblings. But it was like salve on an open wound to hear it again, from the technician, someone sort of on the outside looking in. Recently I went to an art exhibit and ran into a woman I\u2019d seen before at Hope\u2019s school. We began talking and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re Hope\u2019s mom, right? Once a week I volunteer at recess.\u201d I knew that the woman did not know anything about Rhema. \u201cHope is\u2026\u201d She took a long, almost uncomfortable pause before she came up with the word she wanted. \u201c\u2026 nurturing.\u201d A smile spread through me and I nodded, instantly recognizing my Hope in the word. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying that. It\u2019s something unique,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe other day a kid on the playground was having a rough time. And I watched Hope stop what she was doing. She walked over and quietly held the child\u2019s hand. It struck me how sensitive and perceptive she was to this child.\u201d An  old prayer  came back to me: Will you, God, in spite of me, foster these gifts in her as she lives life with her sister? Will you keep her from becoming cynical, jaded and burnt out? Will she see her sister not as a bother or burden, but as valuable teacher and inspiration? Will you hold her during times of fear, frustration, embarassment or disappointment? Will you give her a deep bond with her sister \u2013 one that does not depend on spoken word or touch. Will you teach her to love without conditon and grow it in her, true and patient? Will you bless their relationship to last long after we are gone? \u00a0. I am so proud of who she is. And I\u00a0proud of\u00a0and inspired by so many amazing siblings in the special needs community. Not enough can be said about the way they touch the world with their hearts, kindness and wisdom. She not perfect, my Hope. But yeah, she\u2019s so better than o.k.

{"date": "October 8, 2012", "body": ". A couple weeks ago we visited a friend who has two adult daughters with autism. We\u2019d met on a few occasions over the years, but never had a chance to spend time together until this visit. Some describe themselves/their children as \u201clightly brushed\u201d with autism. When Rhema was younger I so wanted to believe that description fit her. I convinced myself and told others she was \u201cmild\u201d as if I were talking about salsa. But my visions of a small paintbrush gradually gave way to a large bucket of bold paint being dumped over her head. This realization was far more devastating and painful for me than the day she was diagnosed. There are times when I feel I cannot relate to some of the struggles of other autism mama\u2019s \u2013 our journeys seem so different. I looked forward to time with this new friend and her not-lightly-brushed daughters, knowing they could relate to our flavor of autism. We had a great time. It\u2019s a relief to be in a place where you really don\u2019t need to worry about a thing, because everyone really  gets  it. But there was a quiet thoughtfulness, maybe even heaviness? inside me, a sobering. And it stayed with me in the days that followed. I found myself reviewing my life, all my days up until it all changed forever when I became a mother. I wondered at God\u2019s plan, the unexpected. I began doing the thing that I try so hard not to do: \u00a0freaking out about the future \u2014 how does life work for my girl twenty years from now? Later my friend wrote that the visit had been bittersweet for her and guessed it was for me. She told me she identified with my many concerns for Rhema at 8 years old, and how she remembered the stress and uncertainty of those years. Her daughters are in their 20\u2019s now and she still has some of the same issues, but she believes that life is overall easier now than when they were 8. Then she wrote what my heart needed to hear, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little disconcerting to see that [my daughters\u2019] lives remain so circumspect. On the other hand, they\u2019re happy and well loved. And I hope that\u2019s reassuring.\u201d Happy and well loved , I thought of her words as I walked with Rhema, held her hand. In this moment God has given, her girls, my girls, they are happy and well loved. This moment works. This moment is enough. This moment is good. I don\u2019t know what tomorrow looks like, but I\u2019m learning to trust Him for all of her moments to come. Anyway, this friend, she knew.\u00a0Better than anyone\u00a0could know, she just knew.

{"date": "October 10, 2012", "body": "Because it\u2019s always something. =) Our latest challenge involves vomiting. Rhema\u2019s been known to\u00a0gag on her food and then throw up. She used to do this every once in a while. A couple months ago she ramped up to once a week. Now it\u2019s happening almost every day. And I must say, my girl puts the projectile in projectile vomit. The worst was when it happened at a friend\u2019s birthday party a few weeks ago. They had just finished singing Happy Birthday and were ready to pass out the cake when Rhema tossed her cookies\u2026 and the fifty cheese balls and fruit punch she had just consumed. She recently went to the doctor \u2013 she\u2019s not sick. It doesn\u2019t appear to be seizure related. It\u2019s reminiscent of her feeding disorder days, and we\u2019re trying to make her eat slowly and\u00a0cut up her food into small portions. I\u2019m also trying to determine if certain types of foods or textures are causing her to gag. No clear answers yet. In the meantime we\u2019ve been doing lots and lots of cleaning. Last night we all sat down to dinner and said grace. Not 2 minutes after we said Amen, Rhema gagged and hurled, covering our plates and the whole table in a vibrant spew. For a moment we didn\u2019t move. And then B and I, because by now we have definitely lost our minds, burst out laughing. (I really hope I lost 10 lbs because I didn\u2019t eat last night). I thought we\u2019d found and cleaned it all, but today at work when I dug in my purse I discovered a massive amount of day-old pink puke. Sniff. My girl is always with me!

But her speech is so limited and she often gazes off into the distance, and I usually underestimate her. I assume she\u2019s not paying attention. The following steps occur in my house pretty much every night: Round 1 \n Run the bath. \n Insert girls. \n Rhema poops. \n Hope screams. \n \u201cOk, get out girls.\u201d \n Clean the tub. \n Round 2 \n Run the bath. \n Insert girls. \n Etc\u2026 This has been going on for YEARS. Just as sure as the sun will set, my kid \u2013 unless she\u2019s constipated \u2013 will drop some fudge in the tub. Yes, I always sit her on the potty before the bath. But the cold, hard porcelain throne is no match for the liquid laxative \u2013 a nice, warm, bath. So last night while on Round 1 \u2013 Step 5, I was grumbling to myself about being a pooper scooper for the rest of my life. Rhema seemed completely oblivious, standing there dripping wet, humming to herself as usual. After cleaning the tub, I bathed them quickly. They wanted to stay in longer so I sat down on a stool with a good book. Soon Hope hit the drain, jumped out and grabbed her towel. Rhema likes to stay in until all the water has drained so I kept reading. Finally she got out and I toweled her dry. Then I sat down to read one more page. I barely noticed Rhema getting a couple of disposable wipes. She hesitated and leaned over the tub. Then she came over to me and pushed my hand toward the tub. \u201cAw Rhema. What is it? I\u2019m reading.\u201d She pushed my hand toward the tub again. I sighed and stood. Then I saw it. More poop in the tub! And Rhema showed me! I looked at her with surprise and delight. She handed me one of the wipes as if to say, \u201cC\u2019mon woman. Let\u2019s get this mess cleaned up!\u201d Oh, my girl! Sniff. Oops. Better not. Hooray for progress!!! \u00a0.

When a neuropsych confirmed that my daughter\u00a0had developmental delays, I\u00a0was not (at least, initially) devastated. Instead I was extremely hopeful. My only concern, really, was her speech and the fact that I would have to wait a while \u2013 a few months? a year? \u2013 to have a real conversation with her. Back then there was no doubt in my mind that by now she\u2019d be \u201call better.\u201d Recently, we\u2019ve been collecting letters from the experts/angels who have known and worked with her for years to give an honest evaluation of where she is today and what she needs. This, from a letter last week: \u201cRhema\u2019s language is prompted throughout all activities and with all conversational partners. Rhema\u2019s spontaneous one word speech is not only inconsistent but often inaudible\u2026\u201d No, today we are not anywhere near where I hoped we\u2019d be. And dear God it hurts to see the truth in black and white. And when I hear children talking and singing with ease and doing all the things that are still out of reach for us, sometimes I absolutely ache.\u00a0Though, always with hope. I once followed the blog of a mother as she watched her darling son suffer and deteriorate from a vicious disease, Krabbe Disease. All throughout the journey she and her family fasted and prayed fiercely for a miracle on earth \u2013 that never came. When her sweet boy lost his ability to walk, then his ability to see, then his ability to speak and swallow, her faith in God to heal did not waver. I\u2019ll never forget her words about hope \u2013 hope in God \u2013 in the wake of Judson\u2019s death. She said,  It did not disappoint. \u201cNot only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts\u2026\u201d ~Rom. 5:3-5 It was hope that strengthened her to walk the path of suffering with her son. It was hope that enabled her to give him over to the hands of Jesus. It is because of hope that their story, his legacy continues to touch and change people all over the world.* It is Christ, the hope of glory, that takes the brokenness and redeems it into\u00a0something so\u00a0beautiful\u2026 you can\u2019t even begin to tell it all. Out my window on the train this evening, the light was fading and the water was a silver mirror. On\u00a0the surface you could see the clouds rolling by, a rippling concert of praise. \u201cRhema is diagnosed with severe autism that significantly affects her ability to learn academic,\u00a0 language, and communication skills.\u201d I\u2019ll never stop, never regret hoping too much. . *Click -> here <- to see the\u00a0amazing hope in Judson\u2019s story.

Then I decided to dust off the  Insanity  DVD\u2019s my friend Laura loaned me and work out in the living room. So I could justify the three donuts and maybe a fourth. Hope said she wanted to be insane too so she grabbed her sneakers and a water bottle. Rhema hid behind the pillows on the couch. The video started and I was on my way to being in the best shape of my life. Hope crashed into me and warned me to look out for Lucy, her imaginary friend. Five seconds into high knees and keeping my core tight  I was about ready to die  Rhema ran over to me, smiling big. Her laughing eyes looked straight into mine and she held out her hands to me. Well. No one can resist those eyes. Or that smile. And when she initiates an interaction, reaches out to me, wants to play? I will stop and drink in every moment of connection with my girl. While the skinny chicks on the video did tuck jumps and worked on their obliques, we did 9 reps of Ring Around the Rosie. Then I walked giggling Rhema back to the couch and returned to my workout just in time for a new exercise. I got into my low plank position\u2026 (you know the position for push-ups and stuff). But the dude on the video expected me to do push-up  jacks  which is a push up and a jumping jack combined into one which is\u2026 impossible. I was sweating just imagining it. That\u2019s when Rhema came over and sat on my back.  Giddyup . I dropped to the floor and laid there for about 10 minutes. Then I got Rhema off my back (ha!) and walked her back to the couch. It was time for \u201cinsane abs\u201d and I really felt like I should do that part. I followed the instructions to assume a C-sit position. I sat down, leaned back and curved myself into C. Hope, ever so helpful, declared I looked like an L, not a C. I was doing\u00a0the ab-twists-while-lifting-alternating-knees routine when all 60 pounds of my 8.5 year old \u00a0came over and sat in my lap, making ab-twists-while-lifting-alternating-knees unfeasible. She looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to begin singing nursery rhymes. It\u2019s what we do. And so I did. My heart jumping and twisting and high-kneeing.

And run for it!\u201d Hebrews 12:13, The Message . I wanted to share some of the ways we have been blessed by thoughtful, meaningful help in the past weeks. Remember the problem of Rhema  eating her shirts ? Well, immediately upon hearing about it my mother ordered a clip-on chewy tube for her. We hoped that this was the answer. Rhema would get the sensory stimulation she needed, chew to her heart\u2019s content\u2026 and her shirts would live to see another day. When\u00a0the chewy tube arrived in the mail, I clipped it on. \u201cLook Rhema! Look what Nana sent you!\u201d \u201cYou can chew it, Rhema!\u201d Hope and I waited eagerly for Rhema to chow down. She picked it up and curiously twirled it between her fingers. She flapped it. She sniffed it. She hummed and rolled it slowly, lovingly back and forth across her cheeks. When Hope could stand it no longer she\u00a0put the chewy tube to Rhema\u2019s lips. Rhema was horrified and bounced off. And so it goes. She wears her friend Chewy almost every day. But has never, ever chewed Chewy. \u00a0Nor has she eaten a single shirt since. Or, well, I should say, if I forget to put Chewy on then she chews her clothes. But if Chewy is there\u2026 she chews nothing. Works for me! \u00a0. The girls\u2019\u00a0other grandmother was visiting a couple weeks ago. She came to church with us and witnessed Rhema\u2019s obsession with coloring as many church bulletins as possible. Right now, continuously feeding her paper to color is the only way to keep her somewhat quiet and occupied during the service. Rhema is absolutely franctic about her coloring and if we run out of paper, well, someone will lose an arm. I love my mother-in-law. She just has this way of quietly making things better for everyone around her. She\u2019s inventive and creative and\u00a0does not want attention or praise, yet she does\u00a0a hundred\u00a0little things every day to serve and love her family. She bought white paper and brightly colored paper and made a huge stack coloring books for Rhema. She hole-punched them and bound them with yarn. Knowing Rhema is fond of vibrant colors she got her Crayola Slick Stix to decorate the books. Needless to say, Rhema (and Hope) LOVE these homemade Sunday coloring books. And our church no longer need wonder where all the bulletins went! . So there\u2019s another thing about church. We always sit in a small pew, in the second to last row, near the door so that we can make a fast getaway when the need arises. I think it can be overwhelming for Rhema still \u2013 all the people, the sights and sounds \u2013 but her seat, her pew, is predictable and comforting. In the past, if we\u2019ve arrived and people were already sitting in \u201cour\u201d pew, Rhema has attempted to sit  on  them. When we re-direct her to another pew, she\u2019s completely thrown. She\u2019s even cried. This morning before church, B and I had a brief conversation about where we\u2019d go if the pew was already occupied. We had a plan.

{"date": "February 4, 2013", "body": "We moved into our current home two years ago, but we have yet to hang any pictures on the walls. As a military family it\u2019s hard to ever really feel settled. The husband recently received notice of pending PCS orders. Permanent change of station. It\u2019s time to move (again). And again we have begun the process of what Brandon calls negotiating and what I call fighting with the Army. We strongly believe we need to stay right here. We believe it so much that Brandon was  willing to take on a dangerous mission  in Iraq because it meant our family could stay in place. Upon his return, he continued to make sacrifices that would enable us to remain here. It\u2019s hard for some to understand that it takes years of searching and advocating and tweaking and shifting to create a combination of programs, teachers, doctors and therapies that work for your special child. And that it\u2019s amazing when you actually succeed. It\u2019s hard for some to understand when your daughter is severely impacted by autism and has a rare, hard-to-treat seizure disorder how important it is to have doctors and teachers who know her history because they have lived it with her. It\u2019s hard for some to understand what it means for a mother to know that at the end of the day, good or bad, her child had the best chances to grow and learn. It\u2019s hard for some to grasp how unspeakably detrimental it would be\u00a0for a child who desperately needs routine and predictability to be uprooted from the home, school and community she knows and loves. I\u2019m so proud and grateful for my husband\u2019s service to our country. With four years left until retirement, we are praying for big things. That he will not have to deploy this year, that we can keep our family together, that we can stay here. Rhema has this thing she does when she wants something. It comes from years of therapy \u2013 creating scenarios that prevent her from obtaining items on her own and forcing her to seek us out and make a request, using PECs or the communication app on her iPad or (hopefully one day) spoken language. As a result she rarely helps herself to anything (with the exception of the lemonade in the church fellowship hall). She always \u201casks\u201d first. She just puts it \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 in your hands. I\u2019ll be doing my thing \u2013 cooking, making a phone call, going to the bathroom \u2013 and she will come and dump a box of popsicles in my hand. She does this to guests and strangers alike. A friend was visiting and Rhema, without a word, put a bottle of ketchup in her hand. My friend was confused and I laughed and explained that Rhema wanted ketchup. (I quickly made her some fries to go with her ketchup). She has great difficulty communicating the way most of us do, but she trusts. She doesn\u2019t always get what she wants, but she trusts enough to relinquish into our hands the very thing she desires. She knows we will withhold no good thing from her. (Ps. 84:11) Lord, these things I\u2019m holding\u2026 my family, this home,\u00a0this life\u00a0here, my hopes,\u00a0the future and all that has been in my life until now.

{"date": "February 18, 2013", "body": "Last week the husband and I reached 14 years of marriage. I\u2019ve wanted to write something, but I\u2019ve struggled with the words. In the past I have botched my marriage so badly that I often feel I don\u2019t have a right to say anything about marriage. Our precious friends Lance and Lori shared a bit of their story at church and reminded me that there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect marriage, and God can redeem anything. Years ago (before kids) we were stationed in Arizona and Brandon was at military intelligence school. He called me at work one day and told me that he would be bringing a Major from the Yemen Army home with him for dinner.  What?! I rushed home and prepared an elaborate meal. I was quite pleased with myself given the short notice. Brandon and the Yemeni officer arrived and we ate. Dinner was great and if my mother had been there she would have said, \u201cGirl, you put your foot in it!\u201d (That is the highest compliment you can give a cook, I promise.) At the end of the meal I told our guest that we would have to have him over again soon. I, a bundle of false humility, explained that the meal had not been my best. After all I had not had much time to prepare\u2026 I expected assurances that I was da bomb cook, but he looked at his plate critically as if he were Tom Colicchio. He finally sighed and said in his thick accent, \u201cI give you \u2018nother chance.\u201d After he left Brandon and I howled with laughter. It\u2019s a family joke to this day. \u201cWhat we believe about God determines the quality of our marriage.\u201d \n~ Dave Harvey Our story is no romance novel. It\u2019s swung from high to low and back again and been marked by years of struggle, disagreements, laughter, loneliness, joy, and deep hurt. It boggles my mind (and also makes perfect sense) that God uses this \u2013  marriage \u2013  as his showcase of Christ\u2019s love for us, all of us. The gospel truth is that we fail. That we hurt His heart. That He bears it all. That He forgives. That He will never, ever leave. I\u2019m so thankful Brandon believed this about God. At a point when we could have been called irreparable, when I was not the wife he even recognized anymore, he believed enough in that stubborn grace of God to reach out a hand to me:  \u201cI give you \u2018nother chance. Will you give me \u2018nother chance, too?\u201d \u201cAbove all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.\u201d ~Psalm 4:8 \n We\u2019re learning. We get to practice every day \u2013 even when our \u201cbest\u201d tastes supremely bad \u2013 how to be grace-givers. And even though I am not good, God\u2019s goodness comes to me. Most sweetly and completely in the form of my dear husband. * From  http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/ \n \n \n \n How the Gospel Can Transform a Marriage \n \n Gary and Betsy Ricuchi,  Love That Lasts: When Marriage Meets Grace  (Crossway, 2006), pp. 22-23: \n \n Because of the gospel,  Christians have become new creations ( 2 Corinthians 5:17 ) . Therefore, in our marriage, our past does not define us, confine us, or determine our future. \n Because of the gospel,  we are forgiven ( Ephesians 1:7 ) . Therefore we can live free of all guilt and condemnation for every sin, and we can trust that God, in his mercy, will be gracious to us. \n Because of the gospel,  we can forgive, just as Christ forgave us ( Ephesians 4:32 ) . Nothing done against us compares to our sin against God. Therefore all offenses, hostility, and bitterness between Christians can be completely forgiven and removed. \n Because of the gospel,  we are accepted by God ( Romans 15:7 ) . Therefore we are not dependent on a spouse for who we are or what we need. \n Because of the gospel,  sin\u2019s ruling power over us is broken ( Romans 6:6 ,   14 ) . Therefore we can truly obey all that God calls us to do in our marriage, regardless of any circumstance or situation. \n Because of the gospel,  we have access to God through Christ  ( Hebrews 4:14-16 ). Therefore we can at any time take any need in our marriage to the One who can do all things. \n Because of the gospel,  we have hope ( Romans 5:1-4 ) . Therefore we can endure any marital difficulty, hardship, or suffering, with the assurance that God is working all to our greatest good ( Romans 8:28 ). \n Because of the gospel,  Christ dwells in us by his Holy Spirit ( Galatians 3:13-14 ) . Therefore we are confident that God is always with us and is always at work in our marriage, even when progress is imperceptible ( 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 ). \n Because of the gospel,  we have power to fight and overcome remaining sin, which continues to dwell and war within us ( Romans 7:19-21 ,   24-25 ;   Galatians 5:16-17 ) . \n \n These are just a few of the ways the gospel can transform a marriage. Sometimes it\u2019s not easy to live in the reality of these truths. But it is always possible\u2014and not because of our strength or determination, but because of God\u2019s empowering and enabling grace. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/When-Sinners-Say-Do-Discovering/dp/0976758261", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/bandj.jpg", "http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/", "http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2011/01/12/how-the-gospel-can-transform-a-marriage/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581347820/bettwowor-20", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Corinthians%205.17", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%201.7", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%204.32", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%2015.7", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%206.6", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%206.14", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Hebrews%204.14-16", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%205.1-4", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%208.28", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Galatians%203.13-14", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Thessalonians%205.23-24", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%207.19-21", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%207.24-25", "http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Galatians%205.16-17"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/my-anniversary-grace-and-a-yemen-officer/", "title": "My anniversary, Grace, and a Yemen\u00a0officer"},

She had to go through two rounds of chelation, and she had lab work\u00a0done every couple weeks for many months. That whole experience solidified her position on blood draws: She. No. Likey. So when the phlebotomist called us in, I settled into the chair-o-torture and pulled Rhema onto my lap. I smiled sweetly at the phlebotomist and asked her to call for backup.

Throw some autism in the mix, and, well\u2026 These days if we can manage a day trip away from home, in which we go and come back alive, that\u2019s vacation! Last week I scoured the Internet and thought long about what we could handle for a family vacation; ever mindful of Hope and\u00a0not wanting her to miss out on\u00a0anything and\u00a0ever mindful of Rhema\u00a0and what would\u00a0be\u00a0best/easiest/enjoyable for her. Sadly, it\u2019s a rare thing lately to see Rhema really having a good time \u2013 the anxiety, the unfamiliar, the sensory onslaught sucks the fun right out. We settled on York\u2019s Wild Kingdom in Maine (thanks for the suggestion, Lo!) which featured a \u00a0 zoo\u00a0= good for Hope, bad for Rhema \n+\u00a0 small amusement park = good for both. Except, of course the fact that the park opened a whole two hours after the zoo opened and heaven forbid we had to wait in line for rides\u00a0= bad, bad. The next day we took the kids to a mini-golf course. When we got there and saw the course \u2013 the water, the open green, the people \u2013 we thought,\u00a0very, very\u00a0bad. B and I sat in the car for a good 15 minutes trying to figure out what to do. Should I drive away with Rhema, while he and Hope did mini-golf? No, this is a family thing. Should we all just leave? No, Hope\u2019s sooo excited. But what if Rhema pees on Hole 13? (She\u2019s going through a regression in toilet-training). In the end, we decided to try anyway, and I wished everyone putt-putting could know how much courage it took for us just to be there. I\u2019ll spare the gory details, but both ventures \u2013 the zoo park and the mini-golf \u2013 ended in what could easily be described as disasters. There were some ugly, frustrating, discouraging moments. At the end of the day, during our nightly family prayer, B sighed, \u201cWe did the best we could do today, Lord.\u201d When I look over the pictures of our disaster vacation, I see Hope soaking in everything, not wasting a minute, full and spilling joy and life. Her happiness is satisfying; makes me think I\u2019m doing right by her. I see Rhema, in her sweet practical, no-nonsense way, picking up the golf balls and putting them in the hole. Why in the world would you waste time with a club, people? I see her lasting for 5 holes on the course. That\u2019s not nothing. I see my girls getting to spend summer days with their dad \u2013 finally, after\u00a0several summers apart. I see us crafting a beautiful mess of memories.

During Hope\u2019s swimming lesson each week, I take Rhema to the \u201cFamily Swim\u201d side of the pool and we play there until Hope is finished.\u00a0 Last week it worked out that Brandon was able to stay home with Rhema, while I took Hope to her lesson. We drove to the Y. We walked through the parking lot. We went into the girls locker room and put on her bathing suit. I sat on the bleachers and smiled and chatted with other moms while she had her lesson. I read a few pages on my Kindle. After her lesson, she changed in the dressing room. We walked out to the car and drove home. It was so simple. I wasn\u2019t on high-alert like a Secret Service agent, scanning our surroundings for potential problems. I didn\u2019t worry for a second about my offspring pooping in the water. I didn\u2019t spend any time strategizing how to transition from the pool to the locker room. Without autism, it was all so amazingly easy. The week prior Rhema had a potty accident in the shower in the locker room. \u201cPotty accident\u201d is putting it mildly. The brown stuff was sliding out of her suit and down her legs. Wanting to hide (and spare the employee who would have to sanitize the place) I found myself grabbing scoops of poop with soggy toilet paper from the shower floor and running it to a toilet. While my Rhema stood there silent, frozen, helpless in a locker room packed with kids and mothers coming in from swimming lessons. Even now I feel like I\u2019m betraying her for writing it out loud. But I also need to be ok with saying this is hard; and sometimes \u201cnormal\u201d looks and seems so\u2026 not hard. I know they are just feelings \u2013 the wistful longing, the guilt, even the envy. \u00a0Feelings I can lay at the feet of Jesus and say I don\u2019t know what to do with these! I know God will whisper to my heart once again: I have blessed you and entrusted you with a very precious, very special one. And you get to spend your life pouring yourself out for her. It\u2019s not easy or glamorous or even acknowledged, but when you serve her \u2013 when you get up with her in the middle of the night, when you clean her poop, when you drive her to speech therapy every Saturday, when you go to great lengths to keep her safe and help her grow \u2013 you serve me! So do it in gladness and patience, and I will be your help. Many years ago the Chaplain at our church wanted to express his love and appreciation to all of us, so he said, \u2018If they lined up all the congregations and stretched them across the sky\u2026\u2019 \u00a0He paused for effect, \u2018I\u2019d. still. pick. you.!\u2019 It was heartfelt. But it came out sounding rather corny and like a backhanded compliment. B and I still laugh about it to this day.

She took my arm and drew me through the door, her eyes never leaving mine. Brandon and Hope were there observing the whole exchange. \u201cB,\u201d I whispered. \u201cDo you see this? She wants me to stay. She misses me!\u201d He nodded. It was the first time I could remember her ever expressing an opinion about my coming or going. Still holding on to me, she closed the door with her free hand as if to say  you\u2019re staying here, woman.  Be still my heart. I knew I would\u00a0 go wherever she wanted to take me. The stores could close, the seasons could change, the Red Sox could actually win, but nothing could pull me away from her, from the moment. That\u2019s when she led me to the refrigerator. And gently, yet firmly, put my hand on the door handle. \u00a0 I heard the record scratching sound effect and, in the background, Brandon guffawing. And then I laughed and couldn\u2019t stop.

Thank you.\u201d We hang up and I feel a weight lift off my shoulders. These results mean we don\u2019t have to put her in the hospital for long term monitoring. We don\u2019t have to do another EEG right away. We\u2019re not in a situation where we absolutely need to put her on anti-convulsants. In fact it seems she\u2019s improving without them.

I\u2019m so thankful you asked. When people ask, I usually just cop out. I smile and say, \u201cShe\u2019s fine\u201d or \u201cPretty good.\u201d I want to do better than that. But where do I begin? Do you want the long or short? Would you like to hear an awesomely gross story? I\u2019ve got plenty! Should I tell you about our latest challenges? But I want you to hear about all the good stuff. There\u2019s plenty of that, too! And then I thought I was taking too long to answer you. So that\u2019s why I just blurted, \u201cShe dipped her tater tots in ketchup!!!!\u201d And I\u2019m not even sure I can tell you in behavioral analyst terms why that is so absolutely awesome. I just know that a bunch of years ago she had a feeding disorder and she could not stand two different textures in her mouth at once. Still pretty much can\u2019t. And tater tots and ketchup have been on her \u201cI Loathe This!\u201d list for years. But one day she started putting her finger in Hope\u2019s ketchup and painting the table and her pants with it. Then one day\u2026 whilst painting\u2026 she accidentally  tasted  the ketchup. Then she was obsessed with just eating gobs of ketchup. And then one day I guided her hand to pick up a tot and dip it in the ketchup. So many things, it seems, we need to show her. Often in small steps over long periods. It\u2019s just not intuitive for her. But we love teaching her and showing her new things; most of the time she is a willing learner. But anyway, she seemed offended by it for some time \u2013 this dipping food in ketchup. Sometimes\u00a0she would stick her finger in the ketchup and paint a tater tot. But finally she did it! She dipped her tot and then she  ate  it!!!! It\u2019s such a simple, typical thing, I know. Things are not always so simple and typical for my girl. Rejoicing in her accomplishments sure is gooood.

My sisters would often tease, quoting Jo\u2019s sisters from Little Women, \u201cYour hair!\u2026 Your one beauty!\u201d Where I lived it was kind of rare for an African American girl to have long hair, and people often noticed my sisters and me because of our hair. Men and women alike advised me to never cut my hair. I thought I must be the Black Rapunzel. I internalized the idea that if you have \u201cgood hair\u201d, you just don\u2019t cut it. Rhema\u2019s hair is also\u2026 \u201c rare \u201d. Her thick curls turn into knots before my eyes. Washing and brushing her hair often turns into a small war. And when she gets upset she will often eat her hair. I didn\u2019t know you could eat your hair until I met Rhema. You totally can. And lemme tell you, it causes some problems coming out the other end. For months I fretted over her hair. I knew I should cut it short, but couldn\u2019t bear to do it. It also bothered me that I didn\u2019t know how she felt about the whole thing. Maybe she liked her hair long. Maybe she could care less. I tried to talk to her about it, but she showed no understanding of my words at all. I felt sad that she could not have her say. When I learned of my upcoming surgery and the long recovery period, I knew it was time. I began searching for a beautician who would be up for the haircut challenge. I remembered an African American hair stylist named C I\u2019d met a couple years ago \u2013 she had a young son with special needs. I contacted her and explained my situation. I told her that Rhema would not tolerate sitting in the chair for long or getting her hair washed in a strange place, that the blow dryers might set her off. I asked her if we could come at closing time when there\u2019d be fewer people. I told her that it all might go downhill really fast. She said, \u201cHoney, come on over.\u201d We arrived at the salon armed with her iTouch, snacks and bubbles. Amazingly, Rhema did very well except for when they tried to put a cape around her neck. Poor C almost lost her arm when she tried that. C sprayed her hair with water and she and I and another stylist worked together to comb the tangles out. Then I knelt in front of Rhema and tried to keep her engaged with me while C began working the scissors. Even she was hesitant. An older woman watching from her chair exclaimed, \u201cWhy they cuttin\u2019 the baby\u2019s hair? Why they cuttin\u2019 the baby\u2019s hair??\u201d I stayed focused on the face of my girl as she changed before me. We felt light and free as my insecurities and her abundant locks fell away. Silly me. I got a little teary-eyed when it was done. \u201cThere she is.\u201d Like the sunny day at a carnival long ago when a man stuck white rolled paper in a metal vat and went round and round until out came the most deliciously pink cloud of cotton candy, there she is. .

{"date": "September 5, 2012", "body": ". Recently I\u2019ve caught glimpses of my young girl dealing with frustration, remorse, disappointment in herself and her body. Though we cannot communicate in words, I see a child who deeply wants to be with her family, desires to do well in public, desperately wants to control her body and emotions, but she cannot. She lashes out, she grabs, she cowers, she flops, she fights. \u201cI do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.\u201d Romans 7:15 It\u2019s sad to see this awareness of failure in her, the momentary defeat in her big brown eyes. It triggers a pain I know all too well; how much time I\u2019ve spent fighting the ghosts of shame, the brokenness and grief\u00a0of past sin. The internal questions stone us: How, dear God,  how  could I have done that? How could I have failed again? Will I ever break these chains? \u00a0 . At the amusement park, I managed to get her onto the kiddie boat ride. She was too big and too old, but mercifully the ride operator did not object when I put Rhema in the little boat. I fumbled with her belt, stretching it to fit, praying she would stay seated. I hurried to the sidelines and the ride began. The music played and parents called out to their toddlers. I took a deep breath, our time at the park had not gone well \u2013 in fact, every moment had been a spirit-crushing struggle. For now I was relieved she\u2019d made it onto the ride and I had a moment to prepare for the next battle (as soon as the ride ended). Then the operator shouted, \u201cOh no! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d I looked up to find my eight-year old leaning over the side of the boat blissfully splashing water and shoveling it into her mouth as if she\u2019d been\u00a0in the\u00a0desert for forty days and nights. \u201cOh! Rhema!\u201d I ran over to the operator and explained that my daughter has autism and that all shouting was futile. \u201cOh, well,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cThe water\u2019s not clean obviously. But if it\u2019s any consolation, it is chlorinated -\u201d We watched as she began gulping scoops of dirty water from  inside  the boat. \u201c\u2026But I can\u2019t speak for the water  inside  the boat.\u201d I winced. Then I laughed. (She\u2019s ingested much worse). As the ride went around, Rhema let out a shriek that sounded like, Dude, thanks for putting me on this ride! I sure was thirsty! It struck me how joyfully, utterly free she was. \u201cWhen Satan tempts me to despair, \nAnd tells me of the guilt within, \nUpward I look, and see Him there \nWho made an end to all my sin. Spattering, guzzling, rocking, screaming Rhema  lived  that kiddie boat ride. More than anyone in the park, I\u2019m sure. She\u2019s known the dark, but she\u2019s never lost the light. She trusts that she is mine. And no matter how hard she falls, how bitter the fight, at her best, at her worst, I will be all there. I\u2019m so glad she knows I\u2019m there.

Her school day started a half hour earlier than Rhema\u2019s, and as soon as we got into the building Rhema bolted. We were early, but lots of eager children, parents and teachers filled the hallway. I wanted to take my time and savor the moment \u2013 this rite of passage, this titanic step in her educational journey. (Rhema\u2019s school experience has been so vastly different. She started full-time at age three at a year-round autism school over an hour away from home and never looked back. No one ever said to me, \u2018She\u2019s in kindergarten now!\u2019 ) I wanted to greet and chat with Hope\u2019s teacher, hand over the spare EpiPen and inhaler, and review the list of her food allergies once more. \u00a0I wanted to help Hope find her place\u2026 hang her raincoat, get out her supplies, beam with pride as she morphed into an esteemed lifelong learner before my very eyes. But Rhema was gone, out of sight. Over the buzz of kids and teachers I could hear her grunting and shrieking. I stared at Hope, and she looked a little lost, clearly more nervous than excited now. She didn\u2019t know what to do next. I said what I\u2019ve been saying to her all her life: \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, Hope.\u201d I found Rhema very anxious, overwhelmed and over-stimulated. I tried to lead her toward Hope\u2019s classroom, and people tried to get out of our way. But Rhema ran down the stairs; she wanted  out . I grabbed her hands at the door and looked into her frantic eyes. I willed her to listen, to understand. \u201cLet\u2019s go say bye-bye to Hope. Rhema, we need to say bye-bye to Hope.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if she really understood, but amazingly she repeated, \u201cHo. Hope. Bye. Bye.\u201d \u201cYes. Let\u2019s tell her. Let\u2019s go say bye-bye to Hope.\u201d I\u00a0took her hand\u00a0from the door, and she became upset. She grabbed me by the hair and then by my blouse. (Unfortunately she\u2019s been doing this a lot lately). Some of the people coming into school got quite a show. I took Rhema to school. She calmed and happily went with her teacher. Then I skipped my train to work, stopped at the store for some Superstar stickers, and drove back to Hope\u2019s school. Class was well under way, but I just needed to peek in and see her and send her all my mother-love through the window\u00a0and between the hinges and under the door until it filled the entire room and she couldn\u2019t miss it. She was fine, of course, totally fine. She was smiling and working on a project with a new friend. She came out and we had a sweet moment in the hall, just the two of us. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. And I love you so much.

{"date": "September 14, 2012", "body": "\u201cYou see, no matter what, in spite of everything, God would love His children \u2013 with a Never Stopping, Never Giving Up, Unbreakable, Always and Forever Love.\u201d \n~ The Jesus Storybook Bible . Thank you so much for  praying . Over the past few days the incredible teachers at Rhema\u2019s school have implemented three different treatments to address her grabbing behaviors. One involves a pillow. Often when one of her teachers comes to greet her at the start of the day, Rhema grabs her by the collar and pulls hard. It takes the two of us to pry her off. And then she usually turns and grabs me by the collar or the hair and we repeat the un-prying process again. Yesterday her speech therapist met us at the door and offered a pillow to Rhema. Rhema seemed confused at first,  Pillows are beds and\u00a0for sleeping on, people!  Then she hugged it and happily buried her face in it. She tilted her head and laid it on the pillow. And off she went that way. So easy, so smooth. As she went, I knew that friends had prayed for her, and instead of fighting she looked like she was\u2026  resting. Perhaps the pillow is/will meet a sensory need, giving her something to grab and hold on to during transitions. (?) My friend Cathy commented yesterday: \u2018And prayers as well for those who have been harmed, hurt or startled by our children and continue to be calm, patient and loving with them.\u2019 This is the very thing that has blessed me so much as we\u2019ve been dealing with the troubling behaviors. Numerous times Rhema has lunged for a teacher\u2019s throat or even (unintentionally) ripped a shirt, seemingly out of the blue. Even knowing there\u2019s the potential for harm, her teachers always approach her lovingly, patiently, completely. Every day. The battles of the day before, or even the hour before, already forgiven. It\u2019s no different with Hope. She has been subject to many hair-pulling attacks \u2013 in the car, at the dinner table, in the playroom at home. After an episode, I often encourage Hope to give Rhema some space. She waits for a little while. Never timid or afraid, she goes to Rhema with arms stretched wide. She exclaims like a long-lost great aunt, \u201cGive your sister a hug!\u201d I\u2019m her mother.  I\u2019ll always stay  no matter how fast the tide changes. I\u2019ll come close to her with all my love, my heart laid bare. But her teachers, her babysitter, even Hope \u2013 they are not bound to her the way I am. And yet they floor me with their care for her, the way they give of themselves for her.

Her fingers, her skin, her incredible eyes, the mole above her lip \u2013 I am still amazed by it all. In the dark of night she pulls her pajama bottoms all the way up to her chest and I hug her tight, savor her innocence. She\u2019s growing so big and tall, her body is changing.

I still believe in God\u2019s good purpose for her life, that she\u2019s been given a special way to bless others and reflect His glory. The younger girl dances and talks and sings through every day. Clever, funny, little star. As she grows to understand the world is not all castles and fairies, how will I teach her, how will I cultivate her beautiful, open heart? What will I leave behind for her? I still believe in God\u2019s good purpose, that she\u2019s been given a special way to bless others and reflect His glory. The husband, in the midst of crazy weeks of work and school and a surprise party and house guests, he finds quiet ways to connect. Just-because-flowers on the table, a compliment, a touch on the elbow. I nearly tore my house down, my marriage down with my own hands. But he is brave enough to let me know that I mean something to him, more than the rest. It\u2019s the little things, he lifts me higher and higher. How can I support him, love him better? He is God\u2019s good purpose for me, and I still believe this marriage can be a blessing and a reflection of His glory. For this life just as it is, Lord, thank you. I am wife. I am mother.

{"date": "January 20, 2013", "body": "Thank you for the prayers and well wishes for smooth travels! Our time in the airport was certainly challenging, but definitely easier than the last time. We still have to fly back\u2026 so we\u2019ll see how that goes. Ahhhh. Rhema is healthy and happy (usually) and that was not always so. She\u00a0eats well\u00a0and that was not always so. She has full use of her arms and track star legs (and uses them quite well in public places!) and that has always been so. I\u2019m uncomfortable calling it hard, this life.\u00a0There is however a continual struggle to help her, us, navigate her day. Home, school, church, airport, store, car, park \u2013 every setting has its challenges, some familiar, some new and unanticipated. The behaviors that come and go (or never leave)\u00a0can be humorous (invading the personal space of unsuspecting strangers) to mildly annoying (eating paper) to heartbreaking (aggressions)\u2026 they all affect the life of our family. A special needs  mom  once wrote: \u201cEverything I had valued in my life before [her] birth \u2013 intelligence, efficiency, logic, self-control \u2013 had to be re-thought and re-valued.\u201d Often\u00a0in this process of re-valuing, we are frustrated and weary. Discontentment seeps in like bad tea. I see moms who have kids the same age as my Rhema. They\u2019re dropping their girls off at gymnastics practice while I\u2019m still helping mine in the bathroom. In fact, we were in the bathroom at McDonalds. (McDonalds  again . Looking back, I have blogged about McDonalds 6 times on this blog.\u00a0A little\u00a0disturbing!) Anyway, Rhema was making loud, happy noises, enjoying the way the sounds bounced off the walls. I imitated the sounds back to her \u201cEeeee oohhh! Looww dooohhhhh! Eee eee ohhh!\u201d Louder and louder we got, making our noise as I helped her finish up in the bathroom. At the sink we had just reached an \u201cEeeeee\u201d crescendo when a woman stepped out of a stall staring at us like we\u2019d lost our marbles. Ooops, I had thought we were alone! I want my children to remind me of the gospel every day. So often Rhema helps me see my own weakness, my own need. The things I\u00a0once controlled (or thought I did), the things I used to count on \u2013 my education, my abilities, my own strength \u2013 often fall short. These years have exposed me. And I am more amazed by grace, that God\u2019s love is not based on our worthiness, that He  loves  us in and in spite our need. Anyway we\u00a0re-joined Brandon and Hope at the table. It was getting late and we decided to do our evening devotions right there at McDonalds. Brandon read from a Bible app on his phone. I looked at my girls across the table from me, my eyes lingering on Rhema for an extra moment, suddenly coming down from the high in the bathroom to feeling the sad. I felt like God whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s ok!\u201d It\u2019s ok. Really? It\u2019s ok? \u201cLook around at your blessings.\u201d I looked again at my husband, thoughtful and strong, reading to my children, one making funny faces and blowing a kiss,\u00a0one wiggling and humming in her seat.

{"date": "January 15, 2013", "body": "This week we\u2019re flying to the boondocks of Michigan. The whole family. Lord, help us. The last time Rhema flew it was just the two of us. Brandon was in Iraq, and Hope was staying with my mother. Thinking about that trip still gives me heart palpitations\u2026 (Originally published in September 2010) How cool moms like Angelina, Heidi and Victoria do it. I look EXACTLY like this when I travel: . Rhema is not fearful of new situations like some kids on the spectrum. She doesn\u2019t always know where she\u2019s going or why she\u2019s\u00a0going, she just knows that she must! get! there! So it was at the airport. \u00a0Me, with the luggage in one hand while holding on to Rhema for dear life as she sprinted up and down the escalators. Escalators are on her obsession list and Logan Airport was paradise; she was bent on riding every single one. My brother-in-law Joel went with us as far as he could \u2013 to the security check point. The poor man (so dear to me) looked like he was dropping us off at the edge of Hades. I gave him a quick, brave smile and nodded goodbye. I had our boarding passes out, but my ID was in my wallet in my purse in a pouch in the backpack on my back. I could slide said backpack off my back onto the floor and even stoop down while holding the carry-on suitcase and the carseat and Rhema-trying-to-escape all with my pinky finger. But to open said backpack and fish out my purse and then my wallet and then my ID\u2026 well, that would take two hands. At which point Rhema broke free and took off running like she was late for a popsicle handout. She slammed into a metal signpost and cut her ear, but she barely slowed down. I had to leave all of our stuff in the line, run and catch her and bring her back. She got away from me twice. Try as I might, I could not manage to get my shoes off, her shoes off, the laptop out of the backpack and into one of those trays, and the carseat and the carry-on luggage onto the belt and get us both through security. I\u2019d told one of the security dudes that Rhema had autism, but no one was helping us. Then Joel was at my side. \u201cI got a pass. I can go with you to the gate.\u201d  Oh thank you, BRO! By the time we got to the gate I had to check the suitcase and the carseat. I had wanted to avoid going through baggage claim (for obvious reasons), but there was no way I could handle it all. I should have known, should have planned better. But I just thought/hoped that she would be calmer this time (she\u2019s flown before). On the plane our struggles continued. It was a \u2018full flight\u2019, and\u00a0Rhema kicked the living daylights out of the seat in front of her. She slid the window shade up and down, up and down\u2026 and then the tray table in front of her, up and down, up and down. The entire flight. (When the flight attendant calmly explained to her that all tray tables and seatbacks had to be stowed in their upright and locked positions for takeoff and landing, Rhema was unmoved.) For good measure, she dumped her apple juice in my lap. As the plane descended I wondered which was a more frightening prospect: the plane blowing up or Rhema and I trying to get through baggage claim. Of course we couldn\u2019t stand there and wait for our luggage like \u201cnormal people.\u201d Of course we had to run up and down escalators, during which Rhema scraped the back of her leg. Of course we were the last two souls at the baggage claim area late at night with no suitcase or carseat in sight. Rhema was at the end of her rope, and I could not make her be still or sit down. She fought me. She kicked me. She pushed me. I had to go potty, I was famished, I was weary in body and spirit. And then she got up and ran toward a group of soldiers. She had been running all afternoon, not seeming to see anything or anyone around her. But she saw soldiers in desert fatigues and ran to them.  Is she looking for her Daddy? Is that what she thinks this is all about?   I will not cry, I will not cry . After we finally found our luggage, we went to the restroom. Now normally I never go to the bathroom (myself) when Rhema\u2019s with me. Too risky. But this time I couldn\u2019t hold it. So while I sat on the germ-infested potty-chair, I held Rhema\u2019s hand and begged her to \u2018stay with me.\u2019 But my darling child managed to undo the lock on the stall door. The door bust open, and she\u00a0bolted like a skittish pony\u2026 with me in  mid-stream . Now, I ask you,\u00a0what\u2019s a girl to do? This girl kicked the door shut, finished her business and hoped for the best. Thankfully, I found her drinking soapy water out of the sink. I won\u2019t bother to mention  all  of the gory details. Like the fact that we had to wait 20 minutes for the shuttle bus for the rental car to come. (Rhema has a waiting ABA program at school \u2013 she\u2019s up to a whopping 3 seconds. Do you know how many seconds are in 20 minutes?). Or that I tried to feed her some rice while we waited outside for the shuttle\u2026 and she spilled it\u2026 and tried to eat pieces of rice off the pavement like she was starving\u2026 and burst into tears when I stopped her. Or how one of the businessmen observed that she was\u00a0\u2018quite a handful.\u2019 Or that she tried to climb into the shuttle bus driver\u2019s lap  while  he was driving. When we finally stumbled into our hotel room at 11 pm, I had a message from my husband that simply said Ps. 34: 17-18. \u201cThe righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. \u00a0The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\u201d It was late, but I pulled up  Kari Jobe\u2019s My Beloved  on the iPod, gathered my girl in my arms.

But they try to pull me off, and I fight. I hook my leg around his. I won\u2019t let go. Someone says, \u201cNO.\u201d I know I\u2019ve done something wrong. I cover my eyes with my arm. It\u2019s what I do when I\u2019m scared or overwhelmed or ashamed. So they can\u2019t see my face. As they pull me away I hear my mother say, \u2018I\u2019ll take her out.\u2019 But I don\u2019t want to leave so I do  The Flop . My mother half-carries/half-drags me to a bench in the corridor. I\u2019m really upset and confused now, breathing hard. My mother sits next to me. She speaks softly. She tells me that Great-Grandpa is old. His body is weak, she says, and his heart is very tired. She says I can\u2019t jump on him or sit on his lap. But I don\u2019t understand. She kisses my hot cheek, but I won\u2019t uncover my face. She tells me she loves me so much and that I am so smart and kind and good. She says she is so proud of me. The fire in my body begins to die down. I am safe. A little later she tries to lead me back into the room, but I resist. I know I\u2019ll just jump on Great-Grandpa again. Besides it\u2019s cool and quiet out here. I want this calm with her. Then others come out of the room and talk to my mom. My mother starts talking to my aunt about boots and school and House Hunters International. I don\u2019t like it. Sometimes when I\u2019m agitated I don\u2019t want my mom to talk to anyone else. As my aunt goes back into the room, my frustration explodes in a scream and I grab my mother by the hair and yank her head. I sink my fingers deep into her skin. When she\u2019s finally able to pry me free I have a fistful of her hair in my hand. She\u2019s used to this. But I can tell by the way she\u2019s breathing and how she\u2019s staring at me that she feels hurt and sad. I know hurt and sad. She takes her broken hair out of my hand. I cover my face with arm. She turns away and whispers, \u2018Why?\u2019 With my free hand I slowly fiddle with my iTouch. I love jazz. But there\u2019s this one song I like to play over and over and over on my iTouch. I play it for us now. \u201cMy pockets are empty. \n  Fear\u2019s such a thief. \n  You know how that goes \n  I used to think \n  You couldn\u2019t love a mess like me \n  Then You came in so close \n  As my heart settles \n  You do the impossible \n  You change me, You change me \n  Thank you, Jesus \n  I can see You change me.\u201d ~Bethany Dillon I rock forward and back, and I notice Mommy staring at me again.

{"date": "January 30, 2013", "body": "\u201cFret not thyself\u2026\u201d (Ps. 37:1) Grocery shopping. For years we had a system that worked. Rhema would jump into the front of the shopping cart \u2013 never, ever the back \u2013 and buckle herself in. She would stay in the cart the whole time I shopped, perodically giving me a good kick in the legs as I pushed. I marveled at how content she was in the carriage. I didn\u2019t mind that my eight year old needed to ride in the front seat \u2013 it was comforting and predictable for her. It allowed me to focus on the shopping and not worry about her. Of course as she\u2019s grown older, it\u2019s become increasingly harder for her to fit in the carriage. And I\u2019ve had a sense of impending doom. Once we made a quick stop at Trader Joes and I refused to get a carriage. I\u00a0insisted she hold my hand and walk with me. She was so disturbed by this that she kept trying to climb into  other  shoppers\u2019 carts. Several months ago I realized our shopping days were surely numbered. We were at Target \u2013 Hope and I inspecting holiday socks and Rhema sitting in the carriage. Suddenly Rhema scrambled out of the carriage and took off. She\u2019d never done that before and I was dumbfounded for a moment. Hope started yelling and then we started running. She had a good lead on us and we chased her up and down aisles, between shoppers and through racks of clothes.\u00a0We\u00a0laugh about it now, imaging the scene. But at the time I was very afraid that she\u2019d run out the automatic doors and into the street. We caught her. But we were not able to get her to return to the carriage, and we left the store without making a purchase. So for months I\u2019ve wondered how we\u2019d handle shopping trips with Rhema. This past weekend Brandon took her to the grocery store while Hope and I went to the craft store. He prevented her from squeezing herself into the carriage. She walked beside him, and he instructed her to get items off the shelf and put them in the cart. She loved it! She loved helping, loved having a purpose. Not once did she bolt or flop or climb into someone else\u2019s cart or try to eat all the cheese in the store! Sometimes I feel like there is soooo much to worry about when it comes to my girl and the future. Often I pray, \u201cLord, I have no idea what we\u2019re going to do about\u2026\u201d And then an unexpected, amazing successful moment comes and wraps me up in a bear hug. And the thing I thought would be huge and difficult just isn\u2019t. I\u2019m so thankful when that happens. Dear restless heart, be still; don\u2019t fret and worry so; \n  God has a thousand ways His love and help to show; \n  Just trust, and trust, and trust, until His will you know. Dear restless heart, be still, for peace is God\u2019s own smile, \n  His love can every wrong and sorrow reconcile; \n  Just love, and love, and love, and calmly wait awhile. Dear restless heart, be brave; don\u2019t moan and sorrow so, \n  He hath a meaning kind in chilly winds that blow; \n  Just hope, and hope, and hope, until you braver grow. Dear restless heart, repose upon His breast this hour, \n  His grace is strength and life, His love is bloom and flower; \n  Just rest, and rest, and rest, within His tender power. Dear restless heart, be still! Don\u2019t struggle to be free; \n  God\u2019s life is in your life, from Him you may not flee; \n  Just pray, and pray, and pray, till you have faith to see.  ~Edith Willis Linn ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0082.jpeg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/supermarket-sweep/", "title": "Supermarket sweep"},

Autism \u2013 taken from the Greek word autos meaning \u201cself\u201d, \u201calone\u201d ~Student Encyclopedia Britannica \u201c\u2026for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.\u201d Deut. 31:6 . Since she was little, Rhema has been one to go it alone. She would scrape her knees and never cry. Never come to me. Bloody legs were my only clue that she\u2019d hurt herself. There have been mornings I have found her in bed, lying in vomit. I\u2019ve imagined her sick, holding her stomach during the night, not having the words or even the unction to call on her mama. Other times I have put her to bed, come downstairs and discovered a box of spaghetti and a jar of sauce sitting on the table. Oh, sweet child, were you still hungry? Why didn\u2019t you try harder to make me understand you wanted spaghetti? Don\u2019t you know I would do anything for you? She laughs. She throws her head back, her eyes dance and her shoulders shake with giggles. You can\u2019t help but smile at her laughter, one of my favorite sounds. But it\u2019s an inside joke; she doesn\u2019t need me to laugh along. Then there are times when she, without warning, is overwhelmed with emotion. I look over and see her face twisted in sadness, silent tears streaming from huge, brown eyes. It\u2019s the most melancholy cry I\u2019ve ever seen, and I want so much just to be able to talk with her, know what\u2019s on her mind. I wonder if she\u2019s sad that I don\u2019t know what she knows. I wonder if it makes her feel lonely. Years ago, she did not want to be held or touched or comforted the way I give comfort. But now, more times than not, she is most cuddly when she\u2019s sad.  What a gift!  A friend once told me to take advantage of these times, and so I stopped hurrying and sheltered her in my arms. Because I need her to know, really know, that I\u2019m her mommy. Quietly I told her, \u201cSo little girl, I\u2019m your mommy, you know? You may spend hours a day away from me \u2013 with people who teach you and care for you, help you go to the bathroom, help you eat, help you play. And when I drop you off, let you go, pick you up, you might not look at me, you might not say hi or bye. But I\u2019m the one who loves you best. I\u2019m the one who was with you in the beginning. Just you and me, remember? You came out looking like a sunburned Sumo wrestler with a bad hairstyle. I am always with you. Whatever you need I will try to be. You need a knee-healer, a spaghetti-maker, a hand-holder in the night, a hiding place? I\u2019m yours, again and again. If you never have a friend, I\u2019ll be your closest friend. And when you can\u2019t speak or call my name, when you barely have the ability to come, baby, I\u2019ll come to you. You will learn you can make use of me.\u201d As I held her, I suddenly saw myself in her. Trying to go it alone. Not enlisting the help of an ever-present, ever faithful Source: my awesome God. Not comprehending the depth of His love. Not daring to believe that I really could find all I need in Him. The words played over again: \u201cBecause I need you to know, really know, that I\u2019m your God. Little girl, do you know what that means? You may spend hours a day away from me \u2013 with people who teach you and care for you. And when I drop you off, let you go, pick you up, you might not look at me, you might not say hi or bye. But I\u2019m the one who loves you best. I\u2019m the one who was with you in the beginning.  I AM  the Beginning, the End.  I AM.  Always with you, always for you. You need a heart-healer, a way-maker, a song in the night, a hiding place? I AM. yours. I\u2019ll be your closest friend, true lover of your soul. And when you can\u2019t speak, when you barely have the strength to come, I\u2019ll run to you.

She shows affection!!!\u00a0Sometimes it\u2019s a bop on the head, sometimes it\u2019s a sloppy, bordering-on-inappropriate  Rhema-kiss . But she is present, participative,  with us . She seems totally settled in our love. You should see Rhema and Hope play ring around the rosy. They spin in a whirlwind of laughter and excitement and triumph. Rhema \u201cfalls down\u201d on cue. Hope attacks her with shouts of glee and hugs and kisses, and Rhema hooks her arm around her sister\u2019s neck. I could cry every time I watch them. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m cherishing this verse, Eph. 2:13:  \u201cBut now\u2026 ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible. When Rhema eagerly comes and sits in my lap, I know it\u2019s not impossible. When I think about my hard, divided, rebellious heart (believe me\u00a0on this) and how I\u2019ve been forgiven all, I remember it\u2019s not impossible. That mountain of pain and anger, that sea of lies that look like truth, that seemingly insurmountable wall of doubt and fear \u2013 it\u2019s not impossible. That great distance is traversed in an instant by the One who died for us and lives again, the\u00a0 Repairer of the Breach . He comes so close with his inconceivable, unrelenting, saving love\u00a0nothing can separate. And what we were is no longer what we are. We are being made near. Far-off one, God can make you nigh; you can be made nigh tonight. Whoever you may be, he is able still to save, but the blood must make you nigh\u2014the blood of Jesus. Trust him. To believe is to live, and to believe means only and simply to trust, to depend upon. That is faith. Have confidence in Christ\u2019s sacrifice, and you are saved. God grant you may be enabled to do it, for Jesus\u2019 sake. Amen. \n~Charles Spurgeon,  Our Glorious Transforming ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/near.jpg", "http://www.sermoncentral.com/sermons/our-glorious-transforming-charles-spurgeon-sermon-on-born-again-140777.asp?Page=1"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/far-off-one/", "title": "Far-off one"},
{"date": "January 4, 2013", "body": "Lately, more so than ever, Rhema\u2019s humming will turn into a song we recognize. Mary Had a Little Lamb, London Bridge, Yankee Doodle, How Great is our God, even Dynamite by Taio Cruz. It\u2019s so exhilarating for us when she hums a familiar song! There are a thousand reasons why. It\u2019s confirmation that she\u2019s always listening, always learning. It\u2019s because for so long her sounds were not discernible to us; they were background noise and a constant reminder of her inability to communicate with spoken word and my inability to understand her. Years ago my thinking about the humming \u2013 or what others might call vocal stimming \u2013 shifted, thanks in part  to this video  about Amanda Baggs. I began to feel blessed that Rhema\u2019s lovely chorus filled our home, our lives. These days I listen closely. When she begins to hum something that sounds familiar, I stop what I\u2019m doing. I get quiet. I want to  hear . Oh, I\u2019m so desperate to hear. Anything. Anything she wants to share, anything that\u2019s in her head. Even if it\u2019s just Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Because it\u2019s my baby enjoying her song out loud. Because I can finally sing along. It\u2019s growth, it\u2019s progress, it\u2019s miraculous. I was wondering what my little \u201cgoal\u201d should be this year, and it keeps coming to me that I need to get still. Sit with a quiet heart. And know that God is God. I mean,  really  practice that in this loud, anxious\u00a0world. Maybe they are only brief, quiet\u00a0moments I reach for Words that will\u00a0breathe new life and find His voice\u00a0\u2013 in the early morning, over the sink full of dishes, in the waiting room, on the train, as they play. The way I yearn to hear Rhema in the silence is the way I want to wait to hear only God, singing over me. \u201cBut that \u201cstill small voice\u201d\u2026 was God\u2019s answer to all my questions, was God\u2019s life and strength for soul and body, and became the substance of all knowledge, and all prayer and all blessing: for it was the living GOD Himself as my life, my all.\u201d ~A.B.

{"date": "June 25, 2012", "body": "I read once that Grace is a teacher. And those who have experienced grace\u2026 are experiencing grace\u2026 learn to ask for help. Hope had a birthday party to attend this weekend. Her little friend and her family are very dear to us. Our friends live on a very busy street \u2013 it\u2019s state highway, in fact. By the time we arrived,\u00a0the only place\u00a0to park was alongside the street in front of the house. Rhema\u2019s side of the van faced the highway. Not a good scenario because Rhema has a routine \u2013 I\u2019ve been trying to overcome it for months \u2013 she has this compulsion to run at least one wide lap around the van when she gets in or out. (If her hand is held firmly, we can prevent the run around. But you can imagine the danger of this in a parking lot). No way was I going to open her side of the van and expose her to the oncoming traffic. I walked around to Hope\u2019s side and opened her door, and as Hope was climbing out, I saw the alarm on Rhema\u2019s face. I usually always come to Rhema\u2019s side first to open the door and take her hand. This was a change in the order. Instantly she undid her belt, and to my horror pushed the power button on her door. I screamed and lunged across the seats and somehow grabbed her arm, slick with sunscreen. She was already out the door, standing on the pavement \u2013it was only God\u2019s grace that I caught her arm in time. But I was stretched across the seats and she was fighting me, pulling, desperately trying to break free so she could run her lap around the van. I\u00a0could\u00a0hear the cars whizzing by us, couldn\u2019t bring myself to look. \u201cPlease, God! Don\u2019t let me let go! Please, Rhema! Please, baby!\u201d I think I was screaming. I knew that if she broke free, she would be hit by a car. No doubt. She had absolutely no understanding of the danger around her. I\u2019ve been scared for Rhema before \u2013 she\u2019s been  lost  on  several occasions  \u2013 but for the first time\u00a0I really thought I might  lose  her and I\u2019ve never been more scared in my life.\u00a0Perhaps the most heartbreaking thing of all was looking into my girl\u2019s face, pleading with everything in me, begging her to come to me, to hold on, and knowing\u2026 knowing that she wouldn\u2019t. There are no words to describe that feeling, that sense of pain and utter helplessness. It was only grace again that gave me the strength to hold on to her arm while climbing over Hope\u2019s seat, a birthday present (one of those really big, plush Beanie Ballz), a juice box and an empty McDonald\u2019s bag, and a backpack (Sorry, B. I\u2019ll clean out the van) to get to her. Then I had to practically wrestle her into the grass to keep her from running. We still went to the party, lasted a little while. And the girls had a good time. I tried to be normal but I was still shaking, and I spent the whole time chasing Rhema afraid she\u2019d run out the yard, for the highway. My friend Laura had asked the day before: \u201cHow can I help? Do you want me to go to church with you guys? Do you need help at the birthday party?\u201d And I was all, \u201cOh no. We\u2019re fine.\u201d \u201cYou sure?\u201d \u201cYes! Thanks, we\u2019re fine.\u201d Every summer when Brandon is gone (or every TDY or deployment), I go through this thing where I\u2019m sure I can do it alone. It\u2019s not easy for an intensely independent, Ivy League educated, capable (well, most of the time) woman to admit that she needs help, that she cannot go out in public and handle her own child by herself.  As my friend Jess  who knows me well said, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been struggling to make peace with for years. And some outings\u2026 Rhema is totally fine, some days are really good. Other days we go downhill fast, and there are too many close calls. She\u2019s unpredictable, more so it seems, when her father is away. I\u2019ve reasoned that as she\u2019s getting older, she\u2019s maturing and gaining experience to navigate the world \u2013 I assumed we\u2019d need  less  assistance. But as she gets older, stronger, more rigid \u2013 we actually need  more  help. I think deep down I didn\u2019t want to be in \u201cthat category\u201d, the one where the autism impacts us so much that I/we need a helper or an aide with us all the time. I suppose I was in denial \u2013 until now. And there was some real pride underneath it all, and I\u2019m not talking about the good pride. But God\u2019s amazing, preserving, never-letting-go grace is a teacher. And at the point in the party where Rhema chewed all the buttons off her shirt and pooped in her pants and Hope slid down the Slip N\u2019 Slide and busted her knee wide open, I said, \u201cO.k., Lord. I get it. I need help!\u201d So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.  ~Heb. 4:16 And I really could have wept right then, not because I was overwhelmed. Because I kind of felt free. .\u00a0 Thank you, Father, for your work in me. Thank you for surrounding me with grace and help.

{"date": "January 7, 2013", "body": "Hope waited all of December to go to Disney on Ice. When the big day arrived (during the school break) she could not contain herself, screaming and cheering and whirling about in glitter and sequins. As always, the plan was one parent would take Hope to the show and one parent would stay home with Rhema. I hadn\u2019t really been out of the house since my surgery, but there was no way in the world I was going to miss seeing the fascination and pure delight on her sweet face. As we were preparing to go, Rhema was inconsolable. I tried singing to her, offering popsicles, her favorite toy. But she sat in a corner, covered her face with her arm and wept. When Rhema cries like this it\u2019s a sight to behold \u2013 it could break the hardest heart. It may seem obvious that she was sad because she wasn\u2019t going to the show. But honestly, it was not obvious to us. Not at first. For so long Rhema has not given any indication that she understood what was being said around her or to her. Nor has she given any indication that she cared one iota about what was being discussed, what we were doing, where we were going, etc. But as Hope and I boarded the train for Boston, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she  knew , she understood, and she  cared . And it was almost too much to handle.\u00a0 There was hope and joy in this milestone \u2013 her ability to comprehend language around her, her ability to show her comprehension, her desire to be with us. There was heartache in realizing that she knew she was being left behind. It gripped my gut to imagine her tears and know that she might know (or have known all along) that her differences, her challenges make life so hard sometimes. It hit Brandon like a ton of bricks, too. He texted, \u201cI think Rhema was sad because she wasn\u2019t going. Yea, sad when I realized that, but\u2026\u201d As if reading our thoughts, Hope said, \u201cI wish Rhema could come to Disney on Ice with me.\u201d \u201cI know, Hope. The show is 2 hours long\u2026 and loud\u2026 and chaotic\u2026 and wouldn\u2019t hold her interest\u2026 and it would be very hard for her\u2026 She\u2019s better staying with Daddy. They\u2019ll do something fun together.\u201d \u201cI still wish she could come to Disney on Ice with me.\u201d \u201cMe, too.\u201d Hope LOVED every dazzling moment of the show, and I loved every dazzling moment of seeing her so happy. I felt so thankful that she can experience these things, that her father and I can help make her little-girl dreams come true. Of course as I watched her, it was bittersweet. My heart was\u00a0at home with my other sweet girl, wishing she could share this with her sister. Oh, how I want everything good for her. Everything good for them both. We brought home a funny hat. The hat is from those alien things in Toy Story.\u00a0So\u00a0we did a funny photo shoot. Scary. I know.         The next afternoon I found Rhema and Hope huddled under the covers. Hope was gently telling Rhema every detail of the show \u2013 she left nothing out. And I know Rhema listened. And I know she cared. And I chose to believe she understood.

{"date": "July 6, 2012", "body": "As a mother I love to show my children things: how to hum to a snail or do cartwheels or play thumb wars. For Rhema, the lack of joint attention and eye contact and my inability to verbally explain things to her has made this simple pleasure difficult. I long to introduce her to many of the things I enjoyed as a kid. But, like her mama she likes to do things her way. Often, if I try to join her in her play and demonstrate how to manipulate a toy or object she turns away or runs away. The enthusiasm and eagerness in the eyes of a child seeing a new trick or small wonder, I often miss that in Rhema. The other day at the park I felt such frustration over this \u2013 I\u2019d hoped to teach her the joy of the frisbee. Instead she cowered under a park bench and covered her face. No amount of coaxing could bring her out. Defeated, I sat down on the ground and waited for her mood \u2013 or my mood \u2013 to change. There we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. Then I watched an ant determinedly drag a dead insect twice its size through the dirt. It was captivating. What was that verse about the ant? I remembered and laughed:  \u201cGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.\u201d I studied a summer leaf the way Rhema would study it, taking in its deep colors and every striation and pointy edge, even the decay made it beautiful. The leaf Maker finally had my attention. I looked up and let the splendor of the sun fading into the ocean still my soul.  Be still and know that I am God. I was devastated by the awesome presence of God all around and the beauty of creation on display. How had I not seen and not known? The earth and everything in it an exhibition of His glory, a daily proclamation of His everywhere-love for us, for all He has made. Rhema, eyes closed, tapped her fingers in the dirt along to the song of the birds. See what great love the Father has lavished on us\u2026 1 Jn 3:1 Keep showing us, Lord. Don\u2019t let us turn away.

{"date": "July 13, 2012", "body": "I never realized how many transitions there are in a day. Until it seemed like every passage or change in\u00a0direction became a challenge for my girl. These days she gets \u201cstuck\u201d and any movement from one room or activity to another comes only after much anticipating and strategizing. I have quite the\u00a0method for getting her to leave the kitchen table. She sits in her chair, gripping the back\u00a0like it\u2019s a small island in a sea of lava. She\u2019s so determined to stay in that chair, she\u2019s even wet herself right there. So I sit on the floor, in the lava, and call out to her, hold out my arms. She knows that\u2019s her invitation to sit in my lap and get an Eskimo kiss. Sometimes in a whole day that\u2019s our way, our only way of really connecting. But I could sit there, calling all night and it wouldn\u2019t matter. What I need is\u2026 cheese! So I get shredded cheese and go back to sitting on the molten floor. She tentatively dares to step out and then jumps back in the chair. This goes on for a long, long time. On a good night, eventually she makes it to my lap. After more time I\u2019m able to stand her up and carefully guide her to out of the kitchen. At this point she usually breaks away and runs right back to the chair. And the process starts all over again. But some nights I can get her to the stairs on the first round. Then she flops at the foot of the stairs\u2026 because going up the stairs is just another transition we have to work through. Transitions outside of home are trickier. Honestly, I\u2019ve been tempted to avoid public outings with her altogether, because sometimes it\u2019s just that hard. Yesterday I transitioned from one old age to an older old age, and my twin and I went out (with the kids and her husband) for a birthday dinner. Just getting Rhema from the car to the restaurant door was a challenge. And then getting seated was a struggle because we had to wait, and Rhema and I ended up hiding in the restroom until the table was ready. And then leaving the bathroom and getting her to our table was also a battle. I don\u2019t always know how much she understands; when I try to talk to her and explain what\u2019s happening, she\u2019s so frantic she doesn\u2019t seem to understand at all. Once we made it to the table, Rhema did great and enjoyed her dinner. I was already praying about our exit. It did not go well.\u00a0It involved my eight year old refusing to come out of the booth.\u00a0It involved her diving under tables \u2013  other  diner\u2019s tables and holding onto to the legs for dear life. It involved lots of disruption and the stares of everyone in the restaurant. I dislike that out-of-control feeling. I dislike being watched when I\u2019m feeling that out-of-control feeling. I miss my husband. He is my strength. Even when we don\u2019t know what to do \u2013 if he\u2019s there \u2013 I know it\u2019s not completely out of control. Eventually, my brother-in-law had to grab a fighting Rhema into his arms \u2013\u00a0 it took all his muscle \u00a0\u2013 and carry her out. By the time we got home I\u2019d given myself a pass to be all depressed and discouraged. I was ready to hash out every unfair thing that ever happened to me. And detail all the times I\u2019ve had a good attitude and been patient and self-sacrificing. I wanted wave my hand at heaven and stage a protest: But enough is enough! Can\u2019t a girl get a birthday dinner in peace? Why, why does it have to be so hard? It\u2019s been there all along, just beneath the surface \u2013 this prideful sense that I, for some reason, deserve better. \u201cI know sometimes what messes our life up most \u2014 is the expectation of what our life is supposed to look like.  Entitlement can leave you feeling entirely empty . \u201c- Ann Voskamp My twin, who could do plenty of fist-shaking at the heavens, simply said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t let a little trouble steal your joy.  God has blessed you. \u201d I looked and all around me all my days God has opened the floodgates of heaven and rained down blessings. Not a single one earned or deserved, yet lavishly given. Never once \u2013 not when Rhema was diagnosed with autism, not when my twin was diagnosed with MS \u2013 never has there been a lapse in His goodness.  Thank you, Lord.

Her massive mane\u00a0regularly sports lint, twigs, snot and spaghetti sauce. When I braid it, it turns into knots. The only thing to be done really is to tie it all back in a ponytail. Washing it is\u2026 complicated. She loathes the whole experience. She\u2019s afraid of getting water in her eyes or ears, and fights me the entire time. Rinsing out the shampoo is like trying to give the decimal equivalent of pi. Imagine a frightened, slippery Incredible Hulk and Don King combined into one. Then throw some autism on top. After the  blood bath, there\u2019s the task of brushing out the tangles. Which is also a lot of fun. Needless to say we\u2019ve got a very elaborate system in place, involving popsicles, cheese, a reverse downward dog pose, wrestling and a hose. And it all works about 1% of the time. I\u2019ve drifted to sleep wondering, If I die, who will wash Rhema\u2019s hair??? A huge tangle in the back of her head had turned into a dreadlock that began at her scalp. I worried over it for days because I didn\u2019t want to cut her glorious hair. Yesterday I finally did it. I sat her in front of a pile of shredded cheese and called my friend Carrie for moral support while I snipped away. I cut  a lot.  But it was like the miracle of Jesus feeding the five thousand. I kept cutting but there seemed to be no end to her hair! To look at her now, you\u2019d never know her mama\u00a0got scissor happy. Before bed Hope begged me to paint her toenails \u201cBarbie Pink\u201d. We pretended that I was giving her a real pedicure. And Barbie Pink is sooo not my color, but\u00a0we did my toes, too. We noticed how interested Rhema appeared in what we were doing. She would come over and peer curiously at us and then go back to her spot. I can well remember when she was so isolated \u2013 she did not seem to notice or acknowledge anyone in the room; she did not show interest in much of anything around her. We were eager to include Rhema in our girly fun. Hope ran and grabbed a toy for her to hold and I sat her down on a small bench in the bathroom. Rhema has never had her nails painted, but she willingly presented her toes with a giggle.  Wow!  My heart did an inverse downward dog and a backflip. She let me trim her nails  and  paint them; Hope cheered at every pink toe. I love that Rhema is so present; so ready to be a part of us and what we are doing. It\u2019s a simple thing, painting toenails, but it\u2019s something I never really expected to do/share with her. For a moment I saw pure delight in her face as she glanced down at her feet. God is good always. And this life is a wild, convoluted, beautiful miracle. Yep, just like her hair.

I got the gift of uncommon, huge joy in \u201cordinary\u201d miracles.

Anyone who has been around this blog for a minute knows I share the good, the bad, and the smelly. But the Facebook comments caused me to wrestle again with my own flip-flopping thoughts and emotions. Take yesterday, for example. It included an embarrassing scene on the hospital elevator, 4 clothing changes because she pooped in her pants and chewed holes in her shirts, a near death experience on a busy city street, and me declaring to her neuro who hadn\u2019t seen her in 6 months, that yes, she\u2019s still nonverbal. I saw the loss, how painfully different she was from other kids, how she struggled with the transition of simply walking from the doctor\u2019s office to the waiting room, and I wanted to scream bloody murder at the autism monster. The same day included my girl climbing into my lap and breathing slurpy Rhema-kisses on my face. The two of us, nose to nose, hummed London Bridge for ten blessed minutes. I cannot separate her from the autism, and I love everything about her. \u00a0\u00a0 This is a journey I would never, ever choose. I have more questions than answers. But I do know, for us, part of\u00a0the hope in the struggle is that it brings us to our knees, opens our eyes to God, magnified. And He is providing the grace for empathy, the ability to love each other/others in a manner that I daresay was previously unavailable to us. Indeed, He gives beauty for ashes. On the phone the husband and I tried to think through it out loud. About the autism and the seizure disorder,\u00a0he said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I maybe hate it. But even that I can give to God. This whole package, with joy and sadness entwined, I\u2019m learning to embrace it all. It\u2019s a purposeful decision. To give thanks in everything. To be faithful in the waiting.\u201d Brandon\u00a0loves this song by Laura Story,\u00a0a young woman whose\u00a0husband battles brain cancer: . I want, I  need  to hold on to this gifted perspective.

The first time I saw it I thought,  Oh shoot is it baseball week or something and I missed the memo?  But week after week I\u2019d see the caps. I know Rhema loves her teacher Amy. She\u2019s even learned to say Amy\u2019s name quite well. Once Amy came to the gym with us for Special Olympics, and Rhema was having a  rough  time. She also had\u00a0a runny, runny\u00a0nose. Poor Amy was chasing\u00a0her around the gym with big wads of snotty tissue in her hands, and she got snot-slimed more than anyone on the planet ever has. Besides me, of course. Anyway\u2026 at school\u2026 when Amy would come to get Rhema in the morning her beautiful long hair would be tucked into a baseball cap. The cap just didn\u2019t seem to go with her outfit. But since she\u2019s so great, I\u00a0would always\u00a0forgive her daily fashion faux pas. Days later one of her teachers\u00a0happily reported\u00a0that Rhema\u2019s grabbing (people\u2019s clothes) and hair-pulling seemed to be decreasing. \u201cAlso, we find that when wearing hats and caps on our heads she\u2019s not yanking hair as much.\u201d Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh. So. Now\u00a0my kid has managed to change the staff dress code. Dear teachers, thank you so much and I\u2019m sorry so much! I got in the car and all I could do was laugh. Once upon a time my parenting dreams were filled with dancing gold stars and A plus plusses \u00a0in conduct and perfect spelling tests and teacher\u2019s pet. Never could I have imagined\u2026  this.  Oh, the autism pendulum that swings us from exhaustion, frustration, embarrassment to overwhelming joy and pride; from emotional drama to sheer comedy. Sometimes, all within one minute. It\u2019s good to laugh, and my offspring give me plenty reason. Last Friday at pick-up, Amy met me at the door with Rhema. Yep, she had her cap on. She was excited to show me pictures they\u2019d snapped during the day of Rhema\u2019s writing. My girl. She and her teachers have worked so hard for so long. And every now and then, there are these perfect moments when it all just comes together like a 2-piece puzzle. In the midst of the grabbing, hair-pulling, humming, brain spiking 31 times a minute,  she writes her name , unassisted. Once there was this. Rhema, age 4. And then there was \u2018 She may never learn to write . Let\u2019s teach her to use a stamp with her name on it instead.\u2019 Now there\u2019s this. And even this. . Better than my best dreams. And all\u00a0I can do is laugh. And cheer. And let the wonder and gratitude burst from my heart. On the day my daughter was diagnosed with autism I got a gift.

I see her eyes get wide with understanding, I hear her try new words, and watch as she follows a new direction for the first time with the same accuracy as if she had done it a million times before. I can\u2019t believe how much she has grown these last few years and I am so thankful to be a part of her learning and growing.\u2019 Thank you, Amy.\u00a0Every time I see you in your baseball cap I thank God for you.

And then, \u201cI dropped my mitten!\u201d And there in the cold I did not know what to do about Hope\u2019s mitten a few steps behind us. Because if I stopped, stooped, took my eyes off Rhema for a second and picked up the mitten, one of two events would occur: The Flop or The Bolt. The Flop would mean spending several minutes trying to pick my unmovable child bundled up like Ralphie\u2019s little brother from  A Christmas Story  off the icy pavement. Far worse, The Bolt would mean chasing her through the parking lot and fearing for her life. But the frugal side of me could not leave the mitten behind. I looked Rhema in the eyes and pleaded with her,  \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d I juggled all I was carrying, retrieved the mitten and turned back to Rhema, afraid, expecting to pay for letting go of her hand.

He came home and I still never got my wish. But tomorrow. Ohhhh, tomorrow. I think it might really happen! I will get my day. On my day, I will not wipe a single nose or butt. I will not make the weekend trek to speech therapy and gymnastics practice. I will not cook breakfast, lunch or dinner. I will not go to work. I will not go to the playground. I will not load the dishwasher. I will not clean poop out of the tub. I will not be the Human Snack Dispenser. I will not fold a stitch of clothing. I will not watch any episodes of Bubble Guppies, Team Umizoomi or Mike the Knight. Instead I will sleep in. Really, really late.

I might think about thinking about something. Maybe I\u2019ll do a few crunches. I might just do nothing just because I can. Funny thing, no one in my house is  nearly  as excited about my Mother\u2019s Day present as I am. The husband has this resigned sort of look of dread on his face every time I bring it up.

Rhema\u2019s school has been tracking the behavior for years, and once a month every month I look at a graph that shows how much my kid\u2019s been hitting the deck. I\u2019ve Googled it, I\u2019ve asked BCBA\u2019s (Board Certified Behavioral Analyst) about it, What\u2019s with the flopping? What is it about some people with autism that they flop?

Rhema spoke in gentle, perfect words with a soft, clear voice.\u201d \n~Text from the husband From the moment I peed on the stick, as my friend  Leah  would say, I had big dreams for my girl. I\u2019m sure I looked at Dartmouth College onesies in a catalog that very day. But then came the autism diagnosis and the Landau Kleffner diagnosis like a sucker punch\u2026 and the placement in a special needs school and years of one step forward and two steps back. And suddenly the goals went from reading Shakespeare by age two, to sitting still, making vocalizations, eating something/anything besides pretzels, sleeping through the night, surviving the day. And it\u2019s been such a gift to celebrate every big-small, hard-fought victory. Not one inchstone, milestone, iota of development is lost on me, and I\u2019m so thankful for that. But along the way I stopped seeing her as anything but the way she was in the present. Even in sleep I shielded my heart from dreams, it was too painful to go there: the future. Then slowly, gently God began opening my eyes (and my husband\u2019s) to all the gifts in Rhema. And I realized that all along His plans for her were even bigger and better than my own. Fast forward to today. There have been so many firework explosions of progress in my girl that honestly I believe, I believe  more  in God\u2019s good purpose and His willingness to absolutely blow our minds. All my assumptions about what life will look like for her, for us, I\u2019ve chucked them. Because she\u2019s doing things now that my mind was too small to imagine just a few short years ago. Take the whole question-answer thing. I wrote a  blog  once saying I\u2019d hit the floor if Rhema ever responded to a  question . The other day the girls and I drove to a park a good distance away. We pulled into a parking spot and without looking back I asked, \u201cReady to play, Rhema?\u201d And she was too excited, because she said clear as a bell, \u201cPaay! Paay!\u201d I just sat there for a minute, awe-filled, laughing like Sarah. ( \u2018God has brought me laughter\u2026\u2019 Gen. 21:6 ) Is this really real??? She clearly knew I was talking to her, she understood what I said, and she responded vocally, appropriately, wonderfully. In the past if I wanted any acknowledgement that I was on the same planet, I would have to stoop, get in her face, take away whatever she was stimming on and hope for one second of eye contact. Now. Now\u00a0she\u2019s shouting answers to me from the back of the car??!!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Lord!!! She\u2019s learning and understanding SO much, she\u2019s tracing letters, she\u2019s playing with her sister and interacting with babies, she\u2019s dining in restaurants, she\u2019s cooking in the kitchen, she\u2019s humming nursery rhymes, she\u2019s managing her day. \u201cI had a very vivid, long dream last night where Rhema and I spoke for a long time on a lot of things.\u201d We\u2019re dreaming big again.

Today my heart and mind go back to  Warrior\u2019s Walk, October 2010 The Fort Stewart field that welcomes 3rd Infantry Division soldiers home from deployment is surrounded by a living memorial known as  Warriors Walk . Redbud trees line the walkway, each one in honor of a soldier who died serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. An American flag and a name-bearing plaque marks each memorial. I walked this walk in the dark of night and then again in the crisp daylight, feeling the need to pause at every single tree \u2013 there are nearly 500 of them. Many have called it sacred ground. It may be so because in the midst of the memorials, one is compelled to reflect and remember, pray and give thanks. The words, always the words, capture me:             . Brandon\u2019s good friend, Jimmy, a fellow classmate and fellow pilot. . Family and friends place photos and mementos on the trees, leaving a glimpse into the life of their loved one. A guitar\u00a0amp, a Red Sox license plate, a gameboy, a cap, a jersey, golf balls, dogtags, boots \u2013 you are struck by the fact that these are men and women who lived, laughed and loved and gave it all.

{"date": "May 30, 2012", "body": "Life in Autism Land often brings unexpected joy and beautiful humor, and I love having this space to record it. It\u2019s startling how in an instant, moments in the journey can also bring a tidal wave of unsettling fear, heartache and discouragement. On the whole, we have not experienced a high degree of self-injurious and aggressive behavior from Rhema. She\u2019s certainly had periods of this, but it\u2019s been about a year since we\u2019ve seen anything of concern. For reasons I may never know, Rhema\u2019s aggressive behavior spiked this past weekend. Thankfully, all of it directed at me. \u00a0 Several times while we were riding in the car, she became upset, grabbed me by the top of the head and pulled out large clumps of my hair. On another occasion, seemingly out of the blue, she lunged toward me and clawed at my face. Honorable mention? She also got in a few really good bites on my hands. Each time afterward she would cover her face and weep. Her cheeks hot, clutching fistfulls of my hair in her hand. These moments are indelible scars\u00a0to the\u00a0heart. I watch her bewildered, hurt.\u00a0 What is going on???  \u00a0So sad for her; I know this is not my girl. I hold my breath trying to calm the fear and panic threatening to rush in. What if the aggressions get worse? What if we can\u2019t stop this? What will I do when she\u2019s fifteen? What will I do next week? The Army is calling Brandon away for another summer; he leaves in two weeks. Last summer was the  hardest time  I\u2019ve ever had handling Rhema\u2019s behaviors, and I did it alone. Now, just as he\u2019s leaving, the behaviors are ramping up. Again? How can I do this again? I came across this quote last week and it whispers to me over and over: \u201cAll I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.\u201d \n ~Ralph Waldo Emerson The husband goes shopping for a new refrigerator and I tag along, my whole being\u00a0battling for calm, for thankfulness. I say to no one in particular, \u201cSometimes I almost forget she has autism. And then days like this scream at me \u2018She really has autism!\u2019\u201d Somehow the dude working at the store, in the refrigerator section, totally understands why we need special locks on the fridge doors. He happens to be a pastor at a nearby church. His son is eight like our Rhema is eight. His son happens to have autism. A divine appointment, yes, that\u2019s what we call it. We share many stories, even though we already know each other\u2019s stories. And then, on a rainy night on planet Earth, in the United States, in a small town in Massachusetts, at a Lowe\u2019s store, in the refrigerator aisle, the three of\u00a0us\u00a0clasp hands\u00a0and we pray. And I know, know, know God is with me. And with her. And with us. . All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.

{"date": "December 21, 2009", "body": "Holidays have been kind of bittersweet for me the past few years. Rhema still does not \u201cget\u201d Christmas or birthdays. And, honestly, it took some of the fun out it for us as her parents. Why make a big fuss when Rhema seems to have no clue or care about such things. Last year we did not even put up a tree, and instead relied on the grandparents to do Christmas (as we have done for the past few years). This year has been different. With Brandon deployed, our annual trek to Michigan was not really an option (how we miss them).\u00a0This year it has really been my desire to make\u00a0Christmas special and meaningful to Rhema and Hope. But I had no idea where to start \u2013 I\u2019m not naturally good at this stuff. Enter Jess and her family.\u00a0Luau came over and put up our tree, and Jess gave me lots of ideas and sent Rhema-safe decorations (pom-pom garland and tinsel). And then, this weekend, they brought Christmas to us.\u00a0Luau dressed up as Santa,\u00a0Katie was an elf,\u00a0Brooke was a reindeer (and Jess came as Jess.) \u00a0  \u00a0  Oh, if you could have seen the look on Hope\u2019s face when Santa came through the door, bearing gifts galore! \n \nShe was literally frozen for a moment \u2014 wonder, surprise, excitement, dreams comes true. It was the kind of\u00a0moment that a mother treasures forever. (Most of these moments\u00a0have come for me in seeing others love my girls, and  nothing  touches my heart more). During the visit, Hope asked to see Santa\u2019s Nice List. (Up until this point she had been very concerned that she might be on Santa\u2019s naughty list\u2026 due to transgressions committed earlier in the week). Santa had come with just about every prop in the book, but he didn\u2019t bring his list. Jess\u00a0quickly came up with the excuse:\u00a0 \u201cOh, Santa left his list at the North Pole.\u201d While\u00a0Brooke dazzled me with her drawings of Boots, Benny, Tico and Isa and all the cast members of Godspell,\u00a0Katie worked on her own little project. Some time later\u00a0Katie produced a piece of paper with lots of names written on it; across the top it said: Nice List. And Hope, of course, was the very first name on the list. And Santa, of course, showed Hope that she was indeed on the Nice List. Katie\u00a0cares about the details. The entire time her focus was on making this a special time for Rhema and Hope.\u00a0 She is 8 \u00be years old, and\u00a0there\u2019s no doubt this girl is already having a profound impact on this world.\u00a0Katie and\u00a0Brooke both were so amazing and sweet. I seriously think Jess and\u00a0Luau should write books and teach seminars on parenting. These two little girls are the best of the best. When it was time to go, I stood Rhema to her feet and told her to give a high  five to Santa. She had not acknowledged Santa or shown any interest in him. But when I stood her up, instead of giving him a high five, she clambered up his legs, climbed over his big belly and right into his arms. It was PRICELESS\u2026 and perfect. \u00a0 And she didn\u2019t want to let go \u2013\u00a0I had to pry her out of his arms! Rhema doesn\u2019t\u00a0give her hugs to\u00a0many people. But I\u2019m convinced that she  recognizes love .\u00a0And it\u00a0made me wonder (again) if she actually\u00a0understands more than I give her credit for\u2026 like maybe she does get the idea of Santa. Truly it seemed that in that room with Jess and her family, just about anything was possible. Jess came with the gifts and well-wishes of many dear bloggy mamas. For the past few months I have been receiving \u2018encouragement packages\u2019 from friends \u2013 some of whom I have never met. Seriously, the timing is always\u00a0impeccable \u2013\u00a0a package arrives just when I\u2019m having a particularly rough day. (Thank you,  Michelle , for the way you inspire kindness). Try as I might I can\u2019t be eloquent about this.\u00a0The love and support we have received has been like nothing I have ever seen or could have imagined. It\u2019s like God really did open the windows of heaven and is heaping blessings upon my family. The only thing I can liken it to is the gift of grace through Christ \u2013 so lavishly given, so very undeserved. I can only say thank you, and hope you know that that\u00a0does not come close to conveying\u00a0our gratitude. Thank you for the thoughtful gifts. Thank you for your generosity.

{"date": "December 29, 2009", "body": "An apology is a good way to have the last word.  \n~Author Unknown I\u2019ve long struggled with how to handle conflict between Rhema and Hope. When an offense has been committed, I\u2019ve often observed other parents go through the make-up routine, facing the children to\u00a0each other and prompting one or both to say sorry and/or even give a hug. This little drill works somewhat in our house. When Hope is in the wrong, she is corrected and prompted to tell Rhema she\u2019s sorry.\u00a0In earnest\u00a0remorse, Hope will\u00a0say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rhema\u201d to\u2026 the air. Rhema is usually long gone. Or her back is turned or she\u2019s engrossed in a new activity. She does not seem to hear, want, understand or care for Hope\u2019s apology. Rhema\u2019s offenses against Hope stack high by the end of the day. She swipes toys and food. She breaks Strawberry Shortcake\u2019s head off. She rips Hope\u2019s prized artwork to shreds. She colors in Hope\u2019s books. She unintentionally crashes into Hope and knocks her down as she sprints about the house in a continuous loop. Rhema does not often seem to \u201cget\u201d that she\u2019s hurt her sister, and while Hope has often tried to hug Rhema, Rhema has never hugged Hope. I have tried to get Rhema to give Hope a high-five (in replacement of the make-up hug), but this is usually far from smooth. I have often wiped Hope\u2019s tears and said, \u201cRhema\u2019s sorry, honey. She\u2019s sorry. She just can\u2019t always show you.\u201d After Christmas, the girls were playing and Rhema somehow slammed the lid of a toy onto Hope\u2019s finger. It was unintentional, but Hope seemed deeply hurt and cried hard. I stooped to her and tried to comfort her, but she was dramatic and distraught. I grabbed Rhema with one hand as she ran by. \u201cRhema, you really hurt Hope\u2019s finger. You have to be careful.\u201d I said, thinking I\u2019d used way too many words. I looked at Hope. I sensed that for once she just really needed Rhema to acknowledge her, to look at her and see her tears. Rhema tried to squirm out of my grasp, and then she threw her head back and burst into laughter. The harder Hope cried, the harder Rhema laughed, her body shaking with it. Uh oh. \u201cUm. Rhema, say sorry to Hope\u2026 Say sorry.\u201d Until this point, I had never tried to get Rhema to say sorry. Never. I was simply sure she could not do it. Perhaps reading the \u201c sorry   stories \u201d of blogfriends emboldened me. And the crying and laughing had escalated to such a degree in the house that I thought, hey, what the heck. \u201cRhema. Say sorry.\u201d Rhema stopped giggling. The heavens opened and the stars aligned and Hope and I nearly fainted when Rhema said, plain as day, \u201c Saw .  Eeee .\u201d And then she bolted. Even Hope\u2019s tears were in shock because they stopped dead in their tracks on her cheeks. As we stared, a wide grin popped out on her face. \u201cShe said sorry!\u201d \n\u201cShe said sorry!\u201d \n\u201cRhema\u2019s sorry!\u201d We danced around the living room, saying it over and over.

{"date": "November 4, 2010", "body": "So often in Autism Land we must come up with temporary fixes. In fact, maybe\u00a0 all  of our\u00a0solutions are just\u00a0temporary fixes. Do\u00a0we ever really get to mark the Trouble Ticket as Closed? More times than not Plan A\u00a0just gives way to\u00a0Plan G.\u00a0We usually find ourselves\u00a0settling for solutions that will just buy us time until we can figure out another solution. Our kids are just  that  clever, persistent and resourceful. Many months ago I started having a problem with Rhema in her booster seat in the van. She would undo the buckle and run around the inside of the van turning on interior lights and licking windows. She\u2019d climb into the back and dutifully put on her bike helmet and try to ride her bike. In the trunk. All while I was driving. I\u2019d pull over,\u00a0buckle her back in her seat. By the time I was back in my own seat, she was out of hers. It was dangerous for all of us and completely unnerving for me. Commands and pleas\u00a0to\u00a0\u201cstay in your seat\u201d went unheard and unheeded.\u00a0There was no way to explain the dangers of standing, jumping, skating (yes, one day\u00a0a friend put hand-me-down skates in my trunk)\u00a0and  biking  in a moving vehicle\u00a0to a pre-verbal child. So we express-ordered lots of different seatbelt covers. It took me a good, frustrating\u00a045 minutes to put the seatbelt cover on, but after I got\u00a0it on I was triumphant. \u00a0 You keep me on my toes, little girl, but you gotta\u00a0get up pretty early in the morning to outsmart me\u2026I got an A in Calculus. \u00a0 I put Rhema in her seat and\u00a0smugly watched her try\u00a0to unlatch herself. She noticed the cover and I detected curiosity in her face \u2013 I was at least hoping for annoyed. In\u00a02 seconds she\u00a0manuvered the seatbelt cover off and hoped out of her chair. I groaned, and tossed\u00a0the cover down in the car in disgust. The next time she got in the car she picked up the cover and tried to put it back on herself \u2013 because well, it was supposed to be there \u2013 just so she could take it off again. During the summer, the director of Hope\u2019s preschool called me about a large special needs car seat that had been donated to the school, and did I want it? I was dealing with so much at the time \u2013 Rhema\u2019s lead poisoning and moving out of our house \u2013 I felt like the special needs chair was a total Godsend. However, when I picked up the carseat I knew right away that it wasn\u2019t a solution \u2013 Rhema would surely learn to undo the harness. But at least it would buy me some time. She actually figured out how to get out within days, but she\u00a0was mildly entertained by the big, blue oversized chair\u00a0and the old Superman stickers on the buckle. So she didn\u2019t bother getting out for a whopping 3 months!\u00a0But then one day she\u00a0decided she\u2019d had enough and went back to her somersaulting-through-the-van antics. Last month when I was driving on a busy highway I suddenly felt her standing behind me, breathing on the back of my neck.\u00a0When I\u00a0realized she was methodically placing Fritos in my hair I knew it was time for a new \u2018buying time\u2019 solution. Bring out the big guns. I spoke with the nurse at Rhema\u2019s school about a harness-tether system that she uses for her own son. She told me it would change my life. I ordered the equipment through a bus company/distributor in another state, and it arrived last week. Here I present our latest solution:  Operation Harness and Hook Her . ( Say that fast. Hee hee.) \u00a0 This nifty vest zips in the back and has mounting shoulder straps that back-thread and lock! There are D rings with snap hooks (but I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re for)! There\u00a0are crotch straps and loops that a lap belt can be threaded through! Tether hooks on the vest attach to a vehicle tether\u00a0anchor/floor mount system (that we\u2019re still installing in the van)  behind her seat ! (I\u2019m so excited)! And all I have to say is,  \u201cTop this, Rhema girl. I dare you!\u201d . \n(I mean, Look at that face.  It\u2019s. O n. ) . Meh. I give her a week. .

Her name is  Carrie . We met eight years ago when our husbands were stationed at Fort Bragg, NC. Carrie gave birth to her daughter, \u201cGracie.\u201d (I still have the baby shower pics!) We\u00a0lost touch with each other when we moved away.\u00a0 A couple years later I heard that her sweet Gracie had been diagnosed with autism. After Rhema was diagnosed, I tried for months to get in touch with Carrie. I finally found her e-mail address\u2026 and we have talked via phone and e-mail almost every week for the past three years. She has always led the way for me. When Gracie was born I watched Carrie blossom into an amazing\u00a0mother. I took notes; she was the coolest mom I\u2019d ever seen! She has four children now, and she mothers them all with calm and grace. I can call with my frustrations and hear her say,  \u201cWe did the Poop Art years. I know. I get it. It gets better.\u201d  She and her husband Josh are purposeful in teaching their kids how to live, behave and treat others, but\u00a0other areas\u00a0they take a mellow, laid back approach.\u00a0It has been so good for me to learn from them. For example, Gracie likes to bake. Every day. She\u2019s not particularly interested in eating her creations; she just enjoys the process. I would be concerned over wasted eggs and time, and messes to clean up day after day, but not Carrie. Every day she lets Gracie  be  who she is, she encourages her and applauds her creativity and imagination. Carrie\u2019s children do  well  and live life to the full. They are happy and content, genuine and polite \u2013 the kind of children you just thoroughly enjoy being around. She encourages me to take risks with Rhema, to not be afraid of failure. Sometimes she seems to know what Rhema is ready for before I do. \u00a0Only Carrie could convince me to pack up the girls and drive to Pennsylvania to visit her family\u2026 A supposed six hour drive turned into a ten hour\u00a0trip (gotta love traffic in NY), and Rhema did better than I could have imagined, weathering the whole thing with a smile on her face. The weekend was full, wonderful, refreshing \u2013 just what we needed. (Hope seriously expected\u00a0that we were going to get pencils in Pennsylvania). Lots of pool time, Scrabble games, a Starbucks run, an iTouch discovery,\u00a0good food and fun, a princess (Hope), a knight (Mark), a bad guy (John), and a handsome prince (Ben). The girls and I laughed and loved a lot. Loved being in their state and their space, loved being loved by this\u00a0dear family. One of my favorite posts of Carrie\u2019s\u00a0is  Expecting the Unexpected . We\u2019ve both often said we wouldn\u2019t have wished for autism to touch our lives, but we are thankful for the unexpected blessings. Our friendship has been one of those blessings.\u00a0She is my discerning,\u00a0protective and faithful friend for the journey.  There\u2019s nothing like a friend who will go to God for you.  I am blessed beyond\u00a0measure to have friends that do. In Carrie, I\u00a0see again God\u2019s extravagant love and marvelous provision.

There was the comfort of prayers felt and received. There was Hope crying because Daddy was leaving \u2013 he was only going to the store \u2013 but she thought maybe he might be gone for a long time again, like maybe a year. In her bedtime prayers she prayed, \u201cAnd please let Daddy have a good time while he stays here.\u201d I pray that, too.

It\u2019s been a guessing game the past couple months. All throughout I\u2019ve been getting a  crash course  on  learning to trust God with my daughter\u2019s future . I often  think  I know what I want, but at times I know better than to even trust my wants. So I\u2019ve gone back and forth: I don\u2019t want to move\u2026 but maybe there\u2019s something for us in DC\u2026 or somewhere else\u2026 and I just can\u2019t see it yet\u2026 so maybe I should want to move??

{"date": "April 8, 2013", "body": "One of Rhema\u2019s most enjoyable activities is coloring. If she finds a pen, pencil, marker, crayon, crochet hook, strawberry or apple slice she is going to scribble hard on any paper, wall, table, article of clothing in her vicinity. At school her teachers have found ways to engage her while she\u2019s coloring. Rhema has learned to use the communication app on her iPad to say, \u201cI want you to color with me.\u201d My mother got her a Dora book with a paintbrush and paint,\u00a0so I set her up at the table with a plastic cup of water. I guided her hand as she dipped the brush in the water and then the paint and then her paper. She\u00a0enjoyed smashing the bristles of the brushes into the paint. My sister called, and we yacked on the phone as I swept the floor. As we said goodbye I heard Rhema guzzling down her drink.\u00a0Slowly I remembered I had not given her a drink. I rushed over to find the plastic cup of dirty paint water completely empty. Rhema wiped the back of her hand across her purple-stained lips, satisfied. I screamed. She stared. And then I laughed. =} ~ At church, we didn\u2019t last very long in the sanctuary. So we went upstairs to an empty classroom where Rhema quickly found the art supplies. She hummed happily and drew \u201cB\u2019s\u201d all over her paper. As she colored, I daydreamed. She turned nine years old last week and it\u2019s been harder for me than I\u2019d like to admit. There are all these convoluted thoughts of nostalgia and age-appropriateness \u2013 (Is that a word?). She\u2019s growing and changing right before my eyes and I\u2019m thankful, but I miss my sweet baby. But I don\u2019t want her to be a baby. But she\u2019s still kind of like a baby in many ways. Ahhh! This week I was hyper-sensitive to the contrasts \u2013 the fact that I was shopping for the bath toys (she loves) in the baby aisle and scoping out training bras at the same time. The fact that she still can\u2019t blow out the candles on a cake. It was like a marquee flashing across the backs of my eyelids: \u201c This is really real. She\u2019s nine. And autism is still here.\u201d  Instead of hearing her humming and soft utterances I suddenly only heard babbling. In an evaluation for her IEP meeting her speech-language pathologist wrote,  \u201cRhema currently presents with a limited phonemic repertoire. She currently does not contain a number of age-appropriate sounds within her speech. With sounds Rhema does have in her repertoire, she is inconsistent in their use across word positions.\u201d  \u00a0I know this, of course I know this. But it hit me hard, seeing it in writing. This week even the fact that Hope at age 6 has homework and Rhema has never had \u201chomework\u201d\u00a0(she actually works very hard at\u00a0home)\u00a0was cause for pain, and I don\u2019t even like homework!  \u201cCan you believe it? It\u2019s been nine years.\u201d My mother had come over, bearing birthday gifts. I knew she was remembering with me, the day Rhema made me a mother, stole all our hearts forever. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s going too fast.\u201d I looked at my fingers as if sand from an hourglass was slipping right through them. \u201cIs there really no way to slow time?\u201d She sighed, \u201cHoney, if there was you\u2019d still be my little girl\u2026\u201d ~ Rhema\u2019s hand on my hand brought me out of my thoughts, back to the Sunday school room. She was looking at me with her huge brown eyes and I promise you for a moment we were back in that hospital room, at the edge of a great adventure, checking each other out for the first time. I just wanted to hold her forever. Unprompted she said, \u201cCo-. Co-.\u201d We did not have her iPad with the communication app with us. So she put a crayon in my hand and tried again. \u201cCo-.

In years past if you tried to hold her in your arms she\u2019d squirm and run for her life like you\u2019d just eaten garlic pizza and onion rings. Then one day she succumbed to Hope\u2019s daily hug attacks and . She started hugging  everybody.  You could be a total stranger reading People magazine in the waiting room, and Rhema would sit in your lap and hug you. You could be at the playground minding your business and you might get an awkward bear hug from behind. Lately, Rhema\u2019s frustrations and aggressions have increased. I daresay there\u2019s been more grabbing, scratching, hitting and biting than hugging. In fact it seems she\u2019s almost forgotten how to hug. If you ask for a hug and hold your arms out wide, she may lean in sideways, tilt her shoulder. Or she\u2019ll do the armless hug \u2013 where you hug her while she stands still with her arms pinned to her sides.

Something new has emerged in recent days. She will now, quite politely, \u201cask\u201d for a kiss. Hope gets the biggest kick out of it \u2013 the way Rhema will out of the blue come and present her cheek for you to kiss. When she does it we feel sooo special! Quietly B and I have our concerns \u2013 how do we protect her and help her understand what\u2019s appropriate when it comes to touch and affection. (If you see Rhema expecting kisses from random strangers, let me know!) So it goes with autism, just as we celebrate something new, we plan how we\u2019ll handle it if goes to extremes or becomes an obsession. Just as we rejoice in something gained, we brace ourselves for that something lost. But for now there is this. A father, mother and little sister who love to show how much we love her. And a nine year old girl who loves us more than she can say, so she finds ways to show us. On days when every single thing is hard, when the worries are all-consuming, when the tantrums and the battles and the weariness break my heart, that little proffered cheek means everything. No words necessary. . **Oh! I keep forgetting to post this. Jen K. won the  book giveaway !

Well. The amazing teachers at Rhema\u2019s afterschool therapy program have been working on a new invention for months. Now. It still has a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out.

{"date": "April 26, 2013", "body": "\u201cI want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel\u2026\u201d We\u2019ve been reading Paul\u2019s letter to the Philippians in my Bible Study. Paul was specially called by God to preach the gospel. And yet he constantly found himself imprisoned; he spent roughly six years of his ministry as a prisoner. He was put to death in Rome after his last incarceration. Why would God do this, allow such confinement of the man he appointed to proclaim His Word? \u201cThis is my gospel, for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God\u2019s word is not chained.\u201d (2 Tim 2:8) When Rhema was born we, like most new parents, sent out a birth announcement. Brandon explained the meaning of her name: Rhema  (pronounced  ray-mah ) is the Greek word God uses to describe the living, soul-stirring communication He uses to reveal Truth to individuals.\u00a0 It is the \u201crhema\u201d that draws each person to salvation.\u00a0 Romans 10:8-9, 17 states, \u201cThe word [rhema] is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word [rhema] of faith we are proclaiming:\u00a0 That if you confess with your mouth, \u2018Jesus is Lord,\u2019 and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u2026consequently, faith comes by hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word [rhema] of Christ.\u201d\u00a0 It is our prayer that Rhema will be used as God\u2019s instrument to communicate the Truth of God\u2019s Word to many souls who need to hear the message of hope and forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. We gave her a middle name after her great-great-grandmother who spent many years praying for all of her children and grandchildren to come to faith. We hoped Rhema would be a bold witness to everyone around her just as her great-great-grandmother had been. It\u2019s funny looking back. We had such big plans for her (we still do). Before she was born we\u2019d already envisioned who she would be and how things would go. Our purposes were good, just what we thought God would want our purposes for her to be. When she was diagnosed with autism and a seizure condition that assaults the speech and language centers of the brain \u2013 we felt duped, offended, disappointed that God would allow our good dreams to be crushed. Over the years I\u2019ve come to understand that God\u2019s dreams for my children are far bigger than my own. Indeed I\u2019ve seen that \u201cwhat has happened to her really has served to advance the gospel.\u201d Some have encouraged me, saying that I speak for her through this blog. Yes, I record the stories and share what God is teaching  me  through it all. But I believe that she speaks (and will speak in whatever form that may be \u2013 writing, pictures, etc.) for herself. God\u2019s word is not chained by prison walls or epilepsy or autism. Years ago I also saw myself serving and ministering in very specific ways. Since then my own failures have left me constantly battling feelings of guilt, unworthiness, and the whispers in my head that I\u2019ve no right to speak. But I am strengthened by this fact: if God can spread His Word across continents and decades through a jailbird and  speak Word through a girl without words , then He can still speak through bumbling me. Even now Paul\u2019s joy and courage embolden me, and Rhema always inspires.\u00a0 So I say (if you are still reading at this point): Jesus loves you. He takes away the pain of sin and death and gives Life. If you\u00a0will trust\u00a0him, He will\u00a0meet you and say,  \u201cI have loved you with an everlasting love. I have swept away your sins like a cloud, I have scattered your offenses like the morning mist. Oh, return to me, for\u00a0I have paid the price to set you free.\u201d  I am so thankful\u00a0for grace, that we don\u2019t have to be eloquent or deserving or even good\u00a0to gain\u00a0Christ, we just have to believe. That\u2019s gospel truth. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/sayin-it/", "title": "Sayin\u2019 it"},
{"date": "April 12, 2013", "body": "Rhema\u2019s taken up texting. She often\u00a0finds my phone and starts sending people cryptic messages. She likes to pick a letter or number or symbol and press it repeatedly for like 5 minutes and then hit Send. Family and friends\u00a0have come to recognize her messages -(although my friend Leah once teased, \u201cJ, stop texting when you are drunk.\u201d) It\u2019s like deciphering hieroglyphics.

Love you!\u201d Mercifully, only my email address is on her iTouch, and she sends me lots of messages.\u00a0I can\u2019t help but smile when I\u2019m not with her and I start getting her texts\u00a0in rapid succession.

I used to not let myself go there, not hope too much. But all her life, God and Rhema have been blowing my mind, doing the extraordinary.

{"date": "April 1, 2014", "body": "She\u2019d heard the long hushed conversations. She\u2019d caught me brush away a tear. She\u2019d prayed with me every night for her aunt (my twin). Finally she asked, \u201cWhat is MS anyway?\u201d I put her off. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when you\u2019re older.\u201d \u201cYou and Daddy seem to do this a lot. I ask a question and you always say you\u2019ll tell me when I\u2019m older. But I want to know a lot of stuff now. I\u2019m seven years old!\u201d I smiled. \u201cOh, my Hope. Ok. So. Our bodies have things called nerves. Think of a nerve like the cable we use to charge Rhema\u2019s iPad. Nerves carry messages from the brain to other parts of the body \u2013 like your eyes and your elbows and your feet \u2013 and tell them what to do. Cool, right? And we have a ton of nerves in our body. When you have MS the lining that covers the nerves gets damaged and forms lots of scars. It makes it hard for the brain to get messages to other parts of the body. So sometimes people with MS have trouble seeing or walking or using their hands and other stuff.\u201d \u201cBut then they take medicine and it goes away.\u201d \u201cWell, no. There are medicines that might help them feel better. But\u2026 there is no medicine that will make this go away.\u201d I watched the understanding sink in and saw my fears mirrored back as she thought of her beloved aunt, and her eyes filled. I hurried on, \u201cBut isn\u2019t it so cool how our brains are like computers? I\u2019m holding this cup right now and I\u2019m looking at you and breathing and thinking and talking and there is so much, Hope, a million miraculous things going on inside me to make that happen-\u201d And then she said something she\u2019s heard and said many times and come to believe, \u201cGod is good all the time.\u201d The moment I knew Rhema had autism I called my sister. She listened and cried and prayed with me and comforted me. Then she hung up the phone and went to the emergency room because she had no feeling in her legs. That same day she was diagnosed with MS. Since then, eight years ago, my greatest fears in life have centered around my daughter and my sister. The mind is very good at imagining disastrous endings. Still, all along I have made a choice to believe that God will care for them, even better than me. But a series of seemingly unfavorable events in recent weeks forced me to ask \u201cWhat if God doesn\u2019t come through?\u201d, \u201cWhat if my deepest fears one day are realized?\u201d And there was an earthquake because everything around me seemed to come crashing down and I was shaken to the core. But Hope was waiting. I was supposed to say it back in reverse. It\u2019s an old Don Moen song, and they say it in the church I grew up in in a call and response style, \u201cGod is good all the time\u2026\u201d This is silly, I thought. I don\u2019t have to say it. I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m lost. I\u2019ve never been so scared.  But Hope was waiting. \u201cAll the time God is good.\u201d I mumble-whispered it.  Because trusting still sits well with my soul . Saying the words forced me to remember what is true, and this is true: The Maker of brains and voices and myelin sheaths and fingers and feet is  good . And His mercy and goodness follow me, follow my sister, follow my Rhema and Hope and Brandon, all the moments of the days of our lives. Never once has there been a lapse in His goodness. He walks besides us all the way. Endings, yes. But not disastrous when you have the hope of heaven where there will be no more disability, pain, sickness and sorrow. Some call it all a crutch or Santa Claus. For us it is \u201c hope maketh not ashamed .\u201d . \u201cThough I may not understand \n  All the plans you have for me \n  My life is in your hands \n  And through the eyes of faint \n  I can clearly see that \n  God is good all the time.\u201d \n~Don Moen ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A5&version=KJV"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/still-good/", "title": "Still good"},
{"date": "March 3, 2014", "body": "The night Brandon was packing to return to Kuwait we had Christmas all over again. He\u2019d brought home the hundreds of cards and letters he received in response to my  Mail Call  back in December. He and Hope spread them out all over the bed, and I was overwhelmed with gratitude. It was such a gift to read the words and see the faces of friends we know and those we don\u2019t know but somehow God has connected us. Thank you, thank you truly. From Brandon: \n Once again during this deployment I am touched by the generosity and kindness toward me and my family. In so many ways people have filled in the gaps while I have been gone. And, when my wife posted a request for cards here on this blog, I was overwhelmed with the flow of mail. A few hundred cards and packages came my way. From individuals, schools, and organizations. From all over the world. Amazing! I am late with my thank you here because when one doesn\u2019t know what to do/say in response to such a thing, one procrastinates. So, I will just have to say THANK YOU. Please know that the outpouring of mail was greatly appreciated. I took in all of the cards and letters and notes. If you sent a card during the Christmas season, you made my day when it arrived. Thank you. B\u2019s time at home was great. Two weeks is just long enough to get re-integrated as a family, and I almost forgot that having him home is not \u201cnormal\u201d for us. Now that he\u2019s gone again I admit I\u2019m smarting a little to be back in our same old circumstances. Over the weekend I posted the following on Rhemashope\u2019s Facebook page (in fact if you\u2019re on FB the next few paragraphs are a repeat!): We said goodbye to the husband/father yesterday at the airport. Hope cried buckets of tears. Rhema didn\u2019t seem to understand when he held her and said goodbye, she was too excited to be going on a trip. She tried to follow him as he walked \u2026away. I was business-like(Ok, Be safe, See you soon.) \u2013 a thousand concerns already swirling my head. So thankful this is not goodbye for good, only goodbye for 4.5 months. We\u2019ve had many of these goodbyes; they never get easy. \u201cHow lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.\u201d ~Winnie the Pooh Lastly, Rhema is scheduled for surgery tomorrow (Tuesday).\u00a0It\u2019s considered minor surgery. But when autism is in the mix things considered \u201cminor\u201d are sometimes anything but. There\u2019s the fasting before the surgery, the wait time at the hospital, the anesthesia, the recovery period,\u00a0the fact that this is not Rhema\u2019s usual hospital, the fact that the husband is deployed, the fact that I have no real way of communicating to her\u2026 what is happening \u2013 these are things that make this procedure *not* minor. Because sometimes small things can make a really big difference.  Thank you for sharing in our lives. \n\t\tThis entry was posted in  Uncategorized .

{"date": "March 14, 2014", "body": "Before Rhema\u2019s surgery on Tuesday I worked with a Child Life Specialist at the hospital to develop an Autism Care Plan. The Plan is designed to help medical staff address the unique non-medical needs of patients with autism such as communication methods, environmental adaptations, and sensory preferences. The goal is to make the hospital experience as comfortable as possible whether it\u2019s speaking softly or changing the lighting in the room or providing weighted blankets. Rhema\u2019s Plan was very detailed and I actually felt excited to see it in action. I knew that her Plan had been attached to her medical record but I was amazed to find that every nurse and doctor we worked with had really  read  the Plan! They understood that Rhema is absolutely offended by hospital beds \u2013 she\u2019s had one too many EEGs and there\u2019s no way in the world she will sit or lie down one. So they removed the bed before we got to the pre-op room. Also, the nurses knew not to attempt getting a blood pressure while she was still awake. They had an iPad ready to go with her favorite games and a Jazz station cued on Pandora to help her through the waiting period. There were coloring supplies and fidget toys. To help prepare her for getting a mask on her face, the Child Life Specialist coated the inside of the mask with cotton candy flavored chapstick and Rhema was intrigued and put the mask to her face several times! I was able to be with her in the OR until she went to sleep. I held her (or tried to)\u00a0while they put the mask on \u2013 of course she put up a good fight \u2013 she tried to run straight out the door. Later in the recovery room she woke up slowly, humming. A recovery nurse\u00a0told me, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a child come out of anesthesia singing. She has a lovely voice.\u201d \u201cI get to hear her song every day,\u201d I said, feeling like the luckiest mother in the world. I\u2019ve been clinging hard to the Truth that my God has a care plan. Sounds simple, but it\u2019s so hard to believe. I mean,  really believe . We go from crisis to crisis and sometimes it seems the stream of problems will never let up. We are troubled on every side. But like Rhema when she\u2019s got an ink pen clutched in her hand (about to color the world) and there\u2019s no prying it out, we can hold on to this: \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cThey are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.\u201d ~Jer. 29:11 He\u2019s got this. He\u00a0loves us and knows us, every little detail \u2013 down to the number of hairs on our head. He sits with us in the waiting. Surrounds us with help and encouragement. Prepares our hearts for what lies ahead. Holds us to the end. My heartfelt thanks to the staff at Mass General.

{"date": "March 18, 2014", "body": "Well, it\u2019s that time again. Rhema\u2019s IEP meeting is this week. Crazy to think we\u2019ve been doing this since she was three years old and now she\u2019s almost ten! Brandon will Skype in for the meeting as he\u2019s done in previous years when he\u2019s deployed. But there will be someone else with a seat at the table\u2026 (Originally published February 2012) \u201cEven now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.\u201d \n~ Job 16:19 . We head into Rhema\u2019s IEP meeting in a couple hours. I am not anxious. Perhaps it\u2019s because we know our girl is right where she needs to be. And I\u2019m confident that her school placement will remain as is for another year. Perhaps it\u2019s because we trust her team of teachers and therapists completely. Still, there\u2019s such emotion attached to the IEP meeting \u2013 something I cannot really articulate. The lump in the throat. The pit in the stomach. The shock that I\u2019m still shocked that we\u2019re even there. And that the child we\u2019re talking about so intently is  my little girl , my Rhema. I can never walk into one IEP meeting, without thinking of all the meetings in the past\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget the day we met with the local school district to discuss Rhema\u2019s academic setting. \u201cI thought I was totally prepared for this,\u201d I said on the phone to my mother before the meeting. \u201cBut now I think we should have hired an advocate. Someone who understands it all better than I do and will speak for us when we can\u2019t, and stand in our place. We need someone in the know to represent Rhema\u2019s best interests.\u201d My mother, a retired special education teacher who\u2019d participated in a bajillion IEP meetings during her career, said simply, \u201cYou do have an Advocate.\u201d When we arrived at the meeting, the Out of District Coordinator had just finished observing Rhema in her substantially separate pre-school classroom. She shared testing results with us, noting that they\u2019d been largely unsuccessful in conducting  any  testing with Rhema. I began making my case for why we believed our 3-year old little girl needed to be outplaced \u2013 in a school specifically for children with special needs. We\u2019d visited a number of schools, and honestly I\u2019d been scared to death. Most of the students were in their teens and their autism \u2013 their need for support \u2013 had startled me. At the time, the last thing in the world I wanted to do was send my baby off to a private autism school. But I knew it\u2019s what she needed, I knew she was drowning in her current school setting. So I stuffed down my fears, put on my Mama Bear face and detailed our concerns about the current program and what we needed to do for Rhema. But the Special Ed Administrator was distracted. I realized she was looking past me. I stopped mid-sentence and turned around to see my husband beside me, dressed in his ACU\u2019s (Army Combat Uniform), quietly crying. I don\u2019t know what happened after that. I was struck by Brandon\u2019s heartache;  fathers hurt, too . The tone in the room changed, like someone had injected tenderness and cooperation into the air, and I knew then for sure that God would take care of us. By day\u2019s end, the school administration was completely on board with the plan to move Rhema to our school of choice. And again, a couple years later, they supported her move to the wonderful autism school she now attends. So as we head into today\u2019s IEP, I know we\u2019ll talk about Rhema, her beautiful personality, and our vision for her. I know we\u2019ll celebrate her accomplishments over the past year \u2013 she has come so far! I know we\u2019ll examine the areas in which she struggles and strategies to help her overcome those challenges. I know we\u2019ll discuss in depth, the plans and goals for the next year. I will be excited about the new programs and new skills she\u2019ll learn\u2026 I have every confidence she will succeed in her own Rhema way. I will try not to be sad that she still can\u2019t do x, y, and z, and that there has to be such an elaborate plan to help her learn. And call me crazy but I will look over at the empty chair at the table, and know that even as our hearts hurt a little, we are not alone. The Advocate will be there. . ***A Book Giveaway*** \nChicken Soup\u2019s \u201cThe Multitasking Mom\u2019s Survival Guide\u201d is in bookstores today. I\u2019ve got a funny story in it.

{"date": "March 23, 2014", "body": "I have nothing profound to say, but I do have cute stories to share. For a full week Rhema could not sleep. Instead she screamed and shrieked for hours on end. Each night I thought to myself, surely she will finally rest and we will all get some sleep. But no. Then one evening last week Hope yelled from the bathroom: \u201c MOMMY!!!  I found a big fat tooth on the floor. And it\u2019s NOT mine!\u201d She\u00a0raced down the stairs and I confirmed that it indeed was a bloody molar. We ran to Rhema. \u201cYou lost a tooth!! You lost a tooth!!!\u201d Rhema looked at us, bored out of her mind. I showed her the tooth. She took it and headed toward the trash can. I stopped her just before she tossed it in the garbage. Hope, on the other hand, was beside herself with excitement that the Tooth Fairy would be making an appearance that night. The Tooth Fairy was thinking  Oh shoot, I\u2019m broke. Rhema slept through the night and several nights after that. Days later I had an Aha! moment. I remembered that during the sleepless nights I\u2019d often find her in the bathroom at 1 or 2 am trying to brush her teeth. Maybe she\u2019d been experiencing tooth pain all those nights?? And I just did not know, did not put the pieces together. I did not know she had a loose tooth, and I didn\u2019t even know when she lost\u00a0it.\u00a0Sometimes it\u2019s scary to think of all the things that I might be missing\u2026 and sad to think there are things, so many things, she\u2019s never been able to tell. I\u2019m trying to be ok with it. As her mother I\u2019m supposed to know, I  want  to know. I\u2019m trying to trust that God  knows , and that\u2019s enough. Anyway Hope left a note for the Tooth Fairy explaining everything: (Yes, Hope always, always has her sister\u2019s back). Which leads me to the History Fair. Hope got to do\u00a0a project on Rosa Parks and she worked on it for weeks. She asked me to make cookies in the shapes of busses for the night of the Fair. It felt a little irreverent to me but I bought a bus-shaped cookie cutter. Then she eagerly asked me to draw little chocolate Rosa Parks on the busses. And I said noooooo. When Hope learned that Rosa Parks was the first woman to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, she decided she wanted her diorama for the History Fair to depict this. She built a little coffin and put one of her brown-skinned dolls on top. She made a flower arrangement\u00a0out of Rainbow Loom bands. She drew lots of people standing around looking sad. I suggested it was a little morbid, but there was no deterring her. On the night of the fair, she brought Ms. Rosa Parks to life. She was awesome. Hope as Rosa Parks So go these days with my frizzy haired girls. I am often exhausted and overwhelmed and buoyed by tender moments with both of them every day. The house is filled with their songs. For Hope it\u2019s an old Vacation Bible School tune or her piano music or every song (on repeat)\u00a0from the movie Frozen. For Rhema, it\u2019s her continuous soft hums. (Thank you, by the way, for your kind words about Rhema\u2019s voice. I\u2019ve always thought it was beautiful, but I\u2019m her mom so I\u2019m biased. Your comments helped me enjoy her songs even more and I feel special I get to hear them every day). In a devotional I\u2019m reading by  Sarah Young  the following words went right into my heart: Listen to the love song that I am continually singing to you. I take great delight in you. I rejoice over you with singing\u2026 Trust me and don\u2019t be afraid, for I am your Strength and Song. The Lord, the Lord, is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.  ~Isaiah 12:2 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/toothfairy-letter.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/rosa.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Calling-Enjoying-Peace-Presence/dp/1591451884"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/these-days-2/", "title": "These days"},
{"date": "January 7, 2016", "body": "I want to tell you about our progress with RPM (Rapid Prompting Method). It\u2019s been 8 months since Rhema had her first RPM session. We\u2019ve traveled to Wisconsin and Texas and worked with the experts. Last summer we attended one of Soma\u2019s RPM camps, and we were changed forever when Rhema demonstrated her intelligence, thoughtfulness and sense of humor by spelling words on a stencil board. Since then she and I have worked nearly every day together to learn how to improve her communication through this method. For more info on RPM, click  here . Our friend and beloved therapist Terre volunteers her Saturday mornings to work with Rhema. We\u2019ve had many setbacks and frustrations. Days of tears and epic fails. We\u2019ve also had moments of remarkable success. I\u2019ve tried not to fret about our pace or compare our rate of progress to others. Every time we hit a snag I read, study videos, and pray for insight\u2026 a lot. At this point we are practicing spelling words or short phrases on a letter board and doing some math (addition, subtraction). She is growing more confident about answering open ended questions at the end of each lesson (more about that later). I used to shy away from \u201cteaching\u201d her academic topics because of my own insecurities. RPM has given me the opportunity to share in learning with Rhema and opened my eyes to how capable she really is. Now we talk about subjects I never dreamed we would. She does not speak words, she does not give eye contact, and often she doesn\u2019t appear to be listening at all. But no doubt we are conversing. In the past, I would not always tell her about things that were happening \u2013 a\u00a0doctor appointment, trip or change in routine. I\u2019d think, Why bother? Now I build an RPM lesson around an upcoming event. As a result she\u2019s handled situations so much better simply because I told her about them and helped her understand what to expect. Another mom called it dignity. My girl has dignity now \u2013 I see it in her eyes. And I could cry\u00a0thinking that we\u2019ve been (unintentionally) withholding it from her for\u00a0years. Every day I wake up hopeful and excited. I honestly can\u2019t wait until the evening when we do our lessons. I can\u2019t wait to discuss the different shapes of butterfly eggs or the pattern on a woodpecker\u2019s wings or the layers of the forest habitat or Joseph\u2019s coat of many colors. One night after a series of lessons on the butterfly lifecycle, I asked her about her favorite color of butterfly. She independently spelled HOT PIENK. Yes. HOT PIENK!! Now I keep a picture of a pink butterfly on my phone and bring it up when I need a lift\u2026 on the train to work, during a meeting, in the middle of the night, every day. Around Christmas time we studied the birth of Christ and I asked her if she remembered what \u201cImmanuel\u201d means. She spelled, GOD WITH US Yes He is, dear one. Weeks ago I shared with her how God made a way for His people in the book of Exodus and how time and time again He\u2019s done the same for me. I asked her what she thought about \u201cGod making a way\u201d, and she spelled RHEMA. (She gets it. She  gets  it.) I finally get to talk with my girl. And hear from her, too (it\u2019s slow and painstaking and sometimes just a single spelled word). It\u2019s been so long coming, almost 12 years. My heart is pounding with hope and joy. We\u2019re waiting for more. But even if the \u201cmore\u201d doesn\u2019t come, if we stay right here \u2013 where we are now, it\u2019s all been a gift anyway, a sweet gift words can\u2019t begin to convey.

{"date": "March 3, 2016", "body": "\u201cHe loved you before all worlds; long ere the day star flung his ray across the darkness, before the wing of angel had flapped the unnavigated ether, before aught of creation had struggled from the womb of nothingness, God, even our God, had set his heart upon all his children\u2026Ye who have tasted of his love and know his grace, will bear me witness, that he has been in uncertain circumstances a certain friend.\u201d ~Charles Spurgeon Sometimes you think you\u2019re lacking something. And then you realize what you do have is somehow\u00a0sweeter and more than you could have imagined. I was reminded of this\u00a0when reading a story to Rhema about Zacchaeus, a tax collector by trade in Bible times who stole peoples\u2019 money. It went like this: \u201cThere was once a man named Zacchaeus who didn\u2019t have any friends (none). Do you have any friends?\u2026\u201d Naturally, parents want their children to have rich, meaningful relationships in their lives. It\u2019s taken me years to understand what friendship is/means for Rhema. There are no birthday party invitations or playdates or phone calls or the camaraderie of sports teams and group activities\u2026 and that fact used to pain my heart. But she has friends \u2013 her wonderful classmates and teachers at school, Dana and Melissa (her sitters who care for her so much just the way she is), so many people in the online community who cheer her, pray for her and support her from afar. She is enthusiastically loved! What a gift. I once wrote the following about her classmates:  \u201cThey give and don\u2019t keep score. G will happily and faithfully say \u201cHi Rhema!\u201d every day whether she looks at him or not. In my simple way of thinking, friendship involves/includes reciprocation. For a friendship to exist she would need to do something\u00a0for\u00a0them; acknowledge them and talk to them and play with them. In my limited perspective, she doesn\u2019t seem to do any of those things. But maybe she does. And even if she doesn\u2019t, they don\u2019t need it\u00a0from her. And maybe they\u00a0know\u00a0each other better than most and get each other in a \u2018girl, you don\u2019t have to say a thing\u2019 sort of way. Maybe they share a bond I cannot begin to understand\u2026\u201d \u201cDo you have any friends, Rhema?\u201d I held up her RPM letterboard. (Click here for more info on  RPM ) She pointed to the letters \u201cY E S.\u201d She  knows  she has friends. Knowing she knows is a shot of relief and joy to my soul. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of your friend?\u201d \u201cH O P E.\u201d \u201cHope\u201d is Rhema\u2019s answer to a lot of questions. (Can you picture my huge smile? Now picture Hope\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s even bigger.) Hope is excited about her sister\u2019s growing abilities to communicate her thoughts through RPM and tickled pink when Rhema spells her name. We read the rest of the story\u2026 how Jesus looked up and saw the un-seen, the outcast \u2013 Zacchaeus in a sycamore tree (he was short so he\u2019d climbed up for a better view). How He invited himself to Zacchaeus\u2019 house and shared a meal with him\u2013 this man who had no friends. How Jesus knew everything about him and yet he still loved him. In an instant the fellowship of Jesus changed Z\u2019s life and heart forever. He pledged to give half his income to the poor and pay back four times over everyone he has cheated. In the Storybook Bible, Jesus said, \u201c My friend!  Today God has rescued you.\u201d We chewed on that for a while, the fact that the Most High God befriended a man whom everyone despised. Then I said to Rhema. \u201cCan you tell me the name of another friend of yours?\u201d She spelled, \u201cJ E S U S.\u201d \u201cYep. He\u2019s an even better friend than me,\u201d said Hope still beaming.\u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s saying something.\u201d This is my Father and\u00a0Friend. He gently, faithfully provides for my needs. He holds my hand wherever I go. Chases me when I bolt. Scoops me up when I flop. Kisses my hurts. Washes me, clothes\u00a0me, feeds me good things. He understands my heart in the silence. He keeps on speaking, every day He tells the mercy story. He fights for me and cheers for me. When I refuse Him, He stoops down to love me. He is my safe room, surrounding me in unbreakable grace. It may sound simple-minded to some people. But for me, for Rhema and Hope, it\u2019s our\u00a0testimony.

My friend Shannon and I were chatting after dinner in my kitchen in Germany. I told her I that I was not crazy about the name we had chosen for the baby \u2013 it just didn\u2019t seem to fit. Shannon insisted that I had to be excited about the name. And so we brainstormed long into the night. Shannon was the first to say the name  Rhema.\u00a0 And when she said it, I can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s like my heart\u00a0 remembered . I knew her. I knew that was her name. It means \u201cutterance\u201d or \u201cthing said\u201d in Greek. In the Bible, rhema is often translated as the word \u201cword.\u201d At first, Brandon thought it was too sacred a name to put on a child. But my heart was set on it, and we studied the Scriptures for anywhere the Greek word\u00a0 rhema \u00a0appeared. We chose Romans 10: 8-9 as her \u201ctheme\u201d verse: \u201cThe word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is LORD\u201d, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d I recited the verse to her while she was still in my womb. For nearly twelve years now I\u2019ve said it/prayed it over her every night. Autism, for us, has been about tearing down expectations only to build them up again into a fabric we could not ever have imagined. We named her \u201cword\u201d, and yet she was unable to speak a word. Our \u201choly\u201d plans flew out the window every Sunday, and still do, as she struggles to make it through a church service and colors on every bulletin, sign-up sheet, welcome card, and hymnal she can find. She\u2019s been known to low crawl under the pews from the back of the church to the front. Her favorite part is the end when she can race to the fellowship hall for a drink or to the car for a fast getaway. This Holy Week Rhema and I have\u00a0been studying the events that led to Christ\u2019s ultimate sacrifice on the cross. We read of how \u201call the poison of sin was going to have to go into Jesus\u2019\u00a0own heart\u2026 and poured into his heart would be all the sadness and brokenness in people\u2019s hearts. And poured into Jesus\u2019 body would be all the sickness in people\u2019s bodies. It would crush him.\u00a0(Jesus Storybook Bible).\u201d\u00a0But he would do it. For love. For us. I asked her\u00a0what she thought about this crucifixion and resurrection story. As she spelled out her answer, letter by letter, the tears flowed in amazement and joy. It was the culmination of years of wondering and hoping that she was indeed\u00a0hearing and understanding words of faith. That it was/is true that even when she cannot fully communicate with us, God speaks her language perfectly. All my prayers answered in her words tapped on a stencil board: \u201cI HAVE HIM IN MY HEART.\u201d ~Rhema The Word is there, has always been there. On this Good Friday and in light of Rhema\u2019s good confession, I have a renewed interest in asking those of you who read our blog: do you have him in your heart?

As usual, it seemed like the message was just for her and just for me straight from the heart of God. \u201cWhen you pray, don\u2019t pray like those Extra-Super-Holy-People. They think if they say  lots of words , God will hear them. But it\u2019s not because you\u2019re so clever, or good, or so important, that God will listen to you. God listens to you because he loves you. \n Did you know that God is always listening to you? Did you know that God can hear the quietest  whisper  deep inside your heart, even before you\u2019ve started to say it? So you don\u2019t need to use long words or special words. Because God knows exactly what you need even before you ask him.\u201d We didn\u2019t rush over those thoughts. We chewed every morsel as I wrote the words down and she re-traced them or scribbled over them. We practiced spelling on the letter board. And then I asked her, \u201cRhema, what do you pray for? Can you tell me?\u201d I really don\u2019t have words to describe what happened next. It\u2019s a moment that has changed me and changed our family forever, I am shaking and laughing\u00a0and crying\u00a0as I write this. Four words. The first sentence she has ever spelled for me\u2026 And I wondered if anyone would believe me when I told them about Rhema\u2019s prayer. I wondered if I would believe me. So I grabbed an iPad to record her. I asked her to spell it again, and she did. This is her prayer.

Until now, she\u2019s never had a way to really demonstrate her intelligence, humor and imagination. Over the past twelve years she has been described or assumed as  having the expressive and receptive language of a 1-year old, lacking pretend skills, isolated in her own world ;  having poor sense of time and sequence, minimal ability to attend, and little understanding of emotions. I am ashamed to say that, with the exception of occasional Bible passages, I gave up reading aloud to her around the age of 3 \u2013 the last book I read to her was The Foot Book by Dr. Seuss.

It thunders over the waters, strikes with flashes of lightning and twists oaks and cedars. That same voice speaks\u00a0out of fire to Moses and the Israelites, and out of a whirlwind to Job. To Elijah, it\u2019s a still small voice. I\u2019ve been thinking about how Rhema prayed for so many years to have a voice. Only we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t even know she  prayed . She had no way to show us or tell us her deepest desire, her heart\u2019s cry. But God heard. He always hears. I know in those many moments when she has felt so alone, so muted, so sorrowful and angry by the daily challenges in her life, He has whispered, I hear you, I see\u00a0you. I am your God. I am here, and I am holding you. Don\u2019t give up. I know, I know, in times when I have been wearied and overwhelmed by the\u00a0journey and felt sure that I couldn\u2019t do it anymore, couldn\u2019t give anymore, couldn\u2019t help or hope anymore, He has shouted, Get up. Keep going. I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will help you. Don\u2019t give up! One day\u00a0He lit my tail on fire and Rhema\u2019s prayer became my prayer even though I didn\u2019t know it was her prayer. Then He laid down a yellow brick road, led us to the lock to the key.

Her fork \u2013 the only one she\u2019ll use \u2013 is placed on one side and a paper plate of dry Cheerios on the other. Popsicle and iPad in hand, her blue blanket is draped across her shoulders. Her backpack at her feet serves as a trusty foot rest, Her TV nursery rhymes play on repeat. Me, sitting beside her, my arms tucked around her waist, her pinky locked with my thumb. This , every detail of this, is how she relaxes. A bath is not a bath until she\u2019s squeezed half the bottle of liquid soap onto her belly as if getting an ultrasound. The toothpaste cap must be in the right spot on the counter before teeth brushing\u00a0can commence. Lights should be off in the kitchen *while* cooking. In the morning at the therapy center, a certain chair must be sat upon before she can proceed with her day. She meticulously constructs and follows many more patterns each day, taking comfort in her routines. If the circle is broken or things re-arranged, I believe she feels the disorder deep inside as seeks to restore the one missing piece. I\u2019m amazed by her mind, how she navigates the world, how she misses nothing. The study of Rhema is always a page-turner. As I try to keep up with the myriad fine points of all that is my girl, God tells me of His love for her, for us\u00a0so detailed, so particular. How He knit her in my womb, made her bottomless brown eyes, dotted her lip and painted her skin like a mocha frappe. How He gave her a song as sweet as angels. Before I formed you, I knew you. Before you were born I had holy plans for you. You are perfectly, marvelously meant to be. How He keeps every tear in a bottle, each ache is written in His book. He tracks every detail and counts the hairs on her head. He watches over her comings and goings. Whether she goes down to the depths or rises on the wings of the dawn, He is already there. How Love, measureless, incomparable Love came down in human form, in poverty, as a baby in a dirty stable. All for her. All for us. To be with us. To rescue us. To give\u00a0His life as a ransom for mine/ours so that we can live forever free.

We did an  RPM  lesson\u00a0about going to the hospital the night before, but I had no idea how it was going to go. In my mind I rehearsed different strategies for all of the scenarios and struggles we might face. The day of surgery we made it through the hospital doors at 5:45 AM\u00a0and up to the 3rd floor with no major problems. We breathed a huge sigh of relief, and Rhema stood quietly beside me as we checked\u00a0in. She was surprisingly calm and waited very\u00a0well. The woman at the desk stood to escort us into a pediatric waiting area. That\u2019s when Rhema did what I think everyone in the pre-op area felt like doing: she took off running. If I hadn\u2019t been concerned about catching her I would have been beaming with pride at her track star speed. I ran after her, leaving the bewildered woman behind. She stopped in a hallway and covered her face. I told her we needed to go back, that we had to stay at the hospital for a while. She wasn\u2019t budging. I could not physically move her back to the waiting room, and I could not leave her alone to go get help. Anxiety began swirling in my stomach. We were stuck. Then I saw it. A wheelchair. As if placed by divine intervention, there was an abandoned wheelchair just a few skips away from us. \u201cRhema, want to ride in the wheelchair?\u201d As if to say \u201cOf course\u201d, she uncovered her face, walked over and sat in the wheelchair. I wheeled her back to the waiting area, and she contentedly rocked forward and back in the chair all the way. The next challenge was\u00a0her coat. Her coat has a big hood that she always pulls over her head as if to shield herself from the sensory onslaughts of the world. It\u2019s like a security blanket for her, zipped up to her nose. She had\u00a0to take it off for her medical procedure, and I expected a battle. I worried over it for quite some time, debating whether I should even put her coat on at all that morning. After the nurse had done everything she could do  with  Rhema\u2019s coat on, I gently told her I was going to help her take it\u00a0off. She resisted for a moment and then let me unzip her coat and slide it off. I was amazed. I quickly put her hospital gown on. She reached for her coat and tried to put it on over her gown. We had a little tug of war, but she finally let me put her coat away. Wow. Thanks for prayers for peace, friends! \u201cFret not thyself\u2026\u201d (Ps. 37:1)  Sometimes I feel like there\u2019s sooo much to worry about when it comes to managing situations (current and future!) with my girl. Often I pray, \u201cLord, I have no idea what we\u2019re going to do about\u2026\u201d And then an unexpected, amazing successful moment comes and wraps me up in a comforting serenade. And the thing I thought would be huge and hard just isn\u2019t. I\u2019m so thankful for that. We had to wait 2 hours before going into the OR. It was hard to wait, and she was not interested in coloring or playing on her iPad. Nurses, doctors and a Childlife specialist came to talk with us. Rhema sat in her wheelchair and sang her sweet wordless song all the while. Her language, her life is a song. Like a long musical, she\u00a0intones her heart-thoughts; she sings every emotion. It seems to be a melody for her, for us, for the morning and night,\u00a0for paper and rain and air\u00a0and\u00a0macaroni and\u00a0blades of grass; she hums to\u00a0the world. When we went into the OR, I held her in my lap as the anesthesia team put a mask on her face. My girl put up a good fight. Even after the mask was placed and she began to fall asleep, her soft, soprano hums filled the room. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d one of the nurses said, smiling and shaking her head. \u201cShe\u2019s still singing.\u201d * I recorded Rhema singing in the car a couple years ago.

We\u2019re down to our last week (5 days to be exact) with B before he deploys for a year. Last week I had visions of getting away for a little family vacation, but things did not go as planned. Random items started breaking in our house. Our furnace decided to run HEAT during the heat wave and our central air decided to stop working altogether. Our refrigerator also went on the fritz. We got the furnace fixed and then waited all week/weekend for a part for the air conditioning that never came. My sweet Rhema also had some major unexpected issues which pretty much made us housebound\u2026 in our oven of a house. I\u2019m not a big crier and I shed tears two days in a row. On Friday we broke down and bought an AC window unit and installed it in our bedroom. We blew up the air mattress and told the girls we were camping out in the bedroom for the weekend. Hope was beyond thrilled and Rhema seemed happy, too.\u00a0Nah, we didn\u2019t get much sleep,\u00a0but I think we\u2019ll all always remember it as precious time. Thank you, Lord. Teach us to trust you. This week, this just-before-deployment time is always hard; reality sets in as we see him packing and making final arrangements, saying farewell to friends. Still, I never quite believe it\u2019s happening until the moment he actually walks out that door. My heart hurts for him having to leave his family for so long. My heart hurts for Hope conspiring to duct tape the doors, so sure it will make him stay. My heart hurts for Rhema wondering why, where has he gone and will he return? And just when\u00a0I had finally trained the man to do the food shopping. I could actually send him to the grocery store and he would actually buy the right things (way too much of it, but at least it was right)!!! One night\u00a0B did the math of how much he\u2019s been gone, and in the past 5 years alone he\u2019s been away for more than half that time. I know there are many single parents who work and raise their children and every day they do their best to make it happen.\u00a0I know I\u2019ve done it before \u2013 2 yearlong deployments under my belt already and a bunch of summers just me and the kids.

We sang this hymn in church last Sunday, and it was perfect: Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side. \n Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. \n Leave to thy God to order and provide; \n In every change, He faithful will remain. \n Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend \n Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end. Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake \n To guide the future, as He has the past. \n Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake; \n All now mysterious shall be bright at last. \n Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know \n His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below. Be still, my soul: when dearest friends depart, \n And all is darkened in the vale of tears, \n Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart, \n Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears. \n Be still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay \n From His own fullness all He takes away. Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on \n When we shall be forever with the Lord. \n When disappointment, grief and fear are gone, \n Sorrow forgot, love\u2019s purest joys restored. \n Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past \n All safe and bless\u00e8d we shall meet at last. Be still, my soul: begin the song of praise \n On earth, believing, to Thy Lord on high; \n Acknowledge Him in all thy words and ways, \n So shall He view thee with a well pleased eye. \n Be still, my soul: the Sun of life divine \n Through passing clouds shall but more brightly shine.

Often he can\u2019t get through or the reception is bad. When he gets through there\u2019s a delay and we end up talking over each other. Currently he\u2019s only able to call/skype from a common area, and there\u2019s a lot of background noise; I may not be able to hear him but I can always hear the conversation of the soldier sitting next to him. The small amount of time we do have is usually spent discussing \u201cbusiness\u201d:  How are the girls? Fine. How are you? Fine. Fine. I\u00a0got an address.\u00a0Can you mail me the new debit card? How do I stop the house alarm from beeping? Hello?\u2026 Hello???  Skype makes a dying noise and flashes the words, Call Ended.

I\u2019ll never forget the time  several years ago when I dangled a popsicle over the computer screen. I told Brandon, keep talking, keep talking to her. And he did. He told her he loved her and thought about her and missed her so much \u2013 while she ran circles around the room. But then she stopped and saw the popsicle. Then she  saw  him and held his gaze. He said,  \u201cHi Rhema.\u201d  And she said,  \u201cHi.\u201d  Just those words, but there was so much in that exchange. I am hoping, trusting that she hears him when he speaks to her, that they\u2019ll find a way to connect again. I can\u2019t help but think of God speaking while we run. How He waits for us to turn and see Him and hear His song of never-ending\u00a0love over us. Last week Hope gave us a sweet Skype memory.

She may cover her face if you speak to her. She may not seem to hear you or understand what you are saying. She rocks and hums. She squeezes her eyes shut. She shrieks and giggles. She says \u201cHi\u201d, \u201cBye\u201d, \u201cYeah\u201d, and \u201cCheese\u201d when prompted. She rarely shows emotion on her face. She has no super-talent that we know of \u2013 she\u2019s a Special Olympics gymnastics dropout. She has really good days and really bad days. She\u2019s predictably unpredictable. She is often overlooked, occupying the periphery. She is severely affected by autism and a stubborn seizure disorder. She needs help with every part of her day. She is God\u2019s workmanship, fearfully and wonderfully made. I share her here. But in public spaces I\u2019ve been guilty of shielding her/us too much. I\u2019m going to stop now because you really should know her. She\u2019s amazing, she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s gentle and smart. How do you get to know her? Say hello anyway. Come near and catch her soft smile. Hear her sweet song. She has this way of loving, of showing you things you\u2019d never expect to see.

Certainly MISS my wife and daughters terribly, but other than that I am good.\u201d \n~Text message from Brandon just before he boarded a flight to the Middle East . We have been so encouraged by your thoughts, prayers, words and friendships over the past few weeks. Thank you. We\u00a0did a photo shoot a couple weeks ago with my incredibly gifted friend  Kerrie . It was the first time we\u2019d ever really done family pictures outside before, and I had no idea how Rhema would do\u2026 but I knew if anyone could make it a success Kerrie could. We went to a beautiful \u201csecret garden\u201d and just walked around. And Hope posed a lot. (Of course!) She loved every second of it. Rhema was so peaceful and cooperative. I was delighted. Kerrie really captured Rhema and Hope and their sister love so well. She made albums for us \u2013 one for me and the girls and one for Brandon to take with him \u2013 with spaces for us to write notes to each other. She gave us a precious, precious gift.

{"date": "July 17, 2013", "body": "When the husband is away the strangest things happen. There was the \u201cSummer of the Zoo\u201d several years ago when he was off on a training mission.\u00a0We lived\u00a0in a charming old house built in the 1880\u2019s, and that summer\u00a0we discovered bats were living in the attic. (Ugh, I can\u2019t even write that and not get the heebie jeebies.) Yeah, that alone should have been enough. While trying to solve the bat problem we learned that a fox was living in the compost pile in our backyard. Rhema had a habit of streaking in the backyard and she loved to sit on top of that compost pile. I was convinced the fox would find her a tastier treat than Little Red Riding Hood. Brandon missed out on the live exclusion bat removal process and me with a pitchfork and a bottle of coyote urine, scaring away\u00a0Mr. Fox\u00a0for good. Then there was the time he was deployed to Iraq, and the kids caught swine flu. While I cared for our feverish children a hawk crashed into the glass of our screen door. And got stuck there. My neighbor helped me \u201cremove\u201d the hawk and later replace the glass. Also during that deployment Rhema developed lead poisoning from gnawing on the window sills. The whole house had to be\u00a0de-leaded which meant packing, shrink-wrapping all the furniture, and moving into a hotel for six weeks. Now we live in a newer home. And Brandon spent the last few weeks\u00a0ensuring everything was in good condition.\u00a0He did\u00a0everything he could to ensure I would not have to deal with any major house issues while he was gone. Bless his heart. On the day of his departure -on his way to the airport in fact \u2013 the outside unit of our central air system  caught fire . Yes, yes it did. I called him at the airport. Brandon has a special ring tone for me on his phone. It\u2019s \u201cThis Girl is on Fire\u201d by Alicia Keys. How fitting. When I told him the\u00a0news he protested, \u201cBut I haven\u2019t even gotten on the plane yet!\u201d\u00a0Surprised the crazy show\u00a0didn\u2019t wait until he\u2019d at least left the country. Long story short we have to replace the entire central air system. That of course won\u2019t happen for another few days. Meanwhile there\u2019s another heat wave on and, sing it with me,  This girl is on fire . I cannot begin to tell you how hot I am. (Ha!) So yesterday I called my friend Lori and asked if she had an old AC unit I could borrow. She did not. So she called our friend Lynnette who asked all of her friends. Within minutes I was talking on the phone to Kathey \u2013 someone I\u2019d never met. Turns out she\u2019d read the blog before so she kind of \u201cknew us.\u201d She had two\u00a0window units\u00a0and offered to bring them over right away. I was so grateful and touched by her kindness. We were fast friends, and she even got a \u201cHi\u201d and a \u201cYeah\u201d out of Rhema! My neighbor Steve (and friend from church) installed the ACs and \u2013 oh joy! \u2013 we cooled off. Later I sat in the living room and thanked God for friends and the kindness-of-a-stranger-now-friend. I pigged out on a bag of\u00a0serious comfort food, gifted to me by Lori: And ahhhh.

{"date": "February 15, 2016", "body": "The  Tim Tebow Foundation  describes Night to Shine as an unforgettable prom night experience, centered on God\u2019s love, for people with special needs ages 16 and older. North Shore Community Baptist Church hosted a Night to Shine prom this past weekend, and I had the great blessing of serving as a volunteer Buddy. Luke 14:15-24 became a theme for all of the volunteers:  We get the opportunity to throw a lavish banquet for people who are often overlooked, people who are dear to God\u2019s heart. There was a red carpet with young people cheering and snapping pictures like paparazzi as the guests arrived. There was a beauty station for the women and a shoe shine station for the men. There were limo rides, a photo booth, karaoke, a wonderfully catered meal, a special room for caregivers, and, of course, dancing. At one moment all of the guests received crowns and tiaras and were announced kings and queens of the prom. At the beginning of the evening I waited at my table for the three guests to which I\u2019d been assigned to arrive. I didn\u2019t know anything about them, but I prayed for them. With an event such as this you sort of anticipate emotional moments. Unexpectedly, the first thing to grab my heart were hands. Hands flapping excitedly and a young man toe-jumping in the air at the entrance of the banquet room. For me, it was the immediate knowing, the instant recognition deep down of the something that makes this young man and my own daughter so dear and beautiful and unique. It was gladness for his gladness and appreciation for all the effort he\u2019d made to be there. When I saw his face I realized I did actually (kind of) know him. He is a student at Rhema\u2019s school, although he\u2019s 8 or 9 years older than her. There were a few students from the school at the prom, and accompanying them were their teachers. And that\u2019s the second thing that got me. Seeing the teachers dressed in their suits and dresses, so happy to be there to help and celebrate our kids. These teachers are so much more than teachers, they are friends, they do life with our children and words can never express how grateful I am for them. It was an honor for me to be a Buddy to 3 special people. M was an older woman with mobility issues but I actually had trouble keeping up with her (!) as she made her way to the makeup station and the photo booth and eagerly visited with others in the banquet room. M never met a stranger the whole night and she regaled me with her stories. My other guests of honor were MH and T and they stayed with their caregivers at the table for most of the night. MH had a table tray table on his wheelchair that had many of the PECS symbols that Rhema has in her communication app. There was also a typed message on his tray that said, \u201cI am MH. I understand everything you say even though I may be slow to respond.\u201d I told MH about Rhema (too young to attend Night to Shine) and my hopes for her. Seeing how hard he worked to communicate encouraged my heart so much and I told him so. His mother was there and even though our stories and our children\u2019s stories are so very different \u2013 her son is 40, my daughter is 11, her son was hit by a car at the age of 7 and suffered a traumatic brain injury \u2013 we had many things in which we could relate. We shared a precious bond. When a Nat King Cole song came on, MH took my hand and mouthed the words. Best rendition ever. My time with MH and his mother is something I will treasure. So it goes, in God\u2019s economy, the ones who intend to help/volunteer/bless others are the ones who get doubly blessed in return. I once said that when you have a child with special needs, every child with special needs is your child. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s right. But sometimes it feels that way. I\u2019m sensitive to some of the struggles and sorrows and triumphs and joys of others as if they were my own children. I\u2019m liable to get weepy at the grocery store when I see a man with special needs doing his job and loving his job and touching the lives of the people around them. So perhaps you can imagine my joy, multiplied by 100, seeing our guests lavishly loved and treasured and honored with a night that was made just for them. There have been times I\u2019ve wanted to shout to everyone and no one in particular, \u201cDon\u2019t forget my girl. It\u2019s not easy, I know. But she\u2019s here, sitting in the dark, waiting for you to sit with her, see her, know her. Don\u2019t forget my girl.\u201d At Night to Shine God whispered to me: \u2018 I \u00a0cannot, will not ever forget her. She is famous to me like an A-lister walking the red carpet. I throw a party, serve the best food and clothe her in love. I pamper her with my goodness and put a crown on her head. I dance with her, sing along with her. She is precious and she is mine.\u2019 How extravagant is the love of God for us.

{"date": "April 16, 2016", "body": "I have never talked to Rhema about her autism. Our family has talked about autism  around  her, but for so long I incorrectly assumed that we could not have a conversation, that she would not understand. The fact that we can now have a conversation about almost anything still blows my mind and makes me want to cry and dance for joy. Sometimes I type the words that she\u2019s spelled in caps. That\u2019s not proper netiquette, I know. Capital letters make words louder. And that\u2019s just fine by me. After 12 years of silence, I  hear  her loud and clear. Yesterday we went for a drive and things were not in order in her mind. She became upset in the car and lashed out at me. It was not a pretty moment \u2013 for either of us. We arrived home and she went to her chair where we do RPM, and she cried. I came over after a while and picked up her stencil board. \u201cRhema, why are you crying?\u201d \u201cI AM SAD.\u201d \u201cWhy are you sad right now?\u201d \u201cI HAVE A(V)UTISM.\u201d \u201cWhat about autism makes you sad, baby?\u201d \u201cI HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS.\u201d \u201cYes, I know that. You\u2019ve told me before that you have high expectations.\u201d There was a pause as I searched for words. I didn\u2019t know what to say so I just asked her if she had anything else she wanted to say. \u201cAUTISM MAKES ME SO MAD.\u201d \u201cI get that, Rhema. It must be so frustrating sometimes.\u201d \u201cI HAVE HARD TIME DOING LIFE.\u201d At that point we put the stencil board down so that I would not cry. For a minute I just needed to try to process it all \u2013 the joy that she could finally share these things and the heartache over the words themselves. \u201cRhema, I have something to tell you.\u201d And then I kind of laughed. \u201cI think you know this but I write a blog and I\u2019ve been sharing with people about what\u2019s happening with you\u2026 how you\u2019re communicating now through pointing to letters and typing. Someone who reads the blog wrote me this: \u2018Please tell Rhema I\u2019ve been praying about something last night, and in her wisdom, she just gave me the answer today. Tell her thank you!\u2019 So Rhema\u2026 I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 I know autism can be so hard sometimes\u2026 and I know I don\u2019t even know because I\u2019m not you. But I believe God has a good purpose for your life and He can use even what you\u2019re going through now.\u201d \u201cI HAVE AUTISM SO HIS GLORY WOULD BE REVEALED.\u201d \u00a0 I thought about the countless times a scenario likes this has played out where she became overwhelmed or upset, when she put fists to her eyes and wept. And she could never express why. I thought of the years of seizures and hospital stays and the medications with a host of side effects still today poured into her already dysregulated body. And she could never say how she felt. I thought of the years of pain \u2013 when she would repeatedly bite her hands and arms so badly we\u2019d have to ice them and the school nurse recommended we take her to the hospital for her injuries. I thought of the years of screaming. The many times I\u2019d walk into her room and find the floor covered with clumps of hair she pulled out. She did not have the ability to say, \u2018This life hurts!\u2019 or \u2018I am sad\u2019 or \u2018I am mad.\u2019 I thought of the years she has been treated like a baby or spoken to like a baby because of her outward behaviors and inability to speak. And disregarded and not included as if she did not have a working mind. And yet, with her words, she says to me that all of this, all of The Hard, is worth it. If it somehow brings glory to God. Every day it\u2019s worth it. And if she can say that, then Lord help me, so can I. I can get off the floor. I can lift my head as the tears fall and say, \u201cThank you. Thank you.

The lines from a U2 song: I want to trip inside your head \n Spend the day there\u2026 \n To hear the things you haven\u2019t said \n And see what you might see After nearly twelve years of silence we get to do  that . And it is awesome. It truly is like God has opened the floodgates of heaven and poured out a blessing so great we can\u2019t even take it all in. Friends, family, and some therapists who work with Rhema have said to me, \u201cYou always believed.\u201d That\u2019s true, but I only had a little belief\u2026 just enough to keep hoping and keep trying. And I guess all anyone ever needs is just a little faith. A little faith with proper tending will take root and grow into big faith that can move mountains. She is still Rhema. She still needs support with every part of her day. She still struggles to live in a body that repeatedly\u00a0betrays her and navigate a world that often overwhelms her. It\u2019s often hard to believe that the girl I see is the same girl who is now able to share her beautiful thoughts. So far I\u2019ve yet to hear a trace of anger or bitterness or discontent in her words. Only thankfulness.

Yet God clothes them in splendor better than kings. How much more so will He dress you in beauty? What is the price of a sparrow? Pennies, right? And yet the heavenly Father never overlooks a single one. You are worth more than a million sparrows. So do not worry. He knows what you need. (Paraphrase of Matthew 6). Her response: \u201cSo love God my heart sings.\u201d Is that why you sing, girl? Because of Love? I want to believe like that and love like that and sing like that.

I very much like eating sweet treats and when I can I like to go swimming. Are you a sweets fan? My favourite new treat is white chocolate. Do you like school? I am so working hard to stay at school. Never thought I would be included. Have a good day. Your friend Bella. \u00a0 As I read Bella\u2019s letter to Rhema, she hummed and scribbled on paper. She never looked up. Without even seeing her face, I just knew it was a moment we\u2019d always treasure. I knew that she\u00a0was experiencing a special connection of friendship in a way she had never known before. As soon as I finished reading Rhema pointed her pencil at the stencil board. I spoke aloud the letters and words she spelled, and\u00a0I bawled. \u00a0 Hi Bella, So good to meet you So much to tell you I have my voice now I have so long wanted a friend I have love for you even though I have never met you I love being heard I cant believe how God ansered my prayer I like my good mom my sister Hope and my dad I miss you Your friend Rhema \u00a0 Hope begged me to let her write to Bella, too. Upon reading her letter, I bawled again. Bella, I\u2019m Rhema\u2019s little sister, Hope. I am so happy for both of you! I\u2019m happy you found your voices! I know God will do great things in, for and through you. I am 9 years old. My birthday is December 5. When is yours? I like sweets too. Rhema LOVES popsicles. I also like to swim. I like traveling, playing piano, playing soccer, drawing and writing. I have written books and am working on another one. Do you like to write? My sister said that autism makes it hard to do life so when you get frustrated when you can\u2019t make clear what you want (or just in general) remember this bible verse: \u201cconsider it pure joy my brothers, when you face trials of many kinds.\u201d Sincerely, Hope \u00a0 God is giving answers to prayers I never even dared to pray. My girl is not alone. She is beginning to connect with people who get her and communicate like her and share the same challenges, same joys. A friend. My Rhema has a friend. \u00a0 You can read more of Bella\u2019s words on her Facebook page:  Bella\u2019s Walk ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Bellas.Walk/?fref=ts"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2016/05/17/bella-letters/", "title": "Bella letters"},
{"date": "May 12, 2016", "body": "She broke the electric pencil sharpener. I heard the loud grinding noise seconds after I\u2019d turned my back. I was not happy. After yanking the plug I said, \u201cI\u2019ve told you so many times not to stick objects in the pencil sharpener. And now it\u2019s broken!\u201d The sharpener had become very much a part of our RPM routine. She\u2019d spell a word or sentence and I\u2019d let her sharpen her pencil (whether it needed it or not). But soon it became a problem. I fetched the stencil board and without hesitation she spelled, I AM SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you listen?\u201d I CANT CONTROL MY IMPULSES. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED. These days I only pause for a second to marvel at the fact that she even knows what impulses  are . This is the child I always thought had to be taught in a very slow, deliberate and methodical manner. Yet she has learned words, facts and ideas completely on her own. Her depth of understanding blows me away. I sighed, \u201cWhat are we going to do about your uncontrolled impulses?\u201d PRAY. \u00a0 I\u2019ve repeatedly read other autistic people \u2013 particularly non-speaking autistics who use alternative means of communication \u2013 express this same sentiment: that their bodies often do not cooperate. There is a mind/body disconnect that often leaves feelings of\u00a0frustration, discouragement or embarrassment, particularly when people around them dismiss their behaviors as annoying, difficult, apathetic or unintelligent. The fact that Rhema articulated a similar struggle was so insightful for me. I wanted her to know that she was not alone. Our friend  Philip  has written a lot about his struggles with impulse control. The next day I read some of his words to her: I am in a body that does not obey my brain.\u00a0\u00a0I am open minded but my actions are each day searching the peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0Tons of each day I am so tired from making my body obey my brain.\u00a0\u00a0I am always estimating to overcome an impulse.\u00a0\u00a0Impulses come in many different forms.\u00a0\u00a0I may see food and out of the blue it makes me wholly tuned into it.\u00a0\u00a0I am really too slow in my thinking to stop myself from taking the food.\u00a0\u00a0I feel bad after.\u00a0\u00a0I think I really need to readdress understanding real need to control my body.  ~ Philip, March 2014 I am dealing with awkward behaviors all the time. At school I sometimes pace when I should be sitting or I shout out when I should be quiet. People think i am doing it on purpose. I am not. I get caught momentarily mightily by an impulse. My body cannot stop itself. I momentarily lose control. People can plead with me to stop. I want to listen but at times\u00a0my body won\u2019t obey. Ramming\u00a0against a caring mind is my body. Going near loud noise hurts me literally. I\u00a0am each day daring hard to fit in.\u00a0 A tame mind can ease my day. Peace comes day to day from people who accept me at home, school, and church.  ~ Philip, January 2015\u00a0 Philip on the difference between impulses and stims: Impulse is trying to reach for peace momentarily but it is opposite in potential. Peace never comes from acting on impulse. It only brings remorse. Unlike impulses, stims are necessary for\u00a0living. Stims\u00a0should be tolerated at times. One day you might learn to appreciate them. Ceasing to stim bodes poorly on my thinking. Lots of thinking happens as I pace,\u00a0flap, or use another movement. I think stims are healthy but impulses are not. Help me by stopping impulses but allowing stims as long as they do not hurt anyone.\u00a0 ~ Philip, January 2015  I asked Rhema for her\u00a0thoughts and she\u00a0responded: I HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH MY MOTOR SKILLS I AM HAPPY TO HEAR THAT OTHERS HAVE THE SAME STRUGGLES. IT IS SO HARD TO HAVE MY MIND NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER MY BODY. \u00a0 So when another object shatters on the floor, I am trying to understand. When she flops in that same spot in the store or when she seems to ignore my directions, I am cutting out my groans. Even when her actions unintentionally hurt me or others, I am trying to look past my pain and see hers. And so, the girl who some assume lacks emotions and understanding, is teaching  me  compassion and empathy. \u201cI don\u2019t have trouble with impulse control the way you do, Rhema. But on some level I get it. Paul wrote in Romans thousands of years ago, \u2018I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.\u2019 I know this experience inside and out, over and over. So many times I\u2019ve cried, \u201cI am sorry. I should have listened!\u201d Every day\u00a0I have known the amazing grace of Jesus that saves my life. Every day! And forbearance and forgiveness from loved ones in my life.

When I started taking Rhema to gymnastics she couldn\u2019t stand the feeling of the mat beneath her bare feet and she was deathly afraid of the foam pit. After she adjusted to the mats she spent the next several years running circles around the gym with a volunteer dispatched to follow her for safety reasons. Last fall she was paired with Shea, a highschool senior, who expected and believed more for Rhema. The whole team did.  And that\u2019s all it took. Rhema has blossomed in gymnastics this past year and done more than even I could have imagined. This weekend the qualifying meet for the Special Olympics Summer Games was held at MIT. And we went. And she! did! it! She tolerated the leotard (beautifully). She\u00a0made it through the whole meet (only unraveling at the end). She waited (a lot). She smiled (a lot)! She did the routines \u2013 floor, vault, bars and beam\u00a0( her way, of course ). She did her own salute \u2013 the high five.  She qualified for the Summer Games (Woohoo!). Most of all, she was HAPPY. So I am happy. And so proud. Yesterday God answered a little prayer of my heart that I prayed a long time ago. (Click  here  for the back story).

{"date": "April 25, 2016", "body": "TREES HAVE MISTERY IN HOW THEY MAKE MUSIC \nTHEY MAKE MUSIC GLORIOUSLY \nHOW THEY SING \nTREES SOUND LIKE MUSICAL NOTES IN MY EARS \n~Rhema Rhema at age 2, listening to trees 1) She hears music in the trees. Yet when presented with verbal stimuli and asked to identify a tree in an array of four images (for e.g.,\u00a0a cup, banana, duck and tree) during a standardized assessment, she may or not be able to select the tree. Even though she loves markers and uses them every day she may only be able to demonstrate that she knows the function of markers with assistance and prompting by her teacher. In fact, she may engage in behaviors or seem to exhibit decreased attention when tasks become more challenging. Thus, she presents with \u201cextremely low\u201d receptive language skills. Year after year the evaluation scores are the same. The\u00a0 Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test \u2013 Fourth Edition\u00a0 may say she cannot label a tree\u2026 but now I know, I  know,  she has a poem about trees\u00a0dancing in her head. I\u2019m so glad I know. It scares me to think of how much I once believed and accepted assumptions about autistic people like my daughter \u2013 that she lacked understanding of emotions, that she needed to be spoken to in simple language and have things repeated over and over in hopes she might get it, that if she could not demonstrate that a hat is an item you put on your head then she must not know the function of a hat. I\u2019m so glad I know that tests, evaluations and experts have their place. But as Emma on  Emma\u2019s Hope Book  wrote, \u201cThere is no test that allows me to show the creative ways in which I learn.\u201d And that, \u201cBelieving in the potential of all students is not on any test.\u201d 2) When I began working at home with Rhema, one of our biggest struggles, I thought, was in the area of attention. I wanted to write words on paper and show her how to use a pencil to point to choices on paper. She wanted to scribble intensely or shuffle the papers or erase whatever I wrote or break the pencil tips or bite the pencils, etc. Our learning time started as a tug-of-war over a writing utensil and usually ended with a pencil stab and a paper cut. One day I decided to remove all the pencils and markers from the room. I thought I would command her full attention once the distractions were gone. That of course backfired, too. I soon learned \u2013 with Soma\u2019s help \u2013 that Rhema was attending all the while she feverishly scribbled on paper. So I let her color and scribble while I taught a lesson. When I asked questions, she learned to spell her answers very well. In the beginning I was tempted to simplify the lessons. But I found that when we studied age appropriate material she became  more  engaged and so interested that she paused in her coloring to peer at what I was writing. This, from the child who is visually selective and has always struggled with joint attention.   3) It seems miraculous. Rhema\u2019s ability to spell and share her thoughts after so many years of silence. In fact, I asked her how she learned how to spell (because several people asked me and I didn\u2019t really know.) She said, \u201cI learned how to spell by noticing how letters worked.\u201d She hums and rocks and needs continuous support throughout her day, she rarely makes eye contact and\u00a0shows almost no emotion on her face. And yet in her words she communicates a depth, maturity, understanding and love that leave me speechless. Nearly every day tears of joy and amazement fill my eyes as she shares more and more with us. It\u2019s unbelievable. And yet totally believable. It\u2019s more than a miracle. She has worked so hard \u2013 almost every day for the past year \u2013 to be able to spell on stencils (and now type). And now we are blessed to see the fruit of that work. Many years ago I read a beautiful piece by a father of a special needs child. He described his idea of erring on the side of \u201coverbelieving\u201d in his daughter. As Rhema\u2019s parents, Brandon and I have tried to do that. The past couple months we\u2019ve been able to get to know our girl in a way we could only dream of before\u2026 and we\u2019ve discovered that our \u201coverbelieving\u201d was sorely lacking, that we\u2019d been underestimating her all along. And yet\u2026 and still she says to us, \u201cThank you for believing in me.\u201d So. All of our expectations have changed. The way we speak to her has changed. The way we envision her future has changed (-Rhema doing college level work someday is no longer outside the realm of possibility). The way we view her learning has changed. Now we know that speech \u2013 or the lack of \u2013 is not an accurate reflection of her intelligence. As the father I read once said, \u2018She has taught us that everyone needs people who love them enough to overbelieve in them.\u2019 So far she has shown her own funny, amazing, Rhema-way of ultimately exceeding every expectation.

It was her way of telling me that she wanted the TV on, but I was baffled because she usually has no interest in television. I turned it on, but Hope and I could not at all figure out what she wanted to watch. I\u2019d select a channel and she\u2019d hand me the remote control again, unsatisfied. On the 3 rd  night, I put on some old nursery rhyme videos she used to enjoy when she was younger. When our favorite \u201c5 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed\u201d came on, she rocked and giggled and jumped into my arms\u2026 my ten year old a five year old again.

They get absolutely crazy over cool monkeys in shades in \u201c5 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed.\u201d And the way we dance and spin. First Hope in my arms, we jump up and down. And then I dip her head low when a monkey falls off the bed. I wag my finger in her face, and we yell \u201cNo more monkeys jumping in the bed!\u201d I\u00a0deposit Hope on the couch\u00a0when it\u2019s two monkeys down\u00a0and just\u00a0enough time to catch Rhema\u2019s flying leap into my arms.

Emily Willingham  of Forbes put it this way: \u201cHaving children  close together , having them in a  certain order , being a  certain age , having  antibodies , having children  in summer , having  wombs  and gestating embryonic and fetal humans in them, using  Clomid ,  IVF ,  terbutaline , or  labor induction , being pregnant near freeways, donating bad  mitochondria to offspring , partnering with  older fathers , passing  genes to our children ,  eating ,  treating depression , getting an  infection during pregnancy , including the flu,  not getting an infection , being  depressed , or behaving like  refrigerators .\u201d A study (I\u00a0did take\u00a0seriously) came out a week before Rhema\u2019s 10 th  birthday that suggests  autism starts in the womb . The brain tissue reveals \u201cpatches of disorganization in the cortex\u201d of children with autism. \u2018Organization of the cortex begins in the second trimester of pregnancy.  \u201cSo something must have gone wrong at or before that time\u2026\u201d 24 weeks pregnant with Rhema And I don\u2019t understand it all or even know what I think and feel about it all, but there is this: Oh yes, you shaped me first inside, then out; \nyou formed me in my mother\u2019s womb. \nI thank you, High God\u2014you\u2019re breathtaking! \nBody and soul, I am marvelously made! \nI worship in adoration\u2014what a creation! \nYou know me inside and out, \nyou know every bone in my body; \nYou know exactly how I was made, bit by bit, \nhow I was sculpted from nothing into something. \nLike an open book, you watched me grow from conception to birth; \nall the stages of my life were spread out before you, \nThe days of my life all prepared \nbefore I\u2019d even lived one day. ~Psalm 139:13-16 And in the victorious, precious, beautiful times and in the most bitter, trying, heartbreaking times of our lives with autism, God\u2019s good purpose remains. All of these days ordained for me to be their mother and for them to be my girls\u2026 yes, God is good. I don\u2019t always see the good. I\u2019d rewind the clock in a heartbeat, do whatever I could to make my baby an \u2018organized cortex.\u2019 But my vision has always been limited. As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\u201d  \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cbut this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in his life.\u201d \u00a0 ~John 9:1-3 Everything about her is a miracle.

Rhema goes through shirt-chewing/eating/ripping phases. By the time she\u2019s done, most of her tops are un-wearable \u2013 they are either thrown out or used as rags.

They were fascinating and I discovered that behind the image of the great historical figure, there was a man who simply had a heart for God. He was a man who doubted, who got tired and discouraged in the face of indescribable adversity (- jailed over 18 times, nearly stabbed to death, his house bombed 3 times). But he always came back to trusting in His Lord and standing in courage on his faith. His sermons continue to speak to me in the midst of my own journey. Once he preached a sermon entitled  Unfulfilled Dreams . I am there now, in the old country church of hard wooden pews and no air-conditioning, sitting in unfulfilled dreams. I am moving to the sounds of Yes and Amen, the tapping of feet, the flapping of cardboard fans from the local funeral home. I am hearing the voice of Jesus, say still to fight on. Oh this morning, if I can leave anything with you, let me urge you to be sure that you have a strong boat of faith. The winds are going to blow. (Yes) The storms of disappointment are coming. (Yes) The agonies and the anguishes of life are coming. (Yes, sir) And be sure that your boat is strong, and also be very sure that you have an anchor. (Amen) In times like these, you need an anchor. And be very sure that your anchor holds. (Yes, Glory to God)  \n It will be dark sometimes, and it will be dismal and trying, and tribulations will come. But if you have faith in the God that I\u2019m talking about this morning, it doesn\u2019t matter. (Yes) For you can stand up amid the storms. And I say it to you out of experience this morning, yes, I\u2019ve seen the lightning flash. (Yes, sir) I\u2019ve heard the thunder roll. (Yes) I\u2019ve felt sin-breakers dashing, trying to conquer my soul. But I heard the voice of Jesus, saying still to fight on. He promised never to leave me, (Yes, sir) never to leave me alone. (Thank you, Jesus) No, never alone. No, never alone. He promised never to leave me. Never to leave me alone. (Glory to God) \n And when you get this faith, you can walk with your feet solid to the ground and your head to the air, and you fear no man. (Go ahead) And you fear nothing that comes before you. (Yes, sir) Because you know that God is even in Crete. (Amen) If you ascend to the heavens, God is there. If you descend to hell, God is even there. If you take the wings of the morning and fly out to the uttermost parts of the sea, even God is there. Everywhere we turn we find him.

Her amazing curls have always been precious to me, and perhaps as my expectations for both of our lives shifted over the years, I turned her physical beauty into something of a consolation, something I could control. After we cut her hair short last year because of trichotillomania, a few friends told me about dreams they had in which she was talking and her hair had grown back. Without realizing it, I associated long hair with health, happier days, and progress for Rhema. Even in this, I think God has had something to say about trusting Him, believing He\u2019s at work even though my measuring stick tells me different. And about holding onto  Him \u2026 not something as fleeting as hair. \u201cThe Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam 16:7). Life with Rhema is making me want to  see  people better, with God-eyes\u2026 and love them. We were waiting in line in a crowded grocery store, and Rhema could not stand still. I watched her as she weaved between shoppers and carts and rocked and hummed and sampled a few boogers. I saw her mind processing the sights and sounds in her unique way. I saw her hands, shirt and pants stained from the markers she\u2019d colored with earlier. I saw her anxious body still pudgy from the weight she gained while on a particular medication. I saw the thinning hair and bald spots on the top of her head. And she was so genuinely lovely, every part of her, I left my place in line, rushed to her and wrapped my arms around her and held her close. \u201cIt\u2019s time to throw out my ideas of what I thought life would be, should be, and let joy fill up those brand-new vacancies.\u201d \n ~Emily Colson * This blog has a Facebook page now!

While I was at work our youth pastor kindly came over and moved the parts to the basement for me. A couple days later three friends arrived to determine if the bed was as I said: irreparable.

From the house to the car to the snow to opening jars of pickles \u2013 they have stood in the gap for us. We are so blessed! The men loaded the bed pieces onto a truck and went on their way.

The next day Steve called to say they\u2019d rebuilt the bed\u2026 they\u2019d also built a new railing for her\u2026 and when could they bring it by?

{"date": "February 6, 2014", "body": "Dear Brandon, Once upon a time I was young, but I was right about you. We met at a Christian conference in Pennsylvania for college students. You sat next to me in a workshop called \u201cGiving Your Life Away\u201d, and I liked your West Point uniform and the goodness in your eyes. You scribbled your email address on a piece of paper, and I stuck it in Isaiah 6 in my Bible. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. \n~Is. 6:8 We\u2019d only just met, but I knew almost immediately you were the kind who would say, \u201cI\u2019ll go. Send me.\u201d We corresponded off and on for months, and you asked me to be your date to a military ball. I took the train from New Hampshire to New York. I put my hair up and wore that black dress, but I totally should have worn my hair down that night. I\u2019d had little things with boys before, but you were my first serious love. My first real everything. After graduation you went to flight school in Alabama, and I got a job in Boston. We were officially dating by then, getting to know each other through letters, emails, phone calls and occasional weekend visits. Can we ever forget those Alabama weekends? You tried to surprise me with a visit one Easter weekend. (But the truth is B, I\u2019d already figured it out. And I already knew you were going to propose. Of a marriage proposal, you\u2019d said, \u2018It\u2019s just like the Lord coming back. You know it\u2019s going to happen. You just don\u2019t know when.\u2019 Dude, I knew when.) I was watching TV in my parent\u2019s basement with my little brother. You walked in and asked Corey to make his exit, but he took his sweet old time. My serious man, you were on a mission. Before I could blink you were down on a knee asking me to marry you. I was distracted by the fact that my kid brother was there, eavesdropping, anxious to get back to watching his show. It took a while for me to answer you\u2026 What I thought then is what I know to be true now: You say you are not good. But God\u2019s goodness flows out of you. I love that you are wise and thoughtful and purposeful. You live every day wanting to give your life away to God and others. I love that you want to pray with me every night, and that the margins of your Bible are filled with notes you\u2019ve written to yourself. You are Top Gun sexy in a flight suit. When you make a decision, a promise, you are always faithful to it. I know good and honorable men, but your character and integrity sets you apart. You are so generous in your love toward me. I want to go with you until the end. So I said Yes because the answer was always Yes. Goofy That was fifteen years ago. Before 9/11, and wars within and without, and months and years of separations and moves and kids and special needs and surgeries and heartbreak and \u201clove washing over a multitude of things.\u201d The journey has had more hills and valleys than we imagined but you have held me tight and kept me close and called us blessed. Your life is a story of giving \u2013 to your family and country \u2013 willing to go not once but three times on yearlong missions to the Middle East.  You\u2019ve sacrificed all  just so our daughter could stay in place and get the education, services and medical care she needs. Yours is the kind of love that says, Here am I; send me. The very nature of Christ reaches through you to love me and our children and words cannot ever express my thanks and I love you. Once upon a time I was young, but I was right about you. Love, \nMe * Marriage Letters  is a project at the RunaMuck.com in which spouses write to each other on various topics.

Hope thought I would be visiting her classroom so we could Skype with him. Her class has sent him letters and pictures in the past so she thought this was a great idea. When I got there I pretended to call him through the iPad but I really was recording Hope. She just assumed that her poor mother was technologically challenged and attempted to take the iPad from me so that she could call her Dad. And that\u2019s when he appeared\u2026! It was a good reunion. Afterwards each of Hope\u2019s classmates came up and gave her a hug. Just mush. Then we went to Rhema\u2019s school. She was having a snack, and she didn\u2019t move from her chair when she saw him. She just grinned and chuckled like she was in on the best joke ever. That alone thrilled my heart. Rhema rarely shows emotion in her face and eyes. And sometimes I don\u2019t realize how much I\u2019ve missed her smiles and giggles until I see and hear them again. We\u2019ll do just about anything for Rhema-joy. Then she went right to him and gave him a backwards hug. My video recording is horrid. And I cut out a lot of video because it contains the faces of other kids. But below is a taste of what our day was like. One incredible moment we did not capture on video was when we were leaving the cafeteria at Rhema\u2019s school. Brandon really wanted her to know that he was only leaving for a couple hours and that she would see him again shortly. He kept trying to tell her this because he always worries when he\u2019s been gone for a long time \u2014 he never wants her to think he has left her. Finally, reluctantly\u00a0he turned to walk out of the room. And she said as clear and engaged and purposeful and beautiful as I\u2019ve ever heard her say anything: \u201cBye.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dsc_1531.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/smile_status.png"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/a-little-homecoming/", "title": "A little homecoming"},

If I were to compare my life to others I cannot say I have suffered. Not really. But pain is pain is pain. Some days, for Brandon and me, even the wonderful things we experience are underscored by a sense of regret and wistfulness, a sorrow that our darling daughter struggles, that her road is marked with \u2018all kinds of trials.\u2019 And yet I\u2019ve looked at my children and I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve seen and been touched by the closest thing\u00a0JOY UNSPEAKABLE this side of heaven. Peter called our faith, tried by fire, much more precious than gold. And there is comfort in that. To know that God is  doing   something . That we can gather up our smoking pile of ashes, hurts, disappointments, broken hearts and dreams and give it all to Him. And nothing is wasted. This video has ministered to us so much.

{"date": "February 21, 2014", "body": "I hear a strangled scream from one of my children and then the pained cries of the other. I cannot move fast enough to get to them. Through many tears Hope explains how she was reading her book of Princess Adventures and how Rhema was sitting on the bed and became upset. How she\u00a0went over and gave Rhema a hug. (When Rhema is particularly troubled the only person she welcomes touch from is Hope.) And this is what Hope does when she senses her sister is distressed or overwhelmed \u2013 she holds on tight and tells her it\u2019s ok. She doesn\u2019t know why she is distraught, why it happens so often, but that doesn\u2019t really matter to her; she just needs her sister to know that she is never ever alone.\u00a0And nothing that agitates her or hurts her or scares her or saddens her is bigger than this. This\u00a0love, this hug. After the hug Hope goes back to her book. Then Rhema screams and throws her iPad across the room. It smacks Hope in the face, leaves a knot on her head. Hope cries in my lap. Rhema babbles and hums in the background. No one says sorry but me. We head to the kitchen for an ice pack. Rhema comes down minutes later, hunting for cheese in the refrigerator. Hope grins wide -even though it hurts \u2013 because her sister  loves  cheese, that\u2019s for sure. She walks over and reaches up,  \u201cAre you feeling better now, Rhema??\u201d Rhema forgets about the cheese for a moment, leans close to Hope. They do the cheek bump. And teach me what I still desperately need to learn \u2013 the way of true love. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, It does not boast, It is not proud. It does not dishonor others, It is not self-seeking, It is not easily angered, It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. ~1 Corinthians 13:4-8 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dsc_1475.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/love-after-all/", "title": "Love after all"},

{"date": "April 8, 2014", "body": "It might not be rain falling on your head this morning. It might be  heart bits  again, because mine shot up in the air and burst like fireworks. At gymnastics this weekend the Special Olympics team sat in the warm-up circle and each girl said her name and favorite dessert. Rhema sat in the circle with the help of her coach  Shea , and Hope and I stood off to the side. When it was Rhema\u2019s turn to say her name, Hope went over to the circle and sat next to her. She put her hands to Rhema\u2019s face and asked, \u201cRhema, what\u2019s your name?\u201d I think Rhema said her name but it was only for Hope to hear and know. After a few moments Hope told the group, \u201cThis is Rhema and her favorite dessert is\u2026um\u2026 slush!\u201d When the team went into another section of the gym Hope and I retreated to the lobby area, where wouldn\u2019t you know it, slush was for sale. Yeah, Hope\u2019s so stinkin\u2019 cute she got a Bubble gum slush out of me. And being the sister she is, she saved some for Rhema and gave it to her when the practice was over. Rhema eagerly slurped as we crossed the parking lot and buckled in. She grabbed her iPad and the automated voice from her communication app filled the car, \u201cI want\u2026 something to eat\u2026 slush. I want slush.\u201d \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d I screamed. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Hope squealed. \u201cI want slush. I want slush. I want slush. I want slush.\u201d She already had the slush. She was not making a request. It just so happens that currently her screens are somewhat limited to only making requests. Except for a few rare occasions all of Rhema\u2019s language \u2013 vocal or through the iPad \u2013 has been prompted and repetitive, based on requesting a food item or activity. (This has been so important in her learning.) But in the car, I think for the first time ever, she was  commenting . She was independently sharing with us:  I have slush, (and yes Hope) I like it! The old reports said things like, \u201cPoor receptive language. \u201cWord deafness\u201d possibly due to seizure activity in the brain. Poor expressive language. Zero joint attention. Child does not ask for help or make other basic requests. Child has limited ability to share interest or enjoyment with others.\u201d And now. She can \u2013 and desires to! \u2013 put words and pictures together to make a statement about slush, just for the sake of saying it! Stay here with me for a moment because I don\u2019t ever want to let it go. This is a piece of everything I\u2019ve prayed for and been afraid to dream of. This is God surprising us with joy. This is hope I can\u2019t describe, hand-delivered to a mama\u2019s heart in desperate need of it. This is another light shining into my girl, who sees and hears and thinks and understands so much. This is we\u2019ve-come-so-far and we\u2019ve got a ways to go, so keep the faith and hold on. When God gave me Rhema I didn\u2019t know I would get to write of miracles. .

{"date": "April 30, 2014", "body": "B, People say the year is going by fast. In some ways, I suppose. But as another season goes and a new one creeps in, it feels like the husband/father here has been away a long, long time. I no longer count the days, I can only focus on the day I\u2019m living. But babies are being born and it\u2019s a funny way I mark the time. I think,  she wasn\u2019t even pregnant yet when\u00a0you left.  So much happens in a year. Even though the technology is so much improved, we still find communication difficult. You ask, how are the girls? I say, fine. You say, what? I say, I said \u2018fine\u2019. I don\u2019t mention that seven has been good to Hope. She lost her baby front teeth and got these huge crooked incisors in their place. I tried to take lots of pictures during the time she was missing those front teeth \u2013 I knew it was a precious piece of childhood that would pass too quickly. She has grown so much, but don\u2019t worry she\u2019s not changed where it counts. She still has that sparkle in her eyes. Still kind and wise. Still bursting with enthusiasm over everything from broccoli for dinner to sparkly shoes and Bible memory verses. When I tell her to clean up, she bounces and twirls from the table to the sink. She talks so much that tooth-brushing is a problem because she has to slow down her talking while brushing. She never leaves home without the stuffed bear you sent her for Christmas. I often have to give her instructions more than once but it\u2019s because she\u2019s a dreamer and her mind is racing. She\u2019s not afraid to be creative and she\u2019s usually up early working one of her many projects\u2026 like the basket o\u2019 love she put on my door and daily fills with handwritten notes and loom bracelets just for me. Her \u201cmerry heart doeth good like a medicine.\u201d She is my helper and my friend. She teaches tired me that love is  joyful , and I want to love like that. As for Rhema\u2026 will I ever be able to capture with words all that life is with Rhema? And her ways, oh her ways, that always cause me to marvel or chuckle because I never would have seen it, heard it, thought it, tasted it or done it the way she does  every  time. I love that when I put her in the shower she stands there with her mouth wide open gulping down all the hot water or how she dips her Necco wafers in ketchup and brushes the sink with her toothbrush and throws all our plates, spoons and mugs in the trash can. She always leaves me thoughtful. A couple of weeks ago the school nurse sent us home with ice packs because she\u2019d bitten her arms so badly they were bruised and swollen. I studied those arms, I kissed those arms and applied ice but I still could not understand how and why she could hurt herself so badly. Her pain and frustration run so deep some days and I find myself begging God to show me any way I can lift her burden. That night was filled with her screaming and thrashing and me hoping the sleeping meds would finally kick in and bring relief. When the screaming died down I went in her room, and honestly I checked for blood. Found clumps of her hair littering the bed. I picked them up and my heart off the floor. Closed the door to her screams. The next day when at a park she bit me good, my instinct was to fight, to yell  Why?! On the hard days maybe the hardest thing to do is to resist the sinking. I put the girls in the van, loaded their bikes in the trunk and sat on the bumper trying to figure out how to go on. I sat there for the longest time because I didn\u2019t have the courage to get in that van and keep going.  God give me strength to keep on trying, keep on mothering, keep on loving even when I don\u2019t know how.  Somehow, He did. How we appreciate the good days! Often the best moments for us are at bedtime. It\u2019s like Rhema saves them for us, for that time. Sometimes it\u2019s just the gift of her beautiful eyes gazing into mine. Every now and then she\u2019ll echo back \u2018Nigh. Nigh.\u2019 One night she told me she loved me. I know it. The sounds from her mouth cannot be represented with the letters on this keyboard, but I know that\u2019s what she was telling me. I\u2019m so thankful she teaches me that love is holding on. That God never lets go even when we bite and fight and scream, especially then. That the dark moments won\u2019t last always; new will come in with the light.

{"date": "June 17, 2014", "body": "Rhema got a trike for her tenth birthday. She\u2019s had difficulty learning to balance a regular two-wheeler. I hoped this would be a fun, cool way to get her moving. And it was! She took the bike right away. But keeping her safe turned out to be much harder than I imagined.\u00a0We only rode in enclosed areas but she still found a way to streets with cars. I tried many times to demonstrate the boundaries, to no avail. She seemed to have no sense for the danger and I spent most of the time running after her, shouting her name with my heart in my throat. I thought about getting myself a skateboard to try and keep up with her (and for some reason every person I mentioned the idea to laughed!) One day I took the girls to a paved area at a local college. Rhema pedaled around the quad with Hope riding her bike close behind and I jogged alongside. Things were going well and Rhema stayed on the path; eventually I slowed my pace. Rhema veered off the path, around a corner and out of my sight. Hope took off after her and I started my typical running and yelling. I had a feeling she was headed for the main road. When I got there Hope\u2019s bike was thrown down by the side of the road. Rhema\u2019s trike was in the road but she wasn\u2019t on it. Apparently Hope had yelled for her to stop and Rhema had stopped right there and gotten off her trike. Only she was standing there in the middle of the street refusing to move, her arm over her eyes. When Hope saw cars approaching she ran\u00a0into the street and began pushing Rhema out of the street. That\u2019s the scene burned into my memory forever. My seven-year old pushing my ten-year old out of the street, step by step. The cars came to a stop while I retrieved my children and then dragged the trike out of the road. ( Dear sweet Hope, if you read this someday, know that the Bible says, \u201cGreater love has no one than this: to lay down\u00a0one\u2019s life for\u00a0one\u2019s friends.\u201d Thank you for your great love.) That put an end to Rhema\u2019s bike riding (in my mind, for a very long time). Recently I recounted the story to Rhema and Hope\u2019s grandparents. I told them I couldn\u2019t take Rhema riding unless there were\u00a0at least 3\u00a0adults present \u2013 all strategically positioned. (Two friends did this with me once and it\u00a0blessed me to see them running after Rhema like madwomen!)\u00a0I told them I thought I\u2019d made the wrong choice in getting the trike. That I should have gotten a tandem bike instead \u2013 that way I could ride with her and keep her safe. A couple days later they called and told me to order a tandem bike for Rhema \u2013 it would be their gift. This week they\u2019re visiting us from Michigan, and the new bike arrived. Rhema enjoys it, and the bike is perfect for the two of us. My father in law put a mirror on the handlebars so I can see her behind me. We spent yesterday riding together and I\u2019m so pleased to be able to share this with her! She hummed the whole time and\u00a0periodically patted\u00a0my back. Now we can safely go bike riding as a family. There is much suffering and strife in the world. This is small in the grand scheme of things. But as a mother I am grateful that my girls can enjoy safe, fun, free childhood days. I\u2019m thankful for family and friends who help us think outside the box for Rhema. The excitement doesn\u2019t always show on her face, she doesn\u2019t say thank you or even seem to look up. But you can see the happy in her secret grin and hear it in the song she hums, and that means more than any words can say. Thank you Grandma and Grandpa!

I watch her closely wondering if this will be the day I see understanding dawn in her eyes, emotion show on her face. She\u00a0makes no\u00a0sound, does not look my way. But her\u00a0hand often seeks mine. My hands have become an extension of her. No longer my own, she uses my hands to speak. She takes my hand and leads me where she wants to go. She moves my hands to the refrigerator handle and toward a food item, she moves them to the toilet paper in the bathroom, to the door knob when it\u2019s time to leave. She puts cheese, ketchup and box of popsicles in my hand when she wants to eat, the remote control for her nursery rhymes, and my purse when she\u2019s ready to go. In public we do this strange body-walk-dance as\u00a0she holds my hand and arm over her shoulder and across her chest. When she colors \u2013 which is every day \u2013 she puts a marker of her choosing in my hand and guides it to paper. And this is the best of all because it is her favorite thing and she is inviting me in to share it with her, create with her. A study I read once called this autistic leading a \u201cless desirable form of requesting.\u201d Nevertheless it is communication and all communication is important. So I let her lead me. She has caused me to love our hands, hers and mine, because we can always find a way to connect through them. And like all women my hands do many things in a day, but this is most valuable. My hand, 2009 A couple weeks ago we went out to lunch, just the two of us. Something happened \u2013 I don\u2019t know what. She became very upset and before I knew it she had  overturned  the table in the restaurant, her plate of barely-touched spaghetti landing in a heap in the bench across from us. When I reached for her she bit my hand hard and it took everything in me not to cry out in pain and cause more of a scene. We left immediately. At home I tried to talk to her, tried to tell her that I understood being upset and frustrated and that we were all working hard to help her find ways to communicate that, but overturning tables was not acceptable. In that moment I was the one upset, frustrated and hurt. Without looking, she quietly reached for my hand. Tears filled my eyes as I held back. I knew that to withhold my hand would be to reject her, cut her off. Words I wrote years ago came to mind: \u201c\u2026how often I have removed my hand \u2013 cut off communication \u2013 when the Father wants to lead. The well-known Psalm 23 says  \u201cHe  leads  me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.\u201d  How often do I miss out on those quiet waters because I refuse to follow, because I will not be led? Communing with God and taking His lead is not so complicated really. Maybe for starters, it just means we unclinch our fist and hold out our hand.\u201d I took my daughter\u2019s hand\u00a0again and she took mine and the only translation was love.

{"date": "June 10, 2014", "body": "There were so many incredible things surrounding our experience at the Special Olympics Summer Games. The morning of I had a moment of panic, wondering if we should just back out of the whole thing. The thought of trying to find parking on a busy day in the city, walking long distances with Rhema, the noise, the crowds, the unfamiliar, the waiting\u2026 I called my sister and she simply said, \u2018No worries. I be there.\u2019 (Yeah, she tries to talk cool.) We got there just in time for the opening ceremonies. Rhema did so well throughout the meet; she was happy to color with her markers or play on her iPad or walk around a bit when she had to wait. She kept her leotard on. (!) She did all of the routines in her own Rhema style with Shea, her coach, supporting her all the way. As I watched I remembered Rhema, age 5 \u2026how she couldn\u2019t stand the feeling of the mats beneath her feet and how she used to just run circles around the gym. Age 6 How she had no joint attention, didn\u2019t seem to understand anything people said to her. How she could not follow one-step directions or do activities with a group. Look at her now,  I thought . Look at her now! I was/am amazed, so amazed\u00a0to see how far she has come, to see what is possible. And then this happened: Rhema won 2 fourth place ribbons and 3 bronze medals! And she knew it. She knew she had succeeded. She knew she was celebrated by everyone in that arena. Facebook status from Rhemashope: Watching the young athletes of the Special Olympics \u2013 all with various challenges and disabilities do their best, full of sparkle and joy\u2026 Watching those who coached (many of them young girls) guide their friends, cheer them and help them, step by step, side by side\u2026 it was just as it should be. And it was one of the most heartening, inspiring things I\u2019ve ever seen. Team Rhema and Shea (below) \u2013 their last time together like this. Thank you Shea for this gift. \u201cWe are at our best, we act most in concert with what our Maker intends, when we give away in love to another\u2026\u201d (Law of the Gift, Pope John Paul II) \u00a0 Two days later and we can\u2019t stop smiling and talking about it. Hope begged me to take one of the medals to school and I said she could. Her teacher told me she asked her if she could share something with her 1 st  grade class. First Hope told them about the Special Olympics and then she pulled out Rhema\u2019s team leotard and matching scrunchie (which she happily noted that Rhema kept in the whole time). Next she passed around Rhema\u2019s medal and told them she placed 3 rd  overall for her age group. Hope told me her classmates were amazed. One girl said, \u2018Wow, Rhema is super talented.\u2019 It touched me deeply that Hope would think to do that on her own. She\u2019s teaching her friends about her sister\u2019s autism and showing them her many gifts. A woman named Susan took the pictures of Rhema (above) on the podium. She found me and showed me the photos. Later she sent them to me with the words, \u201cYour daughter is a shining star.\u201d Instantly I was taken back to my little girl \u2013 seeming so isolated and hyperactive \u2013 running laps around the gym and holding on to a star. Rhema, age 5 Keep believing, friends.  As my friend\u00a0has reminded\u00a0me \u00a0again and again, anything really is possible. In a blog I wrote about many moons ago when Rhema got her first leotard (you can\u00a0read it  here  \u2013 it\u2019s part of the story), I say again: This is the message that has been\u00a0*5* years in the making for me.  Don\u2019t be afraid to dream big dreams. It may seem impossible, but it\u2019s just a setup\u2026 for\u00a0God to show you what\u00a0He can do. He can take our dreams for our children and give them wings. I dare you to trust God. With Him, nothing is impossible. *Hope and I made this video. Hope took most of these pictures!

{"date": "April 23, 2014", "body": "We\u2019ve had even more than our usual a-lot-going-on, and I haven\u2019t been able to blog. I\u2019ve also felt a need to keep silent here as friends are grieving losses, others are hurting deeply, and me too \u2013 I\u2019m trying to find a way above my own challenges. I was looking at one of Rhema\u2019s graphs \u2013 I get a set every month from school. Some of them are behavior graphs that chart things like flopping, bolting, successful transitions. As I looked at the ups and downs it reminded me of life, and something I read once by a favorite singer (Sara Groves): \u201cI made a map of my life on my 40th birthday, and remembered in broad strokes the first 20 years of my life, and then the second. \u00a0Drawn out in a sort of graph, I was amazed that there was rarely just one monolithic line, plummeting and rising, but that in the darker hours, there was almost always a counter-rise \u2013  this  hard thing was happening, but at the same time,  this \u00a0other (sometimes completely unrelated) wonderful thing was happening. \u00a0Coming-of-age vulnerability alongside finding genuine, life-giving mentors, young adult angst alongside finding a voice, marriage joy alongside marriage pain, birth alongside depression, tearing relational missteps alongside burgeoning life-long friendships, sin and self alongside truly breathtaking revelations of grace.\u201d Anyway, I  am  thankful for the falling and rising and His grace at \u201ceach turn in the line.\u201d Trying to lay it all down at His feet. \u00a0 Reblogging this,\u00a0originally written November 2011. My little Hope and I go down to the boat ramp just to watch the vessels on the water. I want her to know what real hope looks like. Not just a wish or fancy, but an abiding, unshakeable expectation. It\u2019s peaceful just now, though wind and tide have rocked the boat. I know of storms raging family without power homeless men in the subway heartache of friends screaming pressures at work babies battling cancer a beloved aunt in her last days I know of chaos and confusion, weakness and regret. We should surely sink. And yet we are held fast. I read aloud to her the passage from my morning study \u2013 shared with a dozen women in a circle huddled over Bibles, in their own storms: \u201cWe have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf.\u201d Heb. 6:19-20 In the stillness I ask her, \u201cYou know what an anchor is, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, it keeps the\u00a0boat from going away.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut Mama, what\u2019s our soul?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like the deepest part inside you. Everything you think and feel and know and makes you you. With God, our souls have an anchor.\u201d \u201cLike the boat.\u201d \u201cLike the boat. Hope keeps our souls from going away.\u201d It\u2019s my day off from work and I cherish our time together \u2013 we talk and talk and talk and eat McDonalds, bounce around the gym and practice for piano. We pick up a happy Rhema from school. She\u2019s had some tough days lately, but when I put her to bed she thrills me unexpectedly with a beautifully clear \u201cnight night\u201d and \u201cluh yew\u201d (love you). \u00a0I seriously kick up my heels as I close her door \u2013 no medical report or school evaluation or future fear can steal the joy from the moment. And then the husband refuses to be lazy about me. He fights the weariness and frustrations of the day and all the words unspoken; he finds new ways to connect and I know I am loved. It\u2019s the hope of heaven. It\u2019s God\u2019s good gifts I\u2019m counting in the wind. All of it, anchoring. .

{"date": "September 2, 2013", "body": "Hope had two wiggly front teeth and then she did a standing-in-place-flip on the trampoline (I have no idea how you flip and stand in place at the same time) and knocked them out. The Tooth Fairy brought her a $5 pre-viewed DVD of Veggie Tales Silly Songs and the next day we sang silly songs all day. There\u2019s a song called  Barbara Manatee  that Rhema and I used to dance to when she was a toddler. Those days everything was exaggerated and I was so hungry for any expression, any response from her. I\u2019d hold her in my arms and we\u2019d spin as fast as we could- \u201cBarbara Manatee (Manatee, Manatee) \n You are the one for me (one for me, one for me) \n Sent from up above (up above, up above) \n You are the one I love (I love, I love, I love)\u201d I\u2019d cradle her head and dip her low. And a wonderful, soul-filling giggle would bubble out of her and we\u2019d do it over and over until we collapsed on the couch, breathless. I was in the kitchen when Barbara Manatee came on. I\u2019d been grumbling about all I ever do is feed them, clean them and spilled milk and ketchup and other unidentifiable substances, do the dishes, pick up dolls and toys, feed them, clean them, do the dishes\u2026 \u201cOh I love that song!\u201d It had been five years at least. To my surprise Rhema was instantly off the couch holding her arms out to me. She  remembered . I bent to lift her but that was  not  happening. She\u2019s solid and nearly as tall as me now. So I tried to sway her, awkward, back and forth to the music. She looked up at me as if to say, \u201cWoman,  dance  with me.\u201d \u201cOk\u2026 Rhema\u2026 jump!\u201d I took a deep breath, bent at the knees and caught her. Then I tried my darnedest to prance and spin around the living room with all 85 pounds of my daughter. Because she remembered this was our song. Because I wanted to go back. Because I needed to hear that giggle. At the part where I used to dip her, she totally expected me to dip her. Oh Lord, what a sight. I dipped her. But we never came back up. Instead we landed in a heap on the ground and Hope couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Oh Barbara Manatee,  that  was the last time. The last time you pick up your firstborn and hold on for dear life. You\u2019ll always carry her, not so much with hands now but with invisible arms and all your heart, as she stands on her own. The last time your baby girl has this funny, gummy grin, her mouth full of holes. Take a million heart\u00a0snapshots and\u00a0circle this moment on your calendar of life. Today is important. Remember this. \u201cYou are the one I love (I love, I love, I love).\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpcf_qD3GW4", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/rhema-16.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/toothless.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/on-remembering/", "title": "On remembering"},
{"date": "November 6, 2015", "body": "A routine doctor\u2019s appointment for Rhema these days is anything but. She experiences so much anxiety about hospitals and medical offices that I\u2019ve had trouble just getting her into the building, and we\u2019ve had to cancel appointments. Earlier this year a doctor met with me in the parking lot because Rhema became so overwhelmed. Recently that same doctor conducted an appointment at Rhema\u2019s school \u2013 a place where she feels comfortable, safe and supported. I am still amazed and grateful that this doctor was willing to think outside the box and do whatever was necessary to help my girl be ok. But my gratitude doesn\u2019t stop there. Every day for months Rhema\u2019s teachers and our school nurse have been taking her into a medical office at school. They work on taking off shoes and standing on the scale and getting height and vitals and sitting on the examination table. These things have always been hard for Rhema to manage, lately they\u2019ve been pretty much impossible. Even when she had her appointment at school her heart was pounding out of her chest she was so nervous. But they practice at school every day. Today she has an appointment with a new doctor at a new facility. New = unfamiliar = anxiety. Every aspect of it will be hard \u2013 getting through the doors, sitting in the waiting room (a coughing child could trigger an upset),\u00a0walking\u00a0into the examination room, the waiting,\u00a0 staying  in the examination room, the appointment itself\u2026 she\u2019s scheduled to receive 2 injections. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go. But\u2026 but. She\u2019s been practicing. And at the very least she knows that she\u2019s not alone. Two of her teachers are going with us. To help her. To help me. Not enough can be said for how wonderfully and completely people have come alongside us and supported and loved my sweet girl. They go with us, all in, on this journey. All I can say is thank you again and again to every one of you. You know who you are. And I hope you know\u00a0how Rhema loves you, how you inspire her. (Video is an RPM session Rhema and I did last night. The video quality is not so great, but we are talking about going to the doctor. The fact that she is answering questions by spelling answers is an incredible accomplishment, something I could not have imagined a year ago).

Walking to school, waiting for the bus stop, talking, talking, talking. Does she see them, too? Rhema\u2019s been in a full day, year round program since she was three years old. Things stay the same for the most part and that\u2019s a  good  thing. So there\u2019s not really a first day of school, the way I see it. No report cards or promotion certificates; it\u2019s seemed more like one long, long grade. Even still. We dress her in a new top, put a clip in her hair, and pack a brand new backpack. Snap a quick picture. All my dreams in stripes. In a minute the barrette will be thrown to the floor. Before the first day is half over, her new shirt will be shredded, chewed and torn. I\u2019m out of backups, so she\u2019ll come home in a boy\u2019s ill-fitting, old T-shirt. From shoulders to wrists, her arms will be bruised red and puffy from angry bites. She will have 45 instances of self-injurious behavior. She will have seizure-like twitches and jerks. She will spend time time time in the safe room \u2013 a space we\u2019ve approved for her safety and the safety of others when necessary. She\u2019ll gag on her dinner and throw it all up, that and every non-edible thing she ate that day. She\u2019ll cry quietly.  And I won\u2019t know why. She\u2019ll\u00a0show me\u00a0her deep brown eyes for a moment, then look away and smile. And I won\u2019t know why. It will redeem us, bring hope for the second day. I trust there\u2019s purpose for us and God-glory in this. Comparisons are a big no-no for special needs moms, still I think about the girls at the bus stop.

The \u201cfight\u201d is part of the routine. I clap loud and sing (annoyingly) \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Rise and Shine\u2026 and give God the glory-glory.\u201d Then we engage in a tug-of-war with her blanket, and she wins. Later I help her in the washroom, I help her clean and brush her teeth and get dressed. For us, it is  work.  And all of it involves some fight. There will be countless moments this like in a day, month, year, even lifetime. This morning I remember it\u2019s something that just we share, this taking care, this striving and fighting just to do the day. We\u2019ve shared it since the beginning. I can still see her, newly born, spiky black hair and big grey eyes. I\u2019d laid her in my hospital bed after everyone had gone home. Her father was away fighting in the war.  \u201cIt\u2019s you and me, girl. Just you and me.\u201d She\u2019s eleven now and wants to do more, but her body doesn\u2019t always work the way it should. So the glass shatters and the apple juice spills on the table, her plate of wild rice-ketchup-and mayo concoction goes flying across the room. On hands and knees I clean. She efficiently wipes ketchup on the one pair of acceptable pants and in her clean hair. She leans on me with every step, we body-walk into the world. Sometimes it seems she needs help with so many, many things. Sometimes I feel helpless to help her. But I trust that she is helped. Tonight I plop down on the couch next to her. Quietly, unexpectedly she gets my glasses and pushes them, upside down, onto my face. My shirt is somehow hiked up over my belly \u2013 I mean, my six-pack abs \u2013 and I\u2019m too tired to care. She reaches out and gently pulls down my shirt. She does it with the sense of order that she does most everything. But\u00a0her tenderness\u00a0goes into my heart. Without a sound she communicates,  I got you, Mommy. Joy invigorates, and I laugh. That I would be so perfectly cared for by the one I care for. It\u2019s one of those rare, precious moments that a word is not\u00a0just in her heart and head, but in her mouth, spontaneous and clear. I already know the answer. \u201cRhema, do you love me?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The Lord is my strength and my shield; in Him my heart trusts, and I am helped.  ~Psalm 28:7 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2015/11/12/team/", "title": "Team"},
{"date": "November 23, 2015", "body": "We were doing well. Rhema and Hope were sandwiched between Brandon and me in the pew. Rhema colored happily, feverishly on the church bulletin as the congregation sang. And then during the prayer time, Hope coughed. I knew what was happening, but my hands \u2013 trying to hold one and protect the other \u2013 did not move fast enough. Rhema, overwhelmed, let out a strangled scream and lashed out. Brandon gasped and we scrambled to contain the situation but couldn\u2019t help causing a little scene in the back of the church. Rhema\u2019s marker cap rolled a couple rows forward under the pew and she frantically lunged for it, bumping a gentleman in front of us. Once she had her cap, she and I quickly exited the sanctuary. I saw Hope as we left, huddled next to Brandon with tears streaming down her face. Her hair had been pulled pretty hard. I saw the shock and sadness in her eyes, all too familiar now, and oh it\u00a0hurt me to see her like that. We went to a classroom upstairs and Rhema calmed. I tried talking to her about what had happened. Then\u00a0we came down with more markers and paper and settled at a table outside the sanctuary doors. We would be fine, I thought, as long as we didn\u2019t go back inside the sanctuary. I tried to listen to the sermon. But I was still reeling. The aggression and self-injury that sometimes accompanies our flavor of autism can be absolutely crushing. My heart broke for Hope and Rhema. And honestly my heart broke for me. I sat there feeling sorry for myself and for the cup we\u2019d been given. During the service people were encouraged to write something they were thankful for on a paper leaf and bring it to the front. The sanctuary doors were opened and I saw Hope as she stood in line to pin her \u2018thanksgiving leaf\u2019 on a board up front. She saw us\u00a0and waved and gave me a beautiful, peaceful smile, and my eyes filled. Love without condition.\u00a0There was no doubt in my mind\u00a0what she\u2019d written on her leaf and who was at the top of her list. (I found my phone later and Brandon sent a picture of Hope\u2019s leaf). I looked at Rhema, her head down and hood up, humming softly and delighting in the swirling colors on her paper. Thanksgiving, true and deep thanksgiving flooded my soul. One of the church elders approached us. \u201cWould you like to do a leaf? I can take it in for you or I can stay with her while you take it in.\u201d I hadn\u2019t planned on writing a leaf (probably because I\u2019m stubborn). But I took him up on the offer. Without hesitation I wrote down one word and handed it to him. Autism. It\u2019s not daisies and unicorns here. Eleven years and counting, autism has taken far more than it has given to my darling girl. She struggles daily to live in a body that does not cooperate, and I dream of a time\u00a0when she can tell me something, anything of what it\u2019s like to be her. Some days all we know is helplessness, heartache and frustration. I am more inclined to find reasons to be thankful  in  the midst of a hard thing. But to me, giving thanks  for  a hard thing was thankfulness on a whole \u2018nother level. But in that moment I was grateful for the limp of \u2018disability\u2019 that forces us to lean on Him. For weakness so that we draw from the source of real strength. For God\u2019s glory in struggle and eyes that see Him now in\u00a0high definition color in the pain and the gifts and the triumph. For precious people in our lives who walk with us, cheer and uphold us. For knowing Gospel love every day that bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Autism. On a little paper leaf. A joyful offering of gratitude with all my heart, broken pieces and all, to the Giver of all good things.

{"date": "May 6, 2013", "body": "This past weekend I had the privilege of speaking at a fundraiser for Rhema\u2019s special education school. It\u2019s not easy to put into words what this school means to us\u2026 I blubbered through it! But really it\u2019s my thank you letter to her amazing teachers, clinicians and therapists. * One of the biggest questions special needs parents wrestle with is \u201cIs it Enough?\u201d Is my daughter in the right academic environment? Is my son getting all of the therapy he needs? Should we try XYZ treatment? Is he being challenged? Are we making progress? Will she have what she needs to make it in this world when I am gone? Is it enough? We are a military family, and right around the time the school opened (Rhema had been receiving therapy there for years), it was time for us to move to a new duty station. My husband was scheduled to deploy. At the time the Army had something called the Stability Transition Team \u2013 it was a 15-month deployment that involved operating with a small team \u201coutside the wire\u201d to train and counsel Iraqi police/border patrol. It was a dangerous and unpopular job \u2013 so much so that incentives were offered to deploying soldiers who would\u00a0do this mission. One incentive was getting to choose where you live. You guessed it. Brandon agreed to take the job in exchange for our family getting to stay here for another year so that Rhema\u00a0could benefit from some of the best schooling and medical services in the country. When he returned over a year later, we fought all the way up to the Surgeon General of the Army to be able to stay here. We won another 2 years. Now our time is up again. And again Rhema\u2019s dad will deploy for a year \u2013 hopefully this is the last time \u2013 so that we can stay here and Rhema can attend this beloved school. I want you to know how grateful we are for you, how much we depend on you, how much your work and care impacts our entire family. I want you to know that we will go to great lengths just so our children can learn, thrive, be who they are, and enjoy life to the fullest. Thank you, thank you for your life-changing work. I believe other parents will agree with me: At the end of the day, no matter how good or hard, we can take a deep breath knowing that our children had the best chance that day to learn and grow. Every day  you  help me answer Yes to the question of \u201cIs It Enough.\u201d At school our daughter has learned to button her shirt, to request cheese using the communication app on her iPad, to put her shoes on the right feet, to wait, to ride a bike, to use the toilet, to fold clothes, to swim and ice skate, to make eye contact, to write her name, to say hi. And the list goes on and on. Her teachers have endured massive amounts of snot, pee, poop, puke, tears, scratches, bites, hair-pulls, grabs. And that\u2019s all just from my kid. And yet their passion, commitment, creativity and belief in our children\u2019s ability to excel never wavers. Some memories that are treasured in my heart: Tim following us home from school one day just so he could help me get Rhema out of the car, Courtney and Kate\u2019s gentle, patient ways with her, Corrie\u2019s hand on her back at the swimming pool, Amanda E. soaking wet at the pool because she gave up her own towel for Rhema, Jill touring schools with me in DC when we thought we\u2019d have to move there, Katelyn putting her hand on my shoulder and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get through this, Jeneil\u201d after Rhema had an epic, tear-jerking meltdown in the parking lot, Amy M. and Chelsea coming to Rhema\u2019s Special Olympics gymnastics class on a Saturday just to help, Heather teaching her to trace letters and then write her name. These are just some of the moments I hold on to. And the amazing thing is these are just the moments I\u2019ve  seen . I know that my daughter\u2019s day is filled with countless acts of kindness and ordinary miracles made possible by the people in this room who teach her. The other day I came home and Rhema was standing in the corner in the kitchen. From a distance I could tell it one of those times when she was so present, so engaged. She had this beautiful eye contact and I was so happy to see her. I said, \u201cHi Rhema!\u201d She said, \u201cHi, hi\u201d. I said \u201cHow are you?\u201d She said \u201cGu-! Gu-!\u201d And I thought my daughter and I, we just had a conversation. Once I was told her brain was spiking and seizing 58 times a minute. And just the other day  we had a conversation . What a gift. What a miracle. And it\u2019s because of you. Your hard work and her hard work. On the  Law of the Gift,  Cardinal Dolan\u00a0said, \u201cWe are at our best, we act most in concert with what our maker intends, when we give away in love to another\u2026\u201d ( Thanks for the quote,  Emily ! ) From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you.

The good news is he doesn\u2019t have to go until July. The bad news is he has to go in July. It was time to tell the girls. We\u2019ve been particularly concerned about how Hope would handle the news. This is the girl who tries to barricade the door when loved ones leave. \u00a0 Brandon sat her down and told her, and surprisingly she was\u2026 fine. She talked about his  homecoming  after the last deployment and how she wore a bunny costume that day. She said she\u2019d miss their stinky pants fights. (Yes, that\u2019s a game in which they pelt each other with stinky pants, a game in which Mommy does not participate). Finally she simply asked, \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d \u201cIn a couple months.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Daddy.\u201d She hugged his neck and ran up the stairs to brush her teeth. I looked at him. \u201cWell, that went well. \u201cYeah,\u201d he laughed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem too broken up about it.\u201d But as I helped her get ready for bed I watched her face grow troubled and sad as the news sank in. By the time we tucked her in she was almost angry. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go! A year is too long. A year is all the way from now until a few days after Christmas!\u201d It took a minute to realize she was equating New Year\u2019s Day with a year. \u201cBabe, Daddy will be gone from July to July. That\u2019s a year.\u201d She looked at me trying to imagine it. I blabbed on, \u201cYou\u2019ll finish kindergarten, and then it will be summer right? So Daddy will be gone from this summer to next summer. He\u2019ll miss the whole first grade. And-\u201d The pained, horrified look on her face stopped me in my tracks. I turned and saw the same pained, horrified look on his face. Later I thought about it and I knew what I said was wrong. So I told her as soon as she woke up, \u201cDaddy won\u2019t miss the whole first grade, Hope. We\u2019ll take pictures and talk on the phone and skype and tell him all the juicy details. He won\u2019t be here here, but he\u2019ll be here.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know Mom.\u00a0It\u2019s kind of like God.

{"date": "May 10, 2013", "body": "November 2012 Last week I visited Hope\u2019s kindergarten class to read stories and do a craft. (I\u2019m still laughing at myself, that *I* went to school to do a *craft*. I brought Magic Noodles and basically said, \u201cOk kids\u2026 make something.\u201d) One of the stories I read was  the one  about Hope and Rhema and high-fives from the Chicken Soup book,  Raising Kids on the Spectrum . Before reading it, I provided a little background. I asked the class if they knew anything about autism, and a girl offered this explanation: \u201cIf you have autism\u2026 you kind of do things\u2026 wrong.\u201d Her words took me back to an incident several months ago. Because of the girls\u2019 schedules, I always have to drop Hope off at school first. This has not always been easy for Rhema. She used to bolt into Hope\u2019s classroom, grab paper and markers and color vigorously. Hope\u2019s teacher, always so kind and accommodating, would even set out scratch paper for Rhema to use. \u00a0And Rhema would color (on the paper  and  the tables) while I helped Hope hang up her coat and lunch and get out her school materials. The problem was she never wanted to stop coloring and leave. One particularly off morning, I used my best therapist voice and told her she could color for one more minute and then it was time to be all done. Hope and her classmates were already seated and ready to begin their day. After a minute passed I cheerily said, \u201cAll done, Rhema. Let\u2019s clean up.\u201d I moved to help her put away the crayons and markers. She screamed and grabbed me by the collar. \u201cRhema,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go. Let\u2019s be all done.\u201d She let go of my collar, grabbed another\u2019s student\u2019s project and started scribbling on it. \u201cNo, Rhema. That\u2019s not yours. We are all done coloring.\u201d She grabbed me by the hair and screamed again. The more I tried to talk to her the more resistant and angry she became. Hope tried to help, but Rhema escalated quickly and any control I thought I had slipped away. As she screamed, many of Hope\u2019s classmates covered their ears. One girl looked like she was about to cry and said she wanted her Mommy.  I  was about to cry and wanted my Mommy. I ended up leaving an agitated Rhema in the classroom while I ran to get my phone out of the car. Eventually I was able to distract her from the coloring with my phone and walk her outside. It was not a happy scene. . \u201cSometimes kids with autism do things differently. But it\u2019s not wrong.\u201d I told the class last week. As I learn more about the people in my life with autism I continue to be amazed by their \u201cdifferent\u201d. How creative, resourceful, and brilliant they are, how blessed we are to learn from them. \u201cCan you imagine needing and wanting to say something but you cannot? Can you imagine how frustrating and challenging that could be?\u201d I really had not come to talk about autism. I\u2019d come to read bug stories and hand out gummy worms. But I hoped they\u2019d remember, that what I had said had made a difference. \u201cYou know, Hope\u2019s sister has autism. Did you know that they have never fought? They have never said an unkind word to each other, not one. When Hope is sad, Rhema is sad. And when Rhema is sad, sometimes the only one who can cheer her is Hope. They have a really, really special relationship. I\u2019m their Mommy and even I am amazed by it.\u201d I looked at Hope sitting next to me in the circle. She smiled shyly, but oh my goodness, she shined. Love and joy radiated from her whole body. ] . The next day the kids were on the playground when Rhema, Hope and I arrived. A girl from Hope\u2019s class ran over to us. \u201cHi Rhema!\u201d  she said. My heart swelled, and\u00a0we grinned big. When Rhema didn\u2019t make a sound or look at her, the girl asked me if she could hear. \u201cYes, she can. She hears you loud and clear.

Rhema holding hands with her dad during EEG hookup. \u00a0The EEG was challenging. But we were able to get the leads on and keep them on (sort of) so I\u2019m calling it a success! During an ambulatory EEG, you are advised to dress your child in a button-down shirt because you will not be able to pull anything over her head. I rarely follow that instruction because I can never find a cool, comfortable button-down top that Rhema will wear. I just put her in a shirt I\u2019m willing to cut off if need be. This time Rhema had an accident overnight, completely soaking her shirt and the hospital-issued backpack containing the electrodes. A scene played out in our bathroom that I won\u2019t forget. Brandon holding the EEG equipment close to her head while I carefully removed the wet clothing and cleaned her up. Rhema doing her best to stand still. And Hope, when she wasn\u2019t running to get whatever we needed \u2013 from scissors to another backpack, she was there holding Rhema\u2019s hand. Sniff. I could almost see and hear the Sesame Street puppets parading around the room, singing \u201cCooperation Makes it Happen.\u201d As we headed into the kitchen for breakfast Hope said to Rhema, \u201cI\u2019m so glad God made you my sister. He knew you were exactly what I needed.\u201d Rhema never indicated that she heard or was paying attention, but that\u2019s always been fine by Hope. Hope will often take what is said to her and turn it around. She\u2019s heard people say, \u2018Hope is exactly what Rhema needed\u2019 or \u2018Hope is so good for Rhema\u2019 or \u2018God knew what he was doing when he put Hope in your family.\u2019 It\u2019s all so true. But I love Hope\u2019s perspective. That Rhema is good for  her , exactly what she needs. My friend Jett once wrote to me after a hard day with Rhema:  He made you for her.  And He made her for me.

You have to hear Dorothy Norwood sing it with the Georgia Mass Choir (click -> here <-) to really  feel  it. Last week we were in crisis mode with dear Rhema. The intensity of her destructive behaviors left me crushed and shaken for days. I don\u2019t recall ever being so afraid for my girl and what she might do. We went from hoping for a good day to just trying to get through the next hour. We\u00a0even gave voice to\u00a0our deepest, unspoken fears \u2013 What if this doesn\u2019t stop? What if she gets worse? What if it gets so bad she can\u2019t stay at home? No, no, no. She had dental \u201csurgery\u201d last week and we were in the recovery room waiting for her to wake up from anesthesia. A nurse wanting to make conversation said, \u201cWe had a teenaged girl with autism in here last week. She was nonverbal. So you know. Her method of expressing herself was kicking, screaming, biting\u2026 it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d Her words stung and lit my fears on fire. \u201cMy daughter is nonverbal, too.\u201d She communicates in many ways. And I am praying with all my heart that peace will rule inside her and that we\u2019ll be able to understand all she\u2019s trying to tell us. . Throughout the week\u00a0I was lifted by the amazing gift of comfort, the knowledge that we are not alone. From family, friends, friends of friends, churches\u2026 I was\u00a0blown away and humbled that people would care to say a prayer for us. Thank you so much!

What a special community. Thank you, dear friend). And Thursday I felt the winds and waves\u00a0settle. Hope knew it too. She peeked into Rhema\u2019s room and then declared, \u201cMommy. Rhema\u2019s getting happy again!\u201d \u201cYou turned my wailing into dancing; \n  you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy , \n \u00a0 that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. \n  Lord my God, I will praise you forever.\u201d \n ~Psalm 30:11-12 (Another friend reminded me of this passage). To see her body at peace and the smile on her face, to hear her hum again\u2026 I tell you it was like the brightest sun was dawning in my house. And I knew that if it only lasted a minute it was all I needed to keep going, keep hoping. Thankfully that moment has stretched \u2014 the past several days have been pretty good. I can\u2019t help but kiss her cheek and whisper, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back.\u201d Because you can\u2019t go through such extreme weather and not be changed. My friend Judith has walked a similar path and she said it best: we\u2019re holding our breath. Waiting, wondering, looking in every direction for the next tornado. Doing everything we can to try and fend it off. But I want to/need to breathe again. When the next tempest comes, I want to cling to this: But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again.  On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, as you help us by your prayers.  Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many. ~2 Cor. 1:9,10 As for today, she is getting happy.

Melissa, Laura, Rachel and Dana have been sitters and respite care for us, and\u00a0all have left an imprint. They will always be dear to us. Laura now works as an ABA counselor at a residential program. (But we had her first!) For over a year she cared for the girls two afternoons a week, took them on Gloucester adventures and fed them a million gluten free chicken nuggets. She knew I missed them while I was at work and she would send  pictures  and  videos  to me all the time. I never worried for a second when she was with the girls and that\u2019s no small thing. I told her that for a mother to know that her children are safe, well cared for and happy\u2026 well you just can\u2019t put a price on that. I\u2019ll never forget the Saturday morning she met me at Rhema\u2019s speech therapy appointment bearing hot chocolate. We sat in the waiting area and I asked her how I could pray for her.

Laura insisted on having Rhema and Hope at her bridal shower and wedding. At her shower, I worried that we might cause quite a disturbance with Rhema running circles or shrieking or sampling other people\u2019s food. But her family gathered us under their wings, loved on us, treated us like honored guests. I think Rhema sat on Laura\u2019s lap for half of the shower (all 75 pounds of her). Even in planning her reception she thought of us \u2013 telling me in advance the best time to arrive, making sure to seat us near the bathroom  and  near the food (Yes!), having lots of coloring books and crayons and beads\u2026 she thought of everything. At the wedding, we sat in the back and tried to be quiet. But before the ceremony even began Rhema started having trouble. Now normally I don\u2019t mind taking her to walk around outside or hide out in the bathroom. But this time I gave Brandon a look that he correctly interpreted as, \u2018Dude, ain\u2019t no way I\u2019m missing this wedding.\u2019 He promptly exited with Rhema.

It\u2019s a good thing, too, because it was the most beautiful and sacred ceremony. I\u2019m sure everyone in the room felt blessed to witness and be a part of it. Later Brandon told me that when he and Rhema stepped outside, Laura saw them from the limo bus. She immediately asked for them to come inside. When her wedding party got off the bus and entered the church, Rhema remained, happily sitting with Laura. Laura gave her gummy bears and granola bars to eat.

It was exciting the first time she did it with assistance and even more thrilling when she did it independently. And then of course it turned into a stim. I think. I\u2019d wonder, Is she stimming? Is she requesting? Is she really understanding any of this? (Sometimes when she wants cheese she taps out something\u00a0quite different like \u201cI am nine years old. I am nine years old.

I suppose it should have been enough that she could \u201cpractice\u201d with the girls, but I wanted more. In a huff I decided,  This Special Olympics program is just not a good fit for her.  And then I wondered, if not here, where? Where can she go? Hope has dance and piano. Her cousins have soccer. I\u2019ve been praying, fervently praying, that we would find Rhema\u2019s thing. Something she could do and enjoy; something outside of school and therapy that could her help her learn and thrive. After more than a year off, we returned to the gymnastics program this past weekend. Everyone was happy to see her, and Shea, a high school senior who has been a volunteer coach for years, took Rhema by the hand. She led her to the warm-up circle and motioned for Rhema to sit down with the others. I was ready to step in and explain, \u2018Oh, she\u2019ll have trouble with the circle time.\u2019 But I held\u00a0back. Rhema\u2019s body was yearning to run, but she sat down in the circle and hummed and rocked. Around the circle, each team member said their name. It seemed to take forever, but Rhema remained in the circle. When it was her turn to say her name, everyone waited for a bit, and then finally Shea introduced her. Rhema didn\u2019t say her name, but I loved that they waited, gave her a chance anyway. Throughout the practice I anxiously watched Shea and Rhema. Shea was so purposeful and patient. And Rhema tried to do everything she was asked to do. My goodness,  she tried so hard.  I\u00a0got teary\u00a0just watching her. Verbal communication is difficult for her, but so is non-verbal imitation. When seated on the mat, Shea would tap her knees repeatedly and tell Rhema to tap her knees. Rhema would reach over and tap Shea\u2019s knees. When Shea asked her to walk on the balance beam, Rhema would eagerly  sit  on the balance beam. Still Shea was a creative teacher! With assistance, Rhema actually did two forward rolls on the mat. First time ever!!! I don\u2019t know if this is Rhema\u2019s thing. But I am deeply thankful for the special people God brings to our lives ((Shea.)) I was so encouraged to see how far Rhema\u2019s come. So proud of her. So happy to see her happy. And you know that thing gymnasts do before and after a routine? They raise their arms in the air in salute. Throughout the whole practice, Shea tried to demonstrate this. Rhema would just stare or run or drop to the ground. And then, at the very end, Shea raised her arms and Rhema threw her hands in the air. Shea grinned and looked over and I was jumping and cheering and raising my arms like we\u2019d just received a perfect 10. Victory.

There was a man possessed and tormented by a \u201clegion\u201d of demons. He screamed a lot, cut himself with rocks, and\u00a0lived in the graveyard. \u201cOoooo,\u201d said Hope. When Jesus came to town, the man ran to him and fell on his knees. The demons didn\u2019t want to be kicked out of the country so they begged Jesus to send them into two thousand pigs browsing nearby. \u201cTwo thousand pigs!!\u201d So the demons went into the pigs and the pigs went crazy and jumped in the lake and drowned. The man was healed! And there he was sitting still with Jesus, fully clothed, talking and listening to Him. He asked if he could go with Jesus, but Jesus said no. \u201cWhy did Jesus say no?\u201d He had other plans for him. He said,  \u2018Go home to your friends and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, how He has had compassion on you.\u2019  And that\u2019s exactly what the man did. \u201cWhat great things has God done for you?\u201d I asked Hope. \u201cUm, you go first.\u201d I wanted to say this: He has done that for me which none but a God could do. He has subdued my stubborn will, melted a heart of adamant, opened gates of brass, and snapped bars of iron. He hath turned for me my mourning into laughter, and my desolation into joy; he hath led my captivity captive, and made my heart rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory\u2026 And he is full of grace. Ah! had he not been I should never have been saved. He drew me when I struggled to escape from his grace; and when at last I came all trembling like a condemned culprit to his mercy-seat he said, \u2018Thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee: be of good cheer.\u2019 And he is full of truth. True have his promises been, not one has failed. I bear witness that never servant had such a master as I have; never brother such a kinsman as he has been to me; never spouse such a husband as Christ has been to my soul; never sinner a better Saviour; never mourner a better comforter than Christ hath been to my spirit. ~Charles Spurgeon Instead I said, \u201cJust like that spooky man, God rescued me from the darkness and brought me into light. He showed me such great compassion and great salvation. Your turn.\u201d \u201cOk, ok,\u201d she said. \u201cWell! You know how you were mad this morning because we were running late?

There were (and continue to be) moments of discouragement and uncertainty, periods of separation from her husband, and times when even their lives were in danger. She said it was a season of asking, Is God really worth it? There are days, with the husband far away for so long, when the demands of home, work, life, motherhood, and wifehood seem like more than I can handle. (For the record, I don\u2019t buy the oft-quoted sentiment, \u2018God doesn\u2019t give you more than you can handle.\u2019 The phrase is not anywhere in the Bible and it\u2019s pretty funny to me because life, particularly life as a special needs mama, is  way  more than I can handle.

Because at times it\u2019s all so much, the notion sneaks in my head that I can be careless about the little-big things, my words, my thoughts and actions, the places in which I struggle. That I am somehow excused. That I deserve to do the easy thing. Drop the shield of faith. Give the heart guard a night off. Is God worth it? (My ceiling really is bubbling right now).

{"date": "August 5, 2013", "body": "The other day we were at the playground, and as is often the case when we are around other children, I was struck by Rhema\u2019s differences, her challenges. There was a spiral pole that was severed and had a large hole midway down; caution tape was\u00a0wrapped all around it. Before I could blink Rhema had climbed onto the top of the pole. I spent a moment struggling to get her off, but as she slid further down she became completely entangled in the caution tape. A woman rushed over to help. \u201cShe\u2019s autistic,\u201d I explained. \u201cOh, I know. I could tell. I was a special ed teacher in the public schools.\u201d Rhema decided she wasn\u2019t getting off that pole no matter how much sweet ABA-talking we did. It took\u00a0much effort to finger peel her clenched hands from the pole and unwrap her 9-year old legs. We managed to get her down unharmed and I was so thankful for the woman\u2019s help. However Rhema was agitated and angry about being rescued, and I slowly body-walked her across the playground to the car. In the end it wasn\u2019t a big deal. It was just one incident in a series of incidents that left me grappling with the whys and hows I became the mother of a girl with special needs. I felt keenly the weight on my shoulders \u2013 the one labeled \u201clife long care.\u201d You can\u2019t quite understand it unless you\u2019ve lived it \u2013 the everyday-ness, every month-ness, every year-ness of taking care of every aspect of someone\u2019s life and knowing that, to some extent, you always will. I honestly asked God to speak to me about all of it: the why me?/why her? thoughts and emotions, the weary ho-hum days, park incidents, etc. I scanned my Bible in case I\u2019d somehow missed the one chapter or verse written to special needs moms. I found this: This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.  ~1 John 3:16 First we were loved, now we love. He loved us first.  ~ 1 John 4:19 and this: And hope does not put us to shame, because God\u2019s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.  ~ Romans 5:5 \u2026And the life which I now live\u2026 I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  ~Gal. 2:20 As a starry-eyed twenty year old I spent\u00a0months in Ethiopia\u00a0spoon-feeding bedridden, malnourished children, bathing them, dressing them, loving them. I often wonder if God was setting the stage, preparing my heart for this special kind of motherhood. I don\u2019t know. But\u00a0I\u2019m grateful for the gospel and that He keeps showing me\u00a0grace and patience and faith and selfless love through my children in Ethiopia all those years ago and my daughters now. Ann Voskamp wrote a  beautiful post  to her husband, and it ministered to my heart about life with Rhema: \u201cBut real love is when you live the daily faithfulness of making whole decades of minutes tell the truth about the glorious gospel\u2026 \n Your days have done this. \n You have told me about who Christ is, how He dies to self and gives when there\u2019s nothing left and gives up what is His and gives to those who don\u2019t deserve, so they can have more, and I have seen Christ in you, the way you live, the way you make your life about laying down.\u201d Oh, may my days do this kind of love!

She is\u00a0not tempted in the least to eat foods containing allergens \u2013 she\u2019s been sickened enough times to know\u00a0it\u2019s not worth it.\u00a0It kind of stinks for her but it works out pretty well for me. Picture us in the grocery store. I put her in the front of the cart, smooth her hair, squeeze her cheeks just before we stroll by the bakery section.

Hope knows to smile and keep her mouth shut while I graciously reach out and take the cookie. \u201cWhy thank you,\u201d I say. We wheel away to the frozen food aisle where I devour the cookie, careful not to let any crumbs fall on my baby. Works like a charm every time.

Now that she\u2019s a big first grader she\u2019s doing a reading program at school. You know the deal. Your child reads x number of books and she wins a certificate for a free pizza. The first month of the program was absolutely\u00a0grueling. I had to constantly help her sound out the tough words. It seemed like all I heard was, \u201cMommy, what does o-n-o-m-a-t-o-p-o-e-i-a spell? And I had to sign off every time she read for 15 minutes or more. It was tough, but I kept my eye on the prize.

Finally today she presented  my  her prize. \u201cWhat did you say to your teacher when you turned in your reading log, Hope?\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want a pencil this time.

{"date": "December 11, 2013", "body": "I had a meeting at the behavior therapy center associated with Rhema\u2019s school last week, and Hope tagged along. We were walking through the hall when Hope squealed \u201cRhema!\u201d Rhema was not at the therapy center that day so I was confused as to why Hope had called her sister\u2019s name. Then I saw the block letters R H E M A in an office above a desk. Instantly I recognized the letters as the ones in which Rhema had learned to trace her name. I knew the desk must belong to  Heather , Rhema\u2019s former OT, and I didn\u2019t know that\u00a0she had saved the letters. Heather taught Rhema how to trace and write her name a few years ago. Teachers at a previous school had suggested it could not be done, giving her a stamp with her name on it\u00a0instead. But  Heather believed big things  for my girl. Heather and Rhema, August 2010 Can\u2019t tell you what it did for me as I stood there in the hallway, staring at those 5 traced letters on the wall. The words to an old Sara Groves song floated through my head, \u201c Hope has a way of turning its face to you just when you least expect it. You walk in a room, you look out a window and something there leaves you breathless. You say to yourself\u2026 \u00a0it feels like it might be hope.\u201d I\u2019d been focused on the difficult days Rhema was having at home and school. I\u2019d been concerned about its impact on her teachers and her learning. I\u2019d been thinking about all the things she struggled with at age 2.5 that she\u2019s still struggling with at age 9.5. Seeing\u00a0R H E M A in Heather\u2019s office was a precious reminder for me: In the midst of the doing and working and advocating and parenting and praying, I have a reason to be excited. Excited because my daughter has been blessed with teachers who love her and inspire her and she loves and inspires them in return (!!!). \u00a0Excited because she has made great progress. Excited because God is in it all. And anything is possible. I wrote to Heather about the letters and how they encouraged my heart:  I think sometimes we think/expect the super-beautiful, super-talented, popular people to be the much-loved ones (at least I do). Rhema is talented and beautiful but she has trying days and challenging behaviors, she makes messes, she needs continuous one-on-one support, etc \u2026 and yet she is truly loved and celebrated by you and her other teachers. It blesses me more than words can say\u2026 Heather wrote back:  Whenever I am asked why I love being an OT I always talk about teaching Rhema to write her name. I keep the letters at my desk to remind myself why I do what I do and how rewarding and lucky I am to get to work with these kids. Every day it reminds me to do my best and that little miracles happen every day. Thank you for letting me be a small part of your children\u2019s lives. I mean\u2026 WOW.\u00a0Having teachers like Heather in my child\u2019s life is God doing the \u2018exceeding abundantly above all\u00a0that I\u00a0ask or imagine\u2019 (Eph. 3:20).

And on the day we the bereaved, gathered to celebrate her life, the pastor stood and said, \u201cThis is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\u201d \n(Ps. 118:24) And rejoice we did. Because she is finally home. And rejoice we did. Because  she  did. In her days that the Lord made, she was glad. . I\u2019ve been studying Genesis 1 with friends. I\u2019ve heard it all before. God said \u201clet there be light\u201d and there was light\u2026 God saw that the light was good and\u2026 God called the light Day.\u00a0So many times I\u2019ve heard or read those words and they never made their way into my heart until now. God, who is Light, gave light. And called it good. And called it day.  \u201cThis is the Lord\u2019s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.\u201d  (Ps.118:23) Of late, my days with Rhema have been challenging. She\u2019s such a good girl, really. She just requires so much care and attention, and honestly I spend much of my time \u2026  regretting . On this day, my almost-6 year old repeatedly messed her pants, put things in her mouth she shouldn\u2019t, (bit me when I tried to get them out), did not speak, did not look, did not focus, did not comply, and became so frustrated and upset that she broke out into hives. And my husband, on the phone, on the other side of the world, still wants to know, \u201c God, what happened? \u201d Nearly four years since the diagnosis\u2026 and there are times when still we\u00a0wrestle with \u201cwhy\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow could\u201d this happen. God, in great glory and wonder, made this day. He magnificently ordained it to be as it is:  good . O may I follow Debi\u2019s example and raise my arms\u00a0to rejoice in the\u00a0Maker of my days. May I honor Him with my life\u00a0in this day. In\u00a0all He has given me, may I be glad.

I was confused by her request until she climbed into my lap and hugged my neck, taking my breath away. The roles reversed, my baby holding me. (How very, very blessed am I ~ God has given me tangible hope and wrapped it around me.) After a minute, she leaned back and peered at me, \u201cDo you need some more comfort?\u201d \u201cOh yes, please.\u201d I said. How does she do that?  I\u2019ve been thinking about comfort a lot lately, how to give it, how to receive it. My 3-year old is amazingly perceptive, sensitive, dramatic; an eager dispenser of love. My almost 6-year old spends much of life in her own world, seemingly unaware of those around her. The contrast is glaring. This story \u00a0resonated with me. There are times when my Rhema is  overcome . She cries a mournful, heart-rending cry, and we often have no idea what has made her so sad. Her teacher told me that Rhema seems to have a pride in her crying, her head held high, her little fists at her eyes trying to stop the tears. She is not easily consoled. Many a sleepless night, I have tried to reach her, hold her in my arms. But she resists. She cannot tell me what\u2019s wrong or what she feels or needs in the moment. I am her mother and I am lost, unable to conquer the lifelong silence between us. When I\u2019m helpless to help the one I love, I\u2019m learning that sometimes it\u2019s enough just to  be . Just to  sit with her  in the darkness. And pray for the Light. To love with all my heart from a distance.  That , I can do. That, I feel honored to do. Recently there have been a few precious times, with a few precious people, where Rhema has truly allowed herself to be still and safe. . \u201cWhen my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your comforts delight my soul.\u201d  Ps. 94:19. God, the true consolation-giver reminds me that He alone is my solace; the way He gives it is specific and best, and my heart is glad in Him. . It had been a rough day. For both of us. She was standing in her chair at the kitchen table, spinning around and around. As I rushed by her, she reached out to me.  She reached out to me \u2026 and tried to jam a whole apple into my mouth. Not wanting to lose the moment I grabbed a bag of pre-sliced apples out of the fridge. Slice by slice, she pushed the apples in my mouth. I savored the loving, deliberate attention she\u00a0offered as she fed me.\u00a0As if\u00a0she were\u00a0saying, \u201cMommy, lemme give you some comfort.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cTank ew, tank ew,\u201d she whispered back.

{"date": "January 26, 2010", "body": "Things have been extra full around these parts. I went back to work part-time (that was not so bright), a dear friend has been staying with us, and I feel like I\u2019ve been learning a  lot . There\u2019s so much I want to sit with and think about and write about \u2013 I\u2019m so thankful for this space. With Brandon deployed I always get a little anxious when it snows. A few Sundays ago there was a snow storm (one of several we\u2019ve had this winter). The girls and I camped out in my bedroom in the morning hours \u2013 Rhema bounced around and Hope stared out the big window at the beautiful winter wonderland. \u201cHope, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll make it to church this morning. If we don\u2019t get plowed we won\u2019t be going anywhere.\u201d \u201cOhhhhhhhh nnoooooooo,\u201d Hope said, in dramatic fashion. We watched and waited and waited. I knew that the man who plows our driveway was probably very busy that morning. After some time, I said, \u201cI think we\u2019re stuck, girls.\u201d As we\u00a0headed downstairs, Hope took one last look out the big bedroom window. I heard the truck before I saw it. \u201cMommy!!!\u201d  she screamed. \u201cHe\u2019s here! Daddy\u2019s here! He came to  save  us!!!\u201d I went to the window. A friend from church, in his truck, was already barreling up the driveway. We could clearly see him through the window, and I realized for the first time that he looked a lot like Brandon \u2013 same hair color and height \u2013 and he was wearing a baseball cap just like Brandon often does. \u201cNo, Hope. That\u2019s not Daddy. You know he\u2019s in Iraq. That\u2019s Mr. Happel down there.\u201d \u201cNO. That\u2019s Daddy\u2026\u201d I was taken aback at the force of her words. She began waving at the window and calling, \u201cHi, Daddy! Hi!! You\u2019re here from Iraq. Hi Daddy!\u201d \u201cBaby. That\u2019s not Daddy,\u201d I said as gently as I could. \u201cThat\u2019s Mr. Happel. You know. Emma and Sophie\u2019s dad. He\u2019s plowing the snow for us\u2026 now we can go to church!\u201d \u201cNO! That\u2019s my Daddy plowing snow! Hi Daddy!\u201d For a moment, I was at a loss. Only a week before,  Santa  had shown up at the door and made her dreams come true. In her 3-year old mind, it was easy to believe that Daddy could suddenly appear and rescue us from the snow. It took some time for Mr. Happel to plow the big driveway. Hope never left the upstairs window and continued to call out to \u201cDaddy.\u201d (He, of course, could not hear her). At one point, Mr. Happel got out of his truck to shovel in front of the garage. This brought squeals from Hope as she frantically waved out the window, willing him to look up and see her. It broke my heart. When he got out of the truck I knew it would not be long before Hope realized the truth. I watched her as she watched him. First, confusion. Then, realization. Finally, tears. Tears of disappointment like I\u2019d never seen in her before. I held her in my arms as she cried, her little body tense, even angry. She\u2019s such a happy, care-free princess girl. But she\u2019s a sensitive one, and she never forgets. It hit me that maybe this separation had had more of an impact on her than I imagined. It took an unusually long time for me to see her bright smile again that day. I knew all along that there were times when she missed him, but until then I didn\u2019t know how much she needed him. Later, when she calmed down, I said, \u201cSweet girl. Your Daddy loves you so much\u2026 so much. You know?\u201d \u201cYeah, I know. He loves me this much!\u201d she said, arms spread wide. As a birthday gift, Hope was given  The Jesus Storybook Bible . The stories in this book are so relevant and timely and have ministered to us greatly. There\u2019s a song in the book that says simply, God loves us with a Never Stopping, Never Giving Up, Unbreaking, Always and Forever Love. I\u2019ve watched Hope grasp the fact that her father loves her with a never-ending love even though he\u2019s been away for nearly six months \u2013 a lifetime for a child. Even though he wasn\u2019t there for her first day of pre-school, or for autumn afternoons at the park, or for her birthday or Thanksgiving or Christmas. And even though he wasn\u2019t there to rescue her with a snow plow, she has his love, she\u2019s secure in it and better for it. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power\u2026 to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,\u00a0and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u2026 Eph 3:17-18 Oh, how God teaches me through these little ones. To trust and rest in the loving heart of my Father. Winter is long and hard. And there are times when He seems far away and silent, times when\u00a0I wonder why He won\u2019t answer my desperate calls for rescue. I long to have the faith of a child who doesn\u2019t worry about being worthy, but simply,  really  believes\u00a0she is loved. By a Father who never leaves, never breaks, never\u00a0stops giving Always and Forever Love.\u00a0 From the Jesus Storybook Bible ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jesusstorybookbible.com/", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/father_daughter.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/father_daughter1.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/love-in-winter/", "title": "Love in Winter"},

Not just a wish or fancy, but an abiding, unshakeable expectation. It\u2019s peaceful just now, though wind and tide have rocked the boat. I know of storms raging family without power homeless men in the subway heartache of friends screaming pressures at work babies battling cancer a beloved aunt in her last days I know of chaos and confusion, weakness and regret. We should surely sink. And yet we are held fast. I read aloud to her the passage from my morning study \u2013 shared with a dozen women in a circle huddled over Bibles, in their own storms: \u201cWe have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf.\u201d Heb. 6:19-20 In the stillness I ask her, \u201cYou know what an anchor is, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, it keeps the\u00a0boat from going away.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut Mama, what\u2019s our soul?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like the deepest part inside you. Everything you think and feel and know and makes you you. With God, our souls have an anchor.\u201d \u201cLike the boat.\u201d \u201cLike the boat. Hope keeps our souls from going away.\u201d It\u2019s my day off from work and I cherish our time together \u2013 we talk and talk and talk and eat McDonalds, bounce around the gym and practice for piano. We pick up a happy Rhema from school. She\u2019s had some tough days lately, but when I put her to bed she thrills me unexpectedly with a beautifully clear \u201cnight night\u201d and \u201cluh yew\u201d (love you). \u00a0I seriously kick up my heels as I close her door \u2013 no medical report or school evaluation or future fear can steal the joy from the moment. And then the husband refuses to be lazy about me. He fights the weariness and frustrations of the day and all the words unspoken; he finds new ways to connect and I know I am loved.

She\u2019s extremely ill; hospice has been called. We just want you to know she may not recognize you or respond. But as my twin and I quickly prepared to board a red-eye flight to Florida, I almost smiled at their warnings. While\u00a0it might break my heart to see my aunt in such a state, I would not be the least bit afraid or fazed by a lack of response. \u00a0\u00a0 My daughter has taught me well: when the tongue is bound and eyes don\u2019t seem to see and ears don\u2019t seem to hear, love translates.\u00a0 Autism mamas know\u00a0the power of connection, we\u00a0look for it in\u00a0unlikely places. We know to cherish it, celebrate it, no matter how small. As soon as we\u00a0got there\u00a0I plopped down on the bed beside her just like a little girl again. I didn\u2019t need her to accept me or recognize me. This good, good woman who\u2019d raised my father during hard times and loved all of us children like a fierce mother hen.\u00a0I had a lifetime of memories and so much\u00a0adoration and gratitude spilling over. And she who had been largely unresponsive the day before looked at me straight on and found words. Above the hiss of the oxygen pump, I heard her whisper her familiar salutation, sweet Southern drawl: \u201cHi, baby.\u201d In my world we\u2019ve been working on greetings for years. \u201cHi\u201d is an embrace, one of the best words. Her room was filled with visitors. My sister and I only had the day and we never left that room. My aunt seemed to have moments of clarity when she was with us and then she would slip away. My sister reluctantly went to the bathroom while I spoke with my father on the phone and others in the room chatted. When my twin emerged from the bathroom, my aunt suddenly roused and stared at her, a wide smile on her face. \u201cOoooohhh!!!\u201d she exclaimed in joy and recognition. Every brief smile, every feisty word (she called my father and uncle \u201cbigheads\u201d) we treasured.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course I thought of my girl. The similarities between autism and Alzheimer\u2019s. I thought again of the way God longs to connect/talk with us like autism mamas do with their children. I\u00a0thought of what in life is truly important and all that is unnecessary. I thought of the time I\u2019ve\u00a0spent on missing what I\u2019m missing and\u00a0wringing my hands over little things, really,\u00a0and counting losses. When the challenge\u00a0remains: to\u00a0count blessings instead. To still\u00a0feel grace falling down like rain in a room with\u00a0loved ones\u00a0staring\u00a0death in the face.

{"date": "November 21, 2011", "body": "Oh yeah. The blog. Step away for a bit and it\u2019s a little hard to find the way back. I got a break from it all! Flew to Kansas City to spend a girls weekend with dear friends I had not seen in  years.  Ten years ago we were young and kid-less, studying James, Philippians and \u201cBad Girls of the Bible\u201d together, and forming life-giving, life-lasting friendships. So last weekend we escaped\u00a0to a quirky little cottage to laugh, talk, relax, eat gourmet cupcakes, sleep (some of us!), watch chick flicks and pamper ourselves. It was a wonderful time away \u2013 the kind of time that\u00a0lifts you and gives you what you need to keep going. My mother-in-law came for a visit and took care of the little kids (Rhema and Hope) and the big kids (Brandon and me). My grandmothers died too young, and I never got a chance to know them. I\u2019m so thankful for the time my girls have with their grandparents; their lives are rich and full because of Grandma and Nana. Hope\u00a0attends a Christian private school. Recently she informed me that she\u2019s bored with her clothes. She goes two days a week. She\u2019s in  Pre-K . And already she\u2019s got an issue with the dress code. So to break up the monotony of her Pre-K existence Grandma made her a one-of-a-kind jumper\u2026 with stars! and a secret message on the inside hem! When she\u2019s having a tough day or just not feeling sure of herself, she can flip back the edge of her dress and know she\u2019s not alone:  Jesus loves her  (and Grandma does, too!) In other news, Brandon had surgery to remove a chunk\u00a0of skin cancer from his neck. He\u2019s pretty chopped up, and it\u2019s\u00a0kind of\u00a0gross, and we\u2019ve been letting the jokes fly (a little inappropriately). Such a shame. He only missed Halloween by a couple weeks. \u00a0 Thanksgiving is at my house this year, and I\u2019m doing the turkey for the first time! When Rhema was younger she was absolutely petrified of sticking her hand in a bag \u2013 a shopping bag, a brown paper bag, a Ziploc bag with her favorite pretzels \u2013 she absolutely would not do it. Scared to death. Now I can empathize with her because I\u2019m soooo afraid to stick my hand inside that turkey and pull out the slimy neck bone and giblets \u2013 yuck! In my dreams I see my 16-pound decapitated raw turkey doing the jive in the kitchen sink with Brandon\u2019s Frankenstein head\u00a0going gobble gobble gobble\u00a0and bobbling on top. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/nov11-003.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/nov11-010.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/nov11-017.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/nov11-014.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/frankenstein_neck.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/frankenstein_turkey.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/gatherings/", "title": "Gatherings"},

I love you. I love you.\u201d She doesn\u2019t look at me, she seems completely unaffected as she plays on the stairs. She understands so much more now. I always wonder, does she understand this? What I mean when I say \u2018I love you.\u2019? Does she  feel  loved when I say the words? \u201cRhema. Do you love\u2026 me? Do you love me?\u201d Why do I sound vulnerable? How silly. She looks up suddenly, fixes her gaze just past me, and spontaneously speaks, \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d Her words go into my heart and I have to sit down. I think it can\u2019t be real. When she says a word it\u2019s never just once. It\u2019s always repeated two or three times. She says \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah\u201d a fair amount these days, but it\u2019s not always the appropriate response, sometimes she doesn\u2019t seem to understand the question and \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah\u201d is just\u00a0her go-to phrase. I know you love me in your own sweet way, but are you really trying to tell me right now? \u201cRhema. You love me. You do? You do?\u201d  This child God gave me who brings me to my knees and then inspires me to stand every day, (all in the same day or hour or minute), my girl, my darling half-dressed daughter with popsicle juice in her wild hair. She climbs into my lap, gives me a buck-toothed smile, says, \u201cDo, do, do.\u201d . If you have an inkling of what this means to me, multiply that by a thousand and you might be getting close.

We sat at outside a little bakery eating our not-sweet-at-all pastries, and I could literally see Switzerland from where I sat. \u00a0 \n Rhema (age 1) and I under the Swiss flag. On the German side. \n \u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go, B.\u201d \u201cGo where?\u201d \u201cSwitzerland! I\u2019ve never been!\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t go.

You know how neutral they are about these things! They won\u2019t mind.\u201d He just stared at me. \u201cOf course, they\u2019ll notice. And of course they\u2019ll mind.\u201d \u201cOh please? Let\u2019s just try. I\u2019ll bat my eyelashes.\u201d I begged and pleaded and batted my eyelashes until I somehow (amazingly) convinced the husband to try to get me into Switzerland on my expired\u00a0passport. Yes, the man must have been crazy\u2026 in love. (Ha!) \u00a0 At the border, it\u00a0turned out they did notice. And they did mind. \u00a0 The mean old border police dude said,  No way, Jose.  (Only in Swiss.) But in order to exit we had to drive a little loop from the entry point to the exit point. It took about\u00a05 minutes to\u00a0drive our little loop, and during that time we were in Switzerland! \u00a0 And when we tried to get back into Germany, the border patrol decided to give us some trouble. Tried to bribe us and make us pay\u00a050 euro to get back in, and Brandon wasn\u2019t having that. So we\u00a0were detained there for about\u00a015 minutes while Brandon and the German Bundeswehr duked it out. I definitely count those 15 minutes as time I spent in Switzerland. \u00a0 The last time I took Rhema to the dentist on my own\u2026 well, we certainly  drove  there. We even did one minute in the waiting room, before\u00a0she decided to run for her life. And then we spent about ten minutes wrestling in the parking lot. And somehow we made it\u00a0back inside, and she gripped the door frames and screamed bloody murder at the dentist\u2019s chair while the dentist and I discussed scheduling her next appointment at a nearby hospital with general anesthesia just so that one day he can actually look inside her mouth. All in all we were\u00a0there about 720 seconds. \u00a0 But she totally went to the dentist. \u00a0 And I totally went to Switzerland. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc00964.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/it-totally-counts/", "title": "It totally counts"},
{"date": "March 19, 2012", "body": "Rhema hides her face. A lot. She does it when walking into a crowded or unfamiliar place. She does it at home. She does it when someone calls her name. She does it when there\u2019s a sudden noise or a raised voice. Sometimes I\u2019m sure it\u2019s her way of trying to shut out the world when she\u2019s overwhelmed. Sometimes I think it\u2019s just sweet-girl shyness. She hides her face behind her arm in moments of fear, sadness and happiness. It often takes a while \u2014 gentle, quiet coaxing to get her to drop her arm and show us her\u00a0brilliant eyes. Tonight at the dinner table, Rhema sat with us, her face hidden behind her arm. Brandon talked to her across the table. He said her name, told her he loved her, that her fresh-washed hair was beautiful. \u201cWe cannot look too often upon that face which we love; we desire always to have our precious things in our sight.\u201d ~Charles Spurgeon I don\u2019t know how much she understood, but she knew he was talking to her. Slowly, the best smile peeked out. Moments later she dropped her arms and allowed herself see all our love for her. When\u00a0it\u2019s the shame of sin that prompts\u00a0our face-hiding, it is\u00a0always the Father who calls our name, sings love over us, and lifts our head. When\u00a0we dare to open our eyes,\u00a0we can hardly believe it \u2014 there\u2019s only more grace, more amazing love. \u201cHe is divine to me, if he be human to all the world beside. He has done that for me which none but a God could do. He has subdued my stubborn will, melted a heart of adamant, opened gates of brass, and snapped bars of iron. He hath turned for me my mourning into laughter, and my desolation into joy; \u2026And he is full of grace. Ah! had he not been I should never have been saved. He drew me when I struggled to escape from his grace; and when at last I came all trembling like a condemned culprit to his mercy-seat he said, \u2018Thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee:  be of good cheer. \u2018\u201d ~Charles Spurgeon \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dec11-050.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/now-no-condemnation/", "title": "Now no condemnation"},

He finds her iTouch nearby and realizes that he\u2019s being recorded with an app called Voice Memos. He comes to me and we scroll through nearly 50 recordings that Rhema has taken. There are several of her making her sing-songy sounds. There is a conversation between Hope and our wonderful babysitter, Laura. There\u2019s a recording of a voice mail of her cousins singing Happy Birthday. There is a snippet of conversation between me and the ER doctor  last month . (Which boggles my mind because I remember Rhema sitting on the bed playing with her iTouch, but had no idea she was recording me.) There\u2019s water running, \u00a0TV in the background, Hope jabbering, Rhema humming, multiple conversations at the same time. Brandon and I\u00a0smile, thoroughly intrigued as we listen, it\u2019s like hearing the sounds of life and home on replay, but for the first time.

And all this time she\u2019s been recording life around her, and we did not know. I wonder how often she plays back the recordings? I wonder what she hears \u2013\u00a0these voice memos in her life?

{"date": "December 8, 2011", "body": "Hope had a girly girl birthday party with a small group of friends at a pottery studio. Shelves of bisqueware reaching to the ceiling, glass cases of handmade ceramic art for sale, a wet clay room, paints and glazes out on tables with serious artists at work, the  kiln \u2026 As soon as we walked in the door and just before Rhema took off running she and I stared at each other with the same question:  What in the world were you thinking??? The party room was located in the back \u2014 through the studio and\u00a0around the corner. B and I were juggling bags of party favors and cookies and snacks, and I lost Rhema several times along the way as she darted around tables and dove under stools. Things might have gone smoothly if\u00a0she could have started painting right away. But we needed to wait for the rest of Hope\u2019s guests.\u00a0Rhema\u2019s\u00a0anxiety was palpable\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the new environment, the sights and smells and sounds \u2013 she didn\u2019t know what to do, where to go, what would happen next. She refused to sit, and paced frantically through the studio. I felt my own heart rate triple.\u00a0How could I\u00a0be a proper host to Hope\u2019s friends and parents and chase Rhema at the same time? I discovered we\u2019d forgotten the drinks for the kids. We quickly decided Brandon would go for the drinks, and Rhema would go with him.\u00a0 Stat. \u00a0But when we put her coat on, she\u00a0realized she was leaving. She finally stilled, dropped her head and put her fists to her eyes to stop the tears. My heart wilted, and I knelt down. I saw the battle within her. She understood this was her sister\u2019s party and while every cell in her body screamed  Run! , she desperately wanted to stay, she desperately wanted to be a part. Looking up\u00a0at B I said, \u201cShe can stay. We\u2019ll make it work. Hurry back.\u201d She\u00a0continued to bolt and weave through the studio, and\u00a0I could\u00a0only follow close behind. To grab her or try and restrain her would result in a wrestling match and Aboriginal-inspired pottery raining down on our heads. Finally Rhema found a window-corner near the entrance to take refuge. She hummed and hopped and would not leave the corner.\u00a0A studio employee\u00a0came over and asked if she could help. I assued her that we seemed to be doing fine. At that particular second. But my mind was on my sweet Hope in the room at the back of the studio, her mother, father, sister nowhere in sight. She\u2019s always understood that Rhema\u2019s needs\u00a0usually demand more of my attention, but this was her day and she deserved all of me.\u00a0 On cue, my sister appeared at the door. \u201cGo,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here with Rhema.\u201d The evening progressed and\u00a0Hope and her friends painted\u00a0happily while the moms chatted and helped out. My sister came back and informed me that Brandon had arrived and taken Rhema outside. Frustration, anger and sadness swept through me. \u201cShe should be here. This is her sister\u2019s party, and she should be a part of this somehow.\u201d Later Brandon came back, carrying a fighting Rhema in his arms. She was weeping loudly. As he struggled with her, the girls looked up from their pottery. Hope\u2019s big sister was crying at her birthday party. I glanced at Hope, and she just smiled a gentle smile and went back to painting. I tried coaxing Rhema to the table, knowing that if she saw there was an\u00a0activity to do she would be ok. \u201cRhema. Paint? Wanna paint? Look!\u201d Suddenly\u00a0she stopped fighting and climbed up to the table. In a flash I grabbed some paint, a brush, and the closest piece of pottery and plopped it in front of her. It was a mug. And instantly Rhema went to dumping paint inside and stirring her brush around and around with great intensity. I looked at my twin and we burst out laughing. \u201cSmart choice, sis.\u201d The way Rhema sees it, \u00a0a\u00a0mug is for putting liquids inside. End of story. Why in the world would you  ever  dream of painting the outside? And that\u2019s when the party really started. My relief coming out in the laughter, watching both of my girls at the table, and enjoying the good company of friends. My friend Laurie eventually tried to show Rhema how to paint the outside of her mug with a brush, but in the end my sensory girl was more interested in finger- painting her hair and her clothes. Overall it was a smashing success\u2026 because nothing got smashed. (!)

{"date": "January 12, 2012", "body": "When a new, strange behavior surfaces in Rhema \u2013 or one we thought we\u2019d moved past comes back with a vengeance \u2013 we are left scratching our heads, wondering why, and only the good Lord knows. These behaviors in the past have included head-banging, screaming, flopping, pica (eating non-food items like, say, lead-painted window sills), stripping, bolting, paper shredding, hand-biting, hair-eating, obsessive compulsive patterns, fecal smearing, aggressions, meltdowns. Yes, this is our autism. We\u2019ve\u00a0made up\u00a0our own names for some behaviors. \n Blind Girl routine \u2013 when she refused to open her eyes and walked around crashing into things. (This one, quite troublesome,\u00a0lasted on and off for months.) \n Autism Bumper Bandit  phase in which she would rip magnets off cars and break them into tiny pieces. \n Mommy Be Quiet! \u2013 A (thankfully) short period in which she screamed/tantrummed if I spoke. At all. \n The Squat Walk  \u2013 a phase in which she would take a few steps, drop and squat, take a few steps, drop and squat, etc. We spent a lot of time in parking lots, and\u00a0fortunately this did not occur simultaneously with the\u00a0Autism Bumper Bandit phase! \n The latest behavior du jour? Shirt sucking/chewing/eating. I\u2019ve been\u00a0saying to her what my mom used to say to me when I inhaled my food, \u201cGirl, you make it look like I don\u2019t feed you!\u201d When I discovered she\u2019d lost a tooth the other day, the light bulb came on. Oooohhhhh. The sensation (or even pain) of the loose tooth caused her to gnaw her clothing! This theory was confirmed by her teachers who\u00a0track many of her behaviors: the chart for mouthing showed a significant increase over the past few weeks\u2026 and then a sharp drop to\u00a0zero as of two days ago. Mystery solved! And with that, (sniff), we turn the page on the Eat the Shirt Off Your Back chapter. So we lost our shirts this go round (ha!), not a big deal. But there are times when  certain behaviors  send us into crisis mode. These are the  days  when every little thing is hard \u2013 sleeping, eating, dressing, leaving the house, transitioning from one thing to the next. These are the days that break my heart, bring me to my knees. And no matter what the behavior looks like, one thing remains.  I wish I knew . How I wish I knew what goes on in her beautiful mind. I long with all my heart to have a real conversation with her. I have so many questions, so many things I want to know. What is your favorite color, really? What are you saying when you hum? What do you love and why? Why do you weep at night sometimes? What do you need from me? Sweet baby, does anything hurt? \u201cI want to trip inside your  head, \n spend the day there\u2026 \n to hear the things you  haven\u2019t said \n and see what you might see\u2026\u201d \n~U2 It\u2019s in a mother\u2019s wiring to give her child\u00a0what\u00a0she needs.

{"date": "October 9, 2011", "body": "\u00a0 It was a rainy Sunday afternoon and the girls and I had just gotten home from church. Brandon was deployed in Iraq. Admittedly, I was distracted. To this day I\u2019m not sure if Rhema followed me in from the garage and then went back out or if she never came in at all. All I know is that about 10 minutes went by before it hit me that something was very wrong with Rhema. I didn\u2019t even stop to look for her in the house \u2013 I just flew out the door yelling her name. We lived on a busy street at the time, and the road inclined before our house just enough so that a driver could not see what was on the other side. When I got to the end of the driveway I could not see her. It was raining hard and three\u00a0cars had pulled over to the side of the road. My heart pounded as I screamed her name. Then I saw her a little ways down the street in someone\u2019s yard. A man, frantic, was holding her hand. When I got to them he began shouting,  \u201cShe was in the middle of the street! I got out of my car\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what to do! I was trying to find her home!\u201d All I could do was thank him profusely and apologize. Shaking, I grabbed my silent, soaking girl and ran home. Not long after we were home, a police officer arrived at my door. Someone had called the police. This was not the first time the police had been involved when Rhema \u201c disappeared .\u201d I was questioned about the events, questioned about measures I had in place to keep my child safe. I cannot even tell you all of the emotions that went through me. Suffice to say, I felt horrible \u2013 like life was spiraling out of control (it was), and I was losing my grip on everything. Too many ways. Too many ways I could have lost her that day. . Nearly a year later my friend Jess invited me to speak with her friend Drew O\u2019Brien, State Director for Senator John Kerry\u2019s office.\u00a0I shared a bit of our story with him and detailed some of the obstacles we\u2019d encountered in trying to get an appropriate emergency locator device for Rhema. Drew promised to help. Over the next many months letters and e-mails went back and forth. Our local police department was contacted as well as the\u00a0CEO of Brickhouse Security, a distributor of electronic monitoring devices. \u201cRhema is very physically active and extremely coordinated. She is also tremendously curious and has absolutely no sense of danger. This combination of traits has caused a number of terrifying incidents in which Rhema has gone missing.  Despite taking every possible precaution, including but not limited to specialized locks and alarm sensors on all doors, locked gates, fenced yards, etc., Rhema has wandered off on numerous occasions. Her longest elopement lasted over an hour. (She had made her way into another home and was only discovered after the confused homeowner returned from work and found Rhema playing in her toy room.) \n While all incidents up to this point have ended in Rhema\u2019s safe return, [we] are obviously gravely concerned for her ongoing safety. First, Rhema does not respond to her name being called. Second, she is incapable of offering any identification should someone find her. Third, she would be helpless to defend herself and would freely go off with anyone intent on abducting her. \n Additionally, as it is for so many parents of children with autism, drowning is a very real fear. Rhema loves water, but does not understand its inherent dangers. She cannot swim well enough to stay afloat for long in a pool or at all in the tides of the ocean/open water. If she went missing near water, there would be a very limited time to find her.\u201d These efforts\u00a0resulted in\u00a0the coming together of many people to help our family. Not only did Mr. Morris of BrickHouse Security\u00a0supply Rhema with a security device, he generously offered to cover the costs of all the service fees associated with the 24-7 monitoring through the EM Finder system. (!) Thank you Senator John F. Kerry, Drew O\u2019Brien and Ashley O\u2019Neill  for\u00a0your dedication to\u00a0the autism community. Thank you for putting all of these pieces together to help us keep our precious girl safe. Thank you Mr. Todd Morris  of  BrickHouse Security \u00a0for your time, effort and generosity. Thank you Jim Nalley and Chris Buehler , founders of  EmFinders , for providing the EmSeeQ device and for working with us and the local police department so extensively. Thank you Chief Mark Ray and Captain Negrotti  for your willingness to help and for making the safety of our children a priority. Thank you Sergeant McCarthy, Officer Desmond and Officer Deroberts  for taking the time to do a thorough test run with us. Thank you  Jess  for being more than just beautiful words on a screen. Thank you for caring so deeply for our family, for connecting us with the right people, for writing letters. Thank you for crying tears of joy when this all came together. You are an amazing friend. At every turn we have been met with kindness and compassion \u2013 even the jeweler who patiently fitted her device. When I think about the hopelessness of that\u00a0rainy Sunday afternoon I am overwhelmed at how God has blessed us\u00a0through others and given us such comfort and peace of mind. Today Rhema wore her bracelet for the first time. (She doesn\u2019t like it, of course, but she\u2019ll get used it!) Our hearts rest easier today, and we are just grateful.

{"date": "January 20, 2012", "body": "If you felt something fall on your head today, it might have been heart bits. Because mine soared above the clouds this morning\u00a0and exploded. The girls and I were downstairs loading on the winter weather gear, preparing to take Rhema to school. I grabbed a new red hat for myself, stooped down, and made a funny face at Hope. We laughed extra long because being around Hope makes you laugh extra long. Rhema was turned away from us, as usual, humming, seemingly oblivious. \u201cRhema. Look at me in my silly red hat.\u201d Child does not respond to name . I remember the assessments as if it were yesterday. The people from Early Intervention in my living room, calling her name, trying to get her attention\u2026 but she was a million worlds away. The only way to get her to notice anything \u2013 even a highly desired object \u2013 was to wave it directly in front of her eyes. \u00a0 Lack of eye contact.  God gave me a child with the most incredible brown eyes, and for years I hardly ever saw them straight on. Zero joint attention . I remember standing at a window, jumping and waving and chanting her name while she and the babysitter stood right there, on the other side. The babysitter said \u201cMommy\u2019s here!\u201d and pointed at me. She never looked. She could not look at the babysitter and follow her gaze to me.\u00a0\u00a0 Poor receptive language. \u201cWord deafness\u201d possibly due to seizure activity in the  Wernicke\u2019s area  and  Broca\u2019s area  of the brain.  She seemed to have absolutely no understanding of spoken language. Hours upon hours, days and days and years of work and therapy and tears and prayers. And we are here. On this day she turns around. She looks at me. She lets me see the magnificent smile spread across her face. She walks over to me and ever so lightly touches my head. (Pause with me now. This heart was once broken. Amazingly God mends it everyday, more and more.\u00a0Sometimes He fills it with joy and gratitude to bursting.) Then she turns away and resumes her humming like it\u2019s nothing. But it\u2019s not nothing. On this autism journey, I\u2019ve always focused on the present, tried not to think too much of the future \u2013 good or bad.

{"date": "December 9, 2011", "body": "\u201cHelp one another, is part of the religion of sisterhood.\u201d \n~Louisa May Alcott . I often write about how\u00a0Hope is  good sister  to Rhema. I\u2019ve shared  stories  about the things she has already sacrificed in her short life because of her  sister\u2019s autism . Rarely do I highlight the ways Rhema is a blessing to Hope. Sisterhood for my girls is very different from my own experiences with sisters. My sisters and I are very close, and there was a time I grieved that my daughters would not have that kind of relationship. They exist in a silent camaraderie, their lives one long parallel play session. Their chairs are always side by side \u2013 at the dinner table, in the car. They take baths together. They give hugs (well, Hope hugs and Rhema tolerates). There is an honest togetherness about them. But Rhema has never spontaneously said Hope\u2019s name (she has trouble with the sounds). They\u2019ve never played on the playground  with  each other or had a sleepover or attended a show together or shared in pretend play. They\u2019ve never shared a real conversation with words. Yet Hope has no doubt that Rhema loves her. It\u2019s as certain as the morning. Since their love is not always expressed in typical ways, I\u2019ve wondered how Hope is so sure. It came to me at McDonald\u2019s. Hope has a long list of food allergies, including wheat, but over the years she\u2019s developed a tolerance to McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets. If the breading from the nuggets is removed she can eat them without having a reaction. I used to spend too much time carefully de-breading Hope\u2019s nuggets, until one day Rhema quietly took over the job. (She\u2019d been paying attention all along). For the past couple years, without fail, Rhema meticulously peels and nibbles off every little piece of skin from those nuggets. (Eight nuggets in total because there are 4 nuggets in a Happy Meal and they both get Happy Meals. Sometimes they get Mighty Kids Meals with 6 nuggets apiece, so that\u2019s  twelve  nuggets total!) And then she tosses the chicken (can we call it that?) onto Hope\u2019s plate. She never eats the whole nugget \u2013 she saves the chicken for Hope. She even used to go so far as to dunk the nuggets into Hope\u2019s ketchup for her. Rhema detests ketchup; she knows Hope loves it. But Hope actually prefers to dunk\u00a0her half-chewed, skinless nuggets into the ketchup herself. So Rhema has learned to back off and just throw the nuggets onto her plate. \u00a0 We\u2019ve all agreed that Rhema is the fastest and best chicken-nugget-breading-chewer-offer in the world. Makes me so proud. Rhema teaches Hope in ways that Hope is not even fully aware of yet. She never shows jealousy, she\u2019s always willing to share, she\u2019s observant and patient, steady as a rock. She makes the people in her life better for knowing her. She is a good sister, a faithful companion, a gift to Hope. I wish everyone in this life a sister-friend who will eat the skin off your nuggets if you need her to.

{"date": "December 14, 2011", "body": "While some people plan their dream homes, I dream about my OT room. A huge room filled with sensory toys, bean bags, tactile mats, slides, swings, monkey bars,\u00a0a hammock and a trampoline and a rock wall and a ball pit. For my girl. Yeah. But the first thing I\u2019d put in that room would be a steamroller. http://www.autism-products.com/Autism_Steam_Roller_p/015695.htm Or a \u201csqueeze machine\u201d, or a  hug machine  like  Temple Grandin\u2019s . Some days it\u2019s not the lack of language or sleepless nights or missed opportunities that hurt my heart. It\u2019s watching her helplessly\u2026 as she runs through the house in a frantic, endless loop. Under the table, over the couch, through the chairs \u2013 \u00a0she searches\u00a0out the tiniest spaces through which to squeeze herself. It\u2019s then that I get a glimpse of the turmoil inside. I see how desperate she is for input to calm her body, to handle the system overload, to relax her heightened senses. She seeks pressure to cope with the pressure of living in this world. In our college days my twin and I would say  the pressure  whenever faced with a stressful or nerve-wracking circumstance. Now, after a long day at work all I want is to see my babies, but I come home and find her here lost to me, lost to a pattern, her mind and body lost in space. \u00a0I try to hug her and\u00a0she reaches out briefly,\u00a0but then\u00a0pushes me away in frustration. I am not nearly enough. But there are the moments when the heaviness of it all is just too much. \u201cWe are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.\u201d 2 Cor. 4:8-9 This child shows me that pressure has a  good work . That deep touch can be painful but it helps you feel again; deep pressure humbles,  heals . I believe God has the greatest touch, it covers all. If so then, I want to be squished, flattened,  held , steamrolled by Him. I once read that the Hebrew word for glory means \u201cweight\u201d. God is so big, so full of glory, beauty, power, honor \u2013 He is  heavy  with it. It\u2019s ok if you think I\u2019m crazy. I want my OT dream room. But more than that, I want the glory of God\u2019s goodness, grace and character to press on my daughters, wrap them in on every side. I pray for peace in Rhema\u2019s body.

{"date": "December 16, 2011", "body": "One of the perfect themes of Christmas is  giving. \u00a0The Son\u00a0of God came down to  give  life, peace, and joy to all who accept His gift. All around, this season, we have opportunities to give and share with others. I\u00a0will never forget how my friend  Jess  and her family and so many others gave and gave and gave to us\u2026\u00a0 The following was originally published in December 2009.  * Holidays have been kind of bittersweet for me the past few years. Rhema still does not seem to\u00a0\u201cget\u201d Christmas or birthdays. And, honestly,\u00a0there was little motivation on our part to\u00a0make a big fuss when Rhema seemed\u00a0not to\u00a0care about such things. Last year we did not even put up a tree, and instead relied on the grandparents to do Christmas (as we have done for the past few years). This year has been different. With Brandon deployed to Iraq this Christmas, our annual trek to Michigan was not really an option (how we miss them). This year it has really been my desire to make\u00a0the holiday\u00a0special and meaningful to Rhema and Hope. But I had no idea where to start \u2013 I\u2019m not naturally good at this stuff. Enter Jess and her family. Luau came over and put up our tree, and Jess gave me lots of ideas and sent Rhema-safe decorations (pom-pom garland and tinsel). And then, this weekend, they brought Christmas to us. Luau dressed up as Santa, Katie was an elf, Brooke was a reindeer (and Jess came as Jess.)     Oh, if you could have seen the look on Hope\u2019s face when Santa came through the door, bearing gifts galore! \n \nShe was literally frozen for a moment \u2014 wonder, surprise, excitement, dreams comes true. It was the kind of moment that a mother treasures forever. (Most of these moments have come for me in seeing others love my girls, and  nothing  touches my heart more). During the visit, Hope asked to see Santa\u2019s Nice List. (Up until this point she had been very concerned that she might be on Santa\u2019s naughty list\u2026 due to transgressions committed earlier in the week). Santa had come with just about every prop in the book, but he didn\u2019t bring his list. Jess quickly came up with the excuse:  \u201cOh, Santa left his list at the North Pole.\u201d While Brooke dazzled me with her drawings of Boots, Benny, Tico and Isa and all the cast members of Godspell, Katie worked on her own little project. Some time later Katie produced a piece of paper with lots of names written on it; across the top it said: Nice List. And Hope, of course, was the very first name on the list. And Santa, of course, showed Hope that she was indeed on the Nice List. Katie cares about the details. The entire time her focus was on making this a special time for Rhema and Hope. She is 8 \u00be years old, and there\u2019s no doubt this girl is already having a profound impact on this world. Katie and Brooke both were so amazing and sweet. I seriously think Jess and Luau should write books and teach seminars on parenting. These two little girls are the best of the best. When it was time to go, I stood Rhema to her feet and told her to give a high  five to Santa. She had not acknowledged Santa or shown any interest in him. But when I stood her up, instead of giving him a high five, she clambered up his legs, climbed over his big belly and right into his arms. It was PRICELESS\u2026 and perfect. And she didn\u2019t want to let go \u2013 I had to pry her out of his arms! Rhema doesn\u2019t give her hugs to many people. But I\u2019m convinced that she  recognizes love . And it made me wonder (again) if she actually understands more than I give her credit for\u2026 like maybe she does get the idea of Santa. Truly it seemed that in that room with Jess and her family, just about anything was possible. Jess came with the gifts and well-wishes of many dear bloggy mamas. For the past few months I have been receiving \u2018encouragement packages\u2019 from friends \u2013 some of whom I have never met. Seriously, the timing is always impeccable \u2013 a package arrives just when I\u2019m having a particularly rough day. (Thank you,  Michelle , for the way you inspire kindness). Try as I might I can\u2019t be eloquent about this. The love and support we have received has been like nothing I have ever seen or could have imagined. It\u2019s like God really did open the windows of heaven and is heaping blessings upon my family. The only thing I can liken it to is the gift of grace through Christ \u2013 so lavishly given, so very undeserved. I can only say thank you, and hope you know that that does not come close to conveying our gratitude. Thank you for the thoughtful gifts. Thank you for your generosity. Thank you for the prayers. Thank you for the cards and letters to Brandon. Thank you for being here, and thank you for sharing in our lives. Still thankful.

I\u2019m forever grateful to my parents for the seeds of faith they planted and watered in me. Things got interesting\u00a0one Sunday during the altar call. I was surprised to see my sister crying and walking to the front of church to receive Jesus. Not wanting to be outdone and risk appearing more sinful than my twin, I followed her, produced some tears and prayed to accept Jesus Christ into my heart. I was eight years old. When the pastor baptized me I flailed, and he ended up dunking me twice. He concluded I\u2019d be a good Baptist. My sister concluded I needed all the extra dunking I could get. There were many, many times after that day I would pray the prayer repeatedly, just in case. \u201cJesus, I believe in You! I believe You died on the cross and rose again. Please forgive my sins, and come into my heart. I accept You as my Lord and Savior. Thank you for saving me. Amen.\u201d Growing up as a preacher\u2019s daughter, my attendance was mandatory at Sunday School and VBS and youth group meetings. But I went gladly. Over the years I\u2019d seen people lost, broken, grieving, angry, empty\u00a0\u2013 and I saw them  changed  (not necessarily their circumstances, but their lives). I could not explain it. But I had no doubt in the power of God to transform, to give Life and hope. In college, I came to love the words in my Bible. Those words became my lifeline when I lived in  Ethiopia . Marriage and motherhood have stretched, challenged, wrecked and re-built my faith more than anything ever could. \u2018Till sin be bitter, Christ is not sweet.  I\u2019ve long understood the doctrine of grace, and I\u2019ve been encouraged by it as I\u2019ve seen it\u00a0demonstrated in the lives of others.\u00a0But in recent years I\u00a0experienced the way of grace in my own life like never before.\u00a0I fell. I fell into a horrible pit, not only hurting myself but others around me. When I saw myself apart from God\u2019s grace,\u00a0I found the ugliest heart and guilt so terrible, I could have died. But then the very nature of Christ reached through friends, through my husband, to love me. Amazing grace, I will never forget. Some friends/readers have admired my faith, so here\u2019s my story. I am utterly unfaithful, and God has been ever faithful to me. I can tell you I\u2019m like the  father  whose son had no speech, \u201cLord, I believe. Help my unbelief!\u201d\u00a0I can tell you I\u2019m learning that \u201cw ithout faith , it is impossible to please God\u201d, and all I want is to please Him. I can\u00a0tell you\u00a0that I love much because I have been forgiven much. I can\u00a0tell you\u00a0that I still pray with eight year-old faith:\u00a0 Jesus, I believe in You! \u00a0 Thank you for saving me.  Again and again. \u00a0Amen. .

{"date": "February 10, 2012", "body": "The subway across town is so slow, it makes me late for our meeting with the neurologist. The doctor is ready, but you\u00a0will not\u00a0start without me. It touches me that you appreciate my opinions, respect my knowledge on all things Rhema and Landau Kleffner syndrome and anti-epileptic meds. We go through that meeting confident in our discussions with the doctor. We\u2019ve got a plan. We\u2019re good together, a team. For each other, and\u00a0this is how it should be. We can do this. Suddenly, in the car,\u00a0a fight over where to stop for gas. A fight because we\u2019re ten minutes behind schedule. Seriously? We\u2019ve stared down the autism-epilepsy behemoth; endured\u00a0multiple deployments and separation of the heart, body and soul, and by God\u2019s grace,  survived . Yet somehow the small thing turning into the big thing would destroy us piece by piece. And it\u2019s appalling how fast, how completely it can all fall apart. Bitter, hurtful words flying out of my mouth like dagger and flame to the soul. My gosh, my love, what are we doing, undoing us? Lord, have mercy. You\u2019re the first to stand from the ashes. You reach out a hand to help me up. Still I\u00a0want to wield my rubber sword, and you bring me flowers. The Lord has mercy. \u00a0\u201c It is not your love that sustains the marriage, \nbut from now on, the marriage that sustains your love.\u201d \n~Dietrich Bonhoeffer Remember the day we met? In a workshop called \u201cGiving Your Life Away.\u201d I had visions of a life of service, going back to Ethiopia, caring for impoverished children. I could not have known that marriage would be the only way to learn how to give my life away. A wise man once said that a good marriage involves a thousand little deaths to self\u2026 for the other. By God\u2019s grace, that same\u00a0marriage involves at least as many resurrections. It\u2019s the glory of the Gospel. Every day, in so many ways, you lay your life down for me. Just think, B. On a day over fifteen years ago, in a galaxy, on a planet, in a time zone, in a country, in a state, in a city, on a Saturday, at a conference, in a workshop, God sat me in a chair next to the most generous blue eyes. You. And all because of that, the world has Thing 1 and Thing 2 (Rhema and Hope). It\u2019s frightening to think I could have missed  you , missed sharing this hard, good journey with you. Thank God, thank God, thank God for you. You, \u201cmy east, my west, my Sunday rest.\u201d Happy Anniversary weekend, doodlesnort.

I help Hope into her satin-y red dress, stand her in front of the mirror and fuss with her soft curls, while trying to keep my heart in my chest. Her father calls \u201cTime to go!\u201d and I rush her downstairs and into her best shoes and coat. I kiss her cheek and she\u2019s\u00a0dashes\u00a0for the door. She\u2019s been practicing \u201cAway in a Manger\u201d for weeks, and tonight is the big night. The school Christmas concert. And I am missing it. My thoughtful friend \u2013 her daughter also in the concert \u2013 had called days before wondering about our plans and how she could help. B\u2019s going to go, and I\u2019ll stay home with Rhema, I tell her. I don\u2019t want him to miss it. A long night. In a church. Lots of children and adults. All kinds of sights and sounds. The expectation to sit quietly through it all. A bit too much to ask of our Rhema-girl right now. At least  one  of us could enjoy it, that was my reasoning. I should have planned ahead and asked for help, got babysitting. But I just didn\u2019t expect to feel the overwhelming longing, sadness and yes, resentment toward  the autism , as they\u00a0hurry out and the basement door slams shut. I walk up the stairs slowly, aware of the fact that my big girl had been out of my sight too long, but I take my time, my own little rebellion. I come upon a small flood. The child in a tub full of water silently dumping pails of it onto the floor, as if she\u2019s going under. And I just watch her for a while wondering how many more nights\u2026 how many more years like this autism will isolate her and dump on me and make parents choose between their children. She steps out of the tub at one end, runs to the other end and jumps back in the tub. Then out, then in, then out, then in, sloshing water as she goes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any other mother out there staying home tonight\u00a0 because her child has a developmental disability? Is it just me and my strange girl and our chaos? Later, after the bath rugs are thrown in the wash and towels are on the floor, I coax her to sit in my lap for a few moments. She puts her face close to mine and breathes heavy. That\u2019s her best, sweetest version of a kiss; her love refreshing me. \u201cI belong to you,\u201d I say. (I\u2019m never sure if she\u2019s listening or understanding or even interested, but sometimes\u00a0she\u2019s the best\u00a0person to talk to.) \u201cI heard a\u00a0 song  today that made me think of you. It\u2019s based on a  Bible verse  that says nothing can separate us from God\u2019s great love for us. Not anything in this world! Not the present or the future, not angels or demons, not height nor depth, not the worst sins, not hardship, not pain, not sorrow, not even death can do it. That means  so  much to me, Rhema, when I think about my life and things I\u2019ve done. That He loves me still, anyway, even though. I can\u2019t even make sense of that kind of faithful, unending love. But God gave me a taste of it when He gave me to you and Hope. Because nothing can separate you from my love. Not silence or distance. Not stimming, flopping, bolting. Not poop art. Not floods or any form of destruction. Not aggressions and regressions. Not lost opportunities. Not stares in public. Not a million school consults and IEP meetings and therapy appointments. Not broken dreams, not heartache. Not weakness or\u00a0failure. Not the present or the future. Not highs or lows. Not trouble now or ever. Nothing can take you from my great love.

{"date": "January 31, 2012", "body": "\u201cI love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you.\u201d \n~Ben Folds \u00a0 A behavioral consultant named S has been visiting us at home with the goal of implementing a Busy Book for Rhema. (The Busy Book is made of picture cues that Rhema can use to\u00a0structure her play time. It\u2019s similar to the  Picture Activity Schedule  she uses at school. ) Because the goal of the Busy Book is independent play, S instructs me to remain silent and \u201chands-off\u201d throughout the activity. S begins by \u201cbaselining\u201d Rhema using the Busy Book. \u201cRhema! Do Busy Book!\u201d Rhema crawls under the table. Quietly,\u00a0we help her back into her chair. \u201cRhema! Do Busy Book!\u201d She\u00a0jumps and sprints a couple laps through the house. \u00a0 Back\u00a0in her chair,\u00a0she collapses into a fit of giggles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undeterred, S guides Rhema\u2019s hand to the Busy Book and helps her pull off a puzzle icon velcroed to the page. Next she guides Rhema\u2019s hand to the new puzzle I\u2019ve placed on the table. Rhema begins assembling the puzzle; it\u2019s a difficult one with more pieces than she\u2019s used to. It is quiet, too quiet. Rhema looks up at me curiously. We periodically do puzzles together, and I always cheer her on as she works. But since I am not supposed to speak, all I can offer is a smile. She smiles back. Social referencing . A skill that comes to the typical child at 10 months old. We\u2019ve been working on it for years; now she\u2019s got it, and it\u2019s lovely. And so it goes. Long minute after long minute. She stops briefly, looks over at me, and smiles. I smile back until my cheeks hurt, trying to put all the love in the world on my face, just for her. And then we have a whole conversation with our eyes, the two of us. This is kind of weird, Mom. I know. But thanks for playing along. No one\u2019s talking and you guys are just staring at me while I do this puzzle. I know. But have I told you how very smart you are? How I love you. She giggles. The edges of the puzzle are done, and she looks at me, smiling again. Hi Mommy. Hi baby. I love that you look at me. And let me see you. Thank you. She begins to hum\u2026 softly, almost out of respect for our guest. She stays on task the whole time. She resists the urge to flap or bend the pieces. It\u2019s a tough puzzle, but she finishes it all on her own. We always cheer big when Rhema finishes a puzzle. Before I can let out a Whoop, S is waving at me from across the table to hold the applause. Rhema just smiles at me again. I did it. Yes. And I am so proud of you, so proud of who you are. \u00a0 Really I could not be more proud. And I have longed for the easy connection and dialogue I\u2019ve witnessed between other mothers and their children. Now I think \u2013 I know \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s true that some of the best conversations happen in silence. I feel special to share all these words unspoken with my daughter. S is motioning for her to clean up now, and put it away. They struggle with their hands as Rhema tries to close the book repeatedly\u00a0while S tries to pull off the All Done icon. Finally the exercise is complete and S says, \u201cHooray Rhema! Good job!\u201d I touch her hand,\u00a0tell her with my eyes, with my heart, Know this, sweet child of mine. Every day and always, at the top of my lungs, I\u2019m cheering for you.  Before sprinting off, she looks at me one long last time. She already knows.

{"date": "December 27, 2011", "body": "The back story Writing Dreams This Dream Does Not Tarry Writing \u2013 Froms Dreams to Reality . On the last day of school before the holiday break I carried in small gifts for the many teachers who give to Rhema (and to our family) day after day, year after year. Every year I bring in these gifts knowing they cannot begin to convey the depth of our love and gratitude for the people who teach and care for our girl so well. So I was caught off guard when Rhema\u2019s teacher,  Heather , held out of beautifully wrapped gift to  me . She said that Rhema had a gift for us on Christmas, and I knew instantly it was not one that could be found in stores or ever put a price on. The card was addressed to \u201cBrandon, Jeneil and Hope\u201d, and that alone kind of got to me. It said something to me about  family  somehow \u2013 that each one of us is important to Rhema and she is important to each of us. Merry Christmas! Rhema has been working very hard with all her teachers to create this project for you. She wanted you to be surprised so these programs have not been on her data sheet. We are all very proud of her and working with her is a wonderful gift every day! Love, Rhema\u2019s teachers . I wish I had the words to convey how meaningful and precious this gift is. At the same time, I know many of you  know  and rejoice with us. I\u2019ll ramble on, but\u00a0in so many ways the picture\u00a0speaks for itself.\u00a0 So here it is. This is a gift not just from Rhema, but also her many wonderful teachers. They quietly worked with her on every tedious stroke\u2026\u00a0all with the intention of blessing our socks off on Christmas. Yeah, that kind of got to me. Rhema has been learning to write her name for the past two years. When she holds a crayon or pen, her first instinct is to\u00a0scribble vigorously \u2013 it takes much focus and motivation for her to\u00a0change course. She needs a lot of support and physical prompting to write her name, and even then it\u2019s hit or miss. But here, it\u2019s perfect. I can\u2019t stop looking at it. We had no idea she could write or trace any other letters besides those in her name. But she wrote Dad, Hope, Mom and traced I Love You. !!!!! I\u2019d heard she\u2019d been learning to\u00a0draw stick figures, but never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined this.  Hope\u2019s stick figure has a crown.  That kind of got to me, too. (And Hope was  thrilled  when she\u00a0saw!) \u00a0 We\u2019ll hang it in a prominent place, and we\u2019ll treasure it always. But for now I\u2019m like a child by the Christmas tree, clutching a\u00a0cherished\u00a0present to my chest. Every now and then I release it, lean back long enough to stare and be filled with\u00a0wonder again. In its reflection I see moments of days I\u2019ll never forget. Sitting my pregnant self down in a small office while Rhema stimmed on a slinky, and a developmental psychologist gently confirmed everything I already knew.  Autism.  I would never see the woman again, but I remember her name, her eyes, her hair, her clothes, the pearls on her neck.\u00a0I remember wondering why, why, why. Why  my  child? I see us in the hospital room\u00a0looking at images of her brain lit up with epileptic activity, and the meds not working. I remember\u00a0wondering  How? H ow can this be? Then, I\u2019m in an IEP meeting and they\u2019re telling us about a stamp goal.  \u2018She\u2019ll probably never learn to write, so\u00a0she\u2019ll need to learn to use a stamp with her name on it.\u2019 And I had no idea of the divine conspiracy. That God would use what I thought to be such a tragedy\u00a0to be my greatest source of blessing. To lead us to a community of friends and parents and teachers that we are so much the better for knowing. To teach us and help us see sweet, hard, beautiful things we otherwise might have missed. (Blubbering now, any eloquence out the window). I\u2019m just so grateful to Heather and all of Rhema\u2019s teachers. I\u2019m just so amazed by God and the way He heaps blessings on us. I\u2019m just so proud of my little girl. And I\u2019m sure of it now every time I\u00a0see her, her gifts, there\u2019s even more than this to come.

I am always blessed and amazed by\u00a0their commitment to her day after day, the creative ways they teach her,\u00a0the extra care they take with her. Rhema\u2019s flavor of autism mixed with a seizure disorder has caused her to lose skills in the past.\u00a0Her teachers must not only work\u00a0to teach her new skills, they are constantly running programs to reinforce appropriate behaviors and\u00a0help her maintain\u00a0what she\u2019s already learned. Eye contact, joint attention, nonverbal imitation, receptive picture identification, greetings, adaptive P. E., tracing, utensil use, picture activity schedules, etc, etc, etc. It\u2019s a LOT of work. And there are setbacks, to be sure. Yet their passion for her, their belief in her never wavers. This\u00a0month\u2019s school newsletter contains a small picture of Rhema with her teacher Corrie at the swimming pool. Perhaps no one would catch this but a mother, but instantly I noticed Corrie\u2019s tender hand on Rhema\u2019s back as she guided her down the stairs and into the pool. Such a simple thing, but enough to make me want to weep with gratitude. Years ago, I wrote of a crushing moment in the hospital (- to read it, click  here ) when an intern examined Rhema and asked her simple questions repeatedly. She was incapable of responding; she could not look at him or understand him. But now? My girl has learned to answer a question.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  You have to listen closely or you might miss it.

We cannot ever hear her say it enough. As if that\u2019s not enough. She has learned to answer  another  question. (!!!!) If you ask her, Where do you live?, Rhema takes on the three syllable not-easy-to-say\u00a0name of her town as best she can. Her teachers did this. I can only imagine the many months of repetition, repetition, repetition and reinforcers it took to get us to this point. And words cannot convey the joy, the hope here\u2026 I try to say thank you. I know they know they do meaningful work. But I wonder if they really  know . Much like a surgeon performs a lifesaving procedure, or a firefighter carries out a rescue, this school and these teachers have had a tremendous hand in  saving  our little girl. They do it every day. They take all the \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d and disappointments and heartbreaking moments and redeem them somehow. They hand me back my dreams for her and say,  Here, just look what she can do now. Rhema is happy, known, secure and loved\u00a0by her teachers, and it has made all the difference in her learning.

{"date": "February 20, 2012", "body": "Did you hear about the groundbreaking, earth-shattering scientific discovery? Last week physicists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Warwick provided insight into Rhema\u2019s trademark, gravity-defying,\u00a0lint-collecting, twig-sporting, spaghetti sauce wearing, curly-Q hairstyle. Yes, the  Ponytail Shape Equation  has been unveiled. This equation uses a ratio known as the  Rapunzel Number , which calculates the effects of gravity on hair relative to its length. Also considered in the formula are the \u201cstiffness of individual hairs\u201d and the average waviness and springiness of human hair. Springiness. Based on this data,\u00a0experts can predict whether a ponytail will be pointed or fan-like. (!!!) The research also examined how the hair swells \u00a0based on collisions between the component hairs. \u201c As gravity pulls a bundle of hair downward, collisions between the individual hairs cause the tail to swell outward\u2026\u00a0and the curlier the hair, the more internal collisions and thus the greater the \u201cswelling pressure. \u201c Sniff. A diagnosis. Swelling pressure. If your Rapunzel number is low, then your ponytail will fan out, \u2018like a paintbrush.\u2019 If it\u2019s larger, you\u2019ll likely see\u00a0\u2018a characteristic arc that straightens out near the bottom.\u2019 Here, we have a case of a  negative  Rapunzel number: Brushing these amazing tangled locks is no small task, only accomplished with the aid of two popsicles, one in each hand. A mere five minutes later she looks like she stepped into a wind tunnel. The \u201cfourth order non-linear differential equation,\u201d as study co-author Robin Ball, a physicist at the University of Warwick, described the ponytail formula, \u201cis a three-way balance of bending, gravity and curliness.\u201d Now it all makes sense.

{"date": "February 29, 2012", "body": "\u201cEven now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.\u201d \n~ Job 16:19 . We head into Rhema\u2019s IEP meeting in\u00a0a couple\u00a0hours. I am not anxious. Perhaps it\u2019s because we know our girl is right where she needs to be. And I\u2019m confident that her school placement will remain as is for another year. Perhaps it\u2019s because we trust her team of teachers and therapists completely. Still, there\u2019s such emotion attached to the IEP meeting \u2013 something I cannot really articulate. The lump in the throat. The pit in the stomach. The shock that I\u2019m still shocked that we\u2019re even there. And that the child we\u2019re talking about so intently is  my little girl , my Rhema. I can never walk into one IEP meeting, without thinking of all the meetings in the past\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget the day we met with the local school district to discuss Rhema\u2019s academic setting. \u201cI thought I was totally prepared for this,\u201d I said on the phone to my mother before the meeting. \u201cBut now I think we should have hired an advocate. Someone who understands it all better than I do and will speak for us when we can\u2019t, and\u00a0stand in our place. We need someone in the know to represent Rhema\u2019s best interests.\u201d My mother, a retired special education teacher who\u2019d participated in a bajillion IEP meetings during her career, said simply, \u201cYou do have an Advocate.\u201d When we arrived at the meeting, the Out of District Coordinator had just finished observing Rhema in her substantially separate pre-school classroom. She shared testing results with us, noting that they\u2019d been largely unsuccessful in conducting  any  testing with Rhema. I began making my case for why we believed our 3-year old little girl needed to outplaced \u2013 \u00a0in a school specifically for children with special needs. We\u2019d visited a number of schools, and honestly I\u2019d been scared to death. Most of the students were in their teens and their autism \u2013 their need for support \u2013 had startled me. At the time, the last thing in the world I wanted to do was send my baby off to a private autism school. But I knew it\u2019s what she needed, I knew she was drowning in her current school setting. So I stuffed down my fears, put on my Mama Bear face and detailed our concerns about the current program and what we needed to do for Rhema. But the Special Ed Administrator was distracted. I realized she was looking past me. I stopped mid-sentence and turned around to see my husband beside me, dressed in his ACU\u2019s (Army Combat Uniform), quietly crying. I don\u2019t know what happened after that. I was struck by Brandon\u2019s heartache;  fathers grieve, too.  The tone in the room changed, like someone had injected tenderness and cooperation into the air, and I knew then for sure that God would take care of us. By day\u2019s end, the school administration was completely on board with the plan to move Rhema to our school of choice. And again, a couple years later, they supported her move to the wonderful autism school she now attends. So as we head into today\u2019s IEP, I know we\u2019ll talk about Rhema, her beautiful personality, and our vision for her. I know we\u2019ll celebrate her accomplishments over the past year \u2013 she has come so far! I know we\u2019ll examine the areas in which she struggles and strategies to help her overcome those challenges. I know we\u2019ll discuss in depth, the plans and goals for the next year. I will be excited about the new programs and new skills she\u2019ll learn\u2026 I have every confidence she will succeed in her own Rhema way. I will try not to be sad that she still can\u2019t do x, y, and z, and that there has to be such an elaborate plan to help her learn. And call me crazy but I will look over at the empty chair at the table, and know that even as our hearts hurt a little, we are not alone. The Advocate will be there.

{"date": "February 14, 2012", "body": "\u201cWill Rhema still have autism when she grows up?\u201d We\u2019d been rolling along smoothly, happily, taking the girls out for a Valentine\u2019s Day Eve dinner. Our dining out in itself a reason for celebration, such a statement to how far we\u2019ve come. Hope\u2019s question shot out like a canon ball, startling us all, sucking the air out of the car. We\u2019ve talked openly about autism,\u00a0and we\u2019ve let Hope process things as she is able. But autism simply does not dominate our conversations at home, so I was surprised at the question, and\u00a0the feeling of tears in my gut. I wanted to say, it\u2019s a good, honest question. Early on, I\u2019d convinced myself she would in fact \u201coutgrow\u201d it by age 3 or 4, and I was bewildered and then devastated when I met a mother of an adult daughter with autism. I wanted to say that autism is a part of everything we love about Rhema, a part of who she is, a part of what makes her mind so complex and beautiful. I wanted to say that the autism that\u00a0causes her to struggle, traps her, and paralyzes her communication\u2026 I would do almost anything to take it away, if I could.\u00a0 But instead I just said, \u201cHope, God may choose to heal Rhema in heaven.\u201d I could hear the confusion and alarm in her voice as she asked: \u201cBut how will she take care of her children???\u201d It felt like a punch to the stomach, eyes smarting from a pain I thought I\u2019d buried. Neither Brandon nor I could speak. \u201cMommy. Daddy.  How will she take care of her children? \u201d The words hung\u00a0in the air. We didn\u2019t answer. We couldn\u2019t. . After the girls had gone to bed, I went to work on finishing Rhema\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day cards. I had to smile, remembering how the girls had\u00a0sat at the table together. It was a first for Rhema \u2013 decorating the cards with us. I\u2019d written her name and tried to help her trace the letters. We were not very successful, but she\u2019d squealed and colored and loved being involved in the activity. Instantly, I knew I owed Hope an answer and I found her still awake in bed. \u201cYou wanted to know how she will take care of her children.\u201d I said softly. \u201cYeah.\u201d (In her 5-year old mind it\u2019s pretty much a foregone conclusion that she will grow up to be a Mommy and a princess. And if the princess gig doesn\u2019t work out, a mermaid. She assumes the same for her sister.) \u201cI don\u2019t know, baby.\u201d Her eyes and mouth turned sad. \u201cHow will she get married?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, baby.\u201d \u201cHow will she cook?\u201d \u201cShe will make macaroni and cheese, of course.\u201d We laughed. \u201cDid you know that things that seem totally impossible to us are totally possible with God?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know that!\u201d I held up one of Rhema\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day cards\u00a0so that\u00a0Hope could see it by the glow of her night light. \u201cHope.  For with God  nothing  shall be impossible.\u201d She giggled at the card, Rhema\u2019s name in swirly letters, nearly every inch of it colored turquoise. The\u00a0ache in me eased. I rested. Maybe\u00a0I\u2019m a fool. I choose to err on the side of  overbelieving  in my girl, as  Schuyler\u2019s dad  would say. Maybe, some days it takes a lot more fighting and a lot more faith to believe that everything\u2019s going to be alright, that she will be ok. I believe in her. I believe in  Him . So we\u2019ll work hard, we\u2019ll prepare for the unknown as best as we can, and we\u2019ll always, always keep our eyes open wide for miracles.

To get out. Autism once held us back. The inability to wait, the tendency to bolt, the overstimulation, the tantrums and unpredictable behavior. All of these factors have, in the past,\u00a0caused us to opt out, stay home, close the door to what we could be. My friend  Carrie  often encouraged me that getting out and helping Rhema learn to navigate the world through experience was just as important as the extra speech therapy sessions. Sure there will be some meltdowns, she\u2019d day. Some improvising, some\u00a0fast getaways and outings cut short, some heart wrenching and frustrating moments\u2026 that\u2019s ok. There will be some funny and thrilling moments, too, and memories made that make it all worth it. Honestly, there was a time when we dreaded the weekends \u2013 there was no set schedule or direction and autism shocked us every Saturday and Sunday, and everything inside our walls fell apart. Emily Colson in  Dancing with Max  faced similar circumstances and felt like\u00a0a hostage\u00a0in her own home because of her son\u2019s challenges. But one day she decided to believe that it was her last day alive. She asked herself how she would spend her last day. She imagined all of the things she longed to do and really experience with her boy \u2013 going to the beach, walking in the city, running in the water. She wouldn\u2019t care what anyone thought if things didn\u2019t go well. So she got up out of her pity party and she and her son  lived  life. Perhaps for us it was\u00a0Brandon\u2019s absence\u00a0over the\u00a0past two years.\u00a0Maybe it\u00a0taught us something about cherishing family and \u201credeeming the time.\u201d Now we actually look forward to venturing out, doing things together, Rhema right there with us. So this year we had our first successful outing to a  restaurant . We took a 2-day trip to  Storyland . We took a train ride with grandparents and cousins. We\u00a0went to the New England\u00a0Aquarium. It may sound simple, but these are huge, HUGE accomplishments. And they have not been without incident, mind you! But these are things that a short time ago I could not have imagined doing, never even considered a possibility. This weekend we decided to try another first: pumpkin picking. It wasn\u2019t until we had parked the car and I saw the crowds and the wide open spaces that I looked at B, panicked. \u201cUm. How are we going to do this???\u201d And the Hooah-Hooah-airborne-battle-tested-West Point trained-Chinook-pilot-soldier-boy just shrugged at me like I have no earthly\u00a0i-dear. And I thought, God you\u2019re good because you make every day of my life an adventure with these people you gave me and called\u00a0family. But the pumpkin patch we did.  And  a hayride.  And  apple cider and donuts.  And  non-dairy cotton-candy slush. Oh, it tasted sweet, y\u2019all\u2026 With arms raised high, we did it! In our own crazy, hard, beautiful, offbeat, wonder-filled way. \u00a0.

{"date": "February 23, 2012", "body": "A couple months ago we got the  Proloquo2Go  app for Rhema. Proloquo2Go is an alternative and augmentative communication application, and its name comes from Latin, meaning \u201cspeak out loud.\u201d (I kind of love that). The app has a default vocabulary of nearly 8000 words and picture symbols. For us, it feels a bit HUGE. One of my concerns is that Rhema has long used her iPod Touch as a \u2018toy\u2019, and now we want\u00a0her\u00a0to view it as a functional\u00a0communication device.\u00a0We\u2019ve been slowly\u00a0trying to help her understand it all, and navigate the new app. Her\u00a0teachers are\u00a0prompting her to form just one sentence using a picture symbol: \u201cI want .\u201d At home, we\u2019ve just let her play around with the app. She taps the screen repeatedly, so fast you can almost see the smoke rising. From the start, Hope has been convinced that Rhema is talking to us with the device, and we must urgently respond. The computer-generated voice intones, \u00a0\u201cLime. Lime. Lime. Lime.\u201d \u00a0\u201cMommy! Rhema wants a lime!!!\u201d \u201cPomegranate. Pomegranate. Pomegranate. Pomegranate.\u201d \u201cMom! Do we have any\u2026 pom-poms???\u201d \u201cHope, she\u2019s just in the fruit category. I don\u2019t think she really wants\u2013\u201d \u201cBlackberries. Blackberries. Blackberries. Blackberries. Blackberries.\u201d \u201cOh no! She\u2019s hungry for blackberries. Maybe blueberries? Are there any blueberries left?\u201d Pause. \u201cChopsticks. Chopsticks. Africa agency. Africa agency. \u00a0Af-. Af-. Africa agency. \u00a0Africa agency.\u201d Hope smacks her head and looks at me like I don\u2019t know how or where you\u2019re going to get chopsticks and an Africa agency, but you better get it fast. Recently Rhema found a pre-recorded Taco Bell order on the app. A man\u2019s voice politely asks for two tacos and a diet coke. Every time she \u2018places\u2019 the order \u2013 in the bathroom, in the car, in a waiting room \u2013 we burst into laughter at the random sound of a man requesting\u00a0extra sour cream. As I said, it\u2019s been slow going. But the other day we\u2019d been cooped up inside too long, and she oozed restlessness as she fidgeted with her iTouch at the table. I peered over her shoulder and my heart quickened with The Big Hope and excitement that maybe she\u2019s getting it (or always \u2018got\u2019 it). And just maybe, one day, the words won\u2019t be locked inside. One day she\u2019ll be able to share with me all the thinks she thinks. All that she knows and feels and dreams and sees. It was too wonderful to imagine, and I had to stop myself. But as I stared at the sentence she\u2019d formed: \u201cI want to play.

We remember there are things she wants to say \u2013 that the brain and mouth prevent, and sometimes all she can do is scream. We remember we must make a place for her in a world that is especially uneasy for a girl like her. We remember that she needs constant one-on-one support.

I can\u2019t honestly remember much of that weekend, except I learned this girl had written a book.\u00a0 It was still in manuscript form, but I wanted to read it.\u00a0 She eventually got me a copy.\u00a0 It ended up being what initially made me fall in love with my wife.

It is her (nearly) unedited journal from her service in 1995 in Mother Teresa\u2019s orphanage in Ethiopia.\u00a0 Long before Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and Bono decided to visit on their world tours, Jeneil  labored  to care for those women and the orphans with no news cameras to capture her selflessness.\u00a0 She  loved  those women and children.\u00a0 Her book takes you with her.\u00a0 You can feel the sickness, the drool, the bodily fluids, the things we would never touch in a million years.\u00a0 You are scared when this young, na\u00efve girl is stuck on the streets of Addis Abba at night, locked out of the compound until morning (you can imagine what almost happens).\u00a0 You feel guilty as she vividly puts the poverty we will most likely never know in your face.\u00a0 You see the people through her eyes as I believe the Lord sees them.\u00a0 You just can\u2019t put it down. \u00a0Before she graduated from college in 1997, she had been on the short list of some publishing houses with the help of one of her professors at Dartmouth.\u00a0 But it just didn\u2019t get published and she lost contact with the publishing houses.\u00a0 Then we got married in 1999.\u00a0 One of the first things we did was self-publish her\u00a0book through Xlibris.\u00a0 We have always put away any money we made from the sales in an account that we intend to someday hand-deliver to the mission.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t been able to travel back \u00a0to Ethiopia yet, but the money sits waiting.\u00a0 It won\u2019t match what Bono and Brangelina have delivered, but I believe it will be with a different kind of compassion and love that no amount of money can manufacture.

Several times she glances back at us curiously as Rhema\u2019s babbling and humming pierces the quiet sanctuary. That\u2019s when I realize they are about the same age, and for a moment it takes my breath away. Often I\u2019m at a loss for what is age appropriate. Oh yes, this is what it looks like, neurotypical eight. The easy conversation. The independence. The eyes, the focused, available eyes. The sky-is-the-limit possibilities. The  ability . The ability to read, do after-school sports, go potty on your own, have rich friendships. I want it so bad. How I want it for Rhema, for me. I try hard to guard against discontentment, but it has a way of creeping in and catching me by the throat. I close my eyes. Maybe this has all been a long, wild dream. And maybe God has shown me amazing things, taught me so much through this dream, and I am forever changed and so grateful for the lessons. But when I open my eyes the dream will be over, I\u2019ll have my heart\u2019s desire, I\u2019ll know my Rhema girl with no disabilities\u2026 But if not now. If not here. Lord, one day.

{"date": "October 27, 2011", "body": "Last week the husband and I attended a  gala.  You know, the kind where you get all dressed up and have to mingle and feel totally uncomfortable. I\u00a0put on black pantyhose. I wasn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s still ok to wear pantyhose but a quick google search informed me that bare legs are so 2010. (Thank goodness because it\u2019s getting cold!) Apparently  Kate Middleton  has been working the sheer stockings all year. Alright! Check me out dressing like royalty!\u00a0Except that my hose are maybe a little too small and the crotch part has settled around my thighs and I am in heels (in which I am un-trained) so I have this whole lurching, unsophisticated waddle going on. I am an ostrich. Perhaps even more awkward than the pantyhose on a steady descent is the conversation \u2013 the small talk at these gatherings \u2013 with women you\u2019re meeting for the first time. If they\u2019re mothers, of course you know what they\u2019ll do. They\u2019ll talk about the one thing that\u2019s always on their minds, that makes their hearts beat with an incomparable passion: the rugrats at home. No matter the age, there\u2019s always talk of development \u2013 milestones reached and\u00a0future plans. And then they\u2019ll ask you about yours. And I never know quite where to begin. I am a mother of a child with autism. Everything I see, experience and do in life is forever colored to some degree by that fact. I am blessed to know and walk with some incredible mothers of special needs children \u2013 there are not enough words to describe their courage, resilience, strength, get-it-done mama bear-ness, and compassion. They make me proud to be counted among the autism mamas. But I\u2019m learning that it does not define me, not in total. So this particular night I put myself up to a little test. How long can you go before dropping the word  autism.  Five minutes? 10 minutes? The whole night? Can you talk about anything else?\u00a0 Can you turn off the educator, advocator, blogger for one night and just listen?\u00a0 Can you listen, for once, without comparing? Can you genuinely smile because her daughter does ballet and made the honor roll? Can you understand that her concern is a valid one, her son talking  too much  in class?\u00a0Can you listen to another mother\u2019s story and just appreciate her because she\u2019s a mother\u2026 with experiences so different and yet so similar to your own? We sit around the table, passing the butter and rolls. Someone asks me the ages of my children. Seven and a half and almost five, I say. Oh, so you\u2019re past the hard stage, she says. I want to say,  Girl, lemme tell you\u2026 , but I remember my little test. She goes on to detail the woes of toddlerhood. We laugh at the stories of her son\u2019s antics. I can totally relate because I can still totally relate. But I don\u2019t say that. Then she grows serious and tells us that even though she\u2019s exhausted she counts every day with her son a blessing. She tells of how he was born at 27 weeks gestation, weighed less than 2 pounds and spent five months in the hospital. She named him Samuel, her long-awaited, prayed for, miracle baby. I remember my friend Judith\u2019s wise words: human suffering is not a competitive sport. And all of us mothers treasure our children, our gifts, with a fierceness, and all of our children are miracles. As I\u00a0enjoy the anecdotes around the table\u00a0I\u00a0settle into\u00a0a contentment I\u2019ve not known before, like in my skin is right where I am supposed to be, happy to be.  Let God write your motherhood story, J. I know if you\u2019d held the pen you\u2019d have crafted a different tale. But the story God is writing?

{"date": "March 9, 2012", "body": "\u00a0 I am driving with Rhema in the back, thinking about the week. The husband\u2019s been away. There\u2019s a bone-weariness, there\u2019s too much to do. Life is full and good. Yesterday I shared some of our story with my Bible study group. We\u2019re studying Job, telling what we know of suffering, learning how to hold on to Jesus in the midst of many trials. I was none too pleased that I got choked up as I talked about Rhema, the pain of her diagnosis and ongoing challenges. But the women of Faith, many of their own stories untold,  received  me as their sister, laughed and cried with me, encouraged my heart. So good. Then there was the presentation with two\u00a0autism mama friends to a college class called\u00a0Developmental Disabilities. These sweet students listened to every word, asked great questions and ohhed ahhed at baby pictures of our children. And even though I\u2019ve found joy and contentment right where we are, I could not help but wonder why again, why mine is the child who sits on the nonverbal autistic, \u201clow-functioning\u201d end of the spectrum. Then there was the playground. A girl a little older than Rhema came over, said hi, asked to play. Rhema was already upset about something,\u00a0hiding her face behind her arms. \u201cIs she shy?\u201d the girl asked. \u201cSometimes.\u201d \u201cDoes she talk?\u201d I smiled. \u201cNot much.\u201d \u201cDoes she know sign language?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAw, that\u2019s sad.\u201d \u201cNo. She speaks in many ways.\u201d . All this a bit much for one day, and it weighs heavy as we pull up to Hope\u2019s school and jump out of the car. The joy and the ache. The goodness of the Father, His faithfulness then, His faithfulness now. How it\u2019s happy. How it still hurts. How it heals, too. And then I see something so marvelous across the street I don\u2019t even recognize it at first. Even Rhema, holding my hand, stops and looks up.  Ohhhhhh.  Arms pumping, spinning, swirling under the blue sky, dancing in the wind. It\u2019s our Hope girl. Unquenchable spirit, hair in her face, she exults as God exhales. And I imagine I am her lifting all these cares and jumbled emotions, this bittersweet, up to the heavens with every beat of my arms. My family, the future, silent pains, laughter in the wind, what I can\u2019t undo. Everything becomes an offering. It\u2019s surrender. It\u2019s worship. It\u2019s freedom. \u201cLook at Hope!\u201d He breathes life, and we fill our lungs.\u00a0 Hand in hand, we run.

Thus, the Rhema-kiss has been a long time in the making and it is yet another celebrated gift. Because somewhere along the way she got it that this a way we show affection. It wouldn\u2019t be her first choice. She used to be as hard to hold on to as a wet bar of soap. She felt trapped and confined if we tried to hug her and squirmed away from touch and any kind of closeness. A couple years ago  she began pressing her face against mine for just a moment. These days her kisses are very deliberate. She puts her lips on my cheek and kind of just hangs out there, taking in big gulps of air, inhaling and exhaling through her mouth.

{"date": "October 3, 2011", "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s time to throw out my ideas of what I thought life would be, should be, and let joy fill up those brand-new vacancies.\u201d \n ~Emily Colson . Many months ago I read  Dancing with Max \u2013 a beautiful\u00a0book about a mother learning to joy-dance through life with her autistic son. As I read, I felt like a friend was telling me the story. Several weeks after reading the book I had the sense that I was supposed to remember something that I was not remembering. I forced myself to concentrate\u2026 and a class I had taken several years ago came to mind. It was a course on helping families cope with autism and we met weekly for a period of months. There was a soft-spoken, lovely woman in our class with a son with ASD in his late teens, and she shared her wisdom with us. I was drawn to her, to her stories, but after the class ended we did not keep in touch. Emily,  I thought.  Her name was Emily, and I felt such a connection to her . She couldn\u2019t be the same Emily who wrote Dancing with Max? The same Emily Colson, daughter of famous author and ministry leader,  Chuck Colson ? But instantly I knew she was. I dug up an old email that had the names of all the members of our class. I wrote her that night \u2013 and it was a particularly painful night for me \u2013 but I wrote her pouring out a bit of my heart. I was not even sure the email address was still good or if she\u2019d even remember me. She wrote me back right away. We got together for lunch a few weeks later and just like old friends do, we talked for hours. This past weekend I had the great pleasure of traveling with Emily to the  Iron Sharpens Iron Conference  in Hartford. Working at her book table gave me the opportunity to\u00a0meet and even pray with women all touched by special needs in some way \u2013 a grandmother, a sister, a friend that just wanted to know how to encourage her neighbor who\u2019s son was newly diagnosed. I learned so much watching Emily. She is all grace and has a beautiful message of hope. She led a seminar called \u201cA Mother and Son Who Broke Free:  Living Life\u2019s Challenges With A Special Needs Child. \u201d Most of the women in the room were parents or caregivers, hungry for encouragement, eager to share, relieved to be in a safe space with others who got it. She was only about ten minutes into her presentation when she stopped speaking, walked over to a mother weeping quietly in the front row, and hugged her. That one tender moment seemed to open the floodgates and a young woman sitting next to me began to cry. Not really knowing what else to do I rubbed her back and whispered,  \u201cIt\u2019s ok. We know. We all know.\u201d The end of the seminar ended with a sweet time of sharing and I felt honored to be in that group of women. A mother told us about her princess, her 19-year-old daughter with Rett syndrome \u2013 she cannot walk or talk and she is a  gift . A grandmother lost her daughter unexpectedly a few years ago and now cares for her autistic 8-year-old grandson who is growing bigger and stronger and every day is a struggle. A mother with a 4-year-old son with Down Syndrome wondering if he\u2019ll ever get out of diapers. A son, 28 years old,\u00a0was recently diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s and how\u00a0his mother\u00a0worries and some nights cries herself to sleep. Fear not, for I am with you; \n be not dismayed, for I am your God; \n I will strengthen you, I will help you, \n I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Is. 41:10 \n~One of the verses from the seminar Even though we knew we\u2019d be walking out of that church basement and back into our realities filled with challenges and uncertainties, I believe we all held firm and felt the\u00a0joy of that verse. \u201c I will strengthen you, I will help you.\u201d \u00a0 . **As a rule, I\u00a0do not\u00a0review or promote books\u00a0and products on this blog. But this book just needs to be shared. So! I am offering a  giveaway  of  Dancing with Max . This copy is extra special because it\u2019s been signed by Emily, her father Chuck Colson who wrote the prologue and epilogue, and by (drumroll) Max himself!  Just leave a comment any time this week. If\u00a0Rhema draws your\u00a0name (on Saturday, the 8th) I\u2019ll send you the book! ** ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Max-Mother-Broke-Free/dp/0310293685/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317609214&sr=8-1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Colson", "http://www.ironsharpensironwomen.org/", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/1001110841.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/dancing-with-max-a-mother-who-broke-free/", "title": "Dancing with Max: A mother who broke\u00a0free"},
{"date": "November 29, 2011", "body": "\u2018These words are spirit and life\u2026\u2019 (John 6:63) I have long loved a tradition in our church of presenting Bibles to second graders. Each Bible has the child\u2019s name on it, and it\u2019s signed by the pastor. It\u2019s a rite of passage, many of these children receiving their very own Bible for the first time.\u00a0As the children stand before the congregation I believe they get the message that\u00a0the entire church is supporting and encouraging them on their\u00a0journey of faith. Several weeks ago we received an invitation via e-mail for Rhema to participate in the upcoming Bible presentations. I stared at the e-mail suspiciously for a good ten minutes not knowing what to do. For a moment, I honestly thought I\u2019d received the e-mail in error. I\u2019d forgotten that Rhema would be a second grader now if she had been in a typical school setting. And it never occurred to me that she could or would ever be a part of the church ceremony. For days I hemmed and hawed, rehearsing the can\u2019ts and won\u2019ts in my mind. She won\u2019t be able to stand still. She can\u2019t even sit in the sanctuary for 10 minutes. She won\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.  She can\u2019t even read.  Isn\u2019t the whole point of this to entrust Bibles to children who can read and understand? Finally, I mentioned it to Brandon. \u201cDo we want Rhema to participate?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Then I knew.  Of course.  Of course she would go to the front of the church and accept her Bible just like the others. It would be different for her, yes, but meaningful still. Her Maker, limitless, His imagination and purposes so much bigger than mine. And\u00a0this is\u00a0what I\u2019ve been praying for and talking about for years \u2013 to see a more  inclusive Church , one that ministers to, embraces and celebrates people with special needs. I\u2019m so thankful for the church communities of which my family is a part. A Bible for Rhema. Who can say if she\u2019s listening or understanding? Nevertheless, we\u2019ll read it to her. While she\u2019s running and spinning around the room. We\u2019ll pray it over her as we tuck her in at night. We\u2019ll write it out and  post it on her door . We\u2019ll say it to her in moments of discouragement and moments of\u00a0triumph. Because no other word has power like this Word, to teach, heal, encourage, save. Because the word \u201c rhema \u201d means God\u2019s Word spoken, revealed. Because words will come and words will go, but the Word of the Lord stands forever. As it happens, I was out of town the day of the ceremony. But father, sister and grandmother were \u00a0there. Brandon walked her to the front and sat with her on the front pew while the others stood and the Pastor said a few words. And then, at just the right time, Rhema received her Bible, the most important book she\u2019ll ever hold.

{"date": "December 18, 2013", "body": "I\u2019ve been on a mission to help Rhema learn to initiate toileting during the night. In the past we had to ensure that she stayed in her room all night. The potential for danger was too great if she were to roam the house after bedtime. At age five she once got past the child-safety lock on the inside doorknob of her room and managed to trigger some sort of \u201cimminent hostage threat\u201d on our house alarm system. The husband and I awoke to police circling the house.  No kidding . Now that she\u2019s older I don\u2019t worry as much about middle-of-the-night activities. The problem, however, with keeping her to her room at night for years is that now we have to sort of un-teach her. She\u2019s almost always up at night\u2026 which almost always means she\u2019ll have to go to the bathroom\u2026 which means I have a baby monitor by my bed and at her slightest movement (or when she begins to hum) I run blindly to her room and rush her to the bathroom before there\u2019s an accident. It\u2019s maybe not the best way to live. So Operation Go Potty At Night commenced a couple months ago. By leaving her bedroom door open I hoped she would go into the bathroom on her own. Then I would come and help her. But the initiation would be all on her own. The first several weeks nothing happened. She did not leave her bed no matter what. Recently however she\u2019s been venturing out, always dragging her blanket and a toy piano with her. But she does not go into the bathroom. No. She skips right by past it and bursts into my room (causing the door slams against the wall), turns on the light, jumps into my bed, hums and bangs on her toy piano. Usually at 2 or 3 am. I groggily take her to the toilet and then drag her back to her bed. We repeat the steps several times a night \u2013 she bursts into my room, turns on lights, jumps in bed, I take her back to her room, etc., etc. So goes the night. Operation Go Potty At Night has not gone as planned. There has been no toilet-initiating. But I must say there\u2019s another  initiating  that makes my heart smile: she comes to my room at night. She doesn\u2019t greet me or \u201ctalk\u201d to me when she comes in. She just jumps on the bed and plays her piano. It may not sound like a big deal, but it is! She is almost ten years old and she has never in her life \u201ccalled\u201d for me or addressed me or clearly said \u201cMom\u201d outside of a discrete trial program in which she is continuously prompted. But when she wakes up in the middle of the night her first thought is to go to her mama, and just be close to her. And as I\u2019m groaning under my blankets a small part of me is rejoicing at this wonderfully typical thing happening between mother and child. (Yes, I\u2019m crazy and sleep deprived and I\u2019ve managed to romanticize Operation Go Potty At Nght). The other night/morning she burst in, turned on the lights and found my phone. She cranked the volume and played a game while simultaneously humming and banging on her piano. I huddled under the covers in the fetal position mumbling about sleep, sleep, sleep. Suddenly she yanked back the covers and roughly turned my head over. Then she laid her cheek against mine. I closed my eyes and memorized the moment. It was kind of nice.

Oh oh oh oh.\u201d \n  ~Florida Georgia Line Last weekend Hope had a little birthday party at a pottery place, and she really wanted her dad to \u201cattend.\u201d So he did. It was close to midnight his time. And the audio on the\u00a0iPad was not cooperating. But we made sure he had a seat at the table. I gripe about how hard it is to communicate when Brandon is deployed. But it\u2019s amazing to see the changes in technology over the years. During his first deployment in 2003 and 2004,\u00a0it was still early in the war and the infrastructure for\u00a0the communication we\u2019re used to now simply was not there.\u00a0There was no FaceTime. Skype had only just released a Beta version.\u00a0I\u00a0recorded lots of video, but\u00a0Brandon essentially missed\u00a0the first year of Rhema\u2019s life. During his second deployment to Iraq I brought my laptop to Rhema\u2019s IEP meeting, and\u00a0he was able to Skype in for it, and it kind of freaked out the district liaison to have his face sitting next to her! Anyway, it\u2019s even better this time around. I\u2019m thankful. We\u2019re thankful.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t want to miss a thing. And so he was right there.

{"date": "August 12, 2013", "body": "Just to see you smile \n I\u2019d do anything that you wanted me to \n When all is said and done \n I\u2019d never count the cost \n It\u2019s worth all that\u2019s lost \n Just to see you smile \n~Tim McGraw . Last night as I tucked Rhema into bed I wondered if she was remembering all the events of the past week. Hope had dubbed it Fun Week. We\u2019d kicked it off with some pool time. And there Hope transformed into a mermaid right before my eyes. Not surprising, that little girl has been enchanting me all her life. \u00a0 Then we met up with a dear friend in Maine for a day at the zoo. The zoo has always been a challenge for Rhema. Looking at birds and animals does not seem the least bit interesting to her and  waiting  for others to look at birds and animals is even less enjoyable. Whenever we go on an outing, for Rhema there must be a point in going even if only to get to the end of it. The very first time we went to the zoo we were done in about five minutes because Rhema ran from the entrance to the exit, and I\u2019m sure she never saw a single animal. But each time we go I notice that her joint attention is improving, more and more she seems to actually look (albeit briefly) at the whatever we\u2019re oohhhing and ahhing over. This time she even fed the goats. No small thing! I\u2019m convinced her progress had everything to do with being in the company of caring friends. Next up was the Alice in Wonderland play for Hope. Every summer she and I go to shows performed at our local music theater. In the past three years we\u2019ve not missed a single show. This week, however, Rhema was out of school, and I asked my parents to take Hope to the musical. But they were coming from far away and ended up stuck in traffic in the pouring rain. The girls and I had no choice but to go to the theater and wait for my parents there. Thankfully they arrived just as the show was about to start. By then Rhema clearly wanted to stay. My mother urged me to let her attend the show. I said nooooooo. I said she\u2019ll make noise, she won\u2019t be able to sit still for long, etc. My mother gave me a look, and the next thing I knew I was buying 2 extra tickets \u2013 one for me and one for Rhema. My dad fed her popcorn and soda through the whole first act. She rocked in her seat and giggled and colored on every receipt I had in my purse; she was so happy to be there! At the intermission, she and I slipped out of the theater and soared home. Huge success! We finished off the week with a trip to a large amusement park. And it wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 even with a VIP pass Rhema had a difficult time waiting. But she had a lot of help from cousins, uncles and aunts. I went on too many spinny rides and got crazy motion sickness but it was so worth it to see my Rhema throwing her head back, squealing and laughing and soaking up everything and everyone around. There were moments when she was so happy and engaged with Hope and her cousins; we all basked in her joy and didn\u2019t want it to end. When I am weary that smile is my rest. Just one deep, beautiful smile is all I need to keep going. I would go on a million spinny rides for that smile. Lots of little difficult moments, lots of little amazing milestones. I paused at her door before turning out the light. She was looking at me, almost like she had something to say. And when she looks at you like that there is nothing casual about it. I lifted my hand and waved. She offered softly, \u201cBye.\u201d I didn\u2019t say it first. She read my non-verbal cue \u2013 my wave \u2013 and she said Bye perfectly.

Brandon has his own\u00a0funny, nerdy\u00a0way of keeping time too: \n I\u2019ve learned a lot just in the past month \u2013 Air Conditioning Mechanics 101, how to unclog a garbage disposal, how to replace an alarm system battery,\u00a0how to deposit a check with my phone, how to use a blender. I\u2019m serious about the blender. My first attempt resulted in me eating breakfast off the counter. My second attempt resulted in my finger\u00a0all sliced and diced\u00a0and a  very  broken blender. I\u2019ve learned that the bad smell in the garage might not be a dead animal.

{"date": "December 30, 2013", "body": "We are busy and full with holidays and family visiting from out of town. \u00a0Our Christmas was absolutely wonderful \u2013 the only thing missing was Brandon and he was truly missed. Also, we grieved with those who grieved during this holiday. Times like these have such a way of bringing out a roller coaster of emotions. Rhema\u2019s also been up and down. And taking me along for the ride. She screamed literally all day on Christmas Eve, so troubled and distraught by things I could not see, could not understand, could not change. I, in turn, was frustrated and angry and low and everything I did not want to be for \u201cthis most wonderful time of the year.\u201d Then Christmas dawned with hope. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins\u00a0descended on\u00a0us. Fully believing that \u2018 when two or more are gathered in my Name, there am I with them,\u2019  they formed a circle in my living room and prayed for our family. Emmanuel. Oh, I\u2019d been waiting through all of Advent to truly  know  God with us. And He was. He is. We truly felt such a lifting, Rhema, Hope and I. I\u2019m re-posting an oldie \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cout of season\u201d but hopefully someone can relate \u2013 it attempts to capture this mixture of happy and hurt and God\u2019s nearness in it all. * Originally published March 2012 I am driving with Rhema in the back, thinking about the week. Yesterday I shared some of our story with my Bible study group. We\u2019re studying Job, telling what we know of suffering, learning how to hold on to Jesus in the midst of many trials. I was none too pleased that I got choked up as I talked about Rhema, the pain of her diagnosis and ongoing challenges. But the women of Faith, many of their own stories untold,  received  me as their sister, laughed and cried with me, encouraged my heart. So good. Then there was the presentation with two\u00a0autism mama friends to a college class called\u00a0Developmental Disabilities. These sweet students listened to every word, asked great questions and ohhed ahhed at baby pictures of our children. And even though I\u2019ve found joy and contentment right where we are, I could not help but wonder why again, why mine is the child who sits on the nonverbal autistic, \u201clow-functioning\u201d end of the spectrum. Then there was the playground. A girl a little older than Rhema came over, said hi, asked to play. Rhema was already upset about something,\u00a0hiding her face behind her arms. \u201cIs she shy?\u201d the girl asked. \u201cSometimes.\u201d \u201cDoes she talk?\u201d I smiled. \u201cNot much.\u201d \u201cDoes she know sign language?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAw, that\u2019s sad.\u201d \u201cNo. She speaks in many ways.\u201d . All this a bit much for one day, and it weighs heavy as we pull up to Hope\u2019s school and jump out of the car. The joy and the ache. The goodness of the Father, His faithfulness then, His faithfulness now. How it\u2019s happy. How it still hurts. How it heals, too. And then I see something so marvelous across the street I don\u2019t even recognize it at first. Even Rhema, holding my hand, stops and looks up.  Ohhhhhh.  Arms pumping, spinning, swirling under the blue sky, dancing in the wind. It\u2019s our Hope girl. Unquenchable spirit, hair in her face, she exults as God exhales. And I imagine I am her lifting all these cares and jumbled emotions, this bittersweet, up to the heavens with every beat of my arms. My family, the future, silent pains, laughter in the wind, what I can\u2019t undo. Everything becomes an offering. It\u2019s surrender. It\u2019s worship. It\u2019s freedom. \u201cLook at Hope!\u201d He breathes life, and we fill our lungs. Hand in hand, we run.

I feel I am with you now, whatever than can mean.\u201d \n~Marilynne Robison,  Gilead \n . Some things are so raw and close to the surface I find I can\u2019t talk about them. But I can write\u2026 and process\u2026 and write some more. I can tell the story here and it makes my thinking, my experience visible. The day started with Hope in tears. She\u2019d gone into her sister\u2019s room to say good morning and Rhema had grabbed her by the hair and pulled out fistfuls. One look into her eyes and I knew the day would be hard for Rhema. But we had to do the day. So I brushed her teeth, washed her face, cut her fingernails, and hoped for the best. Two weeks ago I took the girls to the Kid\u2019s Club at our local Y. This is the place where they watch your toddlers/young children while you work out. (Yes, Rhema is 9, but she needs constant supervision and support. The Kid\u2019s Club seemed like the only possible fit). I didn\u2019t go about this lightly \u2013 there was much planning and discussion with the director of the program (and praying on my part). Amazingly things went well, Rhema enjoyed coloring with markers the whole time. But even after a successful second visit to the Kid\u2019s Club last week I decided that would be the last time \u2013 it was too nerve-wracking for me! Today Hope had swimming lessons at the Y. Since Brandon deployed it\u2019s been a little crazy managing the schedule. I have to pick up Rhema from her afterschool therapy at almost the same time that Hope\u2019s lesson finishes. When we got to the Y, Rhema made a beeline for the Kid\u2019s Club. I smiled \u2013 my girl\u2019s a stickler for routine even if it\u2019s something she\u2019s done only once or twice. I steered her in the direction of the pool and tried to explain that we were just there to pick up Hope, no Kid\u2019s Club today. We fetched Hope and on our way out, Rhema bolted towards the Kid\u2019s Club room. I asked if I could just let her color for a few minutes and we\u2019d be on our way. I could tell that she was becoming agitated. She\u2019d only been coloring for a minute when she began smashing/breaking off the marker tips. I did not want her having a meltdown with toddlers in the room so I very ungraciously dragged her out of the room with Hope close behind. She darted into an office right next to the entrance/exit to the Y. Much to the surprise of the two people in the office, she flopped on the floor in full meltdown mode. She kicked over a trash can. When I tried to pick up the trash can, she  bit  the edge of the trash can and wouldn\u2019t let go. The ladies in the office were instantly on their feet asking how they could help. I said, \u201cShe really wants to color. Can I borrow a pen and paper? Maybe that will calm her down.\u201d But when we gave her the pen and paper, she was so upset that she tried to eat the pen and paper. A woman named Carol helped me pry pieces of ink pen out of her mouth. Then Rhema turned on me, pulling out large clumps of my hair. I\u2019ll never forget Carol trying to hold my hair back while my daughter clawed at me. It\u2019s one thing to be \u201caggressed on\u201d at home, it\u2019s another thing altogether when it\u2019s happening to you in public. There were moments when I looked up and saw concerned people standing at the door. There were moments when I worried about Hope and then realized with relief that she was being \u201centertained\u201d and distracted by someone who had taken her off to the side. I reached for my phone, \u201cRhema likes music. I can put on a song\u2026\u201d But I was shaking, my brain stopped working and I could not figure out how to put the volume on my own phone. I tried to give her my phone anyway \u2013 she\u2019d know how to put the volume on. She broke the Otterbox case on my phone and threw it down. Out of control, she pulled things off desks, kicked the copier, clung to file cabinets. I desperately wanted to go home and hide and cry, but knew I could not get her to the parking lot until she calmed. We had to wait it out. Carol was there, just there. She put a hand on my shoulder. She turned on some music. I found my phone, put on a game, sat with Rhema, spoke softly to her until she settled. I don\u2019t know how long we were there. Finally I was able to take her by the hand and stand her up. I think someone gave a little cheer. I will never forget the women in that office. Total strangers and yet there was no judgement. They showed only care and compassion for the three of us and I cannot begin to express how much it meant to me. Carol said she didn\u2019t mind if Rhema messed up the office, she just didn\u2019t want her to hurt herself. Later I found out that the staff had given Hope cool sunglasses and a water bottle. I didn\u2019t even really get a chance to say thank you. The way they handled the situation, the way they treated us \u2013their kindness and understanding \u2013 I\u2019ve tucked it away in my heart forever. I\u2019m struggling with publishing this post. I never want to risk portraying my precious girl in a negative light. The thought of her eagerly heading to the Kid\u2019s Club today just levels me. She so wanted to do well. She just could not cope with the change in routine, not today. Writing it down doesn\u2019t make any of this ok. No. My daughter has autism and some days it really hurts. My whole family hurts. But telling our stories, the good and the bad, helps. I want the pain and the gifts and the hope of Jesus in our life story to spill through my fingertips and onto the screen. I want to share about the Carol\u2019s of the world. I want to share about our flavor of autism and know that someone out there gets it. And know that we\u2019re not alone, that someone prays, and another one cheers when we\u2019re up and cries when we\u2019re down. I\u2019m so very grateful for that. \n . \n***Update: I was able to send a thank you note to Carol and this was her response: \n Thank you for your kind words. J.H. and E.F. are the staff who stayed with Hope. We now know that Hope can get her eyes wet because she is 6 and she looks very cool in her new sunglasses. A.W. also stood by in case we needed more help. We were all so pleased for Rhema, you and Hope that Rhema was able to get to a comfortable place and head home and back to her routine. Your blog posting is so powerful and poignant, it speaks to the struggle that is Autism. Your words of gratitude will never be forgotten. We never know who we will cross paths with and yesterday was time to for our paths to cross. The Y is here for you. If there is anything we can do to help, please let us know.

{"date": "November 5, 2013", "body": "I was doing my Bible study when I came to a passage I had not read or thought about in a long time. Instantly I felt goosebumps on my arms and my eyes filled as the memories flooded back. From age two until about age eight, Rhema battled continuous seizure activity in the speech and comprehension areas of her brain. We did significant hospital time in those early years trying all kinds of treatments. During that time I heard about \u201cword deafness\u201d \u2013 the inability to comprehend speech \u2013 and was told that Rhema most likely suffered from it. In my head, I knew that the seizure disorder coupled with a diagnosis of classic autism most likely meant that my sweet girl would not be able to speak. But my heart refused to accept it. I read in Mark 7 the story of Jesus healing a deaf and mute man. He took the man aside, put fingers in his ears and touched his tongue. He prayed and said \u201cEphphatha!\u201d which means \u201cBe opened.\u201d Immediately the man\u2019s ears were opened, his tongue was \u201cloosed\u201d, and he began to hear and speak plainly. Even though  I  couldn\u2019t say the word I posted it \u2013 Ephphatha \u2013 on Rhema\u2019s door and prayed fervently for God to heal her like he\u2019d healed the man in the Bible. Over the years my desperate prayers grew quiet; the healing I sought did not come, and a numbing, disappointed acceptance settled in. The paper curled, fell off the door. I don\u2019t recall thinking about that word again until reading it today. But I felt the power and the mystery, the amazement and joy of that Biblical story as if I were there. I imagined what it must have been like for the man who struggled with the pain and frustration of silence all his life to suddenly hear with understanding and to speak fluently. I imagined my Rhema speaking like that\u2026 God closed my eyes and rolled back the tape, the years of seizure meds, the many wonderful teachers and programs for Rhema, the long hours of therapy, the precious community of support, the gains and the setbacks. There was the day she said  words of a verse . (I would re-post it every day on this blog if I could). And now. Now we\u2019re sure to hear (with a little prompting) \u2018Hi\u2019, \u2018bye\u2019, \u2018yeah\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018cheese\u2019, and \u2018Hope\u2019 from her lips. And now I can say, \u201cRhema, get your shoes on.\u201d or \u201cGo wash hands.\u201d And she understands me. Oh how very far we\u2019ve come. And there\u2019s more still to come! I thought we\u2019d missed the healing but all along there have been miracles\u2026 openings. Jesus taking us aside, touching our ears, touching our tongues. Giving us new words to speak. Helping us hear like we\u2019ve never heard before. Rhema, age 5 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, \u201c He\u2019s done it all and done it well.

She told me she\u2019d cried a lot at school that particular day. \u201cOh Hope, you didn\u2019t tell me. Why were you crying?\u201d \u201cBecause I just miss Daddy.\u201d I\u2019d been so busy just trying to make everything run smoothly, I realized that we had not really talked about how Brandon\u2019s absence affected her. He deployed 4 months ago, 8 more to go, and that\u2019s a long time to a 6 year-old. I almost forgot that\u2019s it\u2019s hard for her, too. \u201cI know you must miss him a lot. I\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d We talked\u00a0about Veteran\u2019s Day and her button-brown eyes lit up at the\u00a0thought of\u00a0\u201ccelebrating Daddy.\u201d We did celebrate him and we did miss him. We received so many messages of thanks and it really means a lot. Homecoming 2010 Hope and I also talked about the ways people have helped our family in the past months.

{"date": "November 18, 2013", "body": "A couple months ago I was going through old blog\u00a0posts for the sole purpose of ohhing and ahhing at pictures of my girls when they were younger. I read an old post that left me very unsettled, and by the end of the night I was ready to delete it and a few others. I realized that all these years I\u2019d not given enough thought to how Rhema might feel about some of the stories I\u2019ve shared. I realized that I\u2019d never acted as if she might really be able to read one day. As much as it is said \u2013 presume competence, they are taking everything in \u2013 and as much as you know it\u2019s true \u2013 in the day-to-day caring of a non-speaking autistic child, sometimes you forget. Or at least I forgot. And as David Mitchell writes in  The Reason I Jump , \u201cas the months turn into years \u201cforgetting\u201d can become \u201cdisbelieving\u201d\u201d.\u00a0There are moments when I\u00a0believe big and\u00a0moments when I underestimate her and limit her with my assumptions \u2013 sometimes all in the same day. The idea that she could be hurt or embarrassed by something I\u2019ve written about her just crushed me. But my Rhema has been patient and gracious to her mama. Truly. I\u2019d like to think that she would find in these years of words her parents seeking ways to live out the lessons God is teaching us through her. That she would find a long love letter from my heart to hers. I am not able to have a conversation with her about what to share or not share here. In recent months I\u2019ve really wrestled with this and how I will blog in the future. This past week was a hard one for the autism community. Autism Speaks\u2019 co-founder Suzanne Wright\u2019s  call to action  left many people angry, sad or both; I think it illuminated the hurt on all sides. Wright paints a picture of 3 million children in America gone missing \u2013 our children with autism. Many parents cried, \u201cMy child is not  lost !\u201d And many autistic people responded, \u201cI am not  lost !\u201d And so the lost concept has been on my mind all week. Truthfully, there was a time we considered Rhema \u201clost\u201d. And I most certainly was lost. I wrote about it four years ago, and I think Rhema \u2013 when she reads it some day \u2013 will like this one: (Originally published November 2009) I don\u2019t know exactly what happened. Or how it happened or why it happened. But at one point we had this: And then suddenly, one day,\u00a0we had this: For whatever reason she retreated to a place we couldn\u2019t reach, and every day since then we\u2019ve been working to draw her back. You could say we\u2019ve been trying to \u201cfind\u201d her behind the walls of autism. There have been  moments  when we\u2019ve discovered parts of her we never knew existed. And each discovery is thrilling and addicting \u2013 we want more and more. She is pursued in earnest; this seeking to know more of her a daily aim. I was \u201clost\u201d, too. Gone was the self-confident, capable, make-it-happen version of myself. I had no ability to make my daughter speak or eat or even sleep. Angry. Bitter. Helpless. Unable to concentrate. My faith shaken. Going through the motions. For a year. As we searched for ways to help Rhema, I wondered where I was\u2026 and where the heck God was. Where are You in all of this? Turns out it\u2019s a good question. Even Job said, \u201cO that I knew where I might find Him!\u201d (Job 23:3) For I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you ,\u201d declares the LORD\u2026 Jer. 29:11-14 I still have my questions, some of which I may never get answers to\u00a0in this life. But\u00a0what I know, what I\u2019ve found so far, is this: There is a God who loves you with an everlasting love. It\u2019s a love \u2018that goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell.\u2019 This God takes you, lost, broken and flawed and  finds \u00a0you worth it. He delights in you greatly, rejoices over you with singing. He is called Faithful and True for he takes the guilt, shame and sorrow and overcomes it on the Cross, and pronounces you  free . In all your looking, He says, look for me with all your heart. I will be found by you. A most important search. It is love that asks, that seeks, that knocks, that finds, \nAnd that is faithful to what it finds \n-St. Augustine ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-washington-call-action", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/rhema_before.jpg", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/rhema_lost1.jpg"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/lost-and-found/", "title": "Lost and found"},

We asked Hope what the blue lights were for, and she excitedly replied \u201cAutism Awareness!\u201d For us the  Light It Up Blue  initiative is about doing whatever little thing we can to help support and promote research,\u00a0family services, compassion and understanding for people impacted by this disorder. It\u2019s about joining with Autism Speaks and a wonderful community of friends and family who share hope and work tirelessly inside and outside the home to make a place for our children in this world. I\u2019m so thankful for all of the efforts that shine a light\u2026 For our family, perhaps it is most about honoring our Rhema. Honoring the efforts she makes to face the day full of unpredictability and sensory bombardment, and the courage she finds to communicate and connect with us. It\u2019s about recognizing how hard she works to learn to wave \u201chello\u201d and say her name and use a spoon and go potty and copy a circle. It\u2019s about celebrating her resilience and resourcefulness, her amazing growth in development, her ability to grasp the things predicted to be beyond her reach. Every day. Brandon put the lantern on the table and invited Rhema to turn it on. She tentatively reached out her hand, not sure what to do. He guided her fingers and helped her flip the switch. On. I can\u2019t say for sure but the words \u201cautism\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d and \u201cawareness\u201d and \u201cadvocacy\u201d do not\u00a0hold meaning for her. But I do know that her lovely face was illuminated by the blue glow of the lantern. And a bright squeal escaped her lips. And Hope cheered. And I just believe that somehow Rhema knew that the blue light had something to do with her. Something exciting and good. And that means a\u00a0whole lot of something. \u00a0 For more on Light It Up Blue, click \u2013> here <\u2013. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_0861.jpg", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/about-us/press-releases/autism-speaks-and-home-depot-team-shine-light-world-autism-awareness-day-a-0", "https://rhemashope.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/apr2012-055.jpg", "http://lightitupblue.org/Markslist/home.do"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/it-means-something/", "title": "It means something"},

{"date": "April 9, 2012", "body": "On Easter weekend we had a little party for Rhema at a local ice cream shop. The rather last-minute e-mail invitation to a small group of family and friends said, \u201cIce cream makes Rhema SMILE, and we wanted to invite you to eat, slurp, lick, or paint yourself with ice cream. With us.\u201d Most of the standard types of birthday parties simply don\u2019t work for her. We wanted to do something she would enjoy, and this was it! It turned out to be a rather cold day, but no one seemed to mind. The ice cream was de-lish. The adults talked and laughed. The kids ran and played. Rhema stayed parked on a bench with a cup of vanilla ice cream the entire time. She never moved for an hour; she just smiled to herself and giggled and stirred her ice cream. Never once did she get up to greet friends bearing gifts. She was happy and content as adult friends took turns sitting with her. But besides a couple prompted, barely audible \u201chi\u2019s\u201d, she did not \u2018speak\u2019 directlywith any of the children atthe party. A\u00a0boy named G attends school with Rhema, and his mother\u00a0told me that he recently saw a picture of\u00a0Rhema and said \u201cThat\u2019s Rhema!\u201d She said that\u00a0when he says her name it sounds like \u201cGramma\u201d, but the way he responded to her picture you could just tell that he really enjoyed a friendship with her. She really wanted me to know that, and for me it was like donning a fleece bathrobe on a cold morning. Another classmate of Rhema\u2019s is E. E is so dear to us. She and Rhema love to go on community trips together with their teachers.\u00a0When Rhema\u00a0went into the hospital for an EEG, E and her mom gave Rhema the BEST Dora music book. They just knew it was the perfect gift. E\u2019s mother tells me that E calls Rhema her \u201cbest friend.\u201d And I love it, but honestly I\u2019ve wondered how? How can it be? I\u2019ve  written before  that I wish Rhema could know what it is to have rich, meaningful relationships. And again, God is showing me  she can  and she does. I\u2019m realizing that Rhema and her precious friends have a lot to teach me about friendship. They give and don\u2019t keep score. G will happily and faithfully say \u201cHi Rhema!\u201d every day whether she looks at him or not. In my simple way of thinking, friendship involves/includes reciprocation. For a friendship to exist she would need to do something  for  them; acknowledge them and talk to them and play with them. In my simple way of thinking, she doesn\u2019t do any of those things. But maybe she does. And even if she doesn\u2019t, they don\u2019t need her to. And maybe they  know  each other better than most and get each other in a \u2018girl, you don\u2019t have to say a thing\u2019 sort of way. Maybe they share a bond I cannot begin to understand. The realization has been liberating. So I didn\u2019t fret or worry at the party\u00a0when she did not interact with the other kids in the way I would want/expect. In the end\u00a0we all gathered around her. I\u2019d prayed at the beginning of the week that she would  feel special  and as I looked around at all our friends,  her  friends, I felt overcome with gratitude:  Rhema is so enthusiastically loved. It\u2019s a joy to this mama\u2019s heart\u2026 the kind that makes you want to weep and do cartwheels all at once. We sang Happy Birthday, and Rhema looked up from her ice cream. She knew we were singing to her.\u00a0 There\u2019s this thing she does when she\u2019s feeling the music, enjoying the song. And she did it then. She lifted her hands in the air and bounced them up and down. Almost like \u201c hooray!\u201d  And \u201c thank you!\u201d Almost like a conductor, only with a big vanilla bucktoothed grin.

Or she would\u00a0clap her hands\u00a0or touch her nose and say \u2018Do this!\u2019 Trial after trial after trial. Week after week, month after month, year after year. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s still very difficult for Rhema. It\u2019s the foundation for other skills \u2013 joint attention, verbalization, play, social, emotional engagement, self-help. I\u2019ve seen her lack of this non-verbal imitation, and it puts her in a totally different space\u2026 even from other children within the autism spectrum. If you cannot hear or understand an instruction, at least if you can observe and imitate what you see, well you\u2019ve got something there \u2013 a model. But just getting this sweet child to  look \u2026 it seems she can barely even attend to what her teacher/coach/sister/peer is doing, let alone follow those actions. How will she learn? Today was one of those days where the beauty of God\u2019s creation fills you full, and you cherish every minute. Ours was a day with no work or school, only inflatable play zones and lunch at our usual joint\u00a0and beaches and walks on sand and ice cream with sprinkles (of course). Then a simple dinner at home. Something happens when I see my children eating what I\u2019ve made (ok I boiled some turkey dogs and warmed up canned corn):\u00a0I get good\u00a0satisfaction as a mama. They\u2019re here, they\u2019re happy and content, their bellies are full.  Thank you Lord. I look at their\u00a0mocha legs dangling, Hope\u2019s long hair on her back, the gentleness in Rhema even as she separates every piece of corn on her plate. The chatter and the hum, the late sun shining on them through the window. I am in awe at these little people growing before my eyes, I am grateful that God lets me see them, experience them, be a part of them. In the afternoon Brandon and I had\u00a0stood on the beach side by side for just a moment, watching Hope twirl and prance in the ocean while Rhema wandered and wondered as the light changed around her and she pressed her toes in the cool sand. How we never could have imagined  these two  the day we met over 15 years ago. I put my arm around his strong shoulders, shoulders I know now I can trust. I am so thankful; there\u2019s no doubt he will pray on his knees in the morning, bring flowers in the evening, love his wife \u2018til it hurts, and give all that he has for his family, his girls.\u00a0He read aloud this morning\u00a01 Peter 4:8. Again, I know it\u2019s all  mercy : \u201c\u2026 Dissolved by Thy goodness, I fall to the ground \n And weep for the praise of the mercy I\u2019ve found.\u201d It comes to me then, how to teach Rhema. How to teach Hope. Love him. Love each other. Love with a heart as wide as that beach, like God\u2019s sea of forgetfulness where forgiven sins are cast. Serve it like a heart-satisfying meal.

She puts the heel of her hand to her nose and in one quick motion pushes all the snot up her forehead. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. The end result is first a slick, then a very crusty forehead. And a hair style featuring mucus mousse in the front. what we need... Due to seasonal allergies and a little cold thrown in, Rhema\u2019s nose has been a most prolific slime factory. And truthfully snot is really all I can think about these days. The only way to handle the problem is to be armed with wipes or a wet cloth at all times. In order to 1) protect yourself and 2) wash her face. Not that washing her face is ever an easy task. She hides, ducks, fights or laughs uncontrollably when I try to clean her. On the morning drive I realized with horror that I was out of wipes. At Hope\u2019s school we ran into the bathroom and I used wet paper towels to wipe her face. But as we walked down the hallway she sneezed. We ran back into the bathroom and did the wet paper towel thing again. I still needed to drop her off at school and catch the train to work. But I knelt down in front of her to try and get a good look at her beautiful face, which she loves to hide.

{"date": "April 6, 2012", "body": "God is funny. Ten days ago I wrote  this post . One of my little desires has been for Rhema to have the opportunity to participate in \u2018after school sports.\u2019 Last week\u00a0Heather, the head coach of the Special Olympics gymnastics team, sent me an email about the new season starting up. And it was like a voice bellowed from the sky:  Team sport, did you say? Here you go.  She can. She can. And just like that I was driving her to the first practice of the season. We actually tried gymnastics\u00a0a couple years ago, and while she had a great time running circles around the gym, I got the sense that she wasn\u2019t quite ready for it. So we sat out for a while. Some long time readers of this blog may remember just how meaningful her involvement with Special Olympics and gymnastics is to me. (Click  here  and  here  for the back story). As soon as we got to gym the excitement spilled out of Rhema like a jelly donut. The coaches were genuinely happy to see her again as she whizzed\u00a0by the group of girls already warming up. Heather\u2019s brother Justin remarked, \u201cShe\u2019s gotten so tall!\u201d Then he ran after her. And Hope ran after him\u2026 snapping pictures on the iPod like the paparazzi. Justin tried to get Rhema to come to the circle and stretch with the rest of the team, but she couldn\u2019t stop running and jumping and shrieking with joy. While the other parents chatted in the lobby, I couldn\u2019t leave the gym \u2013 partly because I didn\u2019t want to miss a thing, and partly because I didn\u2019t want to miss a thing. Just about every emotion bubbled through me. I couldn\u2019t help smiling and laughing at Rhema\u2019s abandon and happy sounds. I felt a hint of disappointment because I\u2019d hoped by now she would be able to participate with the group and follow instructions. Clearly she still needed one coach dedicated solely to her with the task of staying beside her as she ran her loops. I loved Hope for being so excited for her sister; she was the cutest thing, running after Rhema, capturing every moment in snapshot. And I was absolute mush when it came to Coach Justin and his kindness and patience with Rhema. I watched him as he jumped with her on the trampoline and tried to show her new moves. I watched as he tried to get her to walk on the balance beam when all she wanted to do was sit on it. I watched as he helped her up to the bar and eventually got her to hold on for half a second. I watched as he helped her swing on a rope, bounce on a ball.\u00a0She rarely gave any indication that she was listening to him, but he talked to her all the while. Around and around they went, trying, trying, trying. My heart filled with gratitude for people who care so much and help make programs like this possible for our children. Rhema\u2019s gymnastics program for is run by volunteer coaches and is completely funded by donations. The gym space is also donated. It truly is a gift. I\u2019m so hopeful for Rhema that she  will  learn and have fun this season.\u00a0I never cease to be amazed at the wonderful people God puts in her life to help her along. I know anything is possible. At the end of the practice Heather pulled out the parachute. With Justin\u2019s help, Rhema came over and joined in the fun! Granted, she was more interested in jumping on top of it or running under it. But no doubt, she was part of the team.

I wrote some of my story in a blog\u00a0almost two years ago, and I want to share it again.* I was born on a church pew. Not really. But since I was little my parents have been involved in religious ministry \u2013 from hosting Bible studies in our home in Panama to pastoring a church for the past 25 years. I\u2019m forever grateful to my parents for the seeds of faith they planted and watered in me. Things got interesting one Sunday during the altar call. I was surprised to see my sister crying and walking to the front of church to receive Jesus. Not wanting to be outdone and risk appearing more sinful than my twin, I followed her, produced some tears and prayed to accept Jesus Christ into my heart. I was eight years old. When the pastor baptized me I flailed, and he ended up dunking me twice. He concluded I\u2019d be a good Baptist. My sister concluded I needed all the extra dunking I could get. There were many, many times after that day I would pray the prayer repeatedly, just in case. \u201cJesus, I believe in You! I believe You died on the cross and rose again. Please forgive my sins, and come into my heart. I accept You as my Lord and Savior. Thank you for saving me. Amen.\u201d Growing up as a preacher\u2019s daughter, my attendance was mandatory at Sunday School and VBS and youth group meetings. But I went gladly. Over the years I\u2019d seen people lost, broken, grieving, angry, empty \u2013 and I saw them  changed  (not necessarily their circumstances, but their lives). I could not explain it. But I had no doubt in the power of God to transform, to give Life and hope. In college, I came to love the words in my Bible. Those words became my lifeline when I lived in Ethiopia. Marriage and motherhood have stretched, challenged, wrecked and re-built my faith more than anything ever could. \u2018Till sin be bitter, Christ is not sweet.  I\u2019ve long understood the doctrine of grace, and I\u2019ve been encouraged by it as I\u2019ve seen it demonstrated in the lives of others. But in recent years I experienced the way of grace in my own life like never before. I fell. I fell into a horrible pit, not only hurting myself but others around me. When I saw myself apart from God\u2019s grace, I found the ugliest heart and guilt so terrible, I could have died. But then the very nature of Christ reached through friends, through my husband, to love me. Amazing grace, I will never forget. Some friends/readers have admired my faith, so here\u2019s my story. I am utterly unfaithful, and God has been ever faithful to me. I can tell you I\u2019m like the father whose son had no speech, \u201cLord, I believe. Help my unbelief!\u201d I can tell you I\u2019m learning that \u201cwithout faith, it is impossible to please God\u201d, and all I want is to please Him. I can tell you that I love much because I have been forgiven much. I can tell you that I still pray with eight year-old faith:  Jesus, I believe in You! Thank you for saving me.  Again and again.  Amen. ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jjyNgp39Ng"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/faith-story-2/", "title": "Faith Story\u2026"},

When we Skype with him, I put the screen in front of her and he says \u201cHi Rhema!\u201d At first she doesn\u2019t respond, won\u2019t look up. And then suddenly she taps his face once, square in the nose, hard on the screen. Always makes me smile. People will often ask how the girls are doing with Brandon being away. I know what to say about Hope. But it\u2019s hard to know what Rhema thinks, feels and understands about it. I know she misses him but it\u2019s just not something she ever shows or expresses.

She colors on any church bulletin, sign-up sheet, welcome card, and hymnal she can find. She rarely makes it through the service and cannot handle the children\u2019s programs. She runs laps around the sanctuary. She melts down. She\u2019s been known to do the low crawl under the pews from the back of the church to the front. Her favorite part of church is the end\u00a0\u2013 when she can race to the fellowship hall and drink all the lemonade. Yet she is a well-loved member of the church, an important part of the Body. Although she cannot fully communicate it, God speaks her language perfectly. This is an indescribable comfort to me on the hard days. Rhema has a faith story. A couple years ago I wrote the following: My father pastors a church that\u2019s a good distance away from where we live so we don\u2019t get to visit as often as I\u2019d like. But when we go there, we\u2019re home. At the end of the service, the \u201cdoors of the church are opened.\u201d This means that anyone who wants to can come -just as they are \u2013 to receive prayer, to join the church, to give their life to the Lord. It is a powerful, heartfelt time of decision. A few weeks ago when the doors\u00a0of the church were open,\u00a0we all stood to our feet and sang a hymn. Rhema slid out of the pew and into the aisle.\u00a0(We always sit in the back in case we need to make a fast getaway.) She had\u00a0her iPod in hand, and she\u00a0did a little\u00a0tip-toe dance in the aisle. I whispered her name and held out my hand attempting to coax her back to her seat. But she ignored me, hummed a little tune and hopped further down the aisle. I knew that if I tried to lead her back to her seat, skirts were bound to fly, and the pastor\u2019s daughter and granddaughter would end up in a wrestling match in the middle of the aisle while the choir sang \u201cCome To Jesus.\u201d So I resolved to do nothing but quietly follow her\u00a0ambling steps down the aisle. As people noticed her slow progression I could almost hear a collective\u00a0intake of\u00a0breath. One woman said softly, \u201cLet her go.\u201d Another whispered, \u201cPraise the Lord.\u201d Others encouraged, smiled and nodded. These friends \u2013 sisters and brothers \u2013 have prayed for our family, for our Rhema, for so many years. They rejoice over every \u201cinch\u201dstone she acheives and celebrate every utterance and happy noise she makes. They love and accept her\u00a0completely as she is. But I couldn\u2019t just let her go. She might do something inappropriate like jump into the baptistry behind the pulpit. So, meekly,\u00a0I followed. As we neared the front a thought crossed my mind that left me rather panicked. Oh no. Maybe  I\u2019m  supposed to go up front. Maybe, just maybe, right now God is leading her, and she is leading me. To that sweet throne of grace. Maybe right now\u00a0 I  need prayer. Maybe\u00a0I need\u00a0to fall on my face and cry  Lord, I need you.  Maybe\u00a0I\u2019m the one who\u00a0needs to open my clenched fists, examine my heart, and give it all to Jesus again and again\u00a0\u2013 my burdens, my sin, my shame, my pride, my hopes and waiting-on-answer prayers,  me . Finally we reached the front. We were only there briefly. She hummed and rocked a\u00a0little. Then she resumed her iPod game and meandered back down the aisle. Afterwards my parents and I chuckled about it. We agreed that you just never know how God might be speaking into the hearts of our young ones. Even though\u00a0Rhema cannot\u00a0sit through a Sunday school lesson or sing in the children\u2019s choir or even articulate what she knows, I\u2019m trusting she  knows ;  God is developing a special relationship with her. And it\u2019s just like\u00a0that girl to push me closer to Him, too. \u201cThey say that I can move the mountains \n And send them crashing into the sea \n They say that I can walk on water \n If I would follow and believe \n with faith like a child. They say that love can heal the broken \n They say that hope can make you see \n They say that faith can find a Savior \n If you would follow and believe \n with faith like a child\u201d ~Jars of Clay One thing I know. She\u00a0is not afraid to come. She\u2019s not hindered by the details \u2013 the tradition or position or what anyone else thinks. When the Spirit of God moves her, she moves. She just seems to\u00a0trust that she will be  received \u2026 into\u00a0arms wide open. I\u00a0must, I must\u00a0follow her lead. Rhema in 2009.

I came straight from work, picked them up from their afterschool programs and we headed to the mall to join family and friends of the school. To fully appreciate this story you must know that I have recently taken up high heels. Given my life, it\u2019s no small thing that I leave home with my teeth brushed and hair combed. But I\u2019m trying. In heels, I look like a bug-squashing hunchback but I\u2019m trying. Rhema\u2019s chronic vomiting has improved significantly the past few months, thanks to reflux meds and therapy to help her slowly eat and chew her food. But as I was peeling Hope\u2019s nuggets at the Food Court I noticed that two double cheeseburgers, a medium order of waffle fries, an apple juice, 1 pound of ketchup and a soft serve ice cream were  gone . And Rhema had that telltale I\u2019m-going-to-puke-my-brains-out-right-now look. I jumped up, grabbed her hand and propelled her toward the bathroom through a maze of tables and chairs and diners. Half way there it became quite clear. We were not going to make it. What happened next can only be described as one of the most spectacular moments of my life. I grabbed someone\u2019s abandoned, crumb-covered tray off a table. I made like Serena Williams scrambling for the ball. I lunged my business \u201cprofessional\u201d high heeled wearing self forward while holding out that tray with one hand. I CAUGHT the projectile vomit. Yes, y\u2019all. I admit that I thought to myself, \u201c Man, I\u2019m good.\u201d  \u00a0But I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on my accomplishment. I know my kid. I know she doesn\u2019t stop throwing up until it\u2019s all up. She still had 3 or 4 more good hurls in her. Over by Taco Bell, I caught another one! By the time we got inside the crowded bathroom Rhema was doubled over and I was balancing Mount Puke. Everyone got out of our way. Rhema finished getting sick in the toilet, and then she was totally fine and happy. I cleaned her (and the tray) up as best I could. We calmly returned to the school group. No one even knew what happened. Except for Hope of course, unfazed by another spew fest. And the only people who lost their appetites were me, everyone in line at the Chinese food place, anyone seated near Taco Bell, Sbarro and Dunkin Donuts, and probably all the people in the restroom.

Deut.  31:6/Heb. 13:5 \u201cHe will never leave you nor forsake you.\u201d My testimony.\u00a0 Hmm.\u00a0 Most of the time I tell the amazing story of how the Lord rescued my family out of alcohol, drugs, womanizing, and near-divorce.\u00a0 It was 1980 and I was 4.\u00a0 My parents had been married only 11 short years to the day when the Lord saved them, stopped our family from becoming another statistic.\u00a0 My parents just celebrated 44 years of marriage on August 9th.\u00a0 Things could have been so different.\u00a0 Thank you, Jesus.\u00a0 Thank you. I\u2019ve rarely told my personal story.\u00a0 It was rather boring compared to the dramatic Salvation of my parents.\u00a0 Oh, I remember all the evil too well, but life took a very happy turn when I was 4, so I mostly grew up in church.\u00a0 I can relate when Jeneil says she \u201cprayed the prayer\u201d over and over again.\u00a0 Trusting Jesus as a youngster meant no dramatic lifestyle changes.\u00a0 I was relieved to hear one of my older youth group\u00a0leaders say that believing was a fact, not a feeling.\u00a0 I rested with that for a while. I left for West Point at 17.\u00a0 Left a small, small town\u2014legally a municipality defined by law as a village.\u00a0 \u201cMore cows than people,\u201d I always say.\u00a0 I arrived in New York with all the \u201ccity kids\u201d having no idea if someone from rural Michigan could hang with the kids who had all the \u201cstuff\u201d in high school.\u00a0 I made a vow to myself.\u00a0 I would only leave if they escorted me to the gate by force or in a body bag.\u00a0 I also vowed to find out if what I believed about God was True.\u00a0 I spent as much time learning about the Lord at West Point as I did studying.\u00a0 I left after my 4 years believing in Jesus to my bones.\u00a0 All the things I studied as an American Politics major to try to save the world through good policy seemed to pale in comparison to the power of Jesus to really change peoples\u2019 hearts and circumstances. Life was good.\u00a0 Started off marriage with no children and a 5 year perpetual date with my wife!\u00a0 Even after hearing Rhema come into the world over a scratchy phone in a dirty, sweaty tent in Iraq in 2004, life was still good.\u00a0 Even after finding out our dreams for our firstborn were never to come to pass outside of an autism-erasing miracle, life still seemed ok.\u00a0 But, little did I realize that slowly Jeneil and I were losing our souls.\u00a0 We mourned losing our dreams for Rhema, privately.\u00a0 We both found significance in countless hours completing our Master\u2019s degrees.\u00a0 I worked all day long; went to school at night.\u00a0 We fought to bring Rhema back\u2014one of us up, one of us down.\u00a0 Never in sync.\u00a0 We fought each other.\u00a0 We cleaned feces off of walls and floors and beds and hair as Rhema progressed through her stages of autism.\u00a0 We (illogically) blamed each other in those late night moments.\u00a0 We had our second daughter\u2014Hope; best gift ever, but stress upon stress.\u00a0 Hope was sick too in those early years.\u00a0 I was gone every summer for training and a good number of weekends leaving Jeneil to the depression of our home.\u00a0 We wore ourselves out and left each other in the dust for 3 \u00bd \u00a0years.\u00a0 Then, just when both of us were hollowed out souls, I disappeared to Iraq for 15 months.\u00a0 All during that deployment, autism, lead poisoning, house woes, depression, and other crazy circumstances just continued to take their toll. Still, never did I think it could happen to us.\u00a0 No matter how bad things got, we were too  good .\u00a0 Too educated.\u00a0 Too\u2026 proud.\u00a0 But, in the middle of my 2 nd  year-long deployment,\u00a0our marriage and family had officially failed.\u00a0I don\u2019t mean it hit some rocks.\u00a0 That was before I left.\u00a0 It hit the rocks and had now sunk.\u00a0  It. Had. Failed.  \u00a0\u00a0All I could think through the stinging, bitter tears was, \u201cHow?\u201d\u00a0 Looking back it was obvious.\u00a0 But, in the small moments over the previous 5 years as we tore our marriage down, we fooled ourselves thinking it would be all right.\u00a0 I knew we weren\u2019t healthy (Jeneil tried to tell me), but we\u2019d be ok.\u00a0 We were B & J.\u00a0 Self-reliant.\u00a0 Financially secure.\u00a0 Professionals.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t need anything\u2014certainly not anyone\u2019s help.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t need\u2026God. Thank God for faithful, truth-telling chaplains.\u00a0 I remember expecting him to side with me.\u00a0 Instead he looked at me and said \u201cthe biggest problem in your marriage is you.\u201d\u00a0 He didn\u2019t mean Jeneil hadn\u2019t contributed her share, he just knew I didn\u2019t need a pity party.\u00a0 He knew  I  wasn\u2019t  good  despite my best attempt to place blame.\u00a0 His moral mirror on my heart gutted my self-approval.\u00a0 It also saved me from doing what I had done to my wife for years (and she to me)\u2014tear her down further in our lowest times.\u00a0 Instead, the midst of the pain, Jesus showed up.\u00a0 I remember trying to bathe my wife in love from thousands of miles away over Skype.\u00a0 I remember praying over each word I said\u2014careful to hold my tongue when He said to.\u00a0 I remember sending her flowers like when we first dated.\u00a0 He gave me a brand new passionate love for my wife.\u00a0 One that I still have today. The Lord pierced my soul more with something beyond saving my marriage.\u00a0 The good chaplain asked me this question, \u201cIf all this goes away and you face life without your wife and children, do you still love Jesus?\u201d\u00a0 I recoiled because in my economy following Jesus came with fringe benefits\u2014the most basic was my family being intact.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s idolatry,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Confused, I left to think about it.\u00a0 How could something  good  be an idol?\u00a0 \u201cAnything that takes God\u2019s place as your source of Life is an idol.\u00a0 If God isn\u2019t everything, then even a good thing can be an idol in His place.\u201d\u00a0 God was separating the wheat from the chaff in my heart.\u00a0 It may seem strange to count the most painful chapter of my life as the most precious, but one event captured it all.\u00a0 I woke up in the middle of the night wet, weeping.\u00a0 Iraq was pitch dark at night.\u00a0 All I could utter through the tears was \u201cJesus\u201d over and over again\u2014and I  felt  Him there.\u00a0 As crushed as I was, for the first time in my life I got an unvarnished glimpse into my own soul.\u00a0 When all had been stripped away, I knew that the love of Jesus is great and my love for Him was real.\u00a0 In the trial, I chose Him over all else.\u00a0 The feeling of being wondrously rescued that I had wondered about as a kid\u2026well, I got to experience it.\u00a0 No matter the outcome, I knew Jesus would never leave me.\u00a0 I now knew Him at a gut level.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t trade that night for anything. The rest of the story?\u00a0 We made it.\u00a0 God\u2019s Grace was our teacher.\u00a0 The Lord put us back together slowly but firmly, just as He had done with my parents.\u00a0 Things could have been so different.\u00a0 Thank you, Jesus.\u00a0 Thank you. What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You\u2019re near? What if my greatest disappointments or the aching of this life \n Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can\u2019t satisfy? \n What if trials of this life \n The rain, the storms, the hardest nights \n Are your mercies in disguise? When darkness seems to win \n We know that pain reminds this heart \n That this is not, this is not our Home It\u2019s not our Home\u2026   Blessings , Laura Story ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOFAaUGfRE"], "link": "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/brandons-faith-story/", "title": "Brandon\u2019s faith story"},
{"date": "May 13, 2013", "body": "Rhema is having a couple medical procedures this week. She is still vomiting. Even after I chopped off all her hair and even after her gastroenterologist put her on reflux medication. So she is scheduled for a fluoroscopy on Tuesday and an endoscopy on Thursday. The fluoroscopy involves Rhema fasting for a period of time and then drinking a contrast material and then getting her GI tract x-rayed. Y\u2019all know my girl, right? I can\u2019t begin to imagine how all  that\u2019s  gonna go, but one thing\u2019s for sure it will be\u2026 hhhmm\u2026 interesting. The endoscopy is considered day surgery and Rhema will be put under general anesthesia. The doctor will take biopsies of her esophagus, stomach and intestines. As soon as we heard she would be put under, Brandon and I got on our phones and starting calling up all of her doctors \u2013 neurologist, pediatrician, dentist, endocrinologist: \u201cHey, doc. If there is anything you ever wanted to do to Rhema, well now\u2019s your chance! She\u2019s getting put under next week!\u201d Yeah, that sounds kind of bad. But seriously. One doc was like, \u201cOh! Get this and that blood test and maybe an MRI and\u2026\u201d Rhema also has to have an EEG soon and I called three times begging someone to agree to put the leads on while she is out, but alas, the sedation will affect the EEG results. So we\u2019ll have to wait to do the EEG until she\u2019s her usual Incredible Hulk self. And the dentist is going to get his shot to look in her mouth and do a cleaning but not until next month \u2013 when she will be put under anesthesia again. Hope was dancing to a song that had these words: My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. ~Psalm 73:26 She asked, \u201cWhat does it mean? \u2018My portion forever.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou know how you get your own plate of food at dinner, your portion? That verse says that God is your portion. And how big is God? Sitting on your plate.\u201d She giggled, stretched her hands as wide as she could, looked up to the sky and spun around. But she knew she could not begin to express his big-ness. But my portion containeth him whom the heavens, and heaven of heavens, can never contain. ~George Swinnock \u201cHe is all for you. And not just for a day. Or a year. Or a hundred years. But forever. He will never run out.\u201d It\u2019s going to be a stressful week \u2013 even though these are \u201csmall\u201d procedures it does something to a mama\u2019s heart to see her baby unconscious and being rolled into an OR. I\u2019m pretty sure my heart and flesh will fail. (It doesn\u2019t take much). But I\u2019m so thankful to know  God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

{"date": "May 21, 2013", "body": "Thank you for the well wishes for Rhema\u2019s tests last week. She was a superstar. She didn\u2019t like skipping breakfast for two days but she went along with it. She obliged us and did the x-rays and even drank a whole cup of barium \u2013 yes, she did! \u2013 (by way of a\u00a05 ml syringe\u2026 it took a long time). But we all have things in life we just will not do. For me, I won\u2019t ever participate in a hot dog eating contest or share my cupcake or bungee jump off the Empire State Building. For Rhema, she will not will not will not lie down on a hospital bed (or examining table). Fuggedaboutit. So that meant we had to get creative, and B and I got to put on scrubs and those cloth hat thingys and go into the OR to help put her to \u201csleep\u201d. We\u2019re still awaiting some test results. One thing was confirmed: the kid is super constipated. She takes Ex-lax  and  Miralax daily and has done so for months. But she\u2019s still constipated, and it may be the biggest reason she\u2019s tossing her cookies all the time. Her gastro said, \u201cHer abdomen is distended, her stomach is not emptying, and she\u2019s just run out of real estate in there. Rhema is one of several patients with autism that I\u2019ve seen with chronic constipation and poor gut motility. I think there\u2019s much for us to learn when it comes to kids with autism and GI issues.\u201d\u00a0 Yep. \u00a0 We did this about 438 times. \u201cI\u2019m a\u00a0macho man.\u201d\u00a0 Just cute.

{"date": "May 24, 2013", "body": "\u00a0 \u201cI gave Rhema some chapstick, and she didn\u2019t eat it! She carefully swiped it across her lips and casually handed it to me like she\u2019s been doing it all her life. I think that girl secretly enjoys seeing my jaw hit the floor.\u201d \u201cHope asked me today how it is possible that she looks like Mommy  and  Daddy when she came out of MOMMY\u2019S belly.\u201d \u201cRhema\u2019s tearing her sheets to shreds at night and eating the pieces. She\u2019s destroyed two sets of sheets already\u2026 and working on the mattress cover. What do we do?\u201d \u201cHow can we motivate Hope to do her best? How do we nurture her fun, full, carefree spirit?\u201d * When the husband and I finally get a chance to talk, the conversations largely center around our little girls and we can go on and on long into the night. There\u2019s always something to laugh about, a story to tell of what Hope said that morning, what Rhema did that day. We have our frustrations and concerns, too. We wonder about the future. We shake our heads, try to figure it out, grad school didn\u2019t have a class on this. Never could we have imagined this struggle, this joy, this all-consuming-ness,  this  parenting journey. One night last year I had a nightmare about one of my girls. I was so upset and shaken by it that I got up and paced in the bathroom, I was afraid to go back to sleep. I told B I\u2019d had a bad dream about one of the children. He didn\u2019t need to know the details, and I couldn\u2019t speak them anyway. He just cried. He understood. Then he got her from her room, still sleeping, put her in bed between us and we held her. Love so much it hurts. I almost asked God why He made us love them so much. That night I remembered a devotional I once read by Charles Spurgeon and I often think of it during our evening talks. Spurgeon was highlighting the story in Mark 9 of a desperate and despairing father who brings his son to Jesus\u2019 disciples for healing. The disciples try, but they are unable to heal the boy. Jesus says, \u201cBring him unto me.\u201d Those four simple words have stayed with me \u2014 good instructions and great comfort to a mother\u2019s heart. When they\u2019re sick, when they\u2019re well, when they\u2019re young and old, graduating kindergarten or graduating high school, when they go out the door, when they come back in, when they sleep, when they rise, day after day, all of this life, I hear Him say,  Bring them to me. Even now, I do.

{"date": "May 30, 2013", "body": "Photo cred:  http://www.fullstopindia.com I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in trying to survive the busy-ness of these weeks. It seems there have been more meetings, end-of-school-year events, doctor appointments than I can keep up with. Work is crazy, my in-laws are visiting, and we\u2019re trying to treasure this time before Brandon deploys. This morning I found myself up\u00a0at 5 am making the\u00a0gluten-free rice krispie treats I promised for Hope\u2019s class. I was standing over a skillet reading  Psalm 23  while waiting for the dairy-free butter to melt when I realized that I forgot to buy the marshmallows for the rice krispie treats. Ugh! I thought,  my cup runneth over . But not exactly in the way the beautiful psalm intended. The Message version of Psalm 23:5 says,  \u201cYou revive my drooping head; my cup brims with blessing.\u201d It\u2019s true, thank God. And how I need Him this morning! . I wanted to re-post an oldie, another time when cups were running over a lot: . (Originally posted on September 1, 2009) If you read this, Mom, sorry for the un-ladylikeness of this post. Rhema has this thing that she does with an open cup of juice or milk. If she\u2019s really thirsty, she\u2019ll carefully take a few sips. And then all of a sudden, she\u2019ll bolt from the table, run to the bathroom as if life depended on it, and dump the contents of her cup into the toilet bowl. Then she\u2019ll calmly return to the table. It was so insanely busy this past weekend that I couldn\u2019t find time to use the bathroom. (Been there?) Rhema seems to require  more  than constant supervision lately, and I\u00a0thought it would be risky to stop and \u201cgo potty.\u201d So I just opted to hold it for as long as I could. By late afternoon, my bladder was ready to betray me. The girls were at the table eating a snack\u00a0and seemed content. Ahhh, my chance?! I ran to the bathroom\u2026 and\u2026 how do you spell r-e-l-i-e-f? I realized that I hadn\u2019t sat down all day. I sighed, wishing I could hide in there forever. I lingered, enjoying a moment to myself\u2026 You know what happens next. The door bursts open, scaring me half to death. Before I can yell or jump, a full cup of  cold  milk is dumped in my bare lap. My black shirt is suddenly\u00a0decorated with milky polka dots. I scream. Rhema is startled. She had expected an empty toilet. This was  not  part of the plan. We stare at each other for a moment\u2026 Then she sprints back into the kitchen, empty cup in hand.
