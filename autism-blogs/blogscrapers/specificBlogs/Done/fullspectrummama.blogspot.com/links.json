{"date": "Tuesday, February 16, 2016", "body": "\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\n\nIn IS IT TOUCHING?,\nI explored how the traditional view of sensitivity is limited --and somewhat\ndiscriminatory toward highly sensitive people and people with sensory\nprocessing differences (SPD). \u00a0I meant to\nput forth the idea that the way we perceive and process things should be recognized\nas a sort of neurological/physical/emotional/temperamental spectrum. Simply\nput, we have widely divergent levels of physical and emotional sensitivity.\nFurthermore, as self-advocates and advocates for our children and loved ones, it\nis up to us to decide whether our sensory (I include emotions as feelings here) processing differences\nare problematic, or glorious, or both, or neither... \n\n\n\nThis post was one\nof my most-read ever, and elicited\nmany responses, both public and private.\n\n\n\nOne interesting\ntheme that emerged from these conversations was that of EXPRESSION. I heard\nfrom people who have incredibly strong sensory and/or emotional feelings \u2013 but\nhardly express them at all. And I heard from people who feel they are \u201call over\nthe place\u201d in a sort of hot mess way and want to calm their actions, reactions\nand attitudes down (here is where some calming sensory activities might come in\nhandy!). I heard from parents with super-sensitive, expressive children whom\nthey are trying to understand...In short, it emerged that what we show (in those actions, reactions, and\nattitudes) is not just an exact reflection of what we feel. \n\n\n\nSo, this month, I\u2019d\nlike to bring your attention to the possibility that sensitivity does not\ncorrelate directly or evenly with expression or external reactivity. Some\npeople develop coping mechanisms to hamper their reactions because of cultural\nor familial pressures. Some are naturally less expressive. Some people stuff\ntheir feelings. Others let it all hang out, sometimes in spades \u2013 intentionally,\nor because they cannot suppress the expression of their reactions. \n\n\n\nAnother\nmanifestation of the sensitivity/expression interplay may be seen in those of\nus with sensory processing differences where certain stimuli that might seem\nminor to others (tags on clothing, bright lights, strong tastes or textures in\nfood, temperature variations...) are interpreted by the brain as major. This may then result, expression-wise, in sensory overload or \u201cacting out\u201d or \u201cshutting\ndown\u201d or...\n\n\n\nAt the extremes,\nyou get people who may appear histrionic \u2013 your drama kings and queens who\nscream when stepping into a puddle of water (guilty) or a person gives them side\neye; or your heartless stoics, who don\u2019t even flinch when a finger is cut off\nor a loved one dies. \n\n\n\nNotably, the\nhistrionics and the stoicism may\nreflect/express SIMILAR levels of sensitivity, exteriorized in different ways. What\nwe are experiencing inside is not always expressed in ways that exactly match\nour inner experience of intensity. People can be low on the sensitivity scale,\nbut high on the expression scale; or they may feel deeply, yet not be\nexpressive of that externally... \n\n\n\nWe may feel or\nexpress less \u2013 the proverbial\n\u201cstone;\u201d we may feel or express more,\nexperiencing or acting explosively, like \u201cfireworks.\u201d These two things \u2013 what\nwe feel and what we show - don\u2019t usually occur in a matchy-matchy fashion. \n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, sensitivity\nitself can be emotional, physical, neurological...; while expression can be\nthrough actions, words, attitudes, moods...AND, as this scale shows, these\nfactors can intersect in a Full Spectrum of ways! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Showing\nChart: Sensitivity and Expression: Stone to Fireworks, Squared\n\n\n\nIn addition, our\nattempts to modulate our expression\nare not always in line with our intentions. \n\n\n\nAs I wrote in IS IT\nTOUCHING?, I am a total sap and literally \u2013 embarrassingly! - \u00a0unable to not cry under a variety of\ncircumstances, from funerals and other clearly sad occasions to anything\ntouching (try this for a tear test),\nsentimental, or even joyous. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand,\nthings that move me powerfully but are hurtful, complicated, or angering can\noverwhelm me and cause me to shut down and seem withdrawn or even cause a\nmeltdown (internally!). And I am just one feeling/expressing person, a fraction\nof my Full Spectrum family. I am still trying to figure out my son, who\nsometimes can appear extremely insensitive as a reaction to sensory overload;\nmy daughter, who seems impervious to all but a very few extremely, tremendously\nsensitive areas; and Pardner, who has the rare gift of being sensitive but\nnon-reactive, observant and caring, yet as steady as can be. But Pardner has\nhis areas of sensitivity, too: do not put your bike up against his car, nor, if\nyou are a child with potential child gore on your hands, or a hairy cat in your\narms, should you \u201ctouch the threads.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, finally, our sensitivities\nand expressions thereof can also vary from experience to experience, with\ndifferent situations being more or less \n\nManageable/controllable, \n\nmoving/touching/intense, \n\nand/or expressed\n\n!\n\n\n\nIn the neurodiverse\nworld, terms like \u201cover-responder\u201d and \u201cunder-responder\u201d get thrown around, as\nif there is a mean level of response that is correct. Add on different ideas\nabout social cues and behavior, reactions that may be judged \u201cinappropriate,\u201d or\n\u201cunexpected\u201d...Whew. I\u2019m looking to expand our perspective on what\u2019s a natural\npart of the range of human being, not criticize people. Human sensitivity and\nexpression weave together in diverse, complex and fascinating ways, in a dynamic\nmatrix represented here by a spectrum from stones to fireworks. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat holds for all\nof us is that we want to be our healthiest selves. We have the privilege and\nresponsibility of figuring out what that means\u00a0- for our children, for ourselves, for our communities.\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop \u2014 a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.

Among many,\nmany, many other outcomes, I was informed that G had scored under the first\npercentile in \u201cIrony.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough we have had\nhim on a strict Monty Python/Austin Powers program for some time, and the kid\nhas a fantastic sense of humor, we realize that perhaps he may well be lacking\nin \u201cIrony.\u201d Like many individuals who don\u2019t fit the typical \u201cnorms\u201d or test\n\u201caverage\u201d in many areas,\u00a0\u00a0 G excels\n(sometimes extraordinarily) in some areas and is less skilled (sometimes\nremarkably so) in others.\n\n\n\nIn my experience, these\nsorts of test results \u2013 lower than expected, very uneven - are actually\n\u201cnormal\u201d for many people on the autism spectrum, people with ADHD, people with sensory\nprocessing differences, people who are neurodivergent and/or disabled and/or\ndifferently-abled and/or quirky and/or don\u2019t care about testing... \n\n\n\nJust once, though,\nI\u2019d like to receive some test results along the following lines:\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Full Spectrum Mama,\n\n\n\nHere are our test results for your accepted-just-as-he-is\nchild.\n\n\n\nG scored in the 70th percentile for \u201cTelling Bad Jokes.\u201d\nAlthough we found that his jokes were generally pretty lame, and noted, significantly,\nthat he was almost always the only one laughing at said jokes, his score was\nslightly lower because he at times did in fact stop telling jokes, especially when asked to \u201cstop repeating that\njoke which we have already heard seven times.\u201d Still, this is a respectable\n\u201cTelling Bad Jokes\u201d score, and something he should feel good about. \n\n\n\nWe noted several areas of growth. G\u2019s \u201cConfidence in the Face\nof a Lot of Really Daunting Obstacles\u201d outcome has improved by 50 percentage\npoints \u2013 to the 88th percentile - since he was last evaluated in his\nformer school where he was getting bullied. Also improved were his ratings in\n\u201cZipping Pants\u201d (up by 20, to 61st percentile), \u201cBlowing Nose Rather\nThan Just Letting Snot Drip Down\u201d (up by 15, to 56th), and \u201cOverall\nExecutive Function\u201d (up by 3, to 4th).\n\n\n\nHis \u201cAmazing Metaphorical/Metaphysical Insights Not\nNecessarily Appreciated by Peers but Mind-Blowing for Adults\u201d score remains\nvery high (92nd percentile), as corroborated by many of his teachers\nin the narrative portion of the evaluation; while the closely-related\n\u201cWillingness to Write It Down According to Assignment, Dangit\u201d score remains\nalarmingly low (5th percentile). \u00a0\n\n\n\nWe would also like to raise some concerns around the fact\nthat G\u2019s \u201cRemembering School Stuff\u201d score of 8th percentile does not\nseem to match his remarkable achievements in the areas of \u201cRemembering How Many\nDays I Have Been Dating ___ \u201c (98th percentile), or \u201cRemembering the\nTiniest Details About Every Pokemon, Ever\u201d (99th percentile) -\u00a0 even with a 10 percent margin of error. \n\n\n\nHis IEP should reflect the need for accommodation in the\nformer area, yet also take into account the possibility that G may have an asymmetrical\nrange of priorities specific to his own...priorities.\n\n\n\nSome of his strongest scores were in \u201cWonderfulness\u201d (85th\npercentile; this score was mitigated by \u201cTeenage Rote Sullenness\u201d [45th]);\n\u201cInterest in Girls\u201d (98th percentile; this test is administered\naccording to self-reported sexual preference and controls for Trying-to-act-like-you-are-not-thinking-about-____-All.The.Time);\nand \u201cThinking About Pokemon\u201d (90th percentile; down nine points from\nprevious score - possibly offset by \u201cInterest in Girls\u201d). \u201cKnowing the Names of\nPixies, David Bowie, Nirvana, and Red Hot Chili Peppers Songs,\u201d at 65th\npercentile, was also solidly above average.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHe should continue to build on these strengths.\n\n\n\nAlthough he scored just above average in \u201cTeenage Boy\nFlatulence\u201d (58th %ile), when measured against the general\npopulation G\u2019s gassiness was easily in the top 10%. \n\n\n\nMost importantly, for being unfailingly kind and polite (even\nthankful!) to our extensive testing staff, and for countless other reasons, G\nscored off the charts (above the 99th %ile!) in \u201cBeing Himself.\u201d \n\n\n\nCongratulations,\n\nThe Testing People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop \u2014 a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.

{"date": "Monday, March 21, 2016", "body": "\nDear Persons,\n\n\nWe only have so much energy in life. In my last post, THE FULL BUCKET, I wrote about what happens when that energy is all used up.\nChoosing your battles is one way to ensure you avoid getting so drained that\nyou are no longer able to function well...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, I will give two simple examples from the Full\nSpectrums: Armpits versus Teeth, and Grades versus Manners.\n\n\n\nChoosing your battles doesn\u2019t mean you abdicate any\ndiscussion of or efforts toward other areas of life \u2013 it just means you reserve\nyour mightiest strength for those areas that seem most deeply important for\nyourself and/or your loved ones. \n\n\n\nHere are two choices I\u2019ve made for us:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. ARMPITS\nVERSUS TEETH\n\nMiddle schoolers stink. Even with deodorant. Especially if\nyou start with the crunchy granola natural stuff. We are on the Old Spice\nUltra-Chem Turbo Level by this point but it only gets applied, shall we say,\nintermittently. You see, my G has very, very little interest in hygiene. So if\nI want to be sure he is doing something hygiene-related, I have to supervise. \n\n\n\nI stopped brushing teeth with G about a year ago, trusting\nthat he would take responsibility for this important matter. We found out the\nhard way last fall \u2013 when he had to go under general anesthesia to have a tooth\npulled -- \u00a0that he was not ready to brush\nhis teeth alone. Now we brush our teeth together again, with him leading. Ten\nbrushes in each spot. This is non-negotiable. \n\n\n\nSure, I ask G to put on deodorant and ask him if he has done\nso...but with my limited time and energy, sometimes deodorant doesn\u2019t happen.\nTooth brushing does. \n\n\n\nAlways.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. GRADES\nVERSUS MANNERS\n\nHow many talks do your children really want to listen to? Z\nis one of those people who is able to excel at anything she cares to excel\nin...So her consistently getting all threes (\u201cmeets grade level expectations\u201d)\non her report card is...unexpected. Sure, I\u2019ve talked with her about this \u2013\nquite a bit. \n\n\n\nBut I reserve my most heated, heartfelt talks for the area\nof what I call \u201creal manners\u201d (i.e. the manners that are about kindness and\nrespect, not the right fork). Because Z has grappled with an attachment\ndisorder since she came home, she\u2019s always had issues with feeling she doesn\u2019t\nhave enough, and with control. These factors come into play frequently when it\ncomes to sharing and treating others with basic respect. \n\n\n\nI know Z is a tough cookie who will always make her way\nsuccessfully in the world, so I don\u2019t lecture too, too much on grades and hard\nwork. But for her to feel good inside -- and for others to feel comfortable around\nher -- she needs to learn to act with \u201creal manners\u201d in heart and mind. This,\nlike tooth brushing, is non-negotiable, so I save my heartiest lectures for\nthis subject. \n\n\n\nBecause I am not at her all the time about certain other\nstuff (grades, etc.), we are both able to be more fully present in this\nimportant, healing arena.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are all works in progress. It matters that we take a\nlittle time to see where our efforts can be most effective \u2013 and to ponder what\nwe most value.\u00a0 This can vary, of course\n-- the key is to take a step back and determine which battle you will choose. \n\n\n\nThe next and final anniversary post will be the most\npopular, putrid\u00a0 post of the year: THE\nCOMPLAINT DEPARTMENT!!!

{"date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2016", "body": "\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\n\nAs I tell my\nstudents, there\u2019s been a shift in the world of philosophy over the last few\ndecades toward context and the particular. Philosophers and ethicists used to\nsearch for \u201cthe one answer;\u201d now they tend to embrace a range of possibility in ethically/philosophically \"appropriate\" responses. Similarly, in\nthe larger world, the presence and testimony of neurodiverse individuals and\nfamilies have made room for a range of what is \u201cnormal,\u201d as well as a diverse array\nof approaches to difference. Since SPD (sensory processing differences) and\nautism are a huge part of my family\u2019s life, I\u2019m curious about these shifts. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a lot in the press lately\naround the immunology and neurology of difference (my favorite article, which happens to be about schizophrenia - by the brilliant Siddhartha Mukherjee - \u00a0is\nhere); I\u2019ve also been seeing a nuanced view of \u201cfixing\u201d people that\nacknowledges the subtle, sometimes tragic losses our \u201cfixing\u201d can cause, along\nwith potential positives (this slayed me [for the record: I was surprised\nthat John Elder Robison chose this treatment, but that\u2019s another post]). \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been asking\nmyself: if context and situation vary so enormously, how could there possibly\nbe one answer to the sorts of questions we navigate when we and/or our loved\none(s) are neurodiverse? Respectful disagreement, while not being super-well modeled by U.S. Politicians, IS possible!\u00a0\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll use the word\n\u201cchange\u201d to represent a range of possibility, from \u201ccure\u201d to \u201cheal\u201d to\n\u201cprogress,\u201d but want to be clear that I stand pretty firmly in the\nacceptance-as-is camp. However, I respect the rights of others to want and\nadvocate for something different than what\nI want and advocate for...! \n\n\n\nWith all the current\nresearch into our immune and neurological systems, both of which are related to\nneurodiversity (as well as other differences), we are faced almost inevitably\nwith the following questions:\n\n\n\nDo you want to\nchange?\nDo you want your child to change?\n\nDoes your child want\nto change? (And, for non-verbal children and adults, how do we determine this?)\n\nOr do you want\nsociety, community, family, institutions, and/or context to change?\n\nOr BOTH?\n\n\n\nWe have limited time\nand energy (sometimes extremely\nlimited!): where will you choose to put your energy?\u00a0\n\nInto yourself? Your\nchild(ren)? Community advocacy? General advocacy? Change? Acceptance? BOTH? \n\n\nThere are limited institutional, state, federal, international, and\nnon-governmental/not-for-profit resources: Where do you think these resources\nshould go?\u00a0\n\nTo funding a search for a cure? A cure for what (autism, SPD, ADHD, difference...?)? Therapies (Physical? Physiological?\nPsychological? Neurological? Immunological?)? Resources to support families? Resources\nfor schools and other institutions? Advocacy for change in the direction of\ninclusion?\n\n\n\n(And...Finally...Do you even have time to\nthink about all this stuff?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Spectrum of \u201cAppropriate\u201d Possible Answers to Each Question\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs I also say in my\nclasses, complex questions may naturally elicit answers that are complex, even\nseemingly contradictory or inconsistent. Our immune systems and our neurologies\nare intricately intertwined with our ways of being ourselves. We have many, many layers in our approaches to and\nfeelings about who we are \u2013 and who we want to be. \n\n\n\nWe all want to be\nhealthy, function at our best, be accepted; yet these things can manifest very\ndifferently, and mean widely different things to different people.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAcceptance\nand change can conflict, coexist, contradict, and/or complement each other...\n\n\n\nThe respect we offer\nindividuals, presuming competence and sharing autonomy, demands that we honor\nthe multifaceted array of possible answers in a multitude of contexts. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop \u2014 a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.\n Click on the links below to read stories from other bloggers about what\n it\u2019s like to have Sensory Processing Disorder and to raise a sensory \nkiddo!\n\n\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_Mukherjee", "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/an-experimental-autism-treatment-cost-me-my-marriage/?_r=0", "http://www.johnrobison.com/", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c3vyEiEkRK0/VzD2QzFSr1I/AAAAAAAABCE/ZmmRjLGHNwE4Y3NaS2gJj7cnawoBYbjNACLcB/s1600/fsmchanges.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nGf79U1im4k/VehX0nqbeCI/AAAAAAAAA1A/eQTbNyIybGs/s1600/sensory%2Bblog%2Bhop%2Bgraphic.jpg", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesensoryspectrum.com%2F&h=IAQHp1Vvs&s=1", "http://www.thejennyevolution.com/sensory-processing-disorder/", "http://www.inlinkz.com/new/view.php?id=625226"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2016/05/ch-ch-ch-ch-changes-neuro-immuno-moment.html", "title": "\nCH-CH-CH-CH-CHANGES: A NEURO-IMMUNO-MOMENT\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 8, 2016", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0I\u2019ve seen a bucket metaphor here and there, used in different ways, across neurodiverse\u00a0\u00a0communities. I recently shared it, in its OVERLOAD/OVERWHELM form (there\u2019s also a form that\u2019s related to goodness, happiness, and loving/kind acts), with Full Spectrum Grandmother, who found it very useful, so I thought I would share it here, too. It\u2019s by no means original with me, but it\u2019s been super-helpful in a variety of contexts.\n\n\n\nWhen your SENSORY (as always, I include emotions and other mental states here as well, as\u00a0feelings) BUCKET is full, you feel on edge, about to spill over.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t take on more (tasks, responsibilities, activities), or even take\u00a0in\u00a0more (information, stimulus, social cues) effectively; in fact,\u00a0more, in just about any form \u2013 even positive \u2013 is\u00a0simply too much.\n\n\n\nI think of my toughest years in graduate school, when I was reading super-dense materials at all times \u2013 and reading trashy mysteries the rest of the time. I didn\u2019t have the brain space for anything more demanding.\n\n\n\nNow that I have a family and work, my bucket is more Full than ever. One of the top bucket fillers is my smartphone! Back in the day, emails and phone calls were limited to very particular times, and texting didn\u2019t even exist. Now we are on \u2013 and presumably accessible -\u00a0\u00a024/7. Dealing with \u201cspecial needs\u201d bureaucracy, family and personal health issues, finances, running a household, and teaching a high needs population at the community college where students face huge challenges every day just to get an education...I know you all have your lists, but that\u2019s mine: what fills, and sometimes \u2013 often -\u00a0overfills, my bucket.\n\n\n\nThis is important: it\u2019s not just hard, bad, or stressful stuff that fills your SENSORY BUCKET \u2013 it\u2019s anything that\u2019s stimulating and absorbs (rather than rebuilds) your energy. This holds especially true for people with SPD (sensory processing differences). For me, these positive, yet absorbing bucket fillers include great times with my children and Pardner, cultural outings, fascinating classroom discussions, travel...\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s genuinely helpful to be aware that my SENSORY BUCKET gets Full, and to have a visual for this concept, because when my bucket is Full I tend to feel hopeless, desperate. I melt down internally, by feeling useless and getting profoundly overwhelmed and unsure how to do the next thing, and the next...\n\n\n\nI know what I need to make room in my bucket: long walks, yoga practice, lengthy bouts of gardening, meditation practice, reading time, creative time, above all, time alone. Oh! And regular (weekly? {monthly?? [yearly???]} massages! Haha.\n\n\n\nBut let\u2019s look at a more realistic scenario: my son G. G tends to shut down when his bucket is Full. This is his own expression of meltdown. He will stop listening, stop getting anything done, retreat. After a very Full day of school and activities, my sensory-sensitive son needs, from what I can see: extended time alone sorting through his Pokemon cards, And\u00a0he gets it. And it really soothes and balances him, makes room in his SENSORY BUCKET for the next day\u2019s interactions and experiences.\n\n\n\nPeople with sensory challenges often need to rest their brains.\u00a0\u00a0We also need to feed our hearts and souls. What do you and/or your loved ones need to create room in your SENSORY BUCKETS? Are there little things you can do, step by step?\n\n\n\nFor example, realizing that every day I would tell myself I would practice yoga at home before school pickup \u201cafter I got everything done,\u201d and that\u00a0every day\u00a0I would never be left with any time to do so, I have just started (on the days when that\u2019s possible) taking a quick walk after school drop-off when I get to wherever I will be for that day -\u00a0before\u00a0I \u201cget everything done.\u201d It\u2019s not yoga, it\u2019s improvised...yet that little bit of self-care makes a bit more room in my bucket so the \u201ceverything\u201d seems more manageable. A week or so of these walks has created enough spaciousness to enable me to write and draw this post \u2013 which would not have been possible last week, trust me!\n\n\n\nWhat can YOU do for yourself and/or your loved one(s)? A breath? A break? A tiny shift or change? Recognizing and acknowledging a Full SENSORY BUCKET is a great first step!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop \u2014 a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.

{"date": "Monday, February 29, 2016", "body": "\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are not as many advocates for attachment disorder\nawareness as there are for the other areas of advocacy I explore, such as\nadoption, autism, and sensory processing differences. For this reason, I regularly\nrevisit this theme for this one-topic anniversary post. \n\n\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve tended in this blog to focus more on\nautism awareness and advocacy because our experiences with attachment disorder\nfeel somehow more private, more inflicted. Attachment disorders cause children\n(and adults) to act in ways that are often unhealthy, even anti-social, all\nbecause of negative childhood or early life situations that did not allow them\nto form healthy attachments, or prematurely severed such connections.\u00a0 Unlike autism and other neurological\ndifferences, typically inborn states that do not fundamentally need to be\n\u201ccured\u201d (I write a great deal on this elsewhere), attachment disorders are a\nsometimes incapacitating psychological condition that can benefit from\nintensive treatment, primarily through therapeutic parenting or work with an\nexperienced therapist. \n\n\n\nI share our Full Spectrum family struggles with my daughter\nZ\u2019s attachment disorder for two reasons. First, because families all or partly\nformed by adoption or fostering may be facing this condition unawares, and may\nbe desperate for help; and, second, because one of the central reasons we are a\nFull spectrum is because my children\nare so divergent \u2013 and this is partly because of Z\u2019s attachment disorder.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI will offer a little background. As you read about my\ndaughter, please do so bearing in mind that her condition was/is not her\n\u201cfault\u201d \u2013 and is therefore nothing to be ashamed of... \n\n\n\nWhen Z came home she was furious - with good reason. She was\nultra-demanding, starving, relentless.\u00a0\nAs she got older she began to steal, hoard, and lie compulsively. She\nbecame controlling - and a master manipulator. Constant power struggles with a\ntiny person were exhausting for the whole family (including Z!). Her tantrums\ncontinued to disrupt almost any environment she found herself in, well into her\nninth year. \n\n\n\nHer acting out was most overt with me, her mother, because\nshe trusted me the most -- and thus needed to constantly test me. Highly\nchallenging attachment-disordered behaviors may well be reserved for the home\nenvironment, or particular individuals, such as a parent or teacher.\n\n\n\nWhile she was small of stature, adorable, and enormously\ncharming \u2013 traits which her therapist pointed out were actually a disadvantage\nto healing, because they masked the ugliness of her behavior \u2013 Z\u2019s behavior\nmuch of the time was destructive in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\n\n\n\nIf you have a child who is exhibiting such behaviors, GET\nHELP. Trust me, you\u2019re going to need to learn to do things very differently than you might expect! For example, many families\nwith children who were adopted attempt to make up for any pain caused by the\nloss and turmoil of the adoption process by being indulgent and extra-doting\nwith their children. Conceding to a child\u2019s every demand, even with loving\nintent, can be a recipe for disaster with a child who has an attachment\ndisorder. Look for a therapist with expertise in this area, and read everything\nyou can find. I\u2019ve talked about some specific strategies here and here and\nhere, as well as below.\n\n\n\nChildren (and adults) with attachment disorders desperately\nneed to feel SAFE. To that end, they try to control the things and people\naround them.\u00a0 It might sound\ncounterintuitive, but \u2013 in a very real way \u2013 such attachment disordered\nbehaviors emerge in a painful search for safe, strong attachments.\nUnfortunately, attachment disordered actions tend to result in forming primarily\nconflict- and need-based relationships, rather than healthy, loving ones. \n\n\n\nTMI? Successful therapeutic parenting in one sentence? Yes:\n\n\n\nCreate an environment with \n\nCLEAR\nand \n\nCONSISTENT\n\nRULES and \n\nBOUNDARIES \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so that\nyour child can feel safe \n\n-- and\nso can channel his or her energy into healing and growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs unknown as they are, attachment disorders are very real.\nThey can be debilitating for families; they are also sometimes almost\ncompletely curable. In our family, many years of consistent therapeutic\nparenting, at times under the care of a therapist who specializes in attachment\ndisorders, have resulted in a child who is light years healthier and happier\nthan she would have been without this specific mode of therapy. \n\n\n\nAs Z heals, her true character \u2013 brave, loyal, funny, quick,\nloving - begins to emerge, unhindered by a condition imposed upon her by chance\nthrough her birth circumstances. She\u2019s\nstrong, in her own words, \u201cTiny on\nthe outside but HUGE on the inside!\u201d She\u2019s a wonderfully practical girl,\nsometimes a bit more blunt than she was raised to be...but these things are\ncharacterological, part of her disposition, not just a result of trauma. In\nfact, we see a myriad of traits, such as being an astute judge of character,\nthat merge positive aspects of her natural self with lessons learned\nfrom living through an attachment disorder. Perhaps best of all, while she\u2019s\nnever going to be the world\u2019s most sentimental person, she\u2019s cuddly in a way I\ncould not have dreamed of even a few years ago. \u00a0\n\n\n\nShe feels safe enough to relax in my arms...versus her previous\ninclination to demand that I carry her around at all times. The wonderfulness\nof this shift cannot be overestimated. \n\n\n\nChildren are terrifically resilient and, like plants, they\njust want to GROW. They just need the right conditions to do so in the\nhealthiest way possible for their unique needs. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2016/02/fourth-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html", "title": "\nFOURTH ANNIVERSARY LISTS II: ATTACHMENT DISORDERS\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 21, 2016", "body": "\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery year, this time of year, I get to indulge in a series\nof posts that use my most beloved mode of thinking and organizing: LISTS. \u00a0The first in the series has always been on\nADVOCACY, a subject central to most everything I believe, ponder, and do, as a\nmother and as a writer.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be heading into both three-year IEP evaluation meetings\nand high school transition meetings in a few weeks. Considering the week I have\njust had, where I \n\n1. noticed on page 27 of a 40 page\nIEP informational packet that G\u2019s services were being cut from 24 hours per\nweek to 11 for this fall when he starts\nhigh school; \n\n2. noticed that G was once again\nfailing several classes and had to engage intensively with him and his teachers\nand paraprofessionals and case manager* to get him back on track, mostly around\nexecutive function matters; and\n\n3. travelled 45 minutes to an away\nbasketball game to watch G play, having attempted a four-tiered system to help\nhim remember his gear (for the record: written list, email, lecture at\nbreakfast, and quiz in car) only to find that he\u2019d forgotten his shorts.**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...this was\na great time for me to review my advocacy lists and get prepared for what\u2019s to\ncome! As my Meeting Friend can attest, this sort of schedule of minor\ndisastrophes is all too typical for we atypicals, so any time can be a good time to sharpen our advocacy skills.\n\n\n\nHere are my previous anniversary posts on advocacy, chock\nfull of tips for success (and some choice \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d) in delightful list form:\n\n\n\nLinks:\n\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html\n\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/01/second-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html\n\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/01/third-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html\n\n\n\nYou can also use the \u201csearch\u201d function at right to find more\nposts pertaining to this important subject. \n\n\n\nSince I\u2019ve been blogging awhile now, I\u2019ve more and more had\nthe privilege of being asked for advice and support from near and far around\nadvocacy. It\u2019s probably the thing I get the most queries and referrals about,\nand I am pretty sure that\u2019s because we all get intimidated as well as confused\nby powerful, sometimes-inflexible, institutional systems that are larger and\nmore complex than us, and full of people who have their own agendas, not to\nmention the need to become well-versed, quickly,\nin completely new subjects...All the while dealing as individuals and/or\nparents with navigating a world that is not always welcoming of difference. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve come up with this handy-dandy three point list to\nsummarize the key aspects of advocacy as I see them, after almost a decade of\nadvocacy:\n\n1. INSIST!\n\n2. PERSIST!\n\n3. EXIST!\n\n\n\n...And now for a little elaboration:\n\n\n\n1. By INSIST, I mean, to go with\nwhat you know is right, whether anti-bullying or pro-services and \u2013adaptations(\u2013accommodations),\nwhether at school, at work, in the larger world...Oftentimes you might not even know what the law or rule or adaptation/accommodation\nor service or policy is...but you know in your heart that you or your child\ndeserves better. Is your or your child\u2019s neurology, sensory profile, or other\ndifference significantly impacting or impacted by your/their school (or work,\nor...) experience? Then something needs to change. Part of this step is finding\nout what can be done \u2013 finding a way\nto make things better \u2013 and then INSISTING upon it. \n\n\n\n2. By PERSIST, I mean: don\u2019t give\nup.\u00a0 Sometimes our efforts at advocacy\nare flat-out exhausting. Sometimes they don\u2019t help us or our children but they\nhelp others down the road (laws, do I have examples of this). If possible, keep\ntrying: sometimes it might just take one more call, or google search, or email\nto another parent or a friend to push things over the line to full or partial\nsuccess. Yes, there are a lot of things working against progress (on both smaller\nand larger scales), but there are good guys out there, and rules and laws that\nare meant to support equality and fairness...we as individuals can make a\ndifference in the creation of and changing of attitudes and laws, too, but it\ntakes time. PERSIST, dear reader, and find these people and these policies (or\nbe/create them!) and let\u2019s level the playing field!\n\n\n\n3. By EXIST, I mean: you are a\nperson! Yes, you! Take care of yourself. I don\u2019t do this. None of us do. But we\nshould. Especially when the world\nneeds MORE from us, and we feel we\u2019ve Nothing left. Sleep. Good, nourishing\nfood. Taking a break sometimes and just reading or going for a walk...Am I\nringing a bell here? \n\n\n\n\n\nLife can sometimes feel like a roller coaster, all the more\nso when you and/or your child has/have atypical learning styles and/or\nneurology and/or abilities. When I contacted G\u2019s case manager* to review his\ngrades from the depths of a reasonable yet debilitating funk, she responded on\nthat subject and then, later, sent me this: \n\nI forgot to write it in my last email but...I have been\nmeaning to let you know how amazing [G] was during his Socratic Circle in\nEnglish class with [teacher]. He related the poem 'Kindness' to his negative\nexperiences in [pre-move, reason-we-moved, elementary] school with bullying and\nwas able to speak to how it made him understand kindness more. He also said\nthat because of this experience he has become a more compassionate person. I\nwas so impressed and moved by his thoughtful input. He was serious and\nthoughtful. It was just wonderful!\n\n...This email kind of made up for the other disastrophes\nthat week, my point being: take joy/comfort/light where you can...you may need\nit! Seeking out and really listening to those who recognize/acknowledge/celebrate\nyour or you loved ones\u2019 real gifts are a part of self-care and feeding of the\nsoul. \n\n\n\nYou know \u2013 roller\ncoaster alert - I had mixed feelings when this (very kind and hard-working)\ncase manager* subsequently told me that \u201c[G] could be in an advanced language\narts class if not for his issues with organization and writing.\u201d I\nmean...what\u2019s not happening for him at school that you are not helping him\nenough with these very issues (learning differences [a.k.a. disabilities \u2013 the\nlanguage we choose is part of advocacy!]) to realize his potential???\nWait...It\u2019s time to advocate...Ciao!\n\n\n\nNext\nAnniversary List: FOURTH ANNIVERSARY LISTS II: ATTACHMENT DISORDERS.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Ok, \u201cCase manager\u201d makes my son sound like a \u201ccase.\u201d Yuck.\nNote to self: another advocacy goal for when things slow down....??\n\n**The fact that G is on the basketball team is a subject for\nat least seven or eight future posts,\nwhich I will likewise write when the proverbial things slow down...\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2016/01/fourth-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html", "title": "\nFOURTH ANNIVERSARY LISTS I: ADVOCACY\n"},

To this casual observer, it emerged\nthat there were basically two types of parents who chose to attend this event.\nBoth sets looked keyed-up, nervous. But one set looked excited, too, whereas\nthe others, my Friendly Face peeps, looked TERRIFIED. We know how hard\ntransitions can be for our kids, both for individual reasons, such as anxiety\naround new things, executive function challenges, and so on, and for\nlarger-scale reasons, such as the inevitable jostling and alienation that come\nwith new social situations and groups. (Guess who\u2019s usually targeted in high\nstress situations? People who are different? Yup.)\n\n\n\nThe future \u00a0AP parents, the ones who indeed legitimately\nsigned the Honors English agreement that was in the million-page high school\ntransition packet \u2013 the Honors English permission form that I\u2019d signed because, why not? Hey, my kid\nis GIFTED, and...um...honorable \u2013 kept asking questions about things like\n\u201cprerequisites for calculus.\u201d The rest of us cringed, kept quiet. Sure, the\nschool administration and teachers seemed welcoming and nice, but we all knew\nour kids might need a slightly different \u2013 probably more extensive - set of guidelines.\n\n\n\nAfter the\npresentation, I felt shellshocked. Team Friendly Face member J came over to me,\ncrying. I felt a migraine descending. We tried to prop each other up. Team\nFriendly Face members K and C reminded themselves and us that our future ninth\ngraders have such a gift for finding the good in every situation. That our\nfears don\u2019t always manifest \u2013 and often go blissfully unshared by our\nchildren...\n\n\n\nThen my shy,\nsometimes uncertain, Team Friendly Face friend J walked up to the Special\nEducation representative and, before my eyes, turned into an articulate,\nassertive Warrior. While I stood mutely by, gazing through narrowed eyes,\ntrying not to sway or vomit (migraines are fun like that), she introduced\nherself (and me), asked some really smart, important questions, and just\nbasically advocated her butt off for her son. I was so proud of her! And a bit\nashamed that I\u2019d just written a whole post on advocacy...But then sometimes we\nneed to lean on others when it gets too much. I was super grateful for those Friendly Faces at this event! I know I will be getting plenty\nof chances to advocate in the next few months and, thanks to J, some of my\nquestions have already been answered.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt was also a comfort to\nknow I could jot down some reflections on this ordeal in my 300-page and\ngrowing Full Spectrum Mama draft file. I publish only a fraction of my writing,\nbut somehow the luxury of writing things down, along with the opportunity to\nprocess this writing provides, and then \u2013 when appropriate, when I have the\ntime to polish the writing, etc. -\u00a0 I am\ngrateful to be able to have a part in the wonderful blogosphere phenomenon of\nletting others know they are not alone.\n\n\n\nThat being said,\nI\u2019ve always seen THE COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT as a place where ANYONE can share\ntheir experiences. I will be publishing a plethora of COMPLAINTS in the\nupcoming yearly post.

We can and should ask those who value our mutual health and\nrelationships or who are charged with our wellness, working conditions, and/or education\n(and/or the education and/or care of our children!), to honor those boundaries.\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally,\nhealthy boundaries also allow us to more abundantly exude and take in all the\ngood stuff. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure II \u2013\u00a0\n\nPerson\nwith Healthy Boundaries Enjoying The Good Stuff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI never knew all this;\nthat\u2019s why I am sharing.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n[EDIT, 1/13: My dear online friend Kmarie \u00a0Audrey posted this deeply thoughtful and interesting post after reading the above:\u00a0\nhttp://worldwecreate.blogspot.com/2016/01/boundaries-christianity-grace-and.html]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop \u2014 a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.

{"date": "Monday, December 21, 2015", "body": "\n\n\u201cYou need to be your teens\u2019 \u2018frontal lobes\u2019 until their brains are fully wired.\u201d\n\n\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI found this quote,\nfrom The Teenage Brain by Frances\nJensen, in an 8/31/15 New Yorker article, \u201cThe Terrible Teens: What\u2019s wrong\nwith them?\u201d by the highly-respected Elizabeth Kolbert (all following quotes are\nfrom this article unless otherwise specified). Kolbert usually writes searing,\ndevastating pieces on global warming and the environment, but apparently she\u2019s\nalso the mother of three teenage sons, and so had a personal interest in this\nsubject as well. Frances Jensen is herself \u201ca mother, an author, and a\nneurologist,\u201d who has two sons who have now graduated from their respective (very good) colleges. We will leave aside\nthe question of how these two mothers are so incredibly accomplished, naturally\ndoing so in a totally unbitter way, and now proceed to discuss how and why something\nis \u201cwrong\u201d with teenage brains.\n\n\n\n...Something is\nwrong with teenage brains. And what that is,\nis: teens are not yet fully-brained. \n\n\n\nThis is news?\n\n\n\nEven Aristotle (~384-322\nBCE) felt that the young are lacking wisdom or even the capacity for reason. In\nhis Nichomachean Ethics, he wrote\nthat youth are so \u201cinexperienced,\u201d and \u201ctend[ing] to follow his [sic] passions\u201d\nthat \u201cstudying [here, reason and philosophy] will be vain and unprofitable.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Kolbert,\nJensen, et al bring the science: Apparently, everything we think of as mature,\nwise, balanced, reasonable, \u201ccivilized, intelligent,\u201d comes from our frontal\nand prefrontal lobes. Since brain development has been determined to start in\nthe rear sections of the brain and move forward, these areas are the very last\nto mature. In fact, according to MIT.edu\u00a0and many other sources, full brain maturity may not occur until far into the\n20s, usually around 25 years of age. The BBC News,\namong others, extends this into the early 30s. \n\n\n\nIn teens, the\nfrontal and prefrontal lobes of the brain are not yet completely integrated or\nconnected with other more impulsive or pleasure-oriented parts of brain, the\nlatter of which are in fullest-ever force\nduring these years. Usually, in full-brainers such as ourselves, the frontal\nand prefrontal lobes will \u201ccheck on impulses originating in other parts of the\nbrain.\u201d For teens, who are still developing those links, checks and balances\nare rare to nonexistent. Since these front bits of the brain are also the seat\nof executive function \u2013 \u201cresponsible for planning, for self-awareness, and for\njudgment\u201d\u2014organization and follow-through are also at a low point. \n\n\n\nNow imagine all of\nthis plus atypical neurological development. In certain ways, aspects of autism\nand other neurodiverse ways of being such as ADHD, may resemble - or partially\noverlap with - or exacerbate! - the typical teenage brain. \n\n\n\nWhat I really,\nreally want to know is: Does this mean my son may actually someday develop some\nsense? I do and will celebrate all of\nhis other quirkinesses and differences, but the sheer dangerousness of his\nunique developmental status in this area, combined with the natural\nteen/20s[/30s] propensity toward rash, foolish, irresponsible behavior, is\nalarming. At some point, he needs - for his own safety and independence - to\nsomehow make, integrate, and strengthen those neural connections.\n\n\n\nIn any case,\nallistic or neurodiverse, teens also quite blatantly lack some of the central\ncapacities we regard as integral to prudent, productive, safe human existence. \n\n\n\nAs solutions,\nJensen and Kolbert recommend the following hi-tech tools:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * \u201cnear constant hectoring,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * \u201cscare tactics:\u201d telling terrible\ncautionary tales at every opportunity, and\n\n* calling other parents to make sure your teens are never alone at their houses, either (representative teen\nquote following this strategy: \u201cWhy even have kids if you are going to do\nthat?\u201d),\n\n...in order to: \n\n* force our kids into faking or parroting some\nmodicum of executive function, responsibility, and do-right, \n\n* supervise teens\u2019 every move, since they are\npersonally incapable of judgment, and, most importantly, to, \n\n* frighten our kids into not doing all the\nstupid things they are naturally prone to doing.\n\n\n\nCount me in: I\nnever thought I would be this kind of parent but, given what I\u2019ve learned and\nexperienced so far, I agree with them on every level. They admit, however \u2013 and I agree with this, too - that not\nonly were/are their teens\u2019 immediate responses \u201cnot always encouraging,\u201d but that\nthere is \u201cno empirical evidence\u201d that any of this works. \n\n\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s\nall we\u2019ve got.

Oh, I don\u2019t mean perfect, but\u2026in the balance\u2026happy.\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, in a very real way it was I who caused the\nunhappiness in my family unit. Perhaps if they\u2019d had the knowledge we now have\naround neurological diversity and Asperger\u2019s syndrome (I know, I know, autism\nspectrum disorders), they\u2019d\u2019ve coped better with my obsessions, my ideas about\njustice and fairness, my literality and hypersensitivity. \n\n\n\nMy teen obsession with King Arthur, Queen Guinevere and the\nLady Morgan le Fay made me think I lived not just with the wrong family but in\nthe wrong era. What I saw as truth, honor and nobility was called \u201cjudgmental\u201d or\n\u201cblack and white thinking.\u201d I informatively let my family know, on the regular,\nwhat I thought of their [normal, neurotypical] values.\n\n\n\nWith more knowledge of differences my family might\u2019ve known\nhow to address my deep feelings of betrayal at the alarmingly wide variety of\nturns of events that felt to me like lies and injustice:\u00a0 if people didn\u2019t do just what they said\nthey would, or bent the truth, or acted unfairly, or didn\u2019t get the right consequences for\nmisbehavior I was devastated. But they didn\u2019t, and we weren\u2019t \u2013 happy. \n\n\n\nWe weren\u2019t a natural match.\n\n\n\nBy now, most of us in my family have figured most of this\nstuff out [Hi mom! Not your fault! Different era!], but as Andrew Solomon shows\nat length in Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for\nIdentity, families with major internal\ndifferences struggle to accept and understand each other. \n\n\n\nWhich brings me to my daughter. I habitually find myself\nthinking as to how we\u2019d be one of those normal (-ish) happy families if only\nZ would just stop acting out. \n\n\n\nHaving been the \u201cproblem\u201d in my family, I never want my\ndaughter to feel that way \u2013 consciously or unconsciously.\u00a0 I am sure she does, though. Here is one\nlittle way I am trying to change that. \n\n\n\n\n\nII. Holding\nhands in the past:\n\n\n\nTypically, we\u2019d be walking along and Z would grab my hand in\nwhat felt like a slightly aggressive way (maybe I\u2019d be holding a bag or\npackage, or have my hands clenched together for warmth, or in my pockets),\nbecause she\u2019d decided she wanted to hold hands - pronto. \n\n\n\nThen I, wanting to be a good therapeutic parent, wanting not\nto be manipulated (because that makes children with reactive attachment\ndisorders feel scared, out of control and obligated to get even more\nmanipulative), would remove my hand from\nhers. \n\n\n\nAfter awhile, I would take her hand back, in an effort to\nshow her both who was in control and that I was happy to hold her hand.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThat was our sad little pattern. It felt pathetic, like I\nwas/we were circumventing \u201cnatural\u201d love and interaction with a series of\ncontrol-related scenes, vignettes of mini-failures of affection.\n\n\n\nWe went along like this nigh on a couple of years \u2018til I\nfinally had a bright idea\u2026\n\n\n\nSolution? Grab her hand first. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet.\n\n\n\nIII. Holding hands now:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe funny thing is, the more loving I am able to act in our\nrelationship --\u00a0 in this case\nessentially via pre-empting Z\u2019s demands -- the more I feel\u2026loving!\n\n\n\nAs with my revolutionary (to me) hand-holding\nparadigm-shift, this loving-revelation might be a real \u201cduh\u201d sort of insight\nfor some, but for this Full Spectrum parent very little is obvious. So much\ninteraction is attributed to what feels instinctive, or comes \u201cnaturally,\u201d yet\nI don\u2019t believe in my heart that such reactions are based merely on genetic\nrelatedness \u2013 or the lack thereof. \n\n\n\nAnd another thing: People often assume I know what the\n\u201cdifference \u201c is between how one feels about a child who was adopted and a\nchild who is biologically ones \u201cown.\u201d*\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t.\n\n\n\nHow can one distinguish between the love one feels for one\u2019s\nchildren except insofar as it relates to that child, that person, as him- or her-self? I love each child with my whole\nheart, as anyone loves anyone they truly love\u2026\n\n\n\nWhat I do know: it\u2019s challenging to parent children with\nautism and children with attachment disorders for very, very different reasons.\nIt definitely makes you feel ALL the\nfeelings. \n\n\n\nAs to the rest, there are only more questions: What if my\nchild who was adopted had autism (somewhat similar to me) and my biological\nchild had an attachment disorder (relatively dissimilar to me)? Would I still\nhave the same reactions - the same instinctive understanding and empathy with\nG\u2019s autism; the same chagrin and desperation around Z\u2019s attachment disorder?\n\n\n\nFor clues, I look at the way people react to each. \n\n\n\nWith G, some children are cruel, or merely \u201ctolerant;\u201d the\noccasional adult is an ignorant so-and-so; mostly, once people get to know him,\nthey see his huge heart and adore him. \n\n\n\nI see that some of Z\u2019s peers are intimidated by her; but\nmost charmable humans are charmed by her and, eventually, yes, adore her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs the major players in Z and G\u2019s lives know, spend a lot of\ntime with either child and you will\nencounter exasperation.\u00a0The more attached Z becomes, the more she may test that connection; and G's listening and focusing skills are \"developing at this time\" (as they say on Vermont report cards).\u00a0Chances are the adoration will continue apace. Plus,\noccasional exasperation with children is\u2026normal, right?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Z would ever be compelled to pluck my\nhand away from what it is busy doing because she wants to hold hands Right!\nThis! Instant! if she\u2019d been in my arms\nfrom birth. It\u2019s taken longer to bond with a daughter who can be aggressive\n(powerful) and manipulative (perceptive), than it did with my son, a helpless\nnewborn in the NICU.\u00a0 What love has\ngrown, though, is profound \u2013 perhaps the more so for being hard-won. \n\n\n\nEvery time I grab Z\u2019s hand first it gives her some extra sugar and gives me hope, and, as\nSolomon says, \u201cHope is the engine of social changes that mitigate disability\nand difference.\u201d ** \n\n\n\nFunny how that works. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Grrr.\n\n\n**\nhttp://www.farfromthetree.com/hope\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qpwiqZkl8uM/UXqskL9NKHI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/XlmJjD3qV2c/s1600/IMG_0176.jpg", "http://www.farfromthetree.com/hope"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/04/holding-hands.html", "title": "\nHolding Hands\n"},

That\nbook is way longer than I remembered - and \u2013 seriously?! - emotionally\ngrueling. As had happened throughout Little\nWomen, but on an even more snot-filled, ugly-crying level, I began to lose\nit as I tried to read those last pages aloud. The closing bit, where Marmee\nsays, even after all the poverty and hardship, and even though her daughter\nBeth died (sorry if I am giving\nanything away here), \u201cOh, my girls, however long you may live, I can never wish\nyou a greater happiness than this!\u201d And she says this simply because they are all together...I can\u2019t even type it without\nsobbing. \n\n\n\nAs I read to her,\nas she often does, Z observed my emotional reaction and asked, \u201cMom, is it\ntouching?\u201d \n\n\n\nHoney, to me, just about\nEVERYTHING is touching. \n\n\n\nYou can just look\nat my red, blotchy, slimy face \u2013 or your brother\u2019s: Yes. It\u2019s touching. When a\nbird lets another bird go ahead of it at the birdfeeder? Touching. Something on\nthe radio about helping people? We will probably at a minimum get misty-eyed. When\nthere\u2019s a video of a baby seal? Touching. Human interest piece in People magazine at the dentist? All\nthose interspecies friendship books? Elderly people holding hands? Yes.\nAnything to do with animals, life, death, romance, family, and so forth is fair\ngame for being touching. \n\n\n\nAt the same time,\non my own, I\u2019ve been dipping into The Highly\nSensitive Person, in which I was *stunned* to read that 42% of people\ndescribe themselves as \u201cnot sensitive at all.\u201d And here I\u2019d always thought\neverybody was just better at managing their feelings and reactions than I was \u2013\nbecause there was something wrong with me.\nSomething weak, or ignorant, or lame; a lack in me which rendered me less adept\nthan the majority of people...People who didn\u2019t seem to cry or laugh quite as\nreadily, people for whom interacting with others, for example, seemed to be\nmuch more clear cut, less laden with strong, overwhelming feelings, and MUCH\nless daunting...\n\n\n\nI\u2019d assumed\neverybody was \u201clike me\u201d and that it was my \u201cfault\u201d for being unable to \u201cmaster\u201d\nmy feelings and reactions. Now I see another healing, liberating spectrum! I\nwouldn\u2019t quite put my Z in the \u201cnot sensitive at all\u201d category, but on a\nsensitivity spectrum we clearly occupy different spaces. And this holds true\nfor her sensory processing as well: she\u2019s impervious to hunger, noise, lack of\nsleep, etc. in a way that\u2019s inconceivable to the SPD-ers* in the family. \n\n\n\nIn Figure I, I\u2019ve\ncharted approximations of our family sensitivity levels relative to one another\n(P=Pardner, Z=my daughter, G=my son, F=me). This is obviously simplifying and\ngeneralizing, but it also clearly indicates a Full Spectrum of sensitivities\njust within one family. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Touching\nChart: From Squishing-Touching to Not Touching\n\n\n\nKnowing that others\nhave different sorts and levels of sensitivity, doesn\u2019t mean we ourselves\nnecessarily should attempt to change our own feelings and reactions \u2013 even if\nwe are able (?). But that knowledge opens our eyes to possibilities of\ndifferent perspectives - and perspective, as I tell my philosophy students, is\nthe key to a lot. It\u2019s marvelous to\nsee how we all shine in different ways. It\u2019s intriguing for me to imagine the\nexperience of not sobbing at the drop of a hat; for Z, learning about things\nthat are \u201ctouching\u201d is inspiring her to find her own tender spots. \n\n\n\nGuess the Full\nSpectrums will keep learning from each other.\n\n\n\nWe just started By the Shores of Silver Lake.

{"date": "Monday, June 10, 2013", "body": "\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy who took several\nyears to learn to ride a bicycle. When the young lad finally gained this\nimportant skill, he was as proud as can be. A year later, he graduated from the\nsmall, low-to-the-ground bike on which he\u2019d learned to ride to a tall bike that\nhad formerly belonged to his mother. As he began to master this grownup bike,\nhe became interested in shifting gears. However, his Mama and her Pardner\nthought it best that the enthusiastic fellow learn, first, to use the brakes\nand steer the ve-hicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the boy dreamed day and night of attaining this\nprestigious skill, he waited unwearyingly until the sharing of the Secret of\nthe Gears would be allowed.\n\n\n\nIt came to pass, before the lesson of the shifting of the\ngears became appropriate, that the young lad went away from home for the first\ntime on a five-day class trip to a wonderful science camp.\u00a0 Upon the morning of departure to this\nfar away land, his little sister refused to play or speak with him. So deep was\nher pain at his leaving, that she found herself unable to even bid her brother\nadieu.\n\n\n\nHowever, shortly after his departure, the girl child was\novercome with the knowledge that she had her family all to herself and, forthwith, began a campaign of demanding, and\nthen basking in, undivided attention and adoration.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMuch fun was had, and many \u201cspecial\u201d outings were undertaken\nas consolation. Among these, the little girl \u2013 who\u2019d learned to ride her\nbicycle in a trice\u2013 was taken on a long bike ride. During this adventure, the\nfamily encountered a mighty hill, and the young lady was in need of assistance.\nAt this time, her noble stepfather inadvertently taught the lass to shift\ngears.\n\n\n\nAlas, how could this have come to pass? For the young lad\nwould be most heartbroken should he learn that his little sister, four years\nyounger and light years more physically adept, had been taught the Secret of\nthe Gears before him. The unfairness of this deed would have, as the parents\nknew full well, filled him with devastation. \n\n\n\nAnd so the parents endeavored to convince the little sister\nof the importance of not telling her brother that she had the Secret of the\nGears without actually asking her to lie to her brother. Many twistings of the\ntongue and brain, such as the classic \u201cWe are not asking you to keep a secret\nfrom your brother and yet we feel that it would be best if you did not bring up\nthis matter\u201d were shared with the young Bike Princess by both elders.\n\n\n\nFinally, the day of the young lad\u2019s return was upon them.\nWith great joy and anticipation, his Mama and sister awaited him at school\npickup. They lovingly loaded his stinking, filthy trunks into the car and sped\nhome for a feast.\n\n\n\nBrother and sister alighted from the car and swiftly\napproached the house empty-handed, apparently anticipating twenty minutes\u2019 \u201cscreen\ntime.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe door, however, was locked, and so they sat upon the deck\nand conversed, while Mama, having alone shouldered the burdensome baggage and\nseveral other items including her capacious mombag, shuffled toward them in an\nungainly fashion. \n\n\n\nSuddenly, great cries of grief and rage were heard from the\nland of the deck, for, during the very first moment alone she had with him, the\nBike Princess had foisted her knowledge of the Secret of the Gears upon her\nbrother. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, some people hear this story and laugh, some shudder or\neven cry. That is what Part II will be\nabout.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/06/shifting-gears-part-i.html", "title": "\nShifting Gears \u2013 Part I\n"},

As we purchased tickets, I remembered\nthat we\u2019d met maybe six or seven years ago and that she\u2019d had a son who at that\ntime was being evaluated for some differences. G hadn\u2019t been diagnosed with\nautism then, but had been tentatively labeled as having a Sensory Processing\nDisorder (SPD). *\n\n\n\nWith G and Z sort of doodling around behind me, I initiated\na brief conversation with this woman: \n\n\n\nMe: \u201c\u201cHi. You\u2019re blah blah, right? Yes, I think we met over\nto the blah blah when our boys were little\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nShe: \u201cThat\u2019s right! How have you been?\u201d\n\n\n\nMe: \u201cGreat, thanks. You? Do you still live on xyz street?\n\n\n\nShe: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nMe: \u201cAnd didn\u2019t you have a son with asperger\u2019s or something\nlike that?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe: \u201cOh, thank god, no!\u201d\n\n\n\nCRINGE. \n\n\n\nI look around immediately, furtively to assess damage. G\u2019s\nback is to me, uncharacteristically still. \n\n\n\nWhat do I do???? \n\n\n\nFirst, I say, helpfully, \u201cWell, I do. Have a son with\nasperger\u2019s. He\u2019s really great!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026Sorry!\u201d\n\n\n\nAwk-ward.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, um, no problem. Really, it\u2019s\u2026great\u2026See ya\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNext on the agenda? Make a list, of course!\n\n\n\nWhy I thank whatever forces in the Universe brought\nme this child who is the best kid (boy division) I have ever known (abridged\nversion)\n\nHe is super-kind\n\nHe always tells the truth\n\nHe is generous\n\nHis attempts at eye-rolling show\njust how little of a real eye-roller he\nis\n\nHe is goodhearted\n\nHe is selfless and has no guile\nwhatsoever\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care what people look\nlike\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care what people have \u2013\nmoney, status, possessions\n\nHe loves his teachers and makes\nthem feel extra-appreciated\n\nHe is a gentle warrior for justice\n\nHe would never intentionally hurt\nany creature, except in self-defense or defense of another \n\nHe loves animals for the whole,\nworthwhile beings they are - with all his big heart\n\nHe always does what he says he is\ngoing to do \n\nHe always has good intentions\n\n\n\nAs they say, \u201cIf you know one person with autism, you know\none person with autism.\u201d But I can safely say that ALL the people I now know\nwith autism \u2013 though they are as different in size, shape and temperament as\nany other bunch -- share these traits. \n\n\n\nWell, some of them may be better at eye-rolling than G. But\nnot much.\n\n\n\nA dear friend recently shared a blog post with me where a\nmother was expressing her anguish about her child\u2019s SPD* diagnosis (http://www.scarymommy.com/somethings-not-right-with-our-boy/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ScaryMommy+%28Scary+Mommy%29)\n. \n\n\n\nSure, anguish is a piece of the autism/difference\npicture\u00a0 \u2013 but for me (and most\nother people I know with autism and parents of children with autism) it\u2019s anguish\nabout how the neurotypical world will treat us/them, NOT about the \u201ccondition\u201d\nitself! \n\n\n\nI\u2019m not saying this discrete anguish is wine and roses, baby\n-- it can get you down. But it is separate \u2013 at least for me \u2013 from feeling that\nsomething is WRONG with my boy\n(or me, or my friends, or their kids\u2026).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFor many of us, getting through the diagnosis and labeling\nmorass, and, dealing with well-meaning and/or thoughtless ignorance are the\ngrueling bit. \n\n\n\nNot the autism.\n\n\n\nAnd so I say unto you, Praise the Universe, YES, I do have a\nchild with autism.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Sensory Processing Disorder is generally related to the\nautism spectrum, although not considered on\nit per se.

I also knew it would do\nexactly zero good to question said individual. Like, have you ever tried to\nconvince a narcissist of something that doesn\u2019t fit their view of reality? Or\ntried to get your Tupperware back from \u2013 oh, wait, you don\u2019t know her\u2026\n\n\n\nZ is the most convincing person you may ever meet. Unless I\nhave 100% conviction to back me up, I don\u2019t even broach any marginal subjects. \n\n\n\nIn fact, I almost took her to have her hearing checked out\nbecause girlfriend is so convincing she doesn\u2019t even hear you if she isn\u2019t tryna hear what you are saying. Over\nthe course of several days her ignoring me and then saying, casually, \u201cOh,\nsorry\u2019 [but being, definitely, not sorry] happened so frequently that I became\nconcerned. Schedule a hearing test? Sure, until I realized she was testing me. Cheeky.\n\n\n\nHad I asked her about my necklace, the conversation would\nhave gone like so:\n\n\n\n\u201cSay, Z, you haven\u2019t seen my special blue sparkly necklace\nhave you\u201d\n\n\n\nWide-eyed: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Possibility that cat has batted necklace behind shelf\nenters mind of mother.] \u201cOkay.\u201d [Result: Daughter knows Mother is not\nomniscient.]\n\n\n\nFor contrast, let\u2019s examine an interaction wherein FSM knows\nthe facts with certainty:\n\n\n\nThe setting is the walk home from school last Friday. \n\n\n\nZ announces, nonchalantly, \u201cMama, Mrs. S said we should tell\nour parents we are supposed to go to pizza night tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d I query, knowing that the event in question is\nentirely optional \u2013 and geared toward the upper elementary classes. \u201cShould I\nspeak with Mrs. S about that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t really say\u2026I\u2019m not sure what she said,\nexactly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDid she say you should go to pizza night?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\n\n\n\nDid she feel like she was telling the truth when she told me\nwhat her teacher said? No. Z admitted she hadn\u2019t been thinking about that\n(truth), just wanting pizza. \n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t want our families to live in a climate of\nsuspicion. This is a struggle when a family member has an attachment disorder!\nI do want to show Z, though, that lying is something that will be discovered\nand is not an effective means of communication. So, in this sort of context\n(grey areas of truth) I only want to ask her questions to which I basically\nknow the answers. I don\u2019t want to teach her that she can successfully fool her\nmother and take things with impunity.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlso, gimme back my necklace!\n\n\n\nAhem.\n\n\n\nNot only was this necklace Most Spectacular, it had been\ngiven to me by Swan Ayi to remind me of her friendship during a thorny time.\nI\u2019d clutched that necklace through a series of \u201cClutch Pearls!\u201d moments, trust\nme. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure I \u2013 Most Spectacular Necklace (circled)\n\n\n\nI searched far and wide. I can find anything at any time.\nBecause my house is soooo clean. Not. \n\n\n\nIt is tiny, though, so there\u2019s not that many places to look.\n\n\n\nOne day my precious necklace suddenly appeared on my\n(locked) closet floor, where it had decidedly not been before \u2013 and precisely where it might have been slipped under the\ndoor by small fingers.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBut, meanwhile, we\u2019d begun a conversation about the\nexistence of \u201cFinding Fairies.\u201d Z\u2019s eleven-year-old brother contends that,\n\u201cfairies aren\u2019t real, except the tooth fairy,\u201d but we gals felt pretty confident\nabout these FFs. \n\n\n\nI decided to do a little experiment.\n\n\n\nZ wrote a note to the FFs about my necklace and how it had\ndisappeared.

I know it is useful in a variety of ways in terms of\naccess and services, and that many do embrace it. Just \u2013 two quibbles: \n\n\n\nFirst, as far as I can see, it is entirely too broad and\ngeneral, encompassing people whose differences are so disparate as to be\nentirely unrelated. People with schizophrenia and people with paralysis. People\nwith Down syndrome, people with Marfan syndrome and people with Asperger\nsyndrome. Tourette\u2019s and wounded vets. Environment. Fate. Genetics.\nIntellectual differences, emotional differences, physical differences\u2026\n\n\n\nHmm. Sounds like\u2026people.\n\n\n\nSecond, the term overlooks a crucial fact: that people with\n\u201cdisabilities\u201d often have extraordinary abilities, some compensatory (the blind using other senses more effectively, for\ninstance), some attendant to the \u201cdisability\u201d (say, \u201csavants\u201d with autism or an\nolympic para athlete), some simply random or hereditary. \n\n\n\nAgain, what does this sound like? People?\n\n\n\nSo, while one could certainly say that a person with\ncerebral palsy is lacking a certain degree of mobility, one could also say that\nthe person who yelled \u201cGo back where you came from!\u201d to my Chinese American\nfriend and daughter when he almost mowed us down with his car was also lacking\nsomething most individuals might hope to share in a best case scenario. \n\n\n\nMatter of fact, I can think of some fifth graders who are\nlacking a modicum of whatever car-slur dude was lacking. \n\n\n\nDear reader, you are probably tired of hearing this, but I\ndo so wish the majority of people shared the exceptional openheartedness and\nkindness of my son, who happens to have autism. That they do not seems to me more of a \u201cdisability\u201d than his. \n\n\n\nI am not suggesting we throw out the useful aspects of\ndisability as a category or identity. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, for general use, isn\u2019t there something better?\n\n\n\nAfter all, we are ALL \u201cdisabled\u201d in the areas in which we\nstruggle, and enabled both by the areas\nin which we flourish and by those aspects of our individual being\nthat our cultural and social environments generally support. We all more or\nless successfully make all sorts of accommodations for differences and \u201cspecial\nneeds\u201d (our own, and those of others). We blunder through all sorts of\nill-fitting situations.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2016", "body": "\n\nArticles and blog\nposts on the early signs of SPD (sensory processing disorder, which I call\nsensory processing differences) and autism\nfill me with a mixture of recognition (yes, much is familiar), trepidation (at\nthis point I\u2019ve reached a certain level of saturation and also seen many\nstereotypes and errors), annoyance (ditto, plus the occasional offensive or\ncondescending bits can set me back for days), and, sometimes, gratitude (after\nall, some of this stuff could be very helpful to parents \u2013 and most writers\nmean well!).\n\n\n\nI usually find that\nI am holding my breath as I read, waiting for the triggers...yet I am compelled\nto read, always hoping to learn more about our neurodiverse world.\n\n\n\nMy son G was\ndiagnosed with SPD at three, autism at eight. Being a bit spectrumesque myself,\nI would never have thought there was anything about him that needed to be\nevaluated (his evaluations were always at the behest of his teachers) but in\nretrospect a few things stand out. \n\n\n\nMy earliest memory\nof being aware of G\u2019s possible difference from his \u201cnormal\u201d peers occurred in\nan infant massage class. We mothers \u2013 this was in the East Village, in New York\nCity, but yup, all mothers \u2013 were told to sit in a circle. I don\u2019t remember\nprecisely how old the babies were \u2013 early parenthood is kind of a blur \u2013 but\nthey were all quite young, a few months old at most. We had pads and brought\nblankets and placed our babies on their backs on those blankets. We were given\ndiagrams of massage strokes and instructed in proper technique for stroking and\nsoothing our babies. \n\n\n\nInfant massage was\nmeant to be a bonding exercise. To stimulate our babies\u2019 brains and help with\ntheir digestion! To make them happy! Healthy! \n\n\n\nExcept - my baby\ndidn\u2019t seem to be with the program. While all the other babies enjoyed a free\nand loving massage \u2013 yeah, try getting that\na few decades down the line, babies! - my darling G was having none of it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Infant\nMassage Class. Not Shown: Ashamed Mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as I tried\nto massage him, heck, as soon as I lay him down on his back, the screaming\nwould start. Sure, there was the occasional peep from another baby, but nothing\nlike G\u2019s agonized cries. I actually tried three sessions before giving up in\ndespair. \n\n\n\nClearly, I was missing\nsome important mothering skills. I blamed myself, of course. \n\n\n\nWhen G was a baby,\nI thought of myself as someone who accepted all people, someone who would never\ndiscriminate on the basis of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation...Someone\nwho accepted and loved people of all sorts. Yet I knew little to nothing about\nneurodiversity! \n\n\n\nIt would have been\nhelpful to me as a new mother to have a positive concept of other kinds of difference,\nan idea of the incredibly wide ranges of neurology, physiology, psychology,\nsensitivity, sensory processing etc. that make up human beings. Obviously, this\nwould not have led to shifting blame to my baby! It just would have made things\nmake sense. \n\n\n\nIt would have\nhelped to know that my baby needed deep pressure, not fluttery strokes that probably\nfelt like torture to him. It might have been best to keep him partly or fully\nwrapped so that he could locate his body safely in space, instead of flailing\naround. He never liked being moved; there might have been better ways to\ntransition him.\n\n\n\nInstead, all I knew\n- in that context, with the limited knowledge I had \u2013 was that something seemed\nwrong. Since I myself had also always\nbeen \u201cdifferent,\u201d this initially added to my disorientation and self-blame. \n\n\n\nThese moments keep\ncoming, but now they come cushioned with fundamental commitments to diversity,\nacceptance, and hope. \n\n\n\nWhen you and/or\nyour child live(s) with an invisible, complex difference, explanations and\nstrategies can be elusive and imprecise. I still sometimes don\u2019t know whether\nmy child needs help; and when he does need help I don\u2019t always know how to help\nhim. Sometimes I try to help him in unhelpful, unwanted or unnecessary ways, as\ndo others. Other times we miss the boat and G is on his own with his challenges\nwhen some wisdom or support is sorely needed. \n\n\n\nWhen G was\nscreaming in the otherwise serene and harmonious infant massage space, I knew\nhe was deeply uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t know that he had SPD, or that he was\nautistic, and that his sensitivities would benefit from a very different\napproach. Parents who recognize their children in \u201cearly signs\u201d lists will I\nhope have important tools at their disposal, not least the knowledge that all\nparties concerned are doing their best \u2013 and that that is just fine. For the\nFull Spectrums, the labels that apply to us are mostly useful in that regard.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s still so\nmuch I don\u2019t know, but I do know our differences are not our \u201cfault.\u201d I know\nthat what is \u201cwrong\u201d is not us but a\nworld that is primarily designed for the \u201caverage,\u201d \u201cnormal\u201d person \u2013 whoever\nthat is. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI know that I accept and\ncelebrate G exactly as he is.\u00a0\u00a0Same for me.

{"date": "Friday, July 13, 2012", "body": "\n\nAh, summer: that special time when school is out and those of us who are primary caregivers to young children and who either cannot afford to send them to camp all summer or choose not to (or both) find ourselves faced with long days full of endless possibilities of a nonetheless limited sort. The luxury of choosing to be at home with the children during the summer is not one I have during the school year, and its result for now is a piquant combination of gratitude and exhaustion.\n\nThe other morning, Pardner was about to leave the house for a fourteen-hour day that would start at the farmers\u2019 market and end with restaurant cleanup. He asked me what my plans for the day were.\n\nI pictured the day ahead of us \u2013 a minefield of possible tantrums and stomach upsets for starters, the dull hours of the \u201cI have nothing to do\u201d chorus, the sweet and cherished snuggles, unexpected giggles and opportunities (responsibilities) to create memories of a carefree, wonderful childhood.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll probably head to the farmers\u2019 market later and we do have some parties to go to...\u201d I ventured.\n\n\u201cMust be nice,\u201d he chuckled.\n\n\u201cWell, if you must know, I might like to do some writing for my much-neglected blog or tackle my course prep or practice yoga or take a nice long run or even sit in the hammock and read a book while eating bonbons today but those things are not among my options,\u201d I retorted, somewhat defensively\u2026\n\nAt said farmers\u2019 market I ran into a girlfriend who was there with her \u201csurprise\u201d child \u2013 conceived while she was on birth control in her early forties and her two daughters were in their early tweens and her life had begun to free up. I told her about the above exchange and she laughed heartily, resignedly, only slightly bitterly\u2026\n\nSome school-less days, we spend the whole day looking forward to that treasured half hour after the kids are in bed, that bit of time we have to ourselves before we pass out. In summertime, official bedtimes stretch out -- for us, 7 and 8pm become 9 and 10 and later.\n\nAnd then sometimes, as soon as they are in bed, we miss them! Right?\n\nThat said, here\u2019s what I currently am able to offer, given my summery circumstances: a petite follow-up spectrum to selected past posts:\n\n\n\u201cTommy\u201d (from \u201cWould you rather\u2026I\u201d)\nI found out that I was right: Tommy\u2019s elderly mother did pass away and he did have to move. However, he didn\u2019t have to go too far: he was taken in by his Aunt, who lives closer to the center of our small town. He has brothers who are very devoted to him in the neighborhood to boot! He now strolls happily with his walking stick around the town square, which has been called one of the most lovely in New England.\n\n\n\n\nFigure I: The Empty House up the street, which was Tommy\u2019s home. It is no longer quite so sad to see.\n\nTripping/Boundaries (Toilets)/Diet/Diarrhea\n\nWe have been gluten and casein free for over a month.\n\n\n\nThose of us with weak stomachs still have \u2018em \u2013 G\u2019s is about the same and mine is noticeably worse. Migraines? Worse. Red mask-like skin? Worse. Reflux? \u00a0Worse.\n\nCompensatory eating has also become a factor, insofar as we resent not eating certain foods and those substitute items we do eat are generally awful (so naturally we need to eat more of them).\n\n\nI understand, though, that this process can take at least three months, so we are sticking with it for now. As for the fake-gluten and fake-dairy items- avast ye terrible products (with a few notable exceptions, such as GLOW cookies). I wager it\u2019s time to focus entirely on whole foods, not wheat/dairy replacements. \u00a0I also wager we ultimately will end up moving toward a diet much lower in wheat and dairy, much as we did with soy after Mothering magazine published a damning article about soy in 2004 (and we realized we were eating 6-8 servings a day of soy!).*\n\nIt being summer, we have ventured a few perhaps ill-advised jaunts to visit the ocean and family. Restaurants are pretty much out of the question since the only vegetarian item ever available for kids seems to be macaroni and cheese. Mac and cheese seems to hold great desirability and nostalgia for G in particular: \u201cRemember when we used to eat maccy?\u201d he recently asked with a tear, subsequently admitting that our \u201cadventure\u201d with this GFCF diet has been \u201creally, really hard.\u201d I wondered aloud if Z felt the same, and was met with a sheepish, sad nod. That kind of suffering seems hard to justify without any surety around whether a GFCF diet is a solution for us; still, we will go the three-plus months needed for a clear indication.\n\nI used to feel sorry for servers who have to deal with \u201cpicky\u201d people at their tables. Now my feelings are more mixed, knowing, as I do, how hard it is for families with possible intolerances who are trying to have a rare treat: a nice, non-depressing meal out with their kids.\n\nIf, for instance, after close perusal we find that the only vegetarian, gluten free, casein free item on a menu is a frittata with potato crust and then are told, \u201cOh no, we don\u2019t have that today, we only have the bacon-cheddar quiche,\u201d are we, Full spectrum Mama, justified in going into a fugue state?\n\nAlso, we are coping with G\u2019s anxiety around driving anywhere further away than 20 minutes. I don\u2019t want car travel to become a phobia for him, so we have a policy now of stopping as often as he even suspects he might need to go. Two hour trips can turn quickly to four, but then again he only needed to stop twice en route to Cleveland (ten hours). Go figure. I cannot decipher if there is any correlation with any particular types of the limited foods we are still eating.\n\nThe other day I was reading The Autism Revolution (not entirely uncritically) during my lunch and I found out that several factors in G\u2019s life -- including birth by C-section, being gestated by a mother with an autoimmune disorder and antibiotic use during the first month of his life (in the NICU) -- may be affiliated with compromised immunity, increased inflammation and allergies, and, finally, autism.\n\nA few minutes later I checked my email and my beloved cousin, Loon, had sent me a link to \u201cTending the Body\u2019s Microbial Garden,\u201d by Carl Zimmer\n(http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/science/studies-of-human-microbiome-yield-new-insights.html?_r=1&emc=eta1), which basically makes very similar points. For instance, Zimmer describes how vaginal chemistry changes during pregnancy so that when babies pass through the birth canal they are coated with and ingest Lactobacillus johnsonii, thereby promoting a healthy immune system through the skin and facilitating digestion. Babies born by C-section do not receive these benefits. While we may take some steps to improve the health and population of gut bugs, baseline gut health is set to some degree during the first month of life.\n\nI resolved to learn more about which foods and supplements might be at least somewhat helpful, and to at least try to reset our baselines! Zimmer\u2019s article, however, questions the efficacy of currently available probiotics and discusses the emerging field of fecal transplants as an increasingly accepted procedure in the medical field. \n\nSo I was telling Pardner about all this reading\u2026and he began to look increasingly uncomfortable. As it began to dawn on me that he apparently suspected I might be contemplating something rather \u201cout there,\u201d I decided to take this very concept \u2013 which, actually, up to that moment, had not occurred to me -- and roll with it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure II: Horror, dread, incredulousness: Pardner, at the very moment I suggested he place some of his excrement in capsules for G and me to use as suppositories in a sort of \u201cat-home fecal transplant,\u201d since, \u201cafter all, I am a doctor!\u201d **\n\n\u201cYou need help!\u201d/ I need help!\n\nI am raring at the bit to try out my handy new phrase, \u201cI need to find a way to get us out of this trap,\u201d which was offered by a dear friend in response to my overuse of \u201cYou need help.\u201d Of course, Z has chosen the last few weeks to be a shining beacon of peace with sporadic detours into insta-mega-tantrums far too shattering to bow in the face of gentle words. It\u2019s as if she can sense when I feel I have our situation somewhat under control and is able, however briefly and incompletely, to relax and/or sidestep my handy new tools. Smartypants.\n\n\nBike Riding\nIt is with profound ambivalence that I share with you the news that G is now at long last able to ride his bike. He himself is jubilant and wants to go faster and faster!\n\nHowever, the question remains as to whether or not he should ride a bike. That is, he is able to balance and peddle, yes. Other stuff, like stopping the bike, turning, riding on the proper side of the road and listening for cars remains elusive.\n\nPaying Attention\nYesterday, G said, \u201cWhen you said that it sounded like you were upset.\u201d What was wrong? Nothing! We-e-ell, maybe I was being simultaneously talked-at by two small persons, but otherwise I was FINE. \n\nSo he picked up on that tiny bit of irritation? Amazing, especially for what may have been the first time he has ever noticed such a thing. \u00a0Oh, happy (not even slightly persnickety) summer day!\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n* I couldn\u2019t find the article, \"The Whole Soy Story, The Dark Side of America's Favorite Health Food,\" by Kaayla T.

{"date": "Saturday, June 30, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nAnother way to approach my Full Spectrum household is\nthrough a lens of boundaries: Z habitually smashes them, while G is often\nunaware of them. Until recently, when he told me it hurts his feelings and\nembarrasses him, I would publicly joke (say, when he hugged someone he\u2019d never\nmet) that G\u2019s superhero name was \u201cNo Boundaries Man.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe issue of bathrooms is just one example of this\nphenomenon. Now that G is older (and he\u2019s very tall, so he seems even older\nthan he is) I can\u2019t take him into the Women\u2019s Room any more. This is\nanxiety-provoking. I offer the following four justifications for why this is\nso:\n\n\n\n1. Because G is so friendly, he will strike up a\nconversation with just about anyone. Anywhere.\u00a0 After a few too many overheard bathroom conversations, and\nseveral attempts to gently explain how\ninappropriate that was, and dangerous, I told him explicitly and in strong\nterms not to talk to anyone in the bathroom.\u00a0 Period. \n\n\n\nAfter taking Z to the bathroom the other day, we were\nwaiting for G outside the Men\u2019s Room for a few minutes.\n\n\n\n\u201cG?\u201d I called. No answer.\n\n\n\nIncreasingly frantic, I called him several more times.\n\n\n\nJust as I was about to barge into the Men\u2019s Room, G emerged.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mama?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou told me not to\ntalk to anyone in the bathroom.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. Same scenario, but this time G\ngets out of the bathroom first.\u00a0\nFrom inside the Women\u2019s Room I hear him striking up conversations with,\nbasically, any man who is coming out of the Men\u2019s Room.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello, my name is [full name]\u201d he chirps, over and over.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t talk to people outside of the bathroom either,\u201d I say, having rushed Z\u2019s\nhand-washing to forestall the next greeting. \n\n\n\n\u201cBut I made a friend,\u201d he protests. \u201cHe seems like he might\nhave been a little weird when she was a kid. Maybe she was made fun of too. In\nthe past.\u201d*\n\n\n\nScore: one for making difference seem like a prestigious\nclub; zero for safety. \n\n\n\n3. En route to Grandmother\u2019s G\nannounces that we need to make an emergency stop. I manage to exit and pull\ninto a gas station in record time. Z is asleep. Since I have parked right in\nfront of the entrance, I allow him to run in by himself. Relieved over having\nmade it to a bathroom in time, it takes me a few minutes to notice that we are\nin a really sketchy area. I watch a spectrum of shady characters entering and\nexiting the building with mounting dread. I decide to wake up Z, but she is in\na deep sleep so I grab her and carry her inside. We make our way to the hallway\nand to the bathroom door\u2026which is wide open.\n\n\n\n\nThere sits G on the toilet, pants around his ankles, jacket\non the filthy floor, chin resting in his hand like a small, live, No Boundaries\nMan \u201cthinker.\u201d \n\n\n\n4. A few days before school ended,\nthe hallway bathroom lights, which are on an automatic timer, went off while G\nwas sitting on the toilet. He began screaming in terror and by the time someone\nheard him and turned on the light he was in a full-on panic attack. He was\nstill red and on the constant verge of tears when I came to pick him up. \n\n\n\nThe two problems I was later able to glean from him were as\nfollows: First, he knew he was in a stall, but didn\u2019t have a mental picture of\nthe space he was in or how to get out \u201cin the pitch dark;\u201d second, perhaps more\nimportantly, he \u201cwas not done wiping [his] butt.\u201d \n\n\n\nThis, in fact, was a sign of progress: the wipe/flush/wash\nhands trifecta has been a challenging one for G, with at least two out of three\ntypically forgotten.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then we have Z. Unlike G, Z is exceedingly aware of\nboundaries. She tends to see boundaries, however, as mere niceties that do not\napply to her. This, too, raises safety issues. And bathroom issues. For\nexample, we have to monitor Z\u2019s bathroom visits at home after her consumption\nof a few too many bottles of skin and hair products. \n\n\n\nOutside of the bathroom, Z\u2019s iconoclastic confidence is an\ninvaluable tool in achieving sovereignty. Once, she told her teacher she had to\ngo use the microwave, marched into the fourth grade classroom, placed her food\nin the microwave and turned it on to fry her Tupperware and food to a melty,\nsmoking crisp.\u00a0 Curiously, no one\nthought to question her actions once she\u2019d assured them she \u201cknew what she was\ndoing.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe pushes boundaries with words as well. We were at a plant\nshow in a greenhouse with my extended family when I heard her tell her 4-year\nold cousin, \u201cIt\u2019s so f___kin\u2019 hot!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d I gasped. \n\n\n\nZ looked me right in the eyes, and said, \u201cI said it\u2019s so\nfreakin\u2019 hot, Mama.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnd Z looooves her Papa (my Pardner)\u2026Maybe a bit too much. \n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m gonna marry Papa,\" she once informed me. \n\n\n\n\"No, honey, I am married to Papa,\" I said.\n\"You're his stepdaughter and that\u2019s a different relationship that is just\nas wonderful. You'll always be together like that.\" \n\n\n\nShe stared at me like I was a fool. \"When you're\ndead,\" was her nonchalant response. \n\n\n\nAnother time, Pardner was in the bathroom when Z began a\nworld-class tantrum in line at the basement food court in Grand Central\nStation. Upon his return, Pardner thought Z had been injured and swept her up\ninto his arms and away from the others in line, asking with sincere concern,\n\u201cWhat happened, sugar dumplin\u2019?\u201d As he walked away, she paused in her screams\nlong enough to request -- from this apparent new ally -- \u201cCould you poop on\nMama\u2019s head?\u201d\n\n\n\nZ has such a deep, scurvy, belly-chuckle of a laugh that it\nsometimes seems she understands just how funny her transgressions can be. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, both children represent a Full Spectrum of relentlessness when it comes to boundaries. Whether because of\nwillfulness or cluelessness, in both of their lives so far boundaries are\nneither perceived nor approached/avoided as society expects.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, speaking of toilets, and boundaries, when I\nmyself am on the toilet BOTH children often deem it a great time to talk to\nme.\u00a0 I\u2019m not talking about after\nI\u2019ve been lounging for ten minutes \u2013 I mean right away. They enjoy \u201ckeeping me company\u201d and sharing\nimportant information, such as keeping me abreast of all current cat locations.\nRecent urgent, through-the-door inquiries \u2013 from both children at once --\ninclude, \u201cHow do you spell my name backwards?\u201d \u201cHow do you say my name\nbackwards?\u201d \u201cHow do you say your name backwards?\u201d and \u201cHow do you spell\nyour name backwards?\u201d \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nLluf Murtceps Amam\n\n\n\n* Re: s/he: Yes, G does sometimes struggle with pronouns,\nbut in this case the individual in question was transgendered and the fact that\nG was so casual about this gave me hope for the world!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Re: \u201cIn\nthe past:\u201d I also am so glad that G believes me when I tell him that grownups are\nless cruel than children and that many people who struggle with being accepted\nin childhood and adolescence fit in fine as adults because stuff like being\ncool no longer matters.

The range of regimens that has been suggested to me\nis a veritable rainbow, including:\n\nThe GFCF\u00a0 Diet -\ngluten-free, casein free \n\nThe Elimination Diet \u2013 for allergies\n\nThe \u201cForks over Knives\u201d Diet \u2013 plant-based\n\nThe GAPS (gut and psychology syndrome) Diet \u2013 whole foods,\nno grains, lots of meat\n\nThe Paleo Diet \u2013 eat like our ancestors\u2026lots of meat\n\nThe Anti-Inflammation Diet \u2013 no gluten, no nightshades, no\nsugar\n\nAlso, The Body Ecology Diet, The Specific Carbohydrates Diet\n(SCD), The McDougall Diet\u2026even The Jenny McCarthy Diet\u2026\n\n\n\nI appreciate the good intentions behind these suggestions\nand I am grateful.\u00a0 It is not the\nrecommendations that bother me; it is, quite simply, not knowing who\u2019s correct!\nSurfing the internet is no help. Some claims around diet reek of pseudoscience,\nsome are blatantly commercial, most seem genuine and sincere. Each\ncontradictory mandate has scientific backup and heartfelt endorsements. \n\n\n\nBarring any clear consensus, we try to live by Michael\nPollan\u2019s simple edict:\n\n\u201cEat Food.\n\nNot too much.\n\nMostly Plants.\u201d\n\n\n\nRather like\u2026The Mediterranean Diet.\n\n\n\nWe eat mostly whole foods, follow a vegetarian lifestyle and\nyet do not eschew the occasional pint of Ben and Jerry\u2019s (in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of Vermont that might well be unpatriotic!). This works for us, for\nthe most part.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, we are gearing up for a full-on trial of a\ncombined GFCF/anti-inflammation diet. I am taking a few months to read about\nthese, and combine them. I want to figure out what, if any, supplementation we\nwill utilize; so far we are looking at probiotics and vegan DHA and Omega 3\u2019s.\nI also need time to process what the diets will entail and to get ready for\nwhat looks like major sacrifices in an already-tweaked diet scenario. Our\nspectrum comes complete with a variety of neurological and emotional\ndifferences and, as vegetarians, we already don\u2019t eat the way most people do. I\nam reluctant to add yet another layer of difference!\n\n\n\nOh, and I want to make this shift in such a way that the\nkids don\u2019t notice too much, or feel deprived, and yet know enough to graciously\nturn down food that\u2019s not included in this \u201cadventure.\u201d* I want to truly make\nit an \u201cadventure,\u201d tastewise, but a lot of the gluten-free products are\nultra-refined and some have a sandy texture, while the vegan products are often\nmade of isolated or hydrolyzed (huh?) soy protein. I think I can do this for\nthe three to four months I hear it takes to see a difference; facing a longer\nspan feels daunting. \n\n\n\nAs well, I wonder if these dietary changes will \u201cwork\u201d \u2013 and\nwhat that would even mean: I don\u2019t think there is anything about G that needs\nto be fixed! So why start a \u201ctreatment?\u201d Will I become one of \u201cthose\u201d people?\nYou know, the ones who drive restaurant workers crazy? For nothing? Is this a\nsuper bougie bougie project or profoundly worthwhile? \n\n\n\nIn addition to the conflicting reports on diets and autism,\nI am confused by findings that genetics may play a much larger role in autism\nthan previously surmised. The suggestion that diet can \u201ccure\u201d autism was\npotentially belied by a recent New York Times front-page story about research\ninto genetic links with autism (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/health/research/scientists-link-rare-gene-mutations-to-heightened-risk-of-autism.html).\u00a0 With advances in genetic testing and\nanalysis, the prevalence of genetic links with autism is expected to increase\nexponentially from this juncture.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nStill, environmental and other factors (such as diet) can\nstrongly influence the real-world expression of our genetic blueprints.\u00a0 The study of epigenetics may ultimately\nshow that dietary changes correlate strongly with autism \u2013 or not. \n\n\n\nI applaud all families and individuals who make positive\nchanges in diet that lead to improved health on any level. And I know from\npersonal experience that some of the sensitivities that tend to accompany those\non the autism spectrum and those close to it (such as those with sensory\nprocessing differences) can be mitigated by changes in internal (eating,\ndrinking, tasting) or external (seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling) exposure. \n\n\n\nG and I do have some severe chemical and sensory\nsensitivities. G gags and gets reflux from many foods. He is highly sensitive\nto certain sounds, types of touch and tastes. For me, it is more about smells\nand visuals. I will get an aura then an excruciating vomiting migraine after\nwalking down a cleaning-product aisle or smelling certain scented lotions. There\nare times when I need to walk with my eyes mostly closed, under certain\nlighting conditions or when there is too much going on visually. G sometimes\nmakes tubes out of his fingers to look through, so as to limit visual input to\na manageable and intriguing subsection. \n\n\n\nWe both have bumpy skin on our arms and legs, which, I have\nrecently learned from \u201cThe Autism Revolution,\u201d may be a sign of Essential Fatty\nAcid deficiency. On the other hand, some sources claim these bumps are due to\nfood or environmental allergies. \n\n\n\nIt is, literally, a lot to take in.\n\n\n\nIf I could wave a magic food item and change something, what\nwould that something be? Would I make us not always tell the truth and be upset\nwhen others, by our lights, don\u2019t? NO!\u00a0\nWould I make us suddenly able to cold-bloodedly navigate what we both\nview as brutal social scenes? NO! Would I make us see the world just like\nneurotypical people do? NO!\u00a0\n(Everybody sees the world a little differently anyway!) \n\n\n\nI would sooner change the rest of the world than some of\nthese qualia. Nevertheless, would it be nice for both G and I to be more\nflexible, more interpersonally perceptive, less obsessive? Perhaps. But what if\nwe went too far in the other direction and were then overly flexible,\nsocial-climbing dilettantes? I\u2019ve always admired Aristotle\u2019s Doctrine of the\nMean, which posits a lack and an excess for every virtue** -- and counsels us\nto find the middle ground. A whole system approach to balance might enhance\nweak skills (lacks) while retaining strong ones (those that are \u201cjust right\u201d).\nBut just how might diet per se do that, exactly? \n\n\n\nHere are some relevant lacks and excesses:\n\n\n\nVirtue: focus: Would it be easier if G could get from his\nbed to his clothes in the morning without being distracted by every interesting\nitem en route (Lego? Floor board? Cat hair? Sure!)? Maybe. But what if one day,\nduring that process, he discovered the secret to nuclear fusion or the alchemy\nof waste to water?\n\n\n\nVirtue: moderation: What if I got \u201ccured\u201d and stopped making\nmy lists? I love my lists! I got my\nlists from my sensory-challenged\nMama! Or what if G stopped loving pokemon and heavy metal and started liking Jack Johnson and weapons and cars? \n\n\n\nVirtue: wisdom: As a dear friend said, \u201cYou can\u2019t and don\u2019t\nwant to change who you are, you just want to do whatever you can to remove the\nbullshi+ that keeps your true essences from shining.\u201d In Yoga philosophy, that\nbullshi+ is the only true ignorance, and is called Avidya (literally,\nnot-knowing). Of course I want G to be comfortable in the world, his best and\nwhole self. When we are overwhelmed by sensory processing differences and their\nrepercussions, we miss a lot. There are things we do not, then, know. But who\nis to say there are not things we know that others do not?\n\n\n\nVirtues: acceptance, empathy: The fundamental question seems\nto be: should we medicate our differences? Cleaning off the gook that hides our\ntrue Selves from ourselves a la Yoga philosophy is one thing (and many\nsensitivities that cause overload and impede processing may be \u201cgook\u201d in this\nmodel), but trying to squeeze everyone into one neuro-psychological paradigm is\nanother. Who defines this difference? Do we each decide for ourselves?\n\n\n\nI might be able to get behind improvements in some of our\nchemical and sensory sensitivities if our emotional and mental sensitivities\nremained undiminished. In general, though, I fall pretty squarely in the\npro-neurodiversity camp. Then again, my son is (and I am) relatively\nhigh-functioning. \n\n\n\nThat being said, what else might diet affect? In other\nwords, why bother?\n\n\n\nWell, there is the diarrhea. \n\n\n\nWe haven\u2019t got the steadiest stomachs in our Full Spectrum\nhousehold. Let me amend that \u201cwe:\u201d Pardner and Z are tanks, able to eat\nanything with complete physical equanimity; G and I are muy delicato.\n\n\n\nIn a word, we have diarrhea. You think you have diarrhea?\nNo. We have more diarrhea. Gas, too. We\nkeep a box and toilet paper (\u201cthe kit\u201d) in our car. On car trips, we may stop\nmore than once an hour. Before going anywhere by any conveyance we assess the\nnecessity for a preventative poo. \n\n\n\nAn example from last week: We were one hour into an\nostensible six-hour drive to my twentieth Bryn Mawr reunion when G announced\nthat he had pooped his pants. He kept asking, \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d and I kept\ntelling him that I wasn\u2019t. I felt terrible for him \u2013 and unenthusiastic about\nwhat we would need to do to deal. As soon as I could, I pulled into a gas\nstation. G ran in, yelling, \u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d to no one in particular,\nwith Z and I trailing him. In the bathroom, he discovered with great rejoicing that\nhe had been wrong. An hour later, we weren\u2019t so lucky. Then we hit traffic\naround New York City and were bumper to bumper for four hours with no way to\npull over. Between traffic, bathroom stops and incidents, that drive took\nalmost ten hours. I vowed never to go anywhere again.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAnd I wonder: Will G be traumatized? What could I have done\ndifferently? How can I avoid these scenarios in future? \n\n\n\nOne possible explanation for G\u2019s and my stomachs is our\nswimming in the Rio Tuira in La Palma in the Darien jungle in Panama. This cool\nand refreshing river is rife with alien (to us) parasites that we have brought\nhome with us upon occasion. Might I suggest that maybe after three days in the\nheat of the Darien jungle in Panama you too would stop caring that the\nouthouses all empty into the river and dive in and allow your child to do the\nsame, along with all the other kids? \n\n\n\nAnother possible explanation is lactose/casein and/or gluten\nintolerance, which seem anecdotally common in people with autism.\u00a0 Or perhaps our digestive systems are\nimpacted by some or all of the various lacks (beneficial flora, good gut bugs,\nDHA, enzymes) or excesses (bad gut bugs, toxic heavy metals) that people on the\nspectrum tend to present in their guts.\u00a0\nWe need to reach that elusive Digestive System Mean \u2013 and the path is\nunclear.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case may be, our Full Spectrum household is\nalways just a Yo-kids Squeezer away from the scatological. I am hoping that\nswitching to Soy-gurt will help. \n\n\n\nWhole body approaches are designed to improve connections\nbetween and within our various systems and that is one reason diet appeals to\nme. I guess if I could wave a magic food item and change something it might be\nhow completely befuddled I feel about what we should eat!\n\n\n\nI may have to take a \u201cmy bad\u201d on this one:\n\n1. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what the right diet is\nfor us. Should we nix dairy? Cut out wheat? All gluten? Gluten and dairy seem to be the biggest offenders, stomach-wise.\u00a0 Or, as some suggest, should we steer\nclear of All grains? No soy, too? Then we just eat nuts and dried beans for\nprotein? Well aren\u2019t beans pretty\u2026gassy? \n\n2. \u201cI messed up\u2026\u201d \n\nI pooped my pants\u2026or you did -- because I couldn\u2019t get you to a bathroom fast\nenough. \n\nI grumped when I got confused and\nfelt bad about feeding you a meal that I worked hard to purchase and prepare.\nMy choices seemed good by one standard but not by another.\n\n3. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\n\n\nA while ago, G and I experienced an extended weak-stomach\nperiod. I asked my Laotong (\u201cold same\u201d \u2013 a term for lifelong best friend in\nMandarin) Lili \u2013 a bastion of practicality as well as magic -- \u201cHow many times\na year is it normal to poo in your pants?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNone,\u201d she informed me, much to my surprise. \n\n\n\nI had thought one or two seemed reasonable, under the best\nof circumstances. She clearly and unilaterally disagreed.\n\n\n\nHowever, Lili recently returned from a stomach-challenging\ntrip to Ethiopia and I am hopeful that she will change her conservative stance\non reasonable-poops-in-pants per year.\n\n\n\nBut in case she doesn\u2019t, we are still looking into diet.\n\n\n\nGotta go!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* I casually mentioned our new \u201cdiet\u201d to G and he asked me\nnot to use that word \u201cbecause it makes me feel fat.\u201d I explained the various\nalternate meanings of the word, but we decided to refer to our dietary changes\nas an \u201cadventure\u201d instead.\n\n\n\n** For example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cowardice\n\u2013 courage \u2013 foolhardiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 impatience\n\u2013 patience \u2013 inertia\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 gluttony\n-- temperance \u2013 insensibility\n\nSee also:http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#DocMea\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/health/research/scientists-link-rare-gene-mutations-to-heightened-risk-of-autism.html", "http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#DocMea"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/06/diet-i-diarrhea.html", "title": "\nDiet I \u2013 Diarrhea\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 26, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nDo you obey rules? \n\n\n\nWhy or why not? \n\n\n\nWhat about the children you know \u2013 yours or others\u2019?\n\n\n\nContinuing on the trajectory that began in my next-to-last\npost about boundaries, we now turn to those more concrete, explicit boundaries\nknown as \u201crules.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I: Chart of Obedience\n\n\n\nThis chart describes some of the main ways individuals react\nto rules. \n\n\n\nPeople may obey rules out of a sense of justice or fear or\nrespect. They may do so for the sake of appearances -- or because it has not\noccurred to them to do otherwise. People may disobey rules because they are not\naware of them \u2013 or are aware and simply do not care. Or they may do so because\nthey are rebellious and see rules as made to be broken. They may enjoy being\nsneaky, or feel that they need to be sneaky in order to do what they want to\ndo.\u00a0 In this chart, the motives of\njustice and injustice meet on the spectrum, as do two expressions of apathy. \n\n\n\nFinding ways to help my Full Spectrum household follow those\nrules I deem important has been an ongoing challenge. In fact, when I consider\ngetting my children to obey rules, the classic notion of \u201cherding cats\u201d comes\nto mind. G cares deeply about justice and will sometimes follow rules for this\nreason, but he tends toward the \u201cLack of Awareness/Who Cares?\u201d quadrant of my\nchart.\u00a0 Z typically obeys rules for\nthe sake of appearances or out of fear or respect, while having a very strong\npropensity toward sneakiness and rebellion. I\u2019ve yet to determine if, for Z,\ndefiance is based on a feeling of injustice.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn basic societal terms, it seems that G wants to be \u201cgood,\u201d and is sometimes unable to figure out how,\nwhile Z seems to want to be \u201cbad,\u201d and is only sometimes successful due to\nconstrictions which force her to act\n\u201cgood.\u201d Obviously this is an oversimplification, and not language I would ever actively use in parenting, but it does reflect how I\noften feel as we try to navigate the world of rules as a family. \n\n\n\nI was fortunate to encounter my parenting idol, Xiao Chuan\nAyi (Auntie [given Chinese name]), when G was but a lad of two.\u00a0 Xiao Chuan Ayi is unflappable, serene,\nas stable as I have always been high strung.\u00a0 And she has two brilliant, active sons.\n\n\n\nHer standard admonition is very simple: \u201cYou know what? That\nis not safe [or kind or polite or\u2026],\u201d said with great poise and tranquility and\nauthority. Her boys could be breaking all sorts of rules -- swinging from a\nchandelier with machetes, making war cries and sprinkling those below with\nwater balloons -- and, with a word and a Special Look from their mother, they\nare standing at attention. On the ground! She would surely argue that they\ndon\u2019t get off the chandelier immediately 100% of the time but, trust me, they\nlisten more than most. \n\n\n\n\u00a0Following the\nadmirable Xiao Chuan Ayi, \u201cYou know what? \u201c became my earliest go-to phrase.\n\u201cYou know what? That is not safe/kind/polite/[fill-in-the-blank]\u2026\u201d was a\nrelatively effective way to at least communicate rules and boundaries. if not to actually enact them in each instance.\n\n\n\nThe problem was and remains that I have neither what Xiao\nChuan Ayi terms, \u201cThe Chinese Look of Death,\u201d nor its Whitey McWhiterson\nequivalent. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat if I got angry?\u201d my demeanor and past conduct seem to\nsay to my kids, \u201cOh yeah? Well\u2026What if I-I-I\u2026raised my voice to a fairly loud\nvolume and then told you, um, you couldn\u2019t have any dessert but, uh, you could\ncertainly have some blueberries with a teensy bit of Hershey\u2019s syrup on them?\nHuh? Huh??? What then!\u201d\n\n\n\nVery threatening.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Infractions in areas I really care about \u2013\nkindness, respect, safety \u2013 may call my Full Spectrum of Doom down upon my\nchilluns. In those instances I am able to invoke a fearsome aspect of myself\nwithout, indeed, really even trying. I just \u2013 some stuff I just don\u2019t care about,\neven though I am supposed to.\u00a0\nSure, I would like my children to know how to properly set a table.\u00a0 I have a hard time, however, mustering\nobedience-ensuring wrath over a fork in the wrong place.\n\n\n\nBut I should not imply that my friend rules through fear. To\nbe clear, Xiao Chuan Ayi\u2019s Chinese Look of Death may be most remarkable in how\nunnecessary it is -- because the woman just exudes calm. To wit, G, Z and I\nwere recently at her house on a lovely summer morning and, through a series of\nstomach-related mishaps, managed to cover her entire bathroom floor (heck, her\nentire bathroom) in diarrhea. After cracking up big time (now that\u2019s a good friend), she whisked G and Z away so I could\ndeal with the disastrophe at hand. \n\n\n\nWhile I scrubbed away upstairs, the children \u2013 those same\nchildren who had not stopped flapping their jibs for the first three weeks of\nJuly -- stayed downstairs with their Ayi, quietly entertaining themselves.\u00a0 As I attempted at length to restore my\ndear friend\u2019s bathroom to some semblance of cleanliness, not a peep was to be\nheard. Meanwhile, Xiao Chuan Ayi was\u2026accomplishing things! \n\n\n\nOr consider G\u2019s kindergarten teacher, Mrs S.* Mrs. S is of\nsmall stature and looks like a stereotypical blonde angel. She is gentle, kind\nand quiet. Yet she was in complete control of a classroom that consisted of\neleven rambunctious boys and two girls. Imagine the boy-filled,\nfirst-time-in-school chaos, and the tiny teacher in its midst. Yet: \u201cNow girls\nand boys,\u201d she would say softly, and the Entire Room would Instantly hush! \n\n\n\nNews flash: that type of gentle admonition leading to thrall\ndoes not often happen in our household, despite a much more favorable\nchild-to-adult ratio. \n\n\n\nSometimes kids don\u2019t listen. As parents, we must choose our\nbattles. One task, then, is deciding which rules matter to us. The second is\nfiguring out how to convey their importance in a way that makes sense, so that\nour rules are clear, just, fair and compelling.\u00a0 Then we try to follow through with consistency and\nregularity.\u00a0 If we can begin to do\nso with the inner authority and peaceful mien of a Xiao Chuan Ayi or a Mrs. S,\nso much the better. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve heard tell my paternal grandmother (who taught first\ngrade) had this gift, but such subtleties do not come naturally to me. From\nwhere I stand on the spectrum, rules that are just and good are meant to be\nfollowed and those that are not just and good are to be disregarded. Simple.\nExplaining why this is so feels alien.\n\n\n\nModes of enforcing rules seem either mysteriously subtle or\nham-handed or violent.\u00a0 Also,\nineffective: yelling, exhortation, protracted explanations and dire\nconsequences all have little impact given Z and G\u2019s Spectrum locales. The way\nthey handle rules could ultimately affect their overall well-being and chances\nof success in life, ergo, the need to cultivate new approaches.\n\n\n\nThe gentle authority of teachers like Xiao Chuan Ayi, Mrs.\nS, and my Grammy seems a tricky, elusive, extremely worthwhile art, and certainly\none to which I aspire.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSubtly!!!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Mrs. S will be Z\u2019s first grade teacher in the fall, and\nher placid, earthy solidity promises to be a great match for X\u2019s\nmountain-moving attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8X12IjQAgx0/UBFgBQEmGtI/AAAAAAAAAEg/SbaJWDwE-qc/s1600/Photo+83.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/07/our-spectrum-through-lens-of-rules.html", "title": "\nOur Spectrum Through a Lens of Rules\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nWe recently had pizza night with Noodle, her partner and her\npartner\u2019s children.\u00a0 The four\nchildren are a rare good match: two powerful gals who are willing to share\ntheir power for the sake of fun and two gawky boys with no (G) or low (friend)\neye-rolling urges. (G\u2019s friend is a lot younger, but G doesn\u2019t give a hoot\nabout age.)\n\n\n\nAfter a brief \u2013 but non-cruel \u2013 period of incredulity over\nG\u2019s inability ride a bike, G\u2019s friend \u2013 wisely, I thought -- offered him his\nscooter. Friend rode his bike up and down the street while G attempted to scoot\nalongside. After trying the bike, very briefly (and, one might say,\nfruitlessly), G wondered if we might get a \u201cbike like this one\u201d instead of the\nlarger one we have been using to try to teach him how to ride for the last several\nyears. I had that quick sinking feeling of worrying about the cost of a new\nbike, but answered immediately that we would do so. \n\n\n\nThe very next day, we were driving along a country road and\nsaw the perfect bike with a \u201cfree\u201d sign propped up against it.\u00a0 We popped that bike in the car faster\nthan you can say \u201cOur motor-challenged boy with aspergers is willing to try to\nlearn to ride a bike and, goldang it, we are going to Do This!\u201d\n\n\n\nPardner pumped up the tires and we were ready to start. \n\n\n\nI have been trying to teach G to ride a bike since he was\nreally little for so many social and physiological reasons. Bilateral movement,\nincreased proprioception (a fancy word for self-awareness in space), basic\nbalance-improvement, focus, self-esteem, not getting crap from other kids, and\ngeneral fitness are just some of the likely benefits. I have been dismally\nunsuccessful.\n\n\n\nWhen G gets on a bike, he gets distracted. He looks down,\nlosing himself in the turning gears, or the patterns on the road. He leans all\nhis weight on me, making no apparent effort to balance. He is incapable of\nsteering and pedaling at the same time. He forgets to leave his feet on the\npedals if I tell him to try his brake. In fact, there are way too many factors\nto take in when on a bike and \u2013 At The Same Time! -- on a street. For many\nyears it seemed like he would never be able to ride a bike. I understand: in an\nearlier post, I mentioned that I didn\u2019t really learn to drive until my late\nthirties, largely for similar reasons. Sensory overload and safe, direction-oriented\nnavigation don\u2019t necessarily go together. \n\n\n\nOur first try on the new bike: G displayed all of the above while Mama tried to instruct. Not long after starting the lesson, Mama began to lose\nit. \u201cKeep your eyes on the road. Please keep your eyes on the road. KEEP YOUR\nEYES ON THE ROAD!\u201d Also, \u201cFeet on the pedals. Please keep your feet on the\npedals. FEET ON THE PEDALS!\u201d You get the drift.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this is a good time to stop,\u201d G kept suggesting;\nbut noooooo: Mama pushed on until it became obvious that we were getting\nnowhere fast. \n\n\n\nWe veered gracelessly into the driveway. G\u2019s little face was\nall crumpled up. I asked him why he looked so upset. \u201cYou were yelling at me\nevery time I made a mistake!\u201d he wailed, and then began to sob.\n\n\n\nMy stomach clenched. I tried to explain that I was raising\nmy voice because he wasn\u2019t listening and that I was sorry he felt hurt. And\n-\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d I had to finally\nadmit,\u00a0 \u201cI was frustrated.\u201d It\u2019s just a bike. And yet it isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nAll the things that will be harder for him than they are for\nother people, all the extraordinary safety concerns one has for someone with\nzero common sense and oft-scattered attention, common and less-common fears...all are triggered in this bicycle-riding cycle.\u00a0 Plus, there was me sticking my feet under\nhis tires periodically, which was kind of annoying to both of us.\n\n\n\nThere we stood, both holding on to the offending object, a\nrusty, dirty, old black bike that still smelled for some reason like manure\ndespite a good rinse. Both shaken.\n\n\n\nZ, nimble and chock full of sense, watched us warily. She\nhad been riding behind us on her bike, balancing alternately on each side of\nher broken training wheels just for the heck of it. \u00a0If there is a bike riding spectrum, once again we see a Wide\nRange in this family. She seemed confused by these clumsy, sappy people.\n\n\n\nThe good thing was, though, that after a recovery period he\ngot back on that bike. And we are still trying.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t seem like a \u201cnever\u201d now, it seems like a\n\u201csomeday,\u201d even if that someday is far away. Not only that, I dare say we have begun to have fun in the process!\n\n\n\nPlenty of people don\u2019t ride bikes. No biggie. But I very\nsimply and not-so-simply want G to be able to ride a bike if he so chooses. \n\n\n\nI would, quite frankly, prefer that he not ride a bike unless absolutely necessary (and only\nwith me around) \u2013 much as Pardner feels about me and driving \u2013 but I want him\nto have the option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Rocket Boy\n\n\n\nThe text on this painting reads, \u201cThere was a person who\ncould not walk to school so he invented a rocket and flyed to school.\u201d\n\n\n\nG knows that he is different \u2013 neurologically, physically \u2013\nfrom the kids in his class and beyond. This painting gives me hope that he\nknows that for all the things he does differently or cannot do, there are\nthings that he can do that are more magical and more wonderful than the ordinary.\nEven if G never does learn to ride, I know he will find ways to make his\njourney.\n\n\n\nRighteous Love,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2HFaw1fHB0s/T70JFUK2m8I/AAAAAAAAAC0/wPJ1bqOEk7w/s1600/rocket.JPG"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/05/teaching-my-son-to-ride-bike.html", "title": "\nTeaching My Son to Ride a Bike\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2012", "body": "\nThere is a range of ways of being known intimately to me as a person, woman and mother, a Full Spectrum, if you will. As a mother of two high-needs children, I need to access a Full Spectrum of being in order to parent my children. That seems to me only natural: we as individuals and families manifest so much that is unique - and so much that we share.  As well, in the larger picture, human beings embody a vast, diverse ocean of commonalities and divergences.\n\nFor some time I have been thinking about the spectrum of human beings and in my mind simultaneously making more connections and broadening what we are offered when we are diagnosed as different\u2026or have children who are diagnosed as such \u2013 or we or they are perceived as such\u2026or we or they feel different. Where do we fit in? I see rainbows and oceans of interrelations.\n\nWithout \u2013 please! -- assigning any value to the various labels, imagine the Autism Spectrum.  Let\u2019s say it extends from mild Asperger Syndrome to PDDNOS (pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified) to severe Autism, sometimes presenting with other conditions. And then let\u2019s place Sensory Processing Disorders just outside of this spectrum, to the left. Now let\u2019s imagine that just as this spectrum extends to the right, it also extends to the left, and this hypothetical spectrum runs from so-called \u201cnormal\u201d people (more on this later) near the middle, just beyond the \u201csensory processings,\u201d to mild attachment disorders to severe attachment disorders.\nFigure 1.\n\nIf I had better computer skills, this would be So much more luscious, but you get the idea. My intention is to show connections, more than distinctions.\n\nIn any case, I have two children, and I think of them at fairly opposite ends of this spectrum. My son has Asperger Syndrome and my daughter has an attachment disorder.  I don\u2019t want to in any way exploit them, so this blog will remain somewhat anonymous and I will refer to them only by initials (um, the wrong initials). I know there are other people out there who think that the wide range of humanity is fascinating; and I know there are other parents out there stretched thin. You are my people!\n\nSon, G, was born under challenging circumstances in New York City weeks after 9/11. He was on a respirator in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with severe meconium aspiration for a week. He is now ten years old. He is the kindest and most caring child I have ever known. Generous to a fault...and deeply socially awkward. He talks really, really loud and basically wants to talk about his special interests at all times. He would give you his most treasured possession in a heartbeat.\n\nDaughter, Z, was adopted from China at nine months of age. She is six years old now, and stunningly beautiful, with the most perfect features I have ever seen on any human being. She is incredibly intelligent and observant. She has a terrific sense of humor and exudes glamour. We call her mini-Satan. And by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean Me, because, you see, these two children require Two Completely Different Mothers.\n\nSo that is what you will find here \u2013 stories about my daily multiple-personality life \u2013 and how I mother the Full Spectrum. I aim to be inclusive and non-judgmental and never, ever sanctimonious\u2026but you may find me irreverent. I will tell you why we laugh and cry around the house (oh, and in public, for better or worse!) and about our mishaps and triumphs and would love to hear your stories too.\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LdE8toT4x0k/Tw2-nXdj55I/AAAAAAAAAAQ/e3Il27PZ6zQ/s1600/Photo%2B30.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/01/full-spectrum-mama-i.html", "title": "\nFull Spectrum Mama - I\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "body": "\nDisclaimer: I am not a medical doctor, neurologist or psychiatrist.  I am a Ph.D., but in sociology. This is all from my own speculation and observation. So let me explain a bit more about how I think this Full Spectrum makes sense.One lens through which to observe this spectrum is that of relationships. Those in the \u201cnormal\u201d area of this spectrum want to connect and are able to do so, more or less, on a \u201cnormal\u201d level and in a more or less \u201cnormal\u201d fashion. Those closer to the ends of this spectrum I have devised can seem less interested in connecting, while those somewhat closer to the \u201cnormal\u201d center, such as those with mild attachment disorders or Asperger\u2019s syndrome (please note: such labels are only acceptable and useful insofar they serve as tools for us, NEVER weapons) may connect in less-effective ways. Both of my children want very much to connect, but face major challenges in doing so in a healthy and successful fashion.Z sees and knows everything. Within an instant.  She is the ultimate skilled observer. She can read people better than anyone I know and determine pretty quickly what she can get out of them and how far she can push them. She is compelling, convincing...profoundly, brilliantly manipulative. She is always, always up to something or making a plan. One of my best friends calls this her \u201ccontinual boundary-testing.\u201d Being as she is \u2013 have I mentioned this? \u2013 incredibly cute, her acolytes are legion.Figure 1: Z\u2019s Art (at age 6)Observe the precision and focus of this piece: Is there any doubt that this child will one day be the ruler of the known universe? Or at least that in +/- 6 years she will be demanding to know why I dragged her away from China to this third-world, second-rate country?She connects, for sure\u2013 relentlessly! What she wants includes total attention at all times and possession of all potentially desirable, valuable or edible items in her vicinity. She will do whatever it takes to obtain these items. Why? I think partly because she didn\u2019t get to make the connections she needed in the first year of her life. She self-soothes through control. My job is to set firm boundaries for her so that she feels safe \u2013 and can spend her energy on other things!Figure 2: G\u2019s Art (at age 6)This is entitled, \u201cThe Evil Robot.\u201d Note the friendly smile.G, having had the luxury of having all his needs met from birth, and being of a naturally unacquisitive nature, is deeply uncalculating. He would give someone he just met his most precious possession. And it is surprising how many people (to be fair, more children than adults) are willing to take a precious possession, when offered with a smile and very detailed description (\u201cThis is my dual-deck-super-nature-power-booster-deck! I made it for you with grass- and steel-type Pokemon! The top card has multiple moves to take down all opponents! Especially evolved water-types!\u201d).  Eager to make friends, he throws himself into every interaction at the top of his voice and with all conversational options \u2013 emphasis on Pokemon and Legos -- on the table. He is almost entirely unable to read social cues that are more subtle than a sledgehammer. So boundaries are equally important for G so that he can act within the bounds of \u201cacceptable\u201d human interaction and actually Be safe.As I have mentioned, these two, being so different, need two completely different parents in one: a Full Spectrum of parenting. At the same time, and parents of all sorts I know you feel me, it often also seems that each needs the entire parenting capacity of at least one parent just to get through the average day. Luckily, Full Spectrum Mama is occasionally up to this mighty task! Though not always.For example, picture us at the grocery store. If Full Spectrum Mama\u2019s attention lags from her children a little too long, say, while in the produce aisle dreaming of gourmet meals that are probably not going to happen, the scenario might look like this: here is G, extending his hand and introducing himself to some eye-rolling fellow ten-year old, \u201cHi! My name is [full name]! I like Pokemon and Legos!\u201d And here is dear little Z, stuffing those gross, orange-flavored Tums into her pocket. See, it looks like candy and Z doesn\u2019t yet read, despite being a total genius. Her considerable mental prowess is mostly devoted to her adorable kindergarten domination project.I keep a vigilant eye on these two\u2026except when I don\u2019t. Then I see the eye-rolling ten-year old turning around and sneering and mimicking G\u2019s slightly-off cadence to his smirking ten-year old companions. Then Full Spectrum Mama marches over, using incredibly good judgment, and tells those kids they are \u201cCruel and I hope some day someone treats you like that so you can see how it feels!\u201d Meanwhile G \u2013 who, thankfully and let\u2019s admit, characteristically, has not noticed any part of this sordid exchange \u2013 has gotten lost an aisle away and is calling, very loudly, \u201cMamaaaaa!!!!!\u201dLater, at home, I catch Z with the Tums and, after a lengthy exchange (in which the victor is unclear), get her to fess up.  I try to handle it in what seems to be the best way by returning to the store and offering to pay for the Tums with Z in hand. Z, with the most sullen, flat expression imaginable, refuses to speak to the clerk \u2013 who, of course, thinks she is just the most adorable girl child ever, which she is -- and throws a marathon tantrum that lasts well into the night.Well, I needed those Tums anyway!Love,Full Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Jg16SM8CUJ0/Tx2diZKD1TI/AAAAAAAAAAo/Z27P6tQAU28/s1600/IMG_0563.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_4ftv95IwGw/Tx2cmM1ZcgI/AAAAAAAAAAc/XNuKUN2GsrA/s1600/IMG_0564.JPG"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/01/full-spectrum-mama-ii.html", "title": "\nFull Spectrum Mama - II\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 3, 2012", "body": "\nMaybe it was the \u201cvacation\u201d weekend on the Cape when I spent two out of three nights in the car with Z because she refused to stop screaming and was keeping other motel guests awake. And didn\u2019t care. At all. Didn\u2019t care about her crying, sleep-deprived big brother, or even the entreaties of her beloved \u201cPapa\u201d (I believe her exact words were, \u201cShut up, Papa!\u201d {NOT standard words in our family}).\n\nOr maybe it was when we were in the car and I had a migraine and Z was having a tantrum and I got her attention by explaining very, very quietly, that Mama had a migraine and that \u201cevery sound out of her mouth felt like a knife in my brain\u201d\u2026and then she got very, very quiet, took a deep breath, leaned forward and yelled as loud as she could into my ear.\n\nIn any case, at a certain point, my partner \u2013 who grew up oldest of eight and is, I assure you, unflappable \u2013 got the name of a therapist who specializes in children who were adopted and have associated concerns.\n\nIn Vermont, heck, in standard liberal parentland everywhere, we like to Respect our children, right? We talk to them about things, reason with them, offer them Choices.  In previous generations, this might have been viewed as permissive or, um, irrational, but we are Modern Parents, Enlightened Parents and we know that our children are Human Beings.\n\nI had noticed pretty early on that Z seemed to really like choices. She would think about them and weigh them and often contribute her own additional option. In fact, she liked choices so much that her choosing had become an exhausting element of my life.\n\nFor example, if I suggested that Z go upstairs and get ready for bed (pajamas, brush teeth, toilet), she would typically ask, \u201cCan I pee downstairs?\u201d Well, sure\u2026why not? \"Can I choose a goodnight book first?\" \"...OK\"\n\nOr if I let her choose toys for the bath, she would choose an entire bathtub full (many of which I had previously told her couldn\u2019t get wet), so we\u2019d have to go through a long negotiation process.\n\nOr \u2013- and this was my stock story whilst commiserating with other mothers of daughters \u2013 if I would ask her to put her dishes in the sink, inevitably she would respond, \u201cCan I put them Next To the sink?\u201d\n\nEverything was open to negotiation. Still, this felt progressive to me, especially as compared with other elements of our life together (many of which felt challenging and disconnective). So even though I sometimes wanted to say, \u201cJust do it! Because I said so!\u201d I didn\u2019t.\n\nMeanwhile, Z\u2019s tantrums and certain other habits \u2013 hoarding food, stealing, sneaking, lying, general mayhem and human enslavement \u2013 continued to escalate.  Z seemed profoundly angry and, quite frankly, did not seem to be developing a conscience.  I knew that while she might pretend to toe the line when I was in the room, she would do whatever she wanted the instant she was unwatched. I didn\u2019t care so much about most of the basic practical aspects of this, such as spoiled food or ripped clothing (well, the theft and destruction of jewelry was problematic), but I worried about the implications for her later life  - and I did worry about safety.\n\nThe bottom line was I had NO idea what to do. I had tried all the suggestions of friends and family and none of it had worked. Some of the things she did were developmentally appropriate but many were not. Even the developmentally appropriate things were, when done by Z, on a larger, more Machiavellian scale. The whole Z package was just so over the top: brilliant, adorable, charming\u2026and so, sooo incredibly poorly behaved.\n\nFull Spectrum Mama was accustomed to G, the first child, who lived to do the right thing.  G\u2019s very loving, stable start in life, coupled with his innate literalness and natural sweetness, had produced a child who was liable to happily do what was asked of him, so long as he didn\u2019t get distracted en route.  Lest you think G is Mr. Perfect Child, I should add that he does indeed get distracted, oh, say half the time \u2013 and let\u2019s not get into multi-step instructions.\n\nIt seems to me that toward the middle of a Full Spectrum of Doing the Right Thing (according to parents, anyway), children sometimes do what is right and sometimes do not, in either case sometimes because they want to and sometimes because they feel forced. I had one child who was glad to do what FSM asked, basically at all times, because he genuinely believed Mama had her finger on the pulse of cosmic rightness; and one child who didn\u2019t give a rip about right and wrong and only ever did what she was told when directly observed. And often not even then. Her urge to do or get what she wanted felt to her, I suspected, like a matter of survival.\n\nConsequences \u2013 another tenet of Modern Parenting \u2013 meant NOTHING to her.  I would start with the threat of reasonable consequences and sometimes, in the avalanche toward the ridiculous, end up going to extremes. A dispute over whether Z had done something with 2/3 of my $54 jar of Clinique Redness Solution \u2013 a huge, wedding-based splurge \u2013 resulted in absolutely no admission of guilt from her and my having to enforce no dessert for a month. Because, as you know, Consistency and Follow Through are further tenets of Modern Parenting.\n\nI cajoled. I punished. I warned her. I gave her her own creams. She was invariably back in the medicine cabinet within hours.\n\nExtrapolate from the medicine cabinet to almost every other area of our lives -- I was lost.\n\nDuring our very first therapy session, the therapist taught me the single most important thing I ever learned as the parent of an attachment-disordered child: [in this context] \u201ctherapeutic parenting is control freak parenting.\u201d It turns out that the main thing my daughter needed from me was to help her feel safe. And by what felt to me like honoring her as an individual \u2013 giving her choices - I was actually showing her that I didn\u2019t have the answer! Z needed me to tell her what to do. What a revelation!\n\nHave I mentioned I am an extremely controlling person by nature? Knowing this, I have always gone out of my way to Not be a controlling person. It\u2019s not about power for me (as it somewhat is for Z) it\u2019s about my part of the spectrum, self-diagnosed long ago (pre-G!) at being juuust at the tip of the autism range. I am very literal, and there are right and wrong ways to do things. In the abstract, I do know that other people have their own ideas about right and wrong and, in principle, I honor that. But, given half a chance, I could definitely be a total control freak. Drop the constant negotiation and lengthy discussions about every move? \u201cI can do that,\u201d I assured myself.\n\nHow could I have known that by allowing my child to make her own choices I was sending her into a tailspin of uncertainty in which she would constantly and anxiously feel the need to exert the control that I was apparently incapable of managing? I began to give her clear direction \u2013 and she began to heal.\n\nI explained to G that different children need different rules sometimes, and I think he understands. His particular spot on the spectrum sometimes calls for extraordinary monitoring as well. Figuring out just how to balance control and respect in these relationships is an ongoing project.\n\nIn the meantime, as for everybody else, you, too, may put the dish IN the sink, goldang it! Except glasses. Glasses and other breakables Next To the sink, please. And silverware in that cup with the soapy water? Thanks.\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/02/control-and-therapeutic-parenting.html", "title": "\nControl and Therapeutic Parenting\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 14, 2012", "body": "\nLet\u2019s scratch that linear spectrum from my first entry. I\u2019m feeling now that a better visual model would be a circular rainbow pie chart deal, with everything connecting in the center and closely related qualities connecting along the perimeter.\n\n\nFigure 1: An Amended Spectrum\n\n\nOne nice thing about this new and improved circular spectrum is that proximity can be quite telling. I pointed out that the difficulties in connection on the far end of the autism side of that original spectrum reminded me in some ways of the inability to connect on the far end of the attachment disorder side of the spectrum. Within a circle, these two pie slices \u2013 far as they might be from \u201cnormal\u201d on the perimeter -- might themselves be quite close, with some \u201cunknown\u201d slices in-between. The \u201cnormal\u201d slice might be on the opposite side of this thus-far-undefined area.\n\nHere are some ideas for some other Full Spectrums, a veritable Spectrum Rainbow, with illustrations from my own family:\n\n\nA Dance Spectrum\nWe do a lot of dancing in our house. All sorts of music. Sometimes we\u2019ll even have a dance-off!  I could expound at length on kinds of movement, hip-shakers and non-hip-shakers, rhythm, etc. but it basically comes down to this: If Z is Beyonce, G is Steve Martin in \u201cThe Jerk.\u201d \u2018Nuff said.\n\nOn second thought, it occurs to me that although I personally think I would fall closer to Beyonce than the Jerk on this spectrum, G definitely fancies himself quite the dancer too. Hmm.\n\nA Spatial Self-Awareness Spectrum\nPart of my project here is to distinguish and clarify, but I do so more in the ultimate aim of connection than separation. For example, most everybody has some sort of self-awareness in space, so that is a connection. Yet, for a child with Asperger syndrome, self-awareness in terms of place in the physical space one inhabits is fundamentally very different from that self-awareness for a child with an attachment disorder.\n\nI would place Z in a position of extraordinarily high, vigilante-esque self-awareness that is connected integrally with an extraordinarily high level of awareness of others.  G would seem to land close to the opposite side of this pie, with little consciousness of his weight and size and position, or of his spatial relations to others.\n\nI am not a neurologist or psychiatrist, just a Mama wondering at and about her children (and children [and people] in general). I do wonder if this self-awareness thread relates in some way to the ways severely autistic children and children with severe attachment disorders may seem similar in their apparent disengagement with the outside world? How might their awareness of self-in-space and self vis-\u00e0-vis other people differ? How might it be useful to think of self-awareness in space and in relationships as a way IN to children\u2019s minds and hearts? To healing, where needed?\n\nThis spectrum emerges as useful in helping me see that I, as a Full Spectrum Mama, need to help each child move closer to a healthy level of self-awareness in this regard. That\u2019s not always true: sometimes I want to nurture that distance from the \u201cnormal\u201d slice of the spectrum. Here, however, I would like to help Z relax her vigilance -- and G to become more attentive.\n\nA Scotch Tape Spectrum\nSome people feel perfectly comfortable using reams of scotch tape. Who are these people? Oh, pardon. I meant to write that there are different ways of approaching scotch tape use.  Some of us view scotch tape as a precious, non-renewable and expensive resource that must be monitored and used in minimal, just-barely-adequate increments. Others have a \u201cnormal\u201d take on tape. They use it when they need it, a reasonable amount\u2026and buy more with little or no angst! And, much as it pains me to admit this, there are those who are quite \u201cfree\u201d with their usage.  [No need to let me know if you fit in this slice. I accept you. I just do not want to know.]\n\nZ, as you might imagine, is highly responsible and abstemious in her tape-related-habits, even unto the point of Putting the Tape Back; G is a tape-waster par excellence. Left to his own devices, he would use tape for many, many non-approved purposes \u2013 and I would never be able to find the roll in any \u201cemergency.\u201d  From time to time I have generously bought him his own roll, said roll never to be seen again.\n\nMatters of scotch tape and self-awareness are related, yes they are:  ideally I\u2019d like to assist Z in relinquishing her control-freak position on this spectrum, while gently nurturing G in his scotch-tape consciousness.\n\nA Style Spectrum\nHere we have Z, dressed always with a flair and pizzazz and ultra-originality that nonetheless manages to scream, \u201cI have fantastic taste!\u201d She may be wearing seven necklaces, but they perfectly complement her nine bracelets.  A cape? But of course. And matching veil. Anything she puts on, Z instantly elevates and imbues with sheer gorgeousness and chic.\n\nNext to Z, we have people with some style and then we have a series of \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cregular\u201d style slices eventually veering toward a lack of style\u2026and then we have G.\n\nMy son, despite being conceived, gestated and living the first few years of his life in the East Village, has never looked right in anything fey or trendy. Something about him calls for classic, regular, GUY garb. When G was a baby, we came to call this genre \u201cfootball-teddy bear clothes.\u201d I have recently managed to sneak him into a skinny cord without too much protest although he has a really, really hard time getting in and out of this particular pant. In fact, G\u2019s pants are usually pulled up to just under his nipples, His shoes are probably on the wrong feet. Anything he puts on looks like it was put on by mistake. Obviously, we are moving away from \u201cnormal\u201d here\u2026but where are we going, exactly?\n\nI contend that we are actually edging back closer to the high style slice! I further contend that G may well be edging into what we, in our house, call \u201cmeta-cool.\u201d He is so on his own fashion planet that he may well have crossed the pie-border into the slice just adjacent to Z\u2019s super-flair section!\n\n\nFigure 2: Flair de La Z (with brother)\n\n\nA Sexuality Spectrum\nThe increasing acceptance of a rich, full spectrum of sexuality, gender identification and sexual orientation seems to me to be one of the great leaps forward of this new millennium. Nevertheless, so far, my kids have not been taking advantage of the wide range of available options.\n\nWe live in a super-liberal area where I would wager the vast majority of parents would answer the questions \u201cCan girls marry girls?\u201d and \u201cCan boys wear dresses?\u201d in the enthusiastic affirmative, Still,  Z lives in a pink world of princesses and fairy costumes and Prince Charmings. NB: her favorite doll is named \u201cDonna Poodle Itchy,\u201d which does give me hope for her independent future.\n\nWhen G was under one year old, he leaned over from his clip-on high chair and kissed a female model on the back of a magazine that was lying on the counter. Although he does sometimes hug his (male) best friend a leetle too long, he seems to be firmly on the hetero slice of the pie and has \"always\" wanted to \u201cmarry\u201d a gal he met in kindergarten.\n\nWherever they ultimately end up on this spectrum is just fine with Full Spectrum Mama; the only remarkable thing here is that this is one area where Z and G reside in the most average part of the spectrum.\n\nA Sassy Spectrum\nZ is monumentally sassy. G is not, in any way, sassy. When I imagine a full sassiness spectrum with these two opposite slices, one intervening side might be varying degrees of silly sass, and the other side might be mean sass. Having abandoned all hope of reducing Z\u2019s sassiness quotient, I now try to steer her more toward the silly side and away from the mean. And I know it wouldn\u2019t hurt for G to develop a sassy quip or two.

But first a few words about the most alive people I know, Z and G, and about living and laughing with them and the most good crying jag ever.Last spring, a bantam rooster from the stables next door came over to our yard. He was devastatingly handsome and conceited and all 6\u201d of him vibrated with rooster power.I called over to the stables to let them know he was at our house. \u201cHe\u2019s on his own,\u201d they told me,  \u201cHe\u2019s a jerk!\u201dI guess he was just too much man for those bantam hens\u2026G and Z fell totally in love with him and G named him \u201cErk.\u201d We fed him uncooked 10-grain hot cereal and delighted in him for a couple of days.On the day that the kiddoes spend with their father, I went on a crazy mountain bike ride with my world-class athlete beau. Just a quarter-mile or so from my house, almost home, I hit a washboard and went over the front of my bike, knocking out both a tooth and myself. Fast-forward through the hospital, the initial grappling with concussion, the first sight of my ravaged face (Figure 1) to the next day, early afternoon.                                                                                                                            Figure 1: My Face, May 2011Picture me, a fairly slim, white, blonde woman. Without ever having been overtly aware of it, a woman imbued with major non-dangerousness (except during my punk rock days \u2013 and that\u2019s another story!).  I have decided to do some gardening, despite being somewhat physically and mentally depleted. I am still in my pajamas: skin tight red velvet bellbottoms and a concert shirt from my friend\u2019s band. The design on the shirt is one of those ornate heavy metal jobs, with umlauts and gothic script and ram\u2019s horns, but the band itself was a pop/folk band and the design is tongue-in-cheek. Anyway, I have a missing tooth, a black eye, and a cut down the center line of my face. I am carrying a shovel and a hunk of bee balm that I plan to plant just across the dirt road next to my mailbox. Oh, and Erk is by my side, my trusty sidekick awaiting the next sprinkle of grain.                                                                             Figure 2: ErkSuddenly a giant SUV with New York plates comes barreling down the road, windows down. I step back into my driveway, shooing Erk along as well.\u201cWatch out for the roothter!\u201d I shout to the couple in the SUV, who are looking at me with horror in their eyes. My definitely-compromised mind starts racing: why are they looking at me like that? No one has ever looked at me like that! I\u2019m\u2014well\u2014me! What\u2026the\u2026heck\u2026is\u2026going on???And then I get it. Or so I think: \u201cWell, it\u2019th not MY roothter!\u201d I loudly inform the couple, as they drive away as quickly as possible under the circumstances.I have had many a laugh with friends and family over the conversation that might have ensued in that SUV: \u201cDarling, this is why we don\u2019t LIVE in Vermont!\u201dBOTH children think this is the funniest story ever. They will inevitably ask me to tell it in any social gathering. But I remember this time more because it was the first time Z ever really cried. Not that non-attachment-promoting, angry, demanding cry of the attachment-disordered child, but pure sadness and compassion.My parents had come up to help (I couldn\u2019t drive) and brought the kids home from school later that same afternoon. I was sitting in the armchair and Z came toward me, slowly. Right there I knew something was going on \u2013 she usually zings when she moves. She climbed into my lap, took one look at me, and began to wail. She curled up in my arms and continued to cry for a very long time.Four years after coming home, at five years old, my daughter was crying for the first time. I was very proud. It felt so good and natural to hold her and keep holding her. I told her how brave she was to feel her feelings, as I petted her and held her as if she really was my baby who really needed me in a way I could innately understand. Some part of me released that day, the scared and angry part of me that had shriveled when my daughter came into our family pissed and stayed that way despite my best efforts.Sometimes we still reminisce about Erk. We\u2019ll talk about how beautiful he was, how small, how dapper and self-important\u2026 I will usually say, \u201cWasn\u2019t Erk the best rooster ever?\u201d and G \u2013 literal to a fault - will say, \u201cMama! He was our Only rooster! \u201cAlthough Erk left our home a day or two later (having gone \u201cback home\u201d \u2013 if by \u201cback home\u201d one means \u201cprobably eaten by a fox\u201d), he was our one and only rooster of enduring laughter and tears.Love,Full Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uM8EnhkXih4/TyLLnyBCOsI/AAAAAAAAAA0/mX7DLVk25F8/s1600/IMG_0119.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dA_-Vi8In2E/TyLMb0rtLgI/AAAAAAAAABA/Gj998XvpkUY/s1600/IMG_0120.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/01/later-i-am-going-to-write-very-serious.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 6, 2012", "body": "\nWhat are the odds that someone would put on two shirts, one over the other, both inside out and both backwards? Sounds unlikely, no?\n\nActually, Full Spectrum Mama\u2026what ARE the odds? Harkening back to graduate school statistics, I have in fact calculated the random chances that one would simultaneously wear two shirts inside out and backward (*see below): just over six percent. Yet G seems to wear his shirts this way roughly 60% of the time.\n\nThree seasons of the year here in New England, we layer two shirts for warmth -- but we only wear them once. It occurs to me that the odds might be slightly higher in the case of pajamas: you take \u2018em off, they are inside out\u2026You put \u2018em back on: inside out. Thus, one ought reasonably to conclude that there might be a higher than six percent chance in the matter of the double-backward-inside-out (DBIO) pajama tops. We wear pajamas for a week, barring mishaps, with double layers on top during the aforementioned three chilly seasons. I have in fact calculated that for each of the week\u2019s seven wearings the daily DBIO odds are as high as 14% (*see below).  But I would wager that in the pajama realm we are looking at more like a 90% DBIO scenario.\n\nFigure 1: DBIO Pajama Tops, with faint smile\n\n\n\nThere might be an element of intentionality to this sartorial situation. G invariably smiles slightly when I bring up how remarkable his shirt-luck is\u2026is it pride that tickles him? Or is he sheepish? Is he a rebel with a cause, albeit an obscure one?\n\nYou\u2019ll notice I haven\u2019t even mentioned underwear- or pajama bottom-orientation.\n\nIf G cares about something, he WILL change it however he sees fit. However he simply does not agree that shirt-orientation is important. He has a point, I know; even so, I would like to see him express his iconoclasm in a way that won\u2019t make the fourth grade girls tease him.\n\nOne of G\u2019s earlier, tentative diagnoses was Attention Deficit Disorder. I knew this was completely wrong: he could focus on something he was fascinated by for hours at a time. His internal capacity to concentrate \u2013 often on internal topics \u2013 sometimes seemed much higher than average. In fact, he\u2019d be near-unresponsive if absorbed in certain toys or a book. That label was discarded for others, deciding not to label, and so on\u2026Some of you will recognize this cycle\u2026In any case, ADD was not a label that stuck.\n\nCaring about something, paying attention, merits awareness about that thing. Here are some other things G doesn\u2019t care to be all that aware of: prestige, the despotism of custom (http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/block.html), the coolness-level or age of playmates, sleeping past 5am, order and cleaning of most sorts, safety. Some of these are great (I am never pressured by him to buy the latest trendy clothes, for instance), and some can be challenging. It\u2019s the latter that presents some tough choices for this Full Spectrum Mama. I just wish I could convey  \u2013 in a way that really made sense to him \u2013 those things that would keep him safe and out of harm\u2019s way. Of course emotional harm is a piece of this, but I would start with fundamental survival tips. I have to find ways to make these external things matter to him somehow.\n\nLately, sometimes several times a day, I find myself holding G\u2019s precious face tightly in my hands and looking right into his eyes. \u201cPay attention! To the World!\u201d I say. \u201cPlease! Look into my eyes and really hear me: You have to be aware of the world around you.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m one to talk. According to an informal survey of \u201cpeople who walk with me,\u201d I frequently almost walk out into the street at bad times. I (by choice) didn\u2019t get my drivers\u2019 license until my late thirties\u00a0\u00a0(there was a two-week driving salvo in my early\ntwenties that ended with my vowing never to drive again). Granted I am a native New Yorker but it was more about self-limiting: it struck me as neurologically overwhelming, what with all those Factors (Directions! Other drivers! Turning!)! Driving was neither something I thought I would do well or enjoy, and I didn\u2019t start to try until it became an incontrovertible necessity.\n\nObviously, I am not the world\u2019s finest safety representative. As well, I never thought I would be a bastion of conformity-recommendation but here I am informing my son, \u201cThis is the way people do things\u201d (i.e. wear shirts).  On the other hand, daughter Z is all-too-aware of her surroundings and of \u201cnormal\u201d ways of doing things. It probably goes without saying that she dons all clothing 100% correctly, 100% of the time.\n\nOne notion I had when starting this blog was that a useful parenting idea that holds true for Both of my two disparate children might be a useful parenting idea (not suggestion or rule, just idea!) for ALL parents. The topic of paying attention does not seem to generate any such overarching ideas. Here, I parent a very Full Spectrum-Of-Two. For just one example, take driving: I actually believe Z could be a safe and reliable, if, one might say, potentially \u201cstrong on the offense,\u201d driver at age six, while G (and, perhaps, I) would best be served by using public transportation in perpetuity.\n\nBalanced attentiveness to what\u2019s inside and what\u2019s outside is not a given around these parts. Manifestations of focus -- chosen and not-chosen, obsessive or \u201cnormal,\u201d healthy and less-so \u2013 vary widely in our family.\n\nThe ways we (all of us) apportion attention are strikingly different. Children with different attention styles need at times to be parented in different ways. How? Hmm. I do at least maintain that the practice of paying attention to what our children and we ourselves are Paying Attention To is important, especially so when we are not dealing with \u201cneurotypical\u201d or \u201cpsychotypical\u201d individuals.\n\nWhen I am giving some version of a Pay Attention Lecture to G, I become -- on my better days -- aware that Z is listening. She is an excellent listener, regardless of whether she chooses to agree with what she is told. I want to say to her, \u201cNO! Not You! You need to pay LESS attention to the world and more attention to your heart and to let go a bit!\u201d\n\nLuckily, I am able to follow up my Pay Attention lectures to G with Anti-Pay-Attention lectures to Z because G is not listening 93.75% of the time.\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n* I believe one calculates this as follows:  there are four options for each shirt if the dresser is paying ZERO attention:\n1. backward, right side out\n2. backward, inside out\n3. forward, right side out\n4. forward, inside out.\n\nTherefore, there is a one-in-four chance of randomly donning a shirt backward and inside out (BIO).  So for two shirts, since options are not mutually exclusive (vs flipping a penny, for example), we multiply. The chance, then, of wearing two shirts in this way on a given day (DBIO, again, assuming one pays NO attention to proper shirt wearing) is .25 x .25 or .0625.  Just over six percent.\n\nAs for the pajama-calculation, I estimated with a higher, set rate of inside-out chancedness. In seven possible dressings, I generously eliminated the right side out option for Four, but retained the backwards/forwards measure for those days, resulting in the following calculation: (.0625 x 3) + (.25  x 3) or  .1875 + .75 or .9375 for overall chance of the DBIO Pajama Top. I divided this by 7 to get your average chance on a given day: .13392857 or about a 14% chance. From this we may conclude that for a week, random incidence of DBIO-shirt-wearing would be almost assured (93.75%), and not out of the question on any particular day.\n\nHi! If you are still reading this you might want to ask yourself some questions. Hey, I\u2019m the one who *wrote* it\u2026Just saying.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RYDBpue8IvQ/T1Y5oQiORwI/AAAAAAAAABk/fA9LxA0Ir7s/s1600/IMG_0582.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/03/pay-attention-to-world.html", "title": "\nPay Attention!

{"date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nA year ago last month, we first sought refuge with our\nattachment disorder specialist therapist. Neither Progressive nor Old School\nnor any other parenting efforts with Z seemed to be working and home life had\nbecome nightmarish. Within days of our first session we were able to make\nsignificant changes and improvements to our actions, Z\u2019s behavior and quality\nof life for our whole family. \n\n\n\nThe therapist\u2019s most useful suggestion was to tell Z, at the\nvery first sign of acting out, \u201cYou need help. It\u2019s my job as your mother to\nhelp you.\u201d I would take her into my lap and bundle her up into a snuggle\nposition and say this, sometimes tailoring it to particular circumstances,\ni.e., \u201cYou need help right now with being a good listener,\u201d or \u201c\u2026with doing safe\nthings.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn this way, I would stay in charge, thereby helping Z to\nfeel safe, yet at the same time be nurturing and loving. This strategy nipped\nmany a giant blowout in the bud, which saved lots of energy for Z to grow in\nmore healthy ways.\u00a0 It would not be\nhyperbole to say this plain phrase changed our lives considerably.\n\n\n\nZ, however, is far\ntoo smart for such a simple approach. It took a few months, but it was not very\nlong before, in inimitable Z fashion, she wrangled control of these words of\nwisdom.\u00a0 If, by some chance, I\nmissed her signals that she was decompensating, or if I was just too dang tired\nor busy to drop everything and get down on the floor and \u201chelp\u201d her, and, if,\nthen, things degenerated and she began a ginormous tantrum she would often\nbegin screaming at me along the following lines: \u201cYOU BETTER HELP ME! I HATE\nYOU! YOU WON\u201dT HELP ME AND I TOLD\nYOU TO HELP ME!\u201d and so forth. \n\n\n\nOne might well argue that a parent\u2019s duty is to help their\nchild, no matter how distasteful the prospect might seem at a given\nmoment.\u00a0 Z\u2019s attitude in this\ncontext is certainly not conducive to cuddly, helpful helping, but FSM is a big\ngirl and usually able to transcend such reactions. The larger issue is the fact\nthat Z is able to wrest control of the situation, and put Mama in a position of\nbeing unable to do the very thing she needs to do (\u201chelp her\u201d) because allowing\nZ to be in charge would be destabilizing and frightening for her, especially in\nmeltdown mode. \n\n\n\nI have a WROE (wide range of emotions) when stuff like this\nhappens. Somewhere, rather deep down at the moment, I feel love and empathy for\nmy child. I partly feel the way I felt when Z was little and would cry in this\njagged, angry way that made me feel like running away from an enraged spitfire,\nrather than mothering a small and helpless baby. An aunt told me these sounds\nare known as\u00a0\n\u201cnon-attachment-promoting crying,\u201d because parents do not naturally\nrespond to such sounds in positive, nurturing ways. Also, I am confused: I have\nno idea what to say instead of \u201cYou need help,\u201d and the phrases I do come up\nwith in the moment are either unprintable or saccharine. I want to mean what I\nsay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to never going anywhere again (please see\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/06/diet-i-diarrhea.html) I am also\nnever going to a party again. Invariably, I find myself flying solo at parties\n(Pardner is a chef and is essentially gone from Thursday morning early until\nlate Sunday evening) with two hopped up kids, feeling overwhelmed before the sweat\nbeads even form on my single margarita. \n\n\n\nG starts to get anxious days in advance: \u201cWill there be\nanyone there I know?\u201d \u201cWhat if there is no one for me to play with?\u201d I try to\ngive him strategies for socializing, but by the time we arrive he is in full needy\nforce, hitting the ground running, armed with his customary, hand-extended,\nno-eye-contact \u201cHello-my-name-is-G\u2013I-like-Legos\u201d introductory act. When this\nfalls flat, he usually follows me around saying, \u201cThere is no one here I know,\u201d\nand \u201cNo one wants to play with me.\u201d \n\n\n\nZ, falling as she does on the high social acuity slice of\nthe spectrum, makes friends immediately. At this particular party, her new\nfriends helped her climb about ten feet up in a tree and then removed the\nladder and left her there. She asked a passerby to let me know that she had\nclimbed high up in a tree, and to please come look\u2026 Neither passersby nor\nlittle friends seemed to notice the potential danger in a small child being\nseveral times her height in a tree with no way to get down. She comes across as\nthat capable, after all. \n\n\n\nPost-rescue, while I was cheering G on in a race, in which\nhe would come in near last but not notice (go G! Seriously!) I happened to look\ninside to the drinks table, where Z had a two-liter bottle of cola in two hands\nand was pouring what remained of it down her gullet. \n\n\n\nI ran inside.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, aghast. (This is exactly what\none is not supposed to do: children with attachment disorders need surety from\ntheir parents.)\n\n\n\n\u201cYou said I could have\na drink,\u201d she replied in a saucy tone. Several admiring girls a bit younger\nthan Z stood around watching wide-eyed.\n\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know that I did not mean coke? That children\ndon\u2019t drink caffeine?\u201d (Wrong question: see above.)\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d (Reluctantly, with sulkface.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI guess right now you need help with making healthy\nchoices,\u201d I told her, pulling her to my side and taking the empty bottle. \u201dYou\nare going to stick with me for awhile.\u201d\n\n\n\nI thought she would like being doted upon. Apparently, at\nthis particular juncture, doting was humiliating.\n\n\n\nWhat next ensued can only be described as a major, whomping,\nshame rage tantrum. After offering clear guidelines in a deceptively calm voice\nas to the consequence of being removed from the party if she could not stop\nraging, I carried her kicking and screaming to the car. I shut her in while she\nflailed and shouted and tore anything in the car she could get her hands\non.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nHaving previously childproofed the car, I had only to remove\nG\u2019s precious \u201cComplete Pokemon Guide\u201d as a precaution. I sat down on the hood\nwith that large, well-worn book in my lap, and tried to wave cheerily to the\nfaraway people enjoying themselves in a variety of pastimes on the lawn. G had\ngiven up on the party kids and followed me to the car. He lounged companionably\nnext to me. We watched the festivities with mixed feelings: it would have been\nfun to be casually part of it all\u2026But was that really a realistic option?\n\n\n\nInside the car, the screams raged on, punctuated by punches\nto windows and seats.\u00a0 G and I\ntried to be positive, chatting about what a lovely, green day it was. When I\nturned my attention to the sounds I could hear Z shouting, over and over, \u201cI!\nNEED! HELP! YOU! STUPID! MAMA!\u201d\n\n\n\nA sort of funny thing about all this \u2013 funniness being, I\nsuppose, relative and contextual \u2013 is Z\u2019s miraculous resilience. Once she\ndecides she is done with a tantrum, she appears to be immediately 100%\nfine\u2026Unlike the rest of us, who are still reeling hours later. \n\n\n\nI returned to my perch on the trunk to wait for that\neventuality. G is, unfortunately, accustomed to Z losing her temper and was,\nfortunately, unphased by the state of affairs. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, noting the\nPokemon guidebook, \u201cThis seems like a great time for a Pokemon battle!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt sure is,\u201d I sighed, and mustered a smile. \u201cSounds fun!\u201d\n\n\n\nI meant it. Sure to be better\u2019n the parenting battle I had just lost to a gaggle of little girls and a large bottle of soda.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/06/needhelp.html", "title": "\nNeed\u2026Help\u2026\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 26, 2012", "body": "\nWant to make me cry? Reduce me to a quivering, sobbing, snot-covered mass of mama-jelly?\n\nAsk about Z\u2019s ID card.\n\nThe day I met my girl, she was just over nine months old. Dressed in a little light green and white jumper from the orphanage, she was astoundingly beautiful, if looking a little scared. She initially came across as quiet to the point of being possibly drugged, and was clutching her identification in her tiny hand. Why did she have to hold her own ID card? Why did my baby have to bear that responsibility? \n\nWhen I think of most nine-month old babies, I cannot imagine they could be relied upon to hold on to anything consistently. There was Z, in that moment where she was passed from her Ayi (in this context, caregiver) to me, all alone in the world and bravely responsible for her own miniscule self and her very own identity.\n\nWant me to cry some more? Ask me about \u201cTommy.\u201d \n\nTommy lives up the street from us in a quaint, slightly run-down little house with his elderly parents. When Tommy was in school, Pardner\u2019s ex-girlfriend was his teacher. In those days, \u201cspecial needs\u2019 children were not mainstreamed and he went to a \u201cspecial\u201d school. Pardner used to come into the classroom and play his guitar and harmonica for the kids and he has fond memories of Tommy and the others in the class dancing with total glee.\u00a0 \n\nNow Tommy is middle-aged, a pudgy man with his pants hiked high and a bald spot. I usually see him walking jauntily up and down the street with his walking stick, always staying in sight of his house and waving at everyone who drives by. He always seems happy. Every time I see him I think of his parents: I wonder if they worry about who will take care of him when they are gone. I know full well there are social services and safety nets but what will happen to him when his parents are no longer able to run that household? What if what Tommy wants is to stay in his own home?\n\nA few weeks ago, we had a big snowstorm. I didn\u2019t see Tommy for a few days and I noticed that there was no smoke coming from the chimney of the house. The small driveway remained without tracks. I haven\u2019t seen any activity at his home since. I am afraid that time has come.\n\nThese two tear-inducing items represent the two poles of a Full Spectrum of fears for my children. I have a daughter who was able to --\u00a0 in a very real way -- take care of herself at nine-months old\u2026because she had no choice. Almost six years later she remains trapped in a massive control scheme, her babiness largely inchoate. I have a son who is very bright and desirous of independence but who may never be able to live on his own without assistance. I worry, I worry. \n\nSo many faiths advise us to \u201cbe here now.\u201d We are warned that the present is all we have for sure. Our nowadays are sprinkled with lovely small moments, sometimes bumpy but always full of big, deep love. Wisdom traditions notwithstanding, I worry about the days to come. What is the right amount of worry, now and in the future? What is the right amount of care? \n\nTo be continued\u2026\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\nPS.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2012", "body": "\nG had a major project due last week. He was to create a poster to illustrate and outline a presentation on his research on Grover Cleveland.  His written report had gone well, mostly because he enjoyed it, but I was concerned about this more public aspect of the work.  Difficulties in reading social cues and a lack of interest in appearances, both aspects of aspergers syndrome, sometimes conspire in undermining G\u2019s classroom endeavors. \n\nHere\u2019s a Full Spectrum question: how much and in what ways should we help our children with homework? There is a veritable rainbow of answers to this query. It\u2019s an ultra-regular problem, but when a child has learning differences it feels perhaps even more confusing both vis-\u00e0-vis home and school. The spectre of becoming a helicopter parent is never far from parents of many \u201cspecial needs\u201d children. In school, because G has a diagnosis, some teachers may have lower expectations of him. Luckily this year, his teachers \u2013 who are wise, experienced and huge of heart \u2013 seem to get my boy. \n\nSo, home\u2026and G himself. I know he is capable of doing just as well as other students (and even better in certain areas), but does G know that? Encouraging him to accomplish things on his own is one way he may gain this self-knowledge. \n\nTuesday Evening: The Project\nI gave G some guidance, including drawing up a draft outline for him, in standard outline format (roman numerals, capital letters, etc.). Then I let him complete the poster on his own. Some (vast) part of me wanted to hover over him and make sure he made something that would measure up \u2013 by mainstream standards -- to the other kids\u2019 work. But more than that I wanted him to express himself, and hoped it would build confidence and satisfaction to feel trusted and do a good job. \n\nHe proudly brought me his poster. He had entitled it, \u201cUncle Jumbo.\u201d \u201cGood start,\u201d I told him. \u201cCatchy.\u201d He\u2019d decided the day before that our pictures of Cleveland from the encyclopedia were adequate for the final presentation. He had affixed copies of these two small black and white pictures on an angle and his handwriting slanted precipitously likewise.  The outline read from right to left. But he had lots and lots of information in there and had learned a lot and had a fine time doing so. All in all, it seemed he\u2019d done a darn good job for a fourth grader. \n\nWednesday Morning: The Turn-In\nMy heart sank when I saw the other posters. Straight lines, multiple color photos and computer-generated text abounded. I knew no one could\u2019ve worked harder or more earnestly on their posters than G had, but these looked so, so much more\u2026professional.  \n\nAs I walked back to my car after drop-off I suddenly realized that other parents must have been giving a lot more input to these projects than I had deemed appropriate. Basically, I had over-underestimated the \u201cnormal\u201d level of parental involvement in schoolwork. Between parental non-involvement and helicopter parenting (and beyond) there must be a continuum of genuinely helpful help. I decided I\u2019d missed the mark this time, and that I should\u2019ve at the very least recommended straight lines. \n\n\nPostlude: Tuesday Afternoon: Pickup\nThe kindergarteners all walk down the hallway carrying shapes made by linking toothpicks together with mini-marshmallows. Each child proudly bears his or her little diamond or square with the greatest of care.\n\nG and his one friend (who is coming home with us) approach, having noted the marshmallows. I have a cache of vegetarian marshmallows at home and I promise to serve them as snack. I often agree to things I would not otherwise do in order to encourage this rare and precious friendship. Then I further agree -- again, against my best instinct -- that we can go straight home instead of going to the library to download extra pictures of Grover Cleveland for G\u2019s poster (which is due the next day), the faster to eat marshmallows and play. \n\nNext comes Z, sashaying down the hall with the most spectacular assemblage in her arms. Her marshmallow project is in a different universe, nay, a whole different Reality than the others. One of the great aspects of having a child who was adopted is one can really go to town with bragging: \u201cHey, I can\u2019t take any credit but\u2026this kid is spectacular, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Figure 1: Z, Marshmallow Mastermind\n\n\nHers was by far the most technically adept and visionary marshmallow project in the whole bunch. Z, while extremely clever and quick, is not generally the most assiduous student, so I reckoned the candy element was a key factor in the magnitude and fabulousness of her creation.\n\nLater that evening, as G worked on his poster, I would read his report card to find he has been \u201coff his game\u201d this winter. He has been focusing more energy than usual on social issues \u2013 somewhat to the detriment of his academics -- because his one friend is so important to him. Learning to share this friend or to be apart from him sometimes has been a challenge \u2013 and a strain on both boys. I would realize that by caving in to not going to the library I had reinforced this trend. \n\nLater that week his teachers would assure me that social tension is, for fourth graders, essentially \u201cnormal.\u201d Social learning is something most upper elementary students are struggling to balance with academic learning as increased intellectual demands jockey with more complex social dynamics. \n\nIn the end, even after getting a look at the other students\u2019 posters, G felt really great about his project. In the interest of more conventional success, I could have done the bulk of the work myself. Otherwise, even in the quiet, socially unchallenging environs of our home, no amount of friendly cajoling, firm guidance or menacing threats could have gotten G to produce a precision-masterpiece equivalent to Z\u2019s for his presentation on Uncle Jumbo.  \n\nBut\u2026marshmallows might\u2019ve worked.  \n\nHad I only known!\n\nExtremely occasionally, Full Spectrum Mama discovers A Secret to the Universe. This is one of those rare moments.  The secret is\u2026Marshmallows. If all schoolwork -- all activities and interactions -- could just involve marshmallows, everything would be perfect.  Sweet, soft marshmallows (vegetarian for us, please) could sweeten the toughest endeavor of any child (any person!) \u2013 and cushion the frequent falls of every imperfect parent (and other human people).\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bw2zItvPTio/T2nzvzMH9wI/AAAAAAAAABs/SvetM-dUPoo/s1600/marshtermind_ovals.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/03/helicopters-in-our-rainbow.html", "title": "\nHelicopters in Our Rainbow\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 12, 2012", "body": "\nZ was waiting for me at pickup the other day with a big, saucy grin on her face. She held up the latest Scholastic book order and announced:  \u201cJustin Beaver is in here?\u2026He\u2019s HOT!\u201d\n\nIn a sudden transformation as surprising to myself as to Z, Full Spectrum Mama turned into a fascist, super-conservative, sexist anachronism. I heard the following phrase burst from my formerly liberal lips: \u201cYou are! Five! Years! Old! Okay, Six! You will NEVER say that word again!\u201d\n\nMy rule of fear and oppression complete, Z felt able to respond: \u201cUm, okay Mom.\u201d  Eye roll.\n\nThen, resisting the urge to prove that ***I*** am the one who knows not only how to Read but to correctly pronounce Justin Bieber\u2019s name as well, I took a step back to dispassionately analyze my reaction.\n\nThe first language Z heard was the local dialect in Fuzhou (a.k.a. Linchuan), in Jiangxi province in China. I am sure she also heard some Mandarin (which I have continued to integrate into her life, though not as much as I\u2019d like). Until she was almost ten months old, she\u2019d never heard a word of English. Nonetheless, Z has been speaking it in complete sentences with perfect diction since she was 18-months old.\n\nWhat is truly remarkable about her speech to me, though, is the apparent savviness of her tone. She comes across as authoritative yet casually chatty -- much like a clever, popular, connected teen.  Perhaps the most obvious element of this mature tone is how she uses the ultimate tool of with it girls everywhere: vocal fry (http://gawker.com/5867222/vocal-fry-is-the-hot-new-linguistic-fad-among-women), see also (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/science/young-women-often-trendsetters-in-vocal-patterns.html).  Vocal fry sounds rather like a crumpling up of the inquisitive at the ends of her sentences. It\u2019s a mini-hipster-rumble that signifies at once being totally in-the-know and a lack of caring too much.\n\nG rumbles when he talks, too. Because he has some low muscle tone, phlegm often catches in his throat when he speaks and he makes a slight gurgling sound behind his words. I call this \u201cgortles,\u201d as in, \u201cHoney, clear your throat \u2013 ya got gortles.\u201d\n\nLow muscle tone also results in lax enunciation of many sounds. This, coupled with his unique cadence -- Pardner often notes how G \u201csounds like John Wayne\u201d \u2013 makes G sometimes hard to understand, particularly for other children.\n\nG has been receiving speech therapy through his school since he his IEP (Individualized Education Program) was initiated years ago.  His speech therapist initially maintained that G would \u201cnever\u201d make much progress in his speech. I have been able, however, using a rewards system that actually matters to him (pokemon cards), to ease him into the habit of pronouncing many sounds correctly and he has become much easier to understand.\n\nRecently, our dear friends Shu Shu Chuck and Fern Ayi (Auntie [in Mandarin] Fern) came to visit us. They brought lovely educational gifts for the kids and spent lots of doting time with them. Fern Ayi, was even kind enough to get up before dawn with them (\u201cWould it be okay with your mom if you got up?\u201d \u201cYes!!!\u201d [\u201cNo.\u201d]) and feed them bottomless bowls of cereal.\n\nAt brunch on Sunday, Chuck noted that same John Wayne cadence to G\u2019s speech. I immediately began to explain that we are working on his speech, that he has help at school and so on.\n\nChuck looked a little sad. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy try to change what is unique about him?\u201d He said he thinks G is a \u201cwonderful\u201d kid just as he is and decried our culture\u2019s tendency to try to make everyone the same, and to treat difference as if it is a sickness.\n\nI agreed with him wholeheartedly. Without really considering my audience, I had been making my standard excuses, not really lies per se, but statements intended to placate others who may be critical -- when in fact I think G is PERFECT EXACTLY AS HE IS.\n\nNow to give some legitimacy to Chuck\u2019s words: he is none other than Chuck Hoberman (http://www.hoberman.com/home.html), an amazing inventor and brilliant thinker. Among other things, Chuck designs marvelous toys for curious people of all ages. I think his life and oeuvre give great weight to his contention that we should NOT necessarily try to \u201cnormalize\u201d our children\u2019s every atypical quality.\n\nSpeaking of normalization, if truth be told, I\u2019d like to ease Z\u2019s speech away from the conformi-cool area of the speech spectrum:\n\nThe other night, we went to the local caf\u00e9 for pizza night with another family. The sweet, smart mother of Z\u2019s good friend brought her two girls - Z\u2019s good friend and friend\u2019s little sister. I brought along G\u2019s best friend too, to be fair. (The injustice of unequal playdates is one felt and expressed powerfully across the FSM household spectrum.) The boys had their own table and the five of us girls sat at another.\n\nI am always a tiny bit wary of consorting with intact (i.e. not gobsmacked by divorce) families who seem like \u201cnormal\u201d people with seemingly neurotypical, psychotypical kids. I am well aware that \u201cseem\u201d may well be the operative word in most cases; also, the above describes most of my friends\u2026I am just setting this story up here. Our family is blended in several more ways than average and I hope I may be forgiven a smidge of healthy, wholesome paranoia.\n\nAt the boys\u2019 table, G was talking about one of his favorite subjects, marine biology.  He kept referring to \u201caminals\u201d and his friend would get frustrated and correct him. After resisting the urge for some time I finally butted in, letting G\u2019s friend know that I thought saying \u201caminal\u201d was \u201cpretty darn cute.\u201d He remained unconvinced. \u201cI think it\u2019s annoying,\u201d he informed us. G\u2019s face fell.\n\nOver at the girls\u2019 table, Z was holding up her knife and fork and looking through them to frame my face. Then, still looking at me, she began to move them around in a kind of criss-cross pattern. In her perfect, angelic, singsong voice, she began to sing a perfectly enunciated little tune: \u201cCut, cut, cut\u2026Cut my mommy\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nThe mother, who was seated next to me, leaned in and asked, very quietly, \u201cDoes she have violent tendencies?\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I wished for Z to be much, much less comprehensible.\n\nNot for the first time, I found myself simultaneously\n1. wishing two opposite things for my two dissimilar children: that G\u2019s speech would be more clear and compelling, and that Z\u2019s speech would be less clear and less compelling; and\n2. wishing that in each case I wasn\u2019t wishing what I was wishing.\n\nDespite knowing it was a kind of funny situation, and even with all those nice people around me I felt very lonely just then.\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://gawker.com/5867222/vocal-fry-is-the-hot-new-linguistic-fad-among-women", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/science/young-women-often-trendsetters-in-vocal-patterns.html", "http://www.hoberman.com/home.html"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/03/vocal-fry-vs-gortles.html", "title": "\nVocal Fry vs. Gortles\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 2, 2012", "body": "\nMany people worry. I don\u2019t remember worrying much before\nbecoming a mother, but back then I used to, how you say, \u201csleep.\u201d All parents\nworry, I know. To be sure, we all have different worries -- but one thing we do\nshare for sure is a novel and intensified capacity for terror. It\u2019s almost as\nif when we become parents \u2013 however our families are formed \u2013 many of us\ndevelop an extra mental organ (or augment the one we already had) \u2026Let us call\nit the extrapolator-catastrophizer gland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frenzied activity of this new (or newly expanded) organ\nis certainly enough to lead to a wide range of emotions, or what Pardner and I\nrefer to as WROE (pronounced \u201croh\u201d). After all, our children are our hearts\nwalking around -- outside of us! -- in an uncertain world.*\n\n\n\nI imagine the average parent shoves elements of many of the\nfollowing sorts of concerns into their extrapolator-catastrophizer gland:\n\n\n\nHappiness\n\nMoney\n\nManners\n\nGrades\n\nSchool Quality\n\nFamily Issues\n\nPerfect Parent, the attempt to be\n\nHealth\n\nFriends**\n\nPopularity\n\nSafety \n\nSuccess\n\nBad People, contact with kids thereof\n\nCollege\n\nAthletic Ability\n\n\n\nSome parents with \u201cspecial needs\u201d children might consider\nthemselves lucky or wish to have these\nconcerns, rather than worrying about, say, whether their child will ever walk\nor read or live a full, satisfying life. Some parents of children who inhabit\nareas of the spectrum other than \u201cnormal\u201d may share these \u201cnormal\u201d concerns,\ntoo, of course. In any case, although all parents -- and some people -- share\nthis capacity for worry, I have to speculate that the\nextrapolator-catastrophizer gland of parents with \u201chigh needs\u201d or \u201cspecial\nneeds\u201d children may be slightly more taxed than average.\u00a0 But let\u2019s explore this assertion \u2013\nbecause I am not actually sure it is true.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Venn Diagram: People, Parents, \u201cSpecial Needs\u201d\nParents, Gland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we see the scientific, spectrum-based proof that we\nall share more than we differ. I think within that context it becomes\nacceptable and safe, even useful, to make distinctions. \n\n\n\nRelativism makes the Ethics teacher in FSM nuts. Of course\ncontext has weight, but some things just are right and wrong. Sure, everybody\nhas their troubles, but some things Just Are harder than others. I have friends\nwho are raising children who may never talk, never interact\u2026who try for not\ndays, not months, but Years to communicate with their child(ren) and cannot get\nthrough\u2026and they keep trying. I have friends who are raising multiple,\nnon-typical kids on their own on practically nothing. I have been a single mother.\nI have been broke. I have been a single, broke mother of two extraordinary and\nchallenging children. I\u2019m neither broke nor single now and it\u2019s just plain\neasier. I am not saying it\u2019s better, necessarily, but on a purely practical\nlevel it is, without question, more easierer.\n\n\n\nMy dear friend Noodle has two children. Her son is a\nwell-adjusted, neurotypical, socially at-ease, sweet, lovable dude, and her\ndaughter is a brilliant, non-neurotypical, evil mastermind, Goth genius,\nFeminist Riot Grrrl artiste. Noodle says parenting her daughter is simply\nexponentially harder. She worries about her more than she does her son. Period.\n\n\n\nThis may be partly because there is more material for to\nfret. For example, when your child is neurologically inward-focused, you tend\nto catastrophize about basic practical matters \u2013 safety, hygiene,\nself-sufficiency. When your child is delayed in developing a superego (a.k.a.\nconscience), you tend to extrapolate to larger potential dirty deeds. Think\n\u201cMean Girls.\u201d Think Enron.\u00a0 \n\nThese concerns do not just regard individuals or families, but society as a whole. For instance, in a piece on last week's \"troubling\" new CDC figures on autism (1 in 88 children today is on the autism spectrum; 1 in 54 boys) commentators on today's \"On Point\" (http://onpoint.wbur.org/2012/04/02/autism-numbers-skyrocket) discussed some of the challenges in parenting \"special needs\" children and the need for supporting parents, children and communities now -- and as these many, many children make their way into adulthood.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are people with traditional\ntwo-parent families, good job(s), plenty o\u2019 dough and neuro- and psychotypical\nchildren who are consumed by angst. \n\n\n\nMaybe the size of each individual\nextrapolator-catastrophizer gland is set \u2013 and we each worry according to its\nputative capacity. Or, most likely, there is a Full Spectrum of\nextrapolator-catastrophizer tendencies as well. If, for any given individual,\nwe take into account the specific activity level of their E-C gland and their\nactual life concerns as input I think we are going to need a matrix here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure 2: A Matrix: Extrapolator-Catastrophizer Gland\nActivity/Situation\n\n\n\n\n\nMy worries about G being able to live the life he wants to\nlive and Z not becoming a grifter feel like they would fit into that matrix in\na reasonable spot. I hope that Z will allow herself to feel and not just Rule,\nbut I don\u2019t worry over her popularity or job prospects.\u00a0 I hope that G will develop a capacity\nto Pay Attention to the World, but I don\u2019t waste time worrying over whether he\nis a sweet, honest person. \n\n\n\nMy worries are not entirely coincidental with the most\nregular concerns, but they are also distant on the spectrum from both\nmountains-out-of-molehills AND the concerns of those who deal daily with challenges\nmuch greater than mine.\u00a0 It\u2019s a\ndecent place to be, all things considered, so let\u2019s proceed from the pity party\nto the party. I suspect laughter may be the key to moderating the effects of an\nactive extrapolator-catastrophizer gland.\n\n\n\nWant to make me laugh?

{"date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "body": "\nI got A Dreaded Call the other day. We all know what those\nare for our particular family spectra, if sometimes only subconsciously. This was not The Dreaded Call but it was one I have been anticipating\nwith trepidation since Z started kindergarten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cZ has been taking food from the other children,\u201d her\nteacher told me. \u201cI have spoken with her and it hasn\u2019t done any good. One time\nshe said she was hungry and the other times she wouldn\u2019t even answer me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTaking.\u201d What a nice word choice compared with \u201cstealing.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilled with irrational shame, I mentally enumerated her\nlunchbox for the day (hard boiled egg, yoghurt, cheese stick, whole grain\ncrackers, baby carrots, applesauce, clementine, small treat \u2013 all organic!). I\nthen explained that Z (45 lbs.) gets the same lunch as her brother (95 lbs.) --\nand that the hunger is emotional, not physical. I assured her teacher that I\nwould look into solutions.\n\n\n\nThe next afternoon, Mrs. ___ happily told me that Z had a\n\u201cgood day.\u201d I had given Z extra sweets in her lunchbox as a short-term solution\nto the \u201ctaking\u201d of other kids\u2019 food.\u00a0\nMrs. ___ admitted that Z had tried to eat the sweets first thing in the\nmorning, but had stopped when told to do so; then she \u201cneeded extra time at\nsnack time because she wanted to first arrange the treats in an artistic\npattern and then show everyone and then enjoy them very slowly\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNo, that was not a good day.\n\n\n\n\u201cZ needs to abide by the same rules as the rest of the\nclass,\u201d I explained. \u201cWhen you give her special privileges she will feel that\nshe is the one in control and will push \u2013 further and further.\u201d This pushing\npromptly ensued.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Z\u2019s behavior at school subsequently seemed to\nexplode. I received calls or emails from the school nearly every day. Around\nthe same time that a little girl was handcuffed in Florida\u00a0\n(http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-six-year-old-handcuffed-20120417,0,765665.story)\nI had to pick Z up in the classroom because she was very upset. I counted\nmyself lucky to have been available. At another pick up, I found her hunched\nover her Hello Kitty backpack shoveling stolen candy into her mouth with one\nhand, a handful of crumpled wrappers in the other.\u00a0 She kicked her best friend and when she finally calmed down\nannounced the whole thing was best friend\u2019s fault for \u201cmaking me upset\u201d and\n\u201cmaking me do it.\u201d She pushed other students, continued to take food, ignored\nher teacher, lied flagrantly, and so on; she continues to do so. \n\n\n\nAnother teacher, who has fostered children with attachment\ndisorders, suggested that Z\u2019s behaviors are escalating because she has come to\nfeel comfortable in the classroom. This made sense: at home, she feels most\nattached to me and therefore needs to constantly test me. Her kindergarten teacher,\nhowever, had never dealt with a child with an attachment disorder and was \u2013\nquite understandably -- bewildered and overwhelmed. I tried to explain some of\nthe underlying factors, but we were and are struggling with how to actually\nreach Z and create positive change. \n\n\n\nGrandmother* (a gerontologist) and Grandfather (an educator,\ncurrently teaching fourth grade in a public school in CT) recommended that we\nconsider the possibility that she might need a paraprofessional.\n\n\n\n\u201cMa!

No!\u201d \n\n\n\nI imagined myself in a meeting at school wherein this\ntwo-for-two issue might arise: assuming the voice of a Borscht Belt comedian\nfrom the \u201850s, I\u2019d say, \u201cYou think this is bad? You should see us at home!\u201d Ba\ndum bum!\n\n\n\nThe truth is, though, that our current educational paradigm\nholds that public education is for all.\u00a0\nMainstreaming students with most educational and/or emotional and/or\nphysical special needs is our goal. Ergo: IEPs (Individualized Education\nPrograms; which is what G has) and 504 plans (accommodations, not necessarily\nspecial education services; which is what Z may need).\u00a0 Please see also: http://specialchildren.about.com/od/504s/f/504faq2.htm.\n\n\n\nAlso true: things are not necessarily harder at home. In G\u2019s\ncase, his schools came to me with concerns over his development and social\ninteractions. Had life consisted of just G and me (or G and me and Timson Hill)\nI never would have noticed a thing (please see aspergers, genetic links with\nbiological parents\u2026or if there are any websites about people who just want to\nread all the time with cats on their laps and a nice bowl of pudding).\u00a0 In Z\u2019s case, struggles at home had\nalways far outweighed those at school. \n\n\n\nI envisioned a spectrum in which some people were equally\ncomfortable at home and at school, some were more at ease at school, and some\nat home. I had come to think of Z as more \u201cat home\u201d at school whereas G seemed\nmore \u201cat home\u201d at home. \n\n\n\nZ\u2019s first preschool, which she attended just a few mornings\na week, was a sweet, in-home joint, run by a mild, affable woman. Z was \u2013\ngently but firmly -- asked to leave that preschool for monopolizing all of her\nteacher\u2019s time and energy.\n\n\n\nHer second preschool (http://www.timsonhillpreschool.com/\n-- may they live long and prosper) was one of the top-rated in the state and a\nmost wonderful and accepting place. G had gone to Timson Hill in his final\npreschool year, and it was the one place where they never suggested he be\nevaluated (he had been evaluated by Essential Early Education [\u201cTriple E\u201d]\nservices at his previous preschool, before we moved, and was subsequently\nevaluated in kindergarten).\u00a0 G was\nrelatively at ease in that utopian environment \u2013 and unconditionally loved.\nLikewise, the teachers at Timson Hill accepted his sister Z wholeheartedly and\n\u2013 I might add \u2013 effectively, as her behaviors improved in that context.\n\n\n\nSure, there were the several times I had to go get Z when\nshe was \u201cpossibly catatonic\u201d or \u201cmight be having a seizure of some sort\u201d\nbecause she wouldn\u2019t respond or speak to her teachers but once we were in the\ncar she\u2019d revive. Using her own words for what she was doing, I would ask,\n\u201dWere you just tricking your teachers?\u201d\u00a0\n[Giggles\u2026] \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut they never minded! They were just glad to know she was\nokay! And, day-to-day, they celebrated her for Expressing Herself and Exploring\nher Power, just as they had celebrated G\u2019s various quirks and peccadilloes as\noriginality, pensiveness, brilliance\u2026\n\n\n\nAh, would that the whole world were made of Timson Hill.\n\n\n\nOn the first day of kindergarten, Z -- alongside her big\nbrother -- proudly walked into the school she\u2019d been anticipating attending for\nyears. Her pink Hello Kitty backpack was almost bigger than she was.\u00a0 It was an exciting and happy event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013 Backpack to Child Ratio: 4:5\n\n\n\n\u00a0There were other idyllic moments, like when Pardner and I\nboth elected to serve as \u201cMystery Readers\u201d in the classroom. I bawled\nuncontrollably (though [I hope] subtly) throughout those simple and unspoiled\noccasions.\u00a0 I had so much hope that\nZ would be able to self-regulate in positive ways at school.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, fairly early on, Z\u2019s teacher had to move her cubby to\na more visible place because of some sneaking behaviors. And she was having\nsome dominance and conflict-resolution challenges too. Then again, Z could\ncertainly be relied upon to \u201crun circle time\u201d if Mrs. ___ had a small group\nactivity to attend to.\u00a0 Overall,\nkindergarten seemed to be going relatively well.\n\n\n\nOne morning in November, after some small incident, we\nstopped to greet the principal at the front door. \u201cZ is planning to be very\nwell-behaved today,\u201d I announced. Z\u2019s face got flat and stormy. \u201cHey,\u201d I told\nher as we walked into school, noticing her expression, \u201cYou need to behave \u2013\nand we are all here to help you.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the way back out, I stopped again and said to the\nprincipal, \u201cI hope that was okay\u2026I just want to help Z do her best and her\nknowing that everybody is in on that seems like a good idea to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much,\u201d he assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s only\nbeen down in to see me a couple of times.\u201d\n\n\n\nUm. A couple of times? It was November. And she\u2019s in KINDERGARTEN??? G has been to the\nprincipal\u2019s office once in five years; I\u2019d been once: in fifth grade, for\nkicking Jamie Chickaverry in the braces. (I\u2019d been aiming lower.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a weekend from h-e-double-toothpicks, and the\nabove-mentioned calls and concerns from Z\u2019s teacher, I scheduled an emergency\nphone appointment with the attachment disorder therapist. While I was on the\nphone, Pardner ran into the woman who had referred us to that therapist in the\nfirst place in town. She has a son about Z\u2019s age who was also adopted and has\nsimilar issues with anger, among other things. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked\nPard. He told her a little about recent events. \n\n\n\nShe got it. Wasn\u2019t\nany kind of, \u201cOh that\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019\u2019\u2019 \u2013 she got the whole threatening-to-kill-Mama\n(and everyone else), house-destroying aspect of the situation. Apparently, her son calls her a \u201cF-ing B___\u201d On the regular. Sigh.\nMy people. \n\n\n\nPardner said she then uttered the words, \u201csupport group.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think FSM is the type for that\u2026\u201d Pardner\nventured. \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t either. It\u2019s just that you get\nnuggets of information. AND you meet people who get it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is why sometimes I cannot talk to people: I mentioned a\nbit about some current behaviors to someone. \u201cMavbe Z was having a rough day at\nschool,\u201d this innocent person suggested. \n\n\n\nNo, innocent person, Z was not \u201chaving a rough day at school.\u201d Z was possessed. By the exorcist? Or \u2013\nI mean \u2013 she was possessed by whatever the girl in that movie is possessed by \u2013\nthat\u2019s my daughter when she\u2019s mad? Which is a lot of the time? The clinical\nterm is \u201cshame rages\u201d?\n\n\n\nSo\u2026About that support group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur therapist differentiated for us between shame and guilt.\nGuilt is a pro-social emotion, which makes learning and progress possible. When\nchildren feel guilt, they naturally want to do better. In time more pro-social\nbehavior becomes ingrained. Shame is a dead end, and children with that feeling\nsee themselves as helpless and hopeless. They have, therefore, nothing to lose.\nShame is an anti-social emotion. \n\n\n\nWhen Z clams up and refuses to respond to teachers and\nfamily it is with shame. Her \u201cshame rages\u201d are the tantrums of someone who\nbelieves all is already lost, which is the main reason they are so extreme. \n\n\n\nOur therapist said one of the most important gifts one can\ngive a child with an attachment disorder is to create the chance to \u201cdo a\nrepair.\u201d A repair can make a child feel more safe, more at home, wherever he or she is. It is not too much of a\nstretch to hope that a child who feels at home (whether in a place or a\nrelationship) would lose the need to attempt to destroy their surroundings or\ncompanions.\n\n\n\nWhen one has been dealing with relentless testing and\npushing and tantrums all day where does that energy \u2013 the energy to not only\ncome up with an idea for a repair but to\nthen carry through -- come\nfrom?\u00a0 What if the one who might be\nable to \u201cdo a repair\u201d is a teacher with twenty other students to worry about?\n\n\n\nBetter go get some chocolate. It\u2019s for the sake of my child.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* I should note this is the same Grandmother who \u2013 despite\nbeing Liberal and by and large Left-leaning -- is convinced that Z must be\ndescended from royalty due to her great beauty, intelligence and imperiousness.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-six-year-old-handcuffed-20120417,0,765665.story", "http://specialchildren.about.com/od/504s/f/504faq2.htm", "http://www.timsonhillpreschool.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-65d_R717ZDI/T7EbtKjOXPI/AAAAAAAAACo/68Bi3ri0R7k/s1600/bkpk.JPG"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/05/at-home.html", "title": "\nAt Home\n"},

Over\noatmeal breakfast on that fateful day, I was sharing an uplifting story of how\nthe children\u2019s Scots great-grandfather would wear a button on his bum that\nread, \u201cKiss me, I\u2019m Irish,\u201d much to their Irish great-grandmother\u2019s chagrin,\nwhen Z asked me, \u201cMama, am I Irish?\u201d \n\n\n\n[Censored!] I was completely tongue-tied.

I\u2019d\u2019ve preferred to have been\nthinking about many other questions right then, including my ongoing internal\ndebate over which is better as the face ages: the jowl-less wrinkles of your\nskinnier folk or the wrinkle-free jowls of the pleasantly plump? \n\n\n\nAhem. Since Z was adopted from China, I have a ready-made\nresponse for one of the hardest questions: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my birth mother keep\nme?\u201d China\u2019s one-child policy \u2013for all its questionable aspects \u2013 offers the\noption of a simple answer to this complicated question: \u201cYour birth Mama gave\nyou up because she had to, since in China most couples are allowed only one\nchild.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut what about this question? Is Z Irish or not? Clearly she\nis not genetically Irish. But her maternal great-grandmother was fresh off the\nboat from Ireland. Pardner, G and I are all genetically part-Irish. As I sat\nthere, mouth agape, Pardner (Thank you universe for Pardner! Thank you!

It\u2019s one of the songs of our people.\u201d The internal litany of my\nfears for his teenage-period drenched my brain instantaneously. As I sometimes\ndo -- since my stated position vis-\u00e0-vis worrying is Against -- I proactively\nreviewed my mental checklist of the tribes that might protectively accompany G\nthrough his teen years: Dungeons and Dragons and other gaming groups, dorky\nsmart kids, lonely Goths, Drama Club, the Society for Creative Anachronism\nfolks (sensing some overlap here?)\u2026Then I started to actually listen to the\nlong-familiar lyrics of the song I had instructed him to follow\n(http://www.lyricsfreak.com/v/violent+femmes/blister+in+the+sun_20144625.html).\n\n\n\n\n\nWha-a-at?\n\n\n\n\u201cNever mind the song, buddy,\u201d I said, hitting the scan\nbutton pronto. Anyway, who am I to decide which people my son will affiliate\nwith? Maybe I am erroneously offering him the signifiers for particular\nalternative tribes while he is or will be drawn to a completely different\nsubgroup. Still, I hope he will be able to discern and master those actions and\nitems that we use to recognize others \u201clike us\u201d \u2013 whatever and whoever they may\nbe. \n\n\n\nFor now, he\u2019s really digging on \u201cThe Black Sabbaths.\u201d One of\nhis signature communiqu\u00e9s involves growling, especially if he thinks anyone is\nteasing him. Another is his jig of joy, hands and feet flapping, a big goofy\ngrin on his face. Sometimes, during the latter, he trips himself.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure I ever quite got the signals just right\u2026but I\nstill have some friends. One time my dear friend Bob\u00a0 (bobparkswriter.com) was out on a run and passed by my house\nand I happened to be outside. We had a nice long conversation about aspergers\nsyndrome and how both of us identify as neurologically different and aspergian\nalthough we remain undiagnosed. Then, when he was about to leave, we tried to\nhigh five\u2026and missed.\n\n\n\nZ will have her choice of tribe. She will wear a glitter\nsock with a thrifted \u201870s hiking boot (real-life example) and the cool kids\nwill think it is cool and the anti-cool kids will think it is anti-cool. My\nurge with her is more to de-commercialize/de-massify, to offer choices that\nallow her to go inside and see who she is -- not in-relation but in\nHerself.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAs things stand, she prefers to be surrounded by acolytes at\nall times.\u00a0 The phrase, \u201cI need\nspace\u201d feels useful to many of us because it has a certain neutrality. It\nsounds better than, say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to play with you,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like\nyou.\u201d \n\n\n\nNot to Z. \n\n\n\nRecently, my resilient girl was uncharacteristically\ndevastated by two different friends using this phrase with her to, well, get\nsome space.\u00a0 When, after the second\nincident, we had a talk about \u201cneeding space,\u201d she shared that being told\nsomeone \u201cneeds space\u201d felt very hurtful, but she also said it was \u201chard to\nunderstand.\u201d Because of the latter, she found the request difficult to honor\nand exacerbated both situations. \n\n\n\nNot knowing what else to do -- and aware I was not being\nentirely truthful -- I told her, \u201cMama will never need space from you;\u201d I\ngrabbed her and made her walk around clutched (by me) to my leg for an\nafternoon, much to her delight.\n\n\n\nThese \u201cneed space\u201d incidents notwithstanding, Z will\nundoubtedly be able to attract an endless stream of people to her side and she\nwill understand and manipulate their diverse cultural signals and signifiers\nwith ease.\u00a0 My hope is that she\nwill feel fully worthwhile when alone. I hope she will learn to take \u201cI need\nspace\u201d \u2013 in whatever form it is expressed \u2013 as, if not a totally positive\nthing, something that she can at least comprehend...and respect.\n\n\n\nAnother beloved friend \u2013 always a teacher, and variously a\ndean, headmaster, and minister -- once asked me if I thought that perhaps G and\nZ in some sense constitute and intensify one another\u2019s differences. He wrote,\n\u201cI wonder if Z's most challenging explorations to the left sometimes encourage\nG to the right, sort of like a couple that can afford for either [one] to have\na tantrum or \u2018break down\u2019 but not both simultaneously.\u201d At times, it does seem\nto happen in this way; other times, the opposite seems true and they seem to\nsymbiotically draw one another closer.\n\n\n\nDespite their seeming to occupy very different spots on a\nFull Spectrum I have to allow room for these two children to grow in their own unique\nways, perhaps even to grow closer to \u201cnormal,\u201d and therefore also more similar\nto each other. \n\n\n\nI have to let my children be themselves.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 8, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nWe visited Great Gram in North Carolina for school vacation\nweek. Although my beloved Gram looks to me like the most beautiful person on\nearth, the children were naturally wary of the old, bony lady lying in a \u201crest\nhome\u201d bed. G had grown up knowing her well, but in more vital times; she\u2019d been\ndeclining since Z\u2019s arrival home. After adjourning to the hallway for a wee\nchat \u2013 to wit, FSM hissing, \u201cI know she looks a bit scary but she is your ancestor and neither of you would be here if not for her and\nshe loves you even if she doesn\u2019t always know who you and this will probably be\nthe last time you see her so get in there and give her a hug!\u201d \u2013 a decent\namount of sugar ensued, after which we set out to explore the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraveling with G and Z seems to exaggerate some of their\natypical ways of coping, simultaneously highlighting their anxieties and\ndifferences while drawing out their remarkable dual propensities for joy. I\nkept noticing how -- despite Pardner\u2019s and my sometimes near-constant admonitions\n(to \u201cnot hug strangers,\u201d to \u201cnot take your clothes off here,\u201d to \u201clisten and\nallow the tour guide to speak\u2026\u201d (at the International Civil Rights Center &\nMuseum - http://www.sitinmovement.org/)\u00a0 -- both children\npossess a huge capacity for laughter and making things fun.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOf course, being my Full Spectrum babies, they express this\nin their own special ways. In an unfamiliar environment, G copes with total\npokemon immersion, embodying different personae for each situation.\u00a0 Self-regulation in terms of appetite,\nsleep and so forth go out the window, and parental regulation becomes more\ncrucial. He rises above largely by crafting pokemon-based jokes at every turn. \n\n\n\nZ copes via incessant planning, especially of destinations\nand menus, as well as by recruiting any likely candidates (candidate pool:\nanyone who thinks little girls are cute) for unbridled, extensive conversation\nand free samples. Regulation of environments \u2013 social, internal, spatial \u2013\nbecomes paramount. She lightens up, though, with abandon -- and a scurvy belly\nchuckle for her brother\u2019s every pokemon joke.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThis tendency toward enjoyment \u2013 heck, let\u2019s call it Play --\nwas delightful to see. It functioned, too, as a counterbalance for my\nrealization that my children have a great deal to learn if they are ever to function\nwell outside of their comfort zones. \n\n\n\nIn our Full Spectrum, strengths and weaknesses are\nintegrally connected. Case in point: We are driving around and realize we have\ngone the wrong way. Pardner announces that he will have to make a U-turn. Z\nannounces, in her inimitably regal way,\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make a U-turn. I want to take a ME turn.\u201d We \u2013 all of\nus -- laughed about this for the rest of the trip, even though the fact that it\nwas actually true for Z was mildly\ndisconcerting. \n\n\n\nNow that both children are in school, spending twenty-four\nhours a day together was freshly grueling and amazing. Each late night would\nfind Full Spectrum Mama and Pardner lying on the bed staring vacantly at the\nHoliday Inn television with mouths agape, shell-shocked, knowing full well that\nG and Z would start their preliminary grunting and fidgeting around at five in\nthe morning\u2026yet nonetheless unable to sleep. \n\n\n\nThis experience has confirmed my long-standing hunch that\ntraveling with kids should henceforward be referred to not as vacation, per se,\nbut as \u201ctripping.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day we got home, I was thrilled to see an article in the\nlocal paper about a child in a neighboring town with autism who was graduating\nfrom high school and exploring his next steps. I expected to learn about\nresources in our community and people with whom I might connect. I began to\nfeel sick to my stomach as some of the language in the piece sank in: \u201ctrying\nto determine what was wrong with her son\u201d was the phrase I still cannot shake. \n\n\n\nLanguage around disability is so loaded. Labeling and\ndifferentiating language may be useful in accessing services and, in some\ncontexts, increasing understanding. But great care must be used. Although all\nthose involved in the article must have meant well, I remain disappointed by\nthe overall implication that there is something about people with autism that\nneeds to be \u201cfixed.\u201d Such language might fittingly be used in some cases of\nattachment disorder, an often dis-abling condition that results from difficult\ncircumstances and which may, with luck, ultimately be healed. Autism, in\ncontrast, involves \u2013 among other things -- different ways of perceiving,\nprocessing and interacting with the world. These modes may well be held as equally\nvalid to those of neurotypical individuals.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe this is not the current mainstream, on-the-streets\nperspective? After all, there is a vast spectrum of variety in perceiver and perceived...especially with children who are remarkably hard to miss.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTwo new spectra coalesced from watching G and Z interact\nwith strangers during our trip.\u00a0\nFor G, a spectrum of tolerance emerged; for Z, one of engagement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Reaction Spectrum: Tolerance \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure\nII \u2013 Reaction Spectrum: Engagement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdults tend to be engaged and/or charmed by Z. It can take\nquite some time before they realize \u2013 if they ever do \u2013 that they have been\nembroiled in a long, in-depth discourse with someone barely three feet tall and\nsix (\u201csix and a half, Mama!\u201d) years old. This stage we will refer to as\n\u201cdisbelief.\u201d Her relentlessness sporadically results in annoyance and more or\nless successful attempts at extrication. More frequently she is adored, even worshipped,\nfor the tiny deity that she is. Obeisances are offered and accepted. Thanks\nwill be proffered by Herself\u2026if prompted.\n\n\n\n\nThe attachment disorder specialist with whom we are working\nrecently told me that it is \u201charder for the really charming children to get the\nhelp they need because they get away with so much.\u201d Z presents a scintillating\nexterior that diverts her adoring audiences\u2019 gaze from her inner pain and her\nexternal transgressions. With inner healing, perhaps her dazzling shine will\nbecome more of a comfortable glow.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe general adult-stranger reaction to my aspergian son\nseems to be one of tolerance. More negative reactions to his sometimes\nover-friendly or otherwise inappropriate behaviors include confusion and even\nanger. On the other hand, a decent proportion of people will go slightly out of\ntheir way to accommodate him \u2013 and a select few seem to truly appreciate his\nopenheartedness and originality. There are even those who seem to celebrate his\nfree spirit and flailing body.\n\n\n\nThe spectrum of stances taken by his fellow children, they\nof lesser patience and knowledge, veers slightly more toward perplexity and\nannoyance. With both adults and children, however, I get a lot of questioning\nglances, raised eyebrows and rolled eyes. I try to deflect such unspoken\nqueries both because (this is one of many things I have learned about myself in\nparenting a child with autism) most direct eye contact makes me uncomfortable\nand because I demand that G be accepted on his own terms. \n\n\n\nAfter one particularly stressful day in North Carolina,\nPardner wondered whether \u201ceverybody has to, in some sense accommodate G.\u201d \n\n\n\nI disagreed: \u201cI think the people who get G really get him!\u00a0\nIf everybody were like G, the world would be a much better place. But,\u201d\nI conceded, \u201cmuch, much messier.\u201d \n\n\n\nI suppose I fit into the celebratory faction. Unlike the\nmother quoted above, I have never thought for a millisecond that there was\nanything \u201cwrong\u201d with my son. Calling someone \u201cdifferently-abled\u201d may be a\nclich\u00e9, but it is also deep truth.\u00a0\nThe gifts of truth and heart and generosity that come with G could never\nbe compensated for by \u201cnormality.\u201d \n\n\n\nOne of Rudolph Steiner\u2019s first students was a boy with\nautism. Steiner came to believe that people with autism were partly still in\nthe angelic realm. That is, their engagement with the mundane world was limited\nbecause of an ongoing partial immersion in another dimension, one closer to\nsource/truth. Thus the calculations and deceptions of ordinary people are alien\nto those with autism. \n\n\n\nSteiner remains a controversial figure. I both agree and\ndisagree with Steiner\u2019s stance on autism: for one thing, the word \u201cangel\u201d can\nbe a polarizing one; for another, people with autism are as varied as those\nwithout it\u2026Yet there is something to be said for such a positive view of this\n\u201cdisability.\u201d Stay tuned: perhaps another spectrum or two is called for.\n\n\n\nWhatever their religious, philosophical or personal status,\nthose people who wholeheartedly accept all children are angels to us.\nNeutrality is fine too, though surprisingly rare. \n\n\n\nLove \u2013 and never colluding with the eye rollers,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sitinmovement.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bFG6rIgKpXY/T6lOUPOJf3I/AAAAAAAAACc/C01HSODipA4/s1600/engagementspec.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ADPURN22iRk/T6lORsPR-aI/AAAAAAAAACU/QgkTeDdYLks/s1600/tolerancespectr.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/05/tripping.html", "title": "\nTripping\n"},

He\nsaid he would play with me at recess and then he played basketball instead.\u201d It\nis so hard for him to be flexible and see incidents like this as change rather\nthan betrayal. Having, also, an encyclopedic memory, he notes inconsistencies\nand reads them as untruths as well.\u00a0\nTherefore, among other things, he finds it profoundly disjunctive when\npeople act differently in different situations, and with -- or toward --\ndifferent people. Your dork-kid who rejects his dork friends when the in-crowd\ncomes around, your customer who is polite in a fancy restaurant and rude to a\ncashier at the 7-11, your parent who tells a child s/he is eating \u201cnothing\u201d\nwhen s/he has just shoved a piece of candy in her/his mouth\u2026these \u201cnormal\u201d\npeople are disturbing to G.\n\n\n\nI rather know where he gets all of this \u2013the literality, the\ntrash-can memory, the perceptions of dishonesty.

{"date": "Monday, April 30, 2012", "body": "\n\n\n\u2026In which I expound, dear readers, upon a small spectrum of\nhandy-to-la famiglia FSM tools that might be useful and/or laughable in your rainbows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cMy Bad\u201d\n\nWe all aspire to the wielding of copious quantities of\npositive tools like respect, patience, unconditional love and consistency. \n\n\n\nMy favorite progressive tool, though, is more negative. \n\n\n\nMy mother\u2019s generation \u2013 whether traditional or hippie-mama\n\u2013 often felt pressure to act as if mothering felt happy and easy at all times,\nas if motherhood was totally fulfilling and came naturally to all mothers.\nParents, especially fathers, were deemed omnipotent and all-knowing.\n\n\n\nAs our culture has become \u2013 however incrementally \u2013 more\nopen and less sexist, we have gained some additional tools at our disposal. We\nare now free to admit to each other that parenting is sometimes hard, and often\nbaffling, and that \u2013 even as we fiercely, fully love them Every Second -- we\nsometimes don\u2019t entirely like our kids at a given moment. \n\n\n\nIt may be even more important that we are able to admit to\nour children (friends, family, partners\u2026) that we ourselves are human. So, I\ncelebrate the following three phrases:\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI messed up.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2018m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe use of these phrases demonstrates that parents (friends,\nfamily, partners\u2026) are fallible human beings who will try to figure stuff out\nand do better next time. Just like kids can be \u2013 if shown the possibility. \n\n\n\nThe \u201cMy Bad\u201d is liberating, but by no means a license to\nill. At its best, though, it offers possibilities of redemption, learning,\nhealing.\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cLocked\u201d Door\n\nAmong other things, Z\u2019s agenda includes using the stovetop\nand oven at 2am. Because of this, I have had to confine her to her room until I\nofficially get her up in the morning. This involves keeping a chamber pot in\nher room and my \u201clocking\u201d[closing] the door every night after I put her to bed.\nSomewhat paradoxically for Miss Independence \u2013 but well within guidelines set\nby the aforementioned therapist -- this has been a very comforting process for\nZ herself.\n\n\n\nThe first (initially) unknown-to-me reader of FSM -- and\nsomeone I think of as a real live guardian angel -- has degrees in Education of\nYoung Children, Child Assessment and Development, and Psychiatric Social Work\n(with specialty in the field of children and families).\u00a0 She also has decades of experience\nworking with children. She keeps me on track and within the bounds of my\nknowledge while still tolerating, even celebrating, my flights of fancy. Any\nerrors, of course, are all mine. \n\n\n\nShe recently asked me, \u00a0\u201cHow do you as a mother create a safe home for Z while still\nfeeling your home is as you want it to be?\u201d My answer was\u2026I don\u2019t. I used to\nwear a lot of jewelry, for example, until some of my most precious pieces\ndisappeared. Some did reappear, only in different and unsalvageable forms.\u00a0 Now my jewelry is so hidden away that\njust getting to it is way too much trouble for a busy mama. \n\n\n\nSome other nighttime concerns, besides stove on-house fire-gas\nexplosion and jewelry-ruined-gone include:\n\nfood-hoarded-infestations-grody\nstuff-smears-rot-botulism\n\nlotions/creams/polishes-ingested-poisoning\nthereby\n\npets-tied up-enslaved\n\n\n\nZ has her own jewelry and creams and an array of dolls and\nstuffies, but they are never quite enough. Her night machinations made this\nvery clear. Admittedly, with her high level of competence we might teach her\nhow to use the stove, etc. in the not-so-distant future.\u00a0 Until then, we say that Z \u201cisn\u2019t ready\nto get up on her own.\u201d We try to meet her where she is on the developmental\nspectrum, protecting and nurturing the baby inside, while allowing for her\nexceptionally high acumen on mental and physical spectra by essentially\nbaby-proofing the house for a really, really advanced baby.\n\n\n\nOppressing Z was a concern, but her \u201clocked\u201d door liberated\nher from her compulsion to do verboten \u201cprojects\u201d in the night and allowed her\nto sleep soundly, thereby enabling her to not only feel better but to feel\nbetter about herself. \n\n\n\n\nHumor\n\nAlso from my children\u2019s therapist-angel reader came the\nsuggestion to use humor. She reasoned that with all the progress Z had been\nmaking I might begin to use wit in our interactions. Instead of sticking firm\nand strong to my \u201cput the dish in the sink\u201d order, for instance, I might --\naccording to therapist-angel -- say, \u201dPut the dish on the floor.\u201d Essentially, I should continue to contain Z's actions -- but with a light touch.\n\n\n\nYeah, I am not ready for that yet. The therapist Pardner and\nI go to who specializes in attachment disorders suggested the same thing. He\nthought, for example, that when Z looks at one of her adoring aunties and\nhaughtily points to her plate to indicate that more food must be provided I\nshould say \u201cOh\u2026is that a plate?\u201d I told him,\u00a0 \u201cPlease. Just tell me one thing to say for all situations.\nFunny is too confusing. In those moments I can\u2019t remember more than that.\u201d\nSomeday I do very much want to be funny. For now, I aim for functional.\n\n\n\n\nRipping Bag\n\nZ likes to rip. She likes to rip Everything. She rips paper\ninto tiny strips, all of a size. She rips clothing -- seam from seam, or\nexpanding upon a pinhole or snag.\u00a0\nShe rips horns off beloved childhood unicorns saved especially for my\nsome-day daughter. (I\u2019m not bitter about that one.) \n\n\n\nOne day, after yet another ripping disastrophe, it occurred\nto me to fill a bag with stuff that Z not only could but Should rip. It was a\ngreat success and has substantially reduced free-form ripping.\n\n\n\nFeel free to riff on this: what about a smashing bag? A\ncoloring-on box? A food-hoarding bunker? \n\n\n\n\nOne Battle a Day\n\nG has the typical aspergian penchant for obsession. Pokemon\nhas been a focus for almost six years.\u00a0\nIn order to make time for other activities and foci, such as eating and\nsleeping, we have devised a system in which we have one extended, all-out\nPokemon battle a day, after which we have some time for discussion. A potential\nadditional benefit to this system is that G begins to get the notion that other\npeople have interests of their own. \n\n\n\nWhen he raises the subject I can say, \u201cIs this Pokemon time?\nOh, you want to talk about Gyarados\u2019s hit points? Good. We\u2019ll talk about that\nduring Pokemon time.\u201d Ideally in this context, I don\u2019t squish G\u2019s interests,\njust corral them. \n\n\n\nOne battle a day is enough for anybody.\n\n\n\n\nYou flick, I tick\n\nFrom time to time, G begins to develop a tick. The latest\nhas been a sort of flicking of his fingers that seems to happen when he gets\nexcited or anxious. Hoping to help him (and not his neurological hiccups) be\nthe one in charge of his body I started a policy of \u201cyou flick, I tick[le].\u201d\nThat is, whenever he starts flicking his fingers, I tickle him.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIt is probably somewhat annoying, although he tolerates me. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou flick, I tick\u201d is also related to my \u201cyou flap, I clap\u201d\npolicy, for when G starts flapping his hands compulsively. These are intended\nas neither punitive nor judgmental; they should be merely observational. And,\nas I tell him, hey, if you love to flap, just keep on flapping\u2026and I will keep\non clapping. I like to clap -- and I love\nto tickle.\n\n\n\nTickling seems to be a good tool, also, when either child\ngets Stuck in a mood or thought process. Of course, this assumes a certain base\nlevel of receptivity to being tickled at a given moment. \n\n\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could tickle ourselves out of\nbeing stuck?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd, finally\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cMombulance\u201d (also available in \u201cDad\u201d and \u201cPerson\u201d models)\n\n\u201cWheee-oooh, Whee-oooh\u2026\u201d You hear the siren in the distance.\nIt approaches\u2026closer and closer.

Put\ndown the crayon, computer, dishcloth, phone and banana peel.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral other paramedics roll a stretcher toward you. As you\nclimb onto it you note that a nanny and several fun, inclusive kids are headed\ntoward your house, loaded with healthy, delicious snacks, games and educational\nyet entertaining dvds.\u00a0 You see a\nspecial caddy full of trashy magazines affixed to the side of the stretcher.\nYou wave sweetly to your children, who don\u2019t even notice you are leaving.

We went there the other day when Z was just in a\u00a0mood. Mama was not in the mood for this mood.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t a great combination.\n\n\n\nAs G swam happily, Z threw sticks into the muck of a small rock pool and shot copious gratuitous dirty looks my way. I jumped in and joined G for a while, trying to enjoy myself despite one-third of our party being in a snit, and then slid out and approached Z.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you want to go swimming, now is the time,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\n\nFrom the water, G made encouraging river otter sounds and tried to make Z laugh.\n\n\n\nShe ignored him.\n\n\n\nI am always hoping these two Spectrum opposites can be \u201ctherapeutically\u201d complementary to one another. Z might help teach G how to relate to someone who is socially savvy (for instance, getting him accustomed to mild, good-intentioned ribbing); or G could show Z that being generous (i.e. taking the smaller piece of pie) isn\u2019t a sign of weakness. Sometimes it feels like quite the opposite is occurring. At the river, G was being sweet and blatantly making himself vulnerable to rejection and it wasn\u2019t swaying Z\u2019s tough stance one iota.\n\n\n\nMy Great Grandmother Noni, a widowed mother of a huge family and a fantastic and irreverent and loving woman, gave her children the following sage parenting advice: \u201cDon\u2019t see everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nI had\u00a0seen\u00a0Z\u2019s sourpuss and her unwillingness (inability?) to respond to G\u2019s overtures and I just couldn\u2019t take the rudeness.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this family we treat each other with kindness,\u201d I snapped. \u201cPeriod!\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Black and White and Spectrum-y as I can be, I have to wonder whether some of the moral boundaries I set for my family fit the individuals concerned.* I am always telling G, \u201cUse your most powerful [pokemon-style] move: Ignore!\u201d when he feels that Z is tormenting him, yet here I was denying her the right to this mighty move \u2013 and big-time incapable of it myself! Maybe the kids were learning from each other in ways that weren\u2019t so obvious to me; maybe I should have simply accepted \u2013 \u201cnot seen\u201d -- the interaction and, as Noni\u2019s son-in-law (my Grampy) used to say, \u201cLeave it lay where Jesus flang it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs it true, as a dear friend recently told me, that for parents the acts of holding a moral center and loving unconditionally are irreconcilable? If so, which do I value more?\u00a0\u00a0As with many in my raised-by-busy-boomers generation, I felt at times a dearth of both in my upbringing.\u00a0\u00a0Am I now, in attempting through the ways I treat my children to right certain wrongs done to me in those realms, thereby inadvertently creating other wrongs?\n\n\n\nIn a word? Yes. (At least becoming a parent sometimes helps us to better understand and empathize with our own parents!)\n\n\n\nHome we walked, Z stomping and screaming the entire way. I could not carry her, because I was walking her bike. G, though, was on his bike, and I very reluctantly let him ride away from the ruckus. Since Z\u2019s walk-yelling slowed us down, G got home maybe four minutes before we did.\n\n\n\nHe awaited us at the very edge of the driveway. Hesitantly, looking slightly uncomfortable, G asked, \u201cDid that woman give you my message?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\n\nI looked over at my filthy car: \u201cHelp, my Mama is gone\u201d was written in the dust on the back hatch.\n\n\n\nBut Z was\u00a0radioactive\u00a0and I needed to get her inside. A public tantrum can be remarkably depleting for all concerned. Safely in the house, she proceeded to glower her way through dinner. She lost the privilege of dessert after refusing to respond to basic queries and jovial repartee. After several further chances she also lost the popcorn, DVD, and nightly reading of Harry Potter privileges and was banished to the bathroom to prepare for bed. Which she also refused to do. As I was lifting her onto the toilet in the hope that she would deign to use it (channeling Xiao Chuan Ayi all along: \u201cYou know what? Now I am going to have to lift your body onto the toilet,\u201d stated very, very dispassionately), she pulled hard at my thumb and I heard, through the din, a ripping sound.\n\n\n\nZ had torn a ligament in my thumb.\n\n\n\nFunny how one can painstakingly remove oneself from all sorts of negative situations and then find oneself feeling violated by a small child in the home that houses you both. As Z gets older, the violence of her tantrums is increasing, along with her capacity for destruction. Still, there is hope here: she seems to be gaining more security and so is tantruming somewhat less frequently while enjoying more healthy reactions overall.\n\n\n\nI can imagine a time when Z will have learned to calibrate and refine her social persona to the point where her behavior \u2013 at least in public -- is entirely ordinary.\n\n\n\nAs for G, I am not so sure. It turns out that while he had been waiting in the driveway for us to return from the swimming hole, he had run out into the road and flagged down a car to tell the (female) driver that his \u201cMama had disappeared,\u201d and asked her to \u201cplease, try to find her, and tell her that I am looking for her.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn subsequent conversations G admitted that his actions had not made a lots of sense, considering that he had seen me mere minutes before at the swimming hole and had known Z was having a colossal tantrum. He just could not put all the relevant information together through his anxiety. Perhaps this was a Theory of Mind** Moment.\n\n\n\nCome to think of it, a woman\u00a0had\u00a0slowed way down and peered at me in a strange way as we were walking home.\n\n\n\nAnd here I\u2019d thought she had given me the look because of my beet-red, wild-haired, screamin\u2019-like-a-banshee daughter!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0I love this quote from\u00a0The Autism Revolution, by Martha Herbert, MD, PhD with Karen Weintraub: \u201cI\u2019d rather spend time with someone who is interested in me than someone who is trying to fix me or always telling me to do stuff that doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d (p. 162).\n\n**\u00a0Theory of Mind\u00a0is a philosophical/psychological concept that is sometimes used by neurotypical theorists to describe some expressions of autism wherein an individual may be \u2013\u00a0or seem to be\u00a0-- unable to project or attribute mental states beyond his or her own to others.\u00a0\u00a0Here, one\u00a0might\u00a0say that G was unable to conceptualize where we were if we were not at home with him\u00a0\u00a0(as we should logically and historically have been). This theory, though, can be turned around to accuse neurotypical people of not having a Theory of Mind that would fit in a more autistic-centric world\u2026\n\n\n\nIf you do go to this link, please read to the bottom of the autism part, where you will find a more nuanced view:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-summer-idyll-full-spectrum-style.html", "title": "\nA Summer Idyll, Full Spectrum Style\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 10, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nFirst, the corny bit: I walked into the ocean late this\nsummer in a foul mood and, seeing how vast and impervious she was, had the\ntremendously novel idea of dropping my burdens into her salty depths. Then,\ncrying and exhausted and overwhelmed and a little relieved, I sent out a\nprayer/question, \u201cHow do I live a life of peace?\u201d The answer washed over me\nright away: \u201cThe way to live a life of peace is to live a life of peace.\u201d I\nprobably read this in a Dalai Lama book or some such but still it actually sank\nin at that moment. \n\n\n\nThe answer was simple, maybe obvious, but, for me, to truly\nfeel it was revelatory. As an erstwhile\nyoga student and teacher, I have often noticed how many times we humans can\nhear the same thing but never really listen. One day, if we are lucky, we\nactually hear a teaching \u2013\n\u201cListen to your breath,\u201c or \u201cRelax your diaphragm or \u201cLet go\u201d\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 and it\u2019s, um, deep.\n\n\n\nSo of course I then thought to ask ANOTHER question, because\nI am greedy like that. \u201cOkay,\u201d I conceded, \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, but just how\nexactly do I ride the waves of my amazing yet zany life?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRide the waves,\u201d came her reply. \n\n\n\n\n\nNow it\u2019s good old back to school time and the waves are in\nfull force. G hearing me say \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to go,\u201d and slipping his\nsneakers on the wrong, sock-less feet and running out the door in his underwear\nand pajama shirt, Z making her teacher wait an extra ten minutes at the end of\nthe day because she is \u201chelping\u201d her friend pack her backpack and making sure\nshe, Z, is in total control. \n\n\n\nAt the end of each day, I try to sort of gather together the\nturbulences \u2013 good and less-so -- of the day and settle the clan into a smooth,\npeaceful sleep.\n\n\n\nFirst comes Z\u2019s bedtime routine. Since she has excellent executive\nfunction, she can be given ten steps at once and she will follow them --\nefficiently and in order. She might potentially add two or three nefarious and\nunwanted (by parent, teacher, etc.) steps as well if left to her own devices,\nbut she can keep lots and lots and lots of instructions and information in\norder in her mind. She needs no prompting to follow an impeccable bedtime\nroutine in which all the right parts get cleaned, voided, brushed and rendered\nship-shape.\n\n\n\nYet putting Z to bed is sometimes an unhappy time, a time of\nstruggle. Most days, worrisome and/or upsetting behaviors have occurred and I\nwonder if I should process them with her at bedtime.\u00a0 As I am tucking Z in, I may remind her of certain things I\nam trying to teach her. Just as many social rules that seem obvious to\nneurotypical people do not seem naturally clear or obvious to people with\nautism, Z, as a small person with an attachment disorder, needs help navigating\nthe ethical universe most people try their best to share.\n\n\n\nI might tell her, \u201cYou need to follow the same rules as\nother students, like when it is time to leave the classroom everybody leaves\ntogether,\u201d or \u201cDuring school it is a time to listen and respect your teacher.\u201d\nVariations on the phrase, \u201cTelling the truth sometimes seems harder than lying\nbut in the long run it\u2019s a better thing to do \u2013 and you will get in less\ntrouble, too!\u201d are frequent contenders for this nighttime slot. \n\n\n\nI always try to remember to add, \u201cTomorrow will be a better\nday,\u201d especially on the really rocky days. After all, hope is so important! As\ndefeated as I may feel, I also try to sing her a song, sometimes a very short\nsong, and give her a kiss. Then I escape before she can get me with \u201cpuny arm!\u201d\n(If she puts her [puny] arm around me I pretend to fall asleep.)\n\n\n\nI know rationally that the primary caregiver is the one with\nwhom the child with an attachment disorder displays the most reactivity and\ntesting. Some nights, though, I desperately wish we could just snuggle, that my snuggling wouldn\u2019t feel like it was\ntranscending another rough day, that it would just feel simple. \n\n\n\nYou know, like living a life of peace. *\n\n\n\nAs Anne Morrow Lindbergh says, in Gift from the Sea, \u201cDon't wish me happiness -- \n\nI don't expect to be happy all the time...It's gotten beyond\nthat somehow.\n\nWish me courage and strength and a sense of humor. I will\nneed them all.\u201d With this daughter of mine, how I pray for courage and strength\nand \u2013 above all - a sense of humor.\n\n\n\nThen it is bedtime for G. G does best being told one to\nthree (max!) steps at a time and is very literal. His bedtime routine requires\nsome oversight to make sure he enacts the most basic aspects \u2013 brushing teeth,\nusing the toilet\u2026Order of direction is important, too: he will not think twice\nabout taking his fluoride pill before brushing his teeth, for example, if\nthat\u2019s the order in which they are mentioned. \n\n\n\nAfter he gets ready for bed, as I am walking into his room,\nG often runs in, leaps into his bed, pulls the covers over his head and shouts,\n\u201cMom, try to find me!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201dMom, try to find me\u201d??? I am sitting on the edge of your\nbed, from whence your voice is clearly issuing!\n\n\n\nI hate when he does this. It makes me catastrophize and\nproject that he will never, ever be able to be all right on his own. \n\n\n\nBut on this particular night of which I write, the night of\nthe leaving-the-house-in-underwear day, I \u2013 as usual -- laugh and tickle him\nand cuddle up to tell his nightly story:\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a brave\nand noble knight named Sir G-ahad, and he was known far, far across the land\nfor saving unicorns, and seals, and anything else in need, and for being a\nlittle bit different, and for being brave and kind. [All of his stories start\nin this way.**]\n\n\n\nOne day, as Sir G-ahad was sitting\nin the court at Camelot, a beautiful Princess came running in and cried, \u201cSir\nG-ahad, Sir G-ahad, a terrible dragon has stolen my unicorn!!!\u201d\n\n\n\nThen she looked at Sir G-ahad and\nstarted laughing because Sir G-ahad was in his underwear and a T-shirt and the\nshirt was tucked into his underwear. AND he was wearing his noble knight boots\non the wrong feet and without stockings! The Princess was laughing so hard she\nlost her faith in the brave and kind Sir G-ahad and left to find another\nchampion for her cause. [G looked very sad as I told this part of the story.]\n\n\n\nWell, that Princess searched far\nand wide and no knight was able to help her, though many tried and failed,\nbecause no knight was quite as brave and noble and kind as Sir G-ahad. Finally\nshe returned to Camelot, and found Sir G-ahad at the round table wearing a more\nnormal outfit.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d the Princess told Sir\nG-ahad. \u201cI think I have learned my lesson that I should never have judged you\nbecause you were a little bit different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou were right in a way too,\u201d\nadmitted Sir G-ahad. \u201cA knight should pay at least some attention to his noble\nattire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat said, Sir G-ahad set off on\nhis noble knight steed, Corny the unicorn, found the terrible dragon, drew his\nmighty sword and \u2013 lickety-split -- the dragon ran crying home to his Mama.\n\n\n\nAnd everyone said, \u201cThank you, Sir\nG-ahad. You saved a unicorn\u2026again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nI sing him a little song and eventually start to get up. G\ngrabs me and almost knocks me out with a headbutt from his giant, rock-hard\nhead. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh, G,\u201d I groan. \u201cCan you please try to be more aware of\nwhere my body is?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \n\n\n\nFair enough.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know too. Our Full Spectrum runs from\nthe gifts and challenges of aspergers to the wounds of -- and efforts to heal\n-- reactive attachment disorder. Before either of my children had a label, I\nspent even more time feeling tumbled in this ocean of parenthood. A lot of\nparenting advice besides \n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLove your children, and\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBe consistent\n\nis useless in my situation. At least now I know why a lot of\nthe standard stuff doesn\u2019t work\u00a0 --\nand a few things that do, thanks to the insights that came with those labels.\nNow I also know \u201cride the waves\u201d and \u201clive a life of peace,\u201d which feel like\nthey can be applied to just about any situation if I can remember to do so\namidst the unruliness of daily life.\n\n\n\nWaves, try to find me! I\u2019ll be hiding under this here Living\na Life of Peace blanket,\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n* Joke.\n\n** Z gets the same format: her chivalrous deeds are done\nunder the banner of Sir Shawty. \n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/09/mom-try-to-find-me.html", "title": "\n\"Mom, try to find me!\"\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 27, 2012", "body": "\nMany of our friends and family members are educators, and\nmany care intensely about what is taught in our schools. I myself am a teacher.\nSo I feel a bit disloyal and even heretical saying this: as far as my own kids\ngo, I don\u2019t care, like, even at all\nabout curriculum.\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, I had always planned to homeschool my children,\nbut circumstances conspired to bring me one child who doesn\u2019t necessarily want\nbut desperately needs all the socializing he can get and one who would probably\ngo postal within three consecutive days spent with Mama and without major\nsocial activity. For Z, adult acolytes will do in a pinch, but peer adulation\nand goose-stepped errand-running is preferred; for E, the biggest school\nlessons are ones he doesn\u2019t necessarily learn at home: that while everybody is\ndifferent, most people judge others for being different; that we can\u2019t spend\nall our time reading; that people change their minds and plans change; how to \"read\" unfamiliar situations effectively\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure I \u2013 Usefulness of Curriculum Excellence Pie Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this scientific pie chart demonstrates, most learners\nbenefit enormously from a thoughtful, organized curriculum.\u00a0 I contend that my children, along with\ncertain others such as perhaps some gifted students, or some with significant delays or\nlearning differences, do not. It\u2019s not that curriculum excellence always\nimpinges on these students or is a negative thing, it just does not matter as\nit would for other students. My learners gain most from teachers of exceptional character\nand eagle eyes. So I don\u2019t particularly care if they spend a day chasing\ncaterpillars in the meadow or making 3-D models of the Green Mountains. \n\n\n\nIn my ideal world, time spent on curriculum development (not\nto mention test-prep \u2013 another post!) might well be used to consider and\nresearch how to teach contentment or generosity or ways to encourage curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in this reality, teachers don\u2019t have that kind of\nfreedom, regardless of whether they would willingly toe the Full Spectrum line.\nSo I care that -- insofar as possible -- my kids have shining morning faces and\ndon\u2019t get dragged down by awful beastly kids or dreadful,\nserving-time-until-retirement teachers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nG spends most of his time at home reading and learning thereby. At school, this direct absorption of knowledge is somewhat compromised\nby wide-ranging sensory and emotional overload.* In other words, much of his actual intellectual progress probably occurs at home.\n\n\n\nZ isn\u2019t too interested in books\u2026yet. But she could\nefficiently extract all the necessary knowledge for an astronomical level of\nsuccess from two potatoes, a rotten log and a maraca.\n\n\n\nSo, if not book-larnin\u2019 and curricula, what can teachers\noffer such children?\n\n\n\nWhat I hope for from teachers is:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they be kind,\u00a0and\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they model empathy,\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\ngood judgment, and \n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nintegrity; and\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nhold an atmosphere where bullying is simply and absolutely not\na possibility either for potential perpetrators OR victims.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKindness: I hope it is not too much to hope that the logic\nbehind requesting kindness of elementary school teachers is a no-brainer.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEmpathy: Some non-autistic people SAY that people with autism\nlack empathy. This has not been my experience at all. G is the most softhearted\nperson I know. I will say it is sometimes a stretch for him to understand what\nother people are feeling when his senses and neurons are feeling assaulted, but\nonce G knows what's up he cares and understands and acts on those feelings. That is, he empathizes, often too much (so that his\nfeelings become painful and he finds it hard to function...).\u00a0 Z sometimes lacks empathy because she\nis in survival mode.\u00a0 Teachers with\nhealthy instincts for and expressions of this emotion offer lessons in\npositive, pro-social empathy that students can carry throughout their entire\nlives. \n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGood judgment: discernment, moderation, discipline and common\nsense are elusive for G, optional for Z; as much as possible, they need to see them\nin action.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIntegrity: I want my children to see their most esteemed role\nmodels as people who follow their consciences and follow through on their word.\nIn a classroom setting, this could be as plain as setting clear rules and\nconsequences. When G kicked his cat because his cat knocked over his beloved\nfish\u2019s tank and killed the fish, he felt guilty. I told him, \u201cThat was a\nnatural thing to do \u2013 your cat will forgive you and you\u2019ll do better next\ntime.\u201d When he told his teacher \u2013 a former Buddhist monk \u2013 about this incident,\nhis teacher (in the context of an appropriate lesson for the whole classroom, in which many students apparently thought kicking a cat was funny) vehemently scolded him. I like that his teacher did this: he wasn\u2019t\ntrying to make himself popular, nor was he taking the easy, lame approach; he\nwas speaking the truth as he knew it. \n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNo Bullying: some kids, like G, are more vulnerable to being\nbullied or, like Z, to being bullies. Both kinds lose in a chaotic classroom.\nWhen teachers hold the classroom space as a safe one, everyone wins. This fall,\nI finally had an opportunity to enlist Z\u2019s strengths in a positive fashion. A\nlittle boy from her preschool had enrolled in kindergarten and right off the\nbat was getting bullied on the playground by some fifth grade boys. Z hasn\u2019t\ngot a bit of \u201cvictim\u201d on and I knew that by her patronage alone, this sweet\nlittle boy would be safe. As well, her kindest instincts would be called into\nplay in caring for this wee friend. Now I just hope those fifth graders are\nok. \n\n\n\nI spend my advocacy, that tacit, somewhat-limited leeway\nevery parent has, on the above qualities. As long as teachers are decent people\nand in charge of the classroom we\u2019re good. We have done very well so far \u2013\nafter all, why do people choose to become teachers? (Hint: it\u2019s not the\nlucrative salary.)\u00a0 I figure the\nclan can always learn \u201cthe new math,\u201d but if their hearts are hurting that\u2019s a MUCH bigger issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Here is an example. At the end of fourth grade, G\u2019s class\nhad an end-of-school open house to share the students\u2019 Native American\nprojects.\u00a0 There were So! Many!\npeople in that classroom, and so many sights, bright lights and sounds to take\nin, that I began to get a migraine. Consequently, at this event, I could barely\nsee people and when I could they made me nervous as I couldn\u2019t even fathom or\nread what they were thinking and feeling in that context.\u00a0 I had a compelling urge to flee.\n\n\n\nAdding to that urge was the fact that G was wandering around\naimlessly, talking loudly and constantly to anyone nearby without even looking\nat his putative listener to see if he was being heard.\n\n\n\nHaving cornered them in a relatively quiet spot, I asked his\nteachers, \u201cIs he always like this in the classroom?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d they told me, with love in their voices,\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith all due respect to G\u2019s WONDERFUL teachers, HOW, then,\ncan he LEARN?\u00a0 I mean, I know he\nlearns some stuff but there must be so much that is lost in the process!\n\n\n\u00a0On our walk home\nthat day I shared that being in that classroom was very challenging for me.\n\n\u201cIs it challenging\nfor you?\u201d I wondered, casually.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that why you\ntalk a lot sometimes, and in a loud voice?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Having been so profoundly overloaded, I was daunted to realize that this is what G and all students and their teachers deal with every day.

Sharing in\nkitchen chores is something Z really enjoys, an opportunity for us to have\nplain old fun together, so I tried again. \n\n\n\n\u201cZ,\u201d I repeated, perhaps the tiniest smidge more\nemphatically, \u201cPlease come downstairs.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe came to stand near me as I bustled about. \n\n\n\n\u201cSorry Mama,\u201d she informed me, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you the first\ntime.\u201d\n\n\n\nHmm.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, if you didn\u2019t hear me, \u201c I sputtered, \u201cHow would you have known I called you the first time, then?\u201d\n\n\n\nBlank look.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, never mind!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNormal?\u201d Perhaps. (Although not in the autism area of our\nFull Spectrum.) In the context of the rest of that day\u2019s events, this exchange\nemerges as one of many instances of survival-motivated behaviors that add up to\nan overall tendency toward evasiveness and, therefore, at least in our case,\ndishonesty.\n\n\n\nHow does one raise a child inclined to subterfuge? On even\nthe most minor points, Z tends toward confabulation. That is, her disorder (for confabulation implies an illness, often\ndementia) inclines her toward making up whatever answer is most suitable to her\nneeds.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWe have made some real progress with tantrums since the\nearly days (see, for example, http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/06/needhelp.html)\nbut the more subtle matters of day-to-day integrity are an ongoing trial. \n\n\nI was recently\ntalking with my mother about why I haven\u2019t really explored the online world of\nattachment disorders in the same way that I have those of autism and aspergers\nsyndrome. I told her I thought it was because most autism sites seem to\ncelebrate people\u2019s differences while I feared attachment disorder sites would\njust make me scared or sad. I knew that they might make me feel less alone in\nour struggles, but I suspected hearing about other people being as hopeless and\ndesperate as I have sometimes been would be depressing. \n\n\n\nWhen I googled \u201cattachment disorders,\u201d the first site I\nended up on was: \n\nhttp://adoption.families.com/blog/a-letter-to-our-new-neighbors-about-our-rad-daughter.\n\n\n\nI had landed on a link to a letter on a parenting site, from a mother\nof a child with an attachment disorder to her new neighbors. Her daughter was\nquickly forming intense friendships with people in her new neighborhood and\nthis Mama was concerned about the healthy development of those relationships.\n\n\n\nI know how she felt having to write that letter. When you\nhave a child with an attachment disorder, sometimes you feel like you need to\nwrite similar letters, over and over, even to some of the closest people around\nyou. \n\n\n\nA Context Spectrum comes to mind: yes, I understand that\nsometimes {insert behavior} is \u201cnormal\u201d (and, hey, maybe you are trying to make\nus feel better \u2013 thanks!) but in a context of {behavior}, {behavior}, and\n{behavior}, it is NOT normal. And to ignore it will NOT help, in fact it will\nalmost certainly make things worse.\u00a0\nSo please, dear {recipient of letter}, understand that we need to handle\nthis in a way that might seem overly strict to you, but, beloved {recipient of\nletter}, trust me that you do Not know best in this context.\n\n\n\nThis letter-writing Mama\u2019s daughter is, like Z, incredibly\ncharming and engaging, and her mother is worried \u2013 for good reason \u2013 that her\ndaughter\u2019s interactions with neighbors may spiral out of balance in any number\nof ways. \n\n\n\nHer letter most definitely touched a nerve.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t go to any other attachment disorder sites that day.\n\n\n\nI had a vague idea about attachment disorders but assumed\nsince I brought Z home under the age of one she would be unaffected by this\nillness.\n\n\n\nThe fact that I was unable to put Z down for a year or so\n(according to those with intact memories of this period [not including me])\nwithout causing an unremitting stream of bloodcurdling screams to emit from her\ntiny mouth might have indicated that something unusual was going on. I\nattributed her neediness to her exceptional intelligence and sensitivity, as\nwell as to her temperament, about which our guides in China had warned us. I\ncan still remember \u201cRose,\u201d standing at the front of our bus with a microphone,\nannouncing with a big grin, \u201cSince they are from Jiangxi Province, your\ndaughters are gonna be Spicy!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe contrast between the plump, smiling, radiant six-month\nold baby in the referral picture I received and the scrawny, closed-faced child\nof nine months and three weeks that I met was stark. What happened in those\nthree months? Was it something specific, like hunger or abuse? Or was it just\nthat my incredibly perceptive girl had noticed that something was missing?\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI thought that once I brought her home and fattened her up a\nbit that jolly baby Z would re-emerge unscathed. It hasn\u2019t been that simple.\nLoving my vibrant, wonderful yet troubled daughter has not been enough to heal\nher \u2013 yet; and we have searched at length for therapeutic modes of discipline\nthat will actually work.\n\n\nWhen I first brought\nhome my \u201cfirst and best-behaved child,\u201d Pancha, who happened to be a dog\n(Figure I), I resolved to never say \u201cbad dog!\u201d \u201cBad dog\u201d just sounded so mean. Love the sinner, hate the\nsin! I decided, instead, to call her \u201cpoorly behaved\u201d if she did something\n\u201cbad.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I -- The beautiful Pancha,* a.k.a. Sri Sri Sri\nPanchananda-ji, Gabooboogee, The Punk\n\nPancha joined my\nhousehold when I was in the early years of graduate school and was living on a\nfellowship that only barely paid the bills. Every once in awhile \u2013 as in, every\nyear or so -- I would buy something new to wear; slightly more often I\u2019d\nindulge in second-hand clothes from the 96th Street Salvation Army.\n\nWhen Pancha was still a puppy, I purchased a precious,\nprecious new pair of shoes. She promptly chewed them to pieces. I was\ndevastated and determined to prevent such an event ever recurring. I put her on\nher back to show her who was boss and scolded her with a mighty wrath. She\ntrembled, cowering and groveling in guilt and remorse. Except \u2013 as she cowered and groveled in guilt and remorse, she\nreached out with one paw and \u2013 dink, dink \u2013 played with a toy. \n\n\nMy daughter reminds me a lot of Pancha: brilliant,\nbeautiful, vivacious, punk, very lovable, very hungry \u2013 and with a bifurcated\nmind. One part focused on pleasing Mama, the other (larger) on getting what she\nwants\u2026Conscience? \u201cIs still acquiring this skill,\u201d as they say on Vermont\nreport cards. My beautiful dog and my beautiful daughter: both quite good at\naping respect; underneath that surface layer, both convinced that they should\ntake control. It was cute in a small dog, in a small person it is sometimes\ndisturbing. \n\n\n\nZ doesn\u2019t even do the fake remorse, groveling or cowering.\nIf Z is found out in a lie or poorly behaved activity she is, not to put too\nfine a point on it, pissed. She has to be reminded, often firmly obliged, to\nsay she is sorry.\u00a0 The jury is\nstill out on whether forced apology works on any non-superficial level or is an\nacceptable parenting tool, beyond the most simple and public of social\nsituations (i.e., \u201cPlease apologize to that other child for cutting in line\u201d).\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nA wise aunt once told me, \u201cBe careful that you don\u2019t scold\nyour child in a way that makes her begin to have a picture of herself as \u2018the\nbad one.\u201d I\u2019ve tried to combine that with the notion of \u201cpoorly behaved\u201d to\nmanage Z\u2019s disordered actions as actions\nper se -- and not character flaws. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve made major progress\nwith tantrums. We are down from multiples every day to an average of one or two\nreal humdingers a week! \n\n\n\nBut Z\u2019s general approach to life seems still to be one of\npragmatic get-what-I-want-with-a-minimum-of-obstacles-ism. Despite my never\nusing this word with her, when I ask Z why she did a given \u201cbad\u201d thing she will\nanswer me with a shrug, \u201cBecause I am bad.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure II -- Self Portrait by Z, casually left on the\ndrawing table \n\n\n\nDuring a Harry Potter camp last summer, the kids brought\nhome stuffed owls and kept them in their windows. A mysterious \u201csomeone\u201d would\nsend notes every night (for a very long time, every night, until, indeed, the\nowls got very \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cretired\u201d to chairs and beds!). Over and over again Z\nreceived notes that affirmed her essential, innate goodness, in words she could\nunderstand: \u201cLet your good heart shine,\u201d \u201c You are so kind inside \u2013 don\u2019t be\nafraid to let your kindness out!\u201d and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure III \u2013 Drawing under the drawing in Figure II:\nslightly comforting in the drawing\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0context spectrum, assuming she is the one with the wings...\n\n\n\nAround this fall\nequinox I had a talk with G and Z about what the equinox represents -- the\nequal day and night hours, the meaning of equanimity, finding balance\u2026\n\n\n\nI shared that I felt like my teaching work had taken over\nall my writing and yoga practice time (please see http://whitewhine.com/) and that I felt out\nof balance for that reason. I asked them if there was anything in their lives\nthat needed to be in better balance.\n\nG replied that he\nfelt that his life was in a good balance. \n\nThen Z announced,\n\u201cI\u2018m too bad. I\u2019m going to stop being bad, just like I stopped biting my\nnails.\u201d\u00a0 (Her quitting a serious\nnail-biting habit is an example I always use for her to remind her of her\nstrong will power.) \n\n\u201cOh, Z, you are not\nbad,\u201d I reassured her, \u201cSometimes you may do a thing that seems bad but that\u2019s\njust because you are hurting inside.\u201d \n\n\n\nThis is, after all, how I explain unkindness, cruelty,\nlashing out and general chumpitude to myself and to my son, on his spot on the\nFull Spectrum. I prefer this explanation to one of selfishness, and in Z\u2019s case\nI believe it holds true.\u00a0 It is my\nfailure as her Mama that all my linguistic somersaults have not prevented my\ndaughter from thinking she is \u201cbad.\u201d \n\n\n\nNor have my modes of discipline made much progress: Did Z\nstop being poorly behaved?

{"date": "Monday, October 29, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nA year or so ago the Full Spectrum family was having brunch\nwith another couple and their children.\u00a0\nOther Couple had a son a little older than G who was neurotypical,\n\u201ccool\u201d and athletic but usually willing to accommodate G\u2019s Pokemon obsession\nduring family get-togethers. \n\n\n\nKnowing we were to see this family, G had been planning for\ndays which Pokemon cards he would bring to show Other Couple\u2019s Son, a fellow he admired quite a bit. \n\n\n\nWhen we showed up at their door, though, Son had a friend\nover. A similarly \u201ccool\u201d friend, of his own age. G\u2014always wary of three -- immediately\ntore into an excited preventative monologue about Pokemon for Son. Son just as\nimmediately announced, scornfully and for benefit of Friend, \u201cI hate Pokemon.\u201d \n\n\n\nG\u2019s little face crumpled. \n\n\n\nThere are kinds of valor that are not in history books, but\nthat matter greatly all the same. Among these, we ought to include the bravery\nof a little boy who has just been dissed and dismissed and stands his ground\nthere in the hallway.\n\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon G, let\u2019s go get some food,\u201d I said, throwing an arm\naround him and pulling him toward the kitchen -- probably embarrassing him but\nmaking him to know he was very loved.\n\n\n\n\n\nA little later Other Wife was showing me some renovations\naround the house while our husbands, Z and G hung out with the bagels. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she confided, \u201cThis is really hard for Son.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, genuinely perplexed.\n\n\n\n\u201cDealing with G being here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I still had no idea what she meant.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little girl I had a cousin who used to come\nover and she was\u2026well, like we used to say, \u2018retarded,\u2019 and it was very hard\nfor me to be around her.\u201d\n\n\n\nI stood there, speechless. Was she saying that G, who has\nautism and is academically gifted, is \u201cretarded?\u201d Or that being around\n\u201cretarded\u201d people is terribly hard for the \u201cnon-retarded?\u201d\n\n\n\nI had been warned by several friends about this woman. They\ncalled her \u201cCrazy Carla.\u201d* Having been a victim of smear campaigns myself\n(small town viciousness, epic yoga world pettiness), I always try to give\npeople the benefit of the doubt. I was aware from my own interactions with her\nthat Carla was high strung, but I hadn\u2019t seen the full extent of her possible\n\u201ccraziness\u201d until now. \n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel, though, that what she was saying\naloud might reflect the way a lot of other people feel without giving voice to\nthose feelings.\n\n\n\nShe backtracked a little: \u201cI\u2019m not exactly saying that G is\na \u2018retard\u2019 but Son doesn\u2019t know how to deal with having someone\u2026like him\naround! So that\u2019s, you know, really hard on him. I feel bad for him.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhere I am at on the Spectrum, I have a really hard time\nexpressing myself when I am overwhelmed by sensory or emotional input. After\nthis statement, I literally shut down. I have no memory of responding in any\nway. \n\n\n\nRetorts I wish had popped into my mind in a timely fashion: \n\n\u201cReally? Is your child reading\nHawking?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh\u2026I guess retards should be treated with disdain!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay -- G has a hard time\nwith A-holes and I think he\u2019s doing pretty well with it today.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably you should have just\npretended your cousin didn\u2019t exist! It\u2019s very inconvenient when people are\ndifferent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just made me want to die\u2026for\nso many reasons.\u201d\n\nOr even -- but I was not and still\nam not personally enlightened and big enough for this one -- \u201cWhat do you\nmean?\u201d\n\n\n\nWe went back down to the kitchen. Pardner said later that my\nface was grey. We left after awhile.\n\n\n\nI never said anything. Much like when people ask, regarding\nZ, \u201cIs she your REAL child?\u201d I feel like, if you really just opened your mouth\nand said that, what is there to say? I do \u2013 obviously! \u2013 believe in working\nwith people whenever possible around accepting differences, universal equality,\nand so on. Nevertheless, there are people who are receptive to expanding their\nempathy and understanding and people who are willfully ignorant. (Please see\nAnn Coulter and http://www.change.org/petitions/ann-coulter-public-apology-for-constantly-using-the-r-word!)\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made for reclaiming a word such as\n\u201cretard,\u201d too. Along with feminists (and others) reclaiming derogatory words about women,\npeople of different ethnicities (and others) reclaiming disparaging words about their ethnic\ngroups (insofar as such things exist in any clear way), Wiccans (and others) reclaiming the\nword \u201cWitch,\u2019 and so forth, certain individuals can and do lay claim to\nappropriating \u201cretard\u201d for their own positive purposes. That is a different\nissue. \n\n\n\nIn this day and age, there is no excuse for using the word\n\u201cretard\u201d about a child. None. \n\n\n\nAs for \u201cCrazy,\u201d well, most of my favorite people are a little nuts. Good nuts.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n* Crazy Carla\u2019s name has been changed (the Carla part, not\nthe Crazy).\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/10/crazy-carla-retards.html", "title": "\nCrazy Carla & the Retards\n"},

I will take very good care of her and find her a home in our new home\nso she will feel better.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough I\u2019d considered abandoning her as well, I also\npacked up the painted resin garden fairy with the broken wing. \n\n\n\n\n\nIII.

Team Good\n\nOn Election Night, G was goofing around at the dinner table,\ncracking himself (and Pardner and me) up with talk of \u201cDemo-Craps\u201d and\n\u201cRe-Butt-licans,\u201d(the finer implications of which I hope escaped him).\nSometimes, though, G gets \u201cstuck,\u201d and he would not stop saying these words despite my telling him he was not\nusing language suitable for a seven-year-old. \n\n\n\nZ covered her ears and, with her clear, dark, never tame but\nperhaps increasingly civilized eyes, looked right into mine. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat is not appropriate, G,\u201d she announced, holding my\ngaze, \u201cand I am not listening!\u201d\n\n\n\nSince I am Z\u2019s primary caregiver, she focuses a great deal\nof oppositional energy on me. It was such an incredibly nice feeling to have a\nmoment where I felt she and I were so clearly on the same \u201cteam,\u201d a brief\nrespite where she felt safe enough to let down her defiant defenses and join\nwith me in an effort to give her shelter \u2013 even if that shelter was merely from\na grody eleven-year-old.\n\n\n\nI think she felt it too. Later, she wrote me a letter, \u201cthak\nyou for that diner\u201d [thank you for that dinner] and signed it \u201clove form\nshorde\u201d [love from Shorty].\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nV. The Hope of a Mother\n\nWhen glimmers of empathy and Do-Right shine through the\ndaily power struggles they are a balm for the Full Spectrum soul. \n\n\n\nZ showed me we have plenty of love and caring to share with\nevery member of this forever family, even those of us who might be referred to\nas imperfect\u2026or inanimate. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s showed me that although it may take a little longer\nthan we\u2019d like, a frightened creature can learn to trust \u2013 and that with that\ntrust comes the possibility of walls coming down.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve begun to hope that, in the fullness of time, Z will use\nher substantial magnetism and undeniable, very tall and large will for the sake of goodness and\njustice. \n\n\n\nI leave you with this Emily Dickinson poem about hope. It\noften pops into my mind both when I feel hopeless, and, like now, when I feel\nthe power of hope. \n\n\n\n254\n\n\n\n\"Hope\" is the thing with feathers\u2014\n\nThat perches in the soul\u2014\n\nAnd sings the tune without the words\u2014\n\nAnd never stops\u2014at all\u2014\n\n\n\nAnd sweetest\u2014in the Gale\u2014is heard\u2014\n\nAnd sore must be the storm\u2014\n\nThat could abash the little Bird\n\nThat kept so many warm\u2014\n\n\n\nI've heard it in the chillest land\u2014\n\nAnd on the strangest Sea\u2014\n\nYet, never, in Extremity,\n\nIt asked a crumb\u2014of Me. \n\n\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/11/suite-shorty-hedgehog-eyes.html", "title": "\nSuite: Shorty Hedgehog Eyes\n"},

These include, on the one\nhand, exceptional sassiness or dorkiness\nof oral interaction styles and, on the other, widely disparate levels of verbal\nagility.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are two more topics to consider: repetition and volume.\n\n\n\nG and Z loooove to repeat. Single words, questions,\nquotations, astute observations, not-so-astute observations, random sounds\u2026all\nare fodder for extensive repetition. This shared habit is rooted in two very\ndifferent sources: G\u2019s mind seems to get drawn into a pattern - he\u2019ll blurt out\na word or phrase from time to time, sometimes for days, as the neural impulse\nstrikes; Z likes uninterrupted attention, which speech can bring, but she also\nself-soothes \u2013 and learns --with patter. \n\n\n\nWe use the same tool inclusive of these two distinct\ncontexts. Since it works well in our household, it just might work in a wide\nrange of families. I therefore offer: \n\n\n\nA Good Rule for Parents and People:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe One Time Rule\n\nThings may only be said ONE\nTIME.\u00a0 If something is repeated,\nMama \u2013 often in cahoots with the currently non-repeating child \u2013 may utter the\npowerful phrase, \u201cOne Time Rule\u201d\u2026as many times as is necessary.\n\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Awesome [or insert your dreadful trending word here] Rule\n\nEach child may utter the word\n\u201cawesome\u201d ONE TIME per diem.\n\nFor some reason, this has worked.\nGood thing, because we have yet to work out the Consequences.\n\n\n\nPartly because of low tone, G also has issues with volume\nmodulation. More specifically, he speaks very, very loudly, especially when\nexcited (and he\u2019s an enthusiastic guy). His speech volume is probably the\nsingle biggest obstacle to other kids\u2019 acceptance and comfort in his presence.\n\n\n\nWhen we are together as a family, I might say, \u201cStop\nshouting in my ear,\u201d \u201cTurn it Down, please,\u201d or \u201cI am RIGHT HERE.\u201d I don\u2019t want\nto humiliate him in public, though, so we have devised a sort of\nturning-down-a-radio-dial type motion that is meant to indicate to him that he\nneeds to try to modulate his voice to a quieter level. \n\n\n\nAlas, unless he is looking right at my finger, he doesn\u2019t\nnotice this signal! My gesture, then, gets bigger and bigger, progressing\ninitially to something resembling the \u201ccuckoo\u201d finger swirl and then evolving,\nas it widens, into a one-handed version of Jazz Hands. \n\n\n\nIn contrast, and no, I am not making this up just to, as it\nwere, fill my proverbial Spectrum, Z has issues with speaking at LOW volume.\nSpecifically, she prefers to speak At All Times, and so, if she has been asked\nto be quiet, she simply speaks much, much more quietly, typically in a very\nspecial language of her very own. This brings us to:\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0 The No Poltergeist Voices Rule\n\nIf your attachment disordered, or\notherwise anxiously garrulous, or perhaps even happily loquacious child has not\nstopped speaking in approximately seven hours (years) and if he or she insists\nupon whispering \u201cZI-guh-sa-ba ZI-guh-sa-ba\u201d over and over near your ear while\nyou are on the phone for Three Minutes after Paying Attention to her or him the\nEntire Day (or some similar situation), simply invoke the No Poltergeist Voices\nRule.\n\n\n\nThis might work.\n\n\n\nJazz Hands!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/11/speech-iiitools-ii.html", "title": "\nSpeech \u2013 III/Tools - II\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 13, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nI recently spent a morning meandering and gabbing with a\nbeloved friend. As we walked along a magical, secluded trail, she showed me\nsome special spots where her children play together. \u201cWe are here a lot because\nwe can\u2019t be in public right now,\u201d she confided. One of her children is going\nthrough a period of strong tantrums and the effort and strain of it in the\nsocial scene is just too much. She admitted how ashamed she feels when her\nchild throws a public tantrum and how her fear of getting caught in that\nsituation has vastly limited her social life. How isolating it can be\u2026Having\nread some of my experiences here (and heard about them in person and seen them\nin real life), she added, \u201cYou know how it is!\u201d Oh yes, Mama, I know how it\nis. \n\n\n\nThis conversation reminded me of some instances when I had\nno choice but to be out in the world while my children were going through\nchanges. Bleak times filled with helplessness, anger, sadness and humiliation\nfor all\u2026Happily, what also came to mind were the times when someone \u2013 often a\ncomplete stranger \u2013 gave me love, peace and strength just when I needed it. \n\n\n\nEverybody knows what a MILF is, right? Well, I want to talk\nabout MILCS: Mothers I\u2019d Like to Celebrate. I don\u2019t even know if some of these\npeople have children\u2026But they are MOTHERS, for sure. See if you don\u2019t agree.\n\n\n\nOnce, Z was having a ghastly tantrum and I had taken her\noutside to avoid disturbing G\u2019s tae kwon do class.\u00a0 People kept walking by and either totally avoiding us or\nlooking pityingly at the poor, poor little girl.\u00a0 Poor, poor little girl was so angry (no idea why, this was a\ndaily occurrence at the time\u2026) that nothing I knew of (not hugs, not threats of\nConsequences\u2026) would stop the screams of rage. I was near tears. \n\n\n\nAs I stood there, trying to shrink as small as possible\nwhile still indicating that the tantruming child had someone watching her (for\nwhat that someone was worth), a woman came up to me and said, simply, \u201cMom, you\nare doing okay.\u201d She wrapped me up in her arms and rocked me a little from side\nto side and then went on her way. \n\n\n\nHey you, lady who just hugged a pariah, you are doing more\nthan ok.\n\n\n\nOh, here\u2019s a good one. You know when someone thinks your\nchild with an attachment disorder has autism and that your child with autism is\nneurotypical, or vice versa? Yeah, that happens to me sometimes. \n\n\n\nI was at this fantastic storefront Aztec-Mexican restaurant\nin Norwalk, CT called Molcajetes (http://www.ctbites.com/home/2009/9/18/los-molcajetes-seriously-authentic-mexican-in-norwalk.html)\nwith extended family when Z threw one of her most remarkable, powerful tantrums\nof all time. Full Spectrum Grandmother tried to intervene and got kicked for\nher troubles\u2026Pardner tried joking her out of it with no luck\u2026\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next [period of time, I am not sure\nhow long!] or so I spent with my rocking, growling, kicking, screaming daughter\nout on the stoop, not one but TWO women with autistic sons walked by at\ndifferent times and commiserated with me\nover what they thought was a textbook autistic tantrum. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d I told each kind mother in turn. \u201cThe one with\nautism is sitting inside eating nicely!\u201d \n\n\n\nWhen Z was good and ready she pretty instantly stopped being\nupset and went inside and, with a big smile on her face, devoured enough food\n(fresh, garlicky guacamole and soft tacos and just-fried chips with that\nincredible slightly sweet cabbage salsa) to feed an army, which is kind of what\nshe was. You need fuel for that kind of sally!\n\n\n\nWhen Z was younger, I often felt as if people judged me as a\nmother for her behavior. I wished I could maybe wear a sign that said, \u201cThis is\nnot a normal tantrum. I have tried everything you (or I, or anyone) could\nimagine to stop this tantrum and many others like it. Yes, my daughter was just hitting me and screaming as if I was hitting\nher but I was not, actually, hitting her\u2026, as you can see right here with your\nown eyes. In fact, your staring at us might even fuel this little situation we\ngot going on here. Now, please, I just have to sit here and wait it out so I\nwould be so grateful if you would stop giving me dirty looks.\u201d \n\n\n\nNow that Z is a little older, people can tell her tantrums\nare not just run-of-the-mill. They can see that she is older than a \u201cnormal\u201d\nage for tantrums, and that she is writhing and screaming, extensively, without\nany input. They seem somewhat less likely to be appalled -- and rather more\nlikely to feel compassion for both the parent who stands helplessly witness to\nsuch an event and the child who cannot extricate herself from it \u2013 or let\nherself be extricated... \n\n\n\nG has his moments too, whether from his really rare but\nquite memorable public tantrums to his more common general\ninappropriateness/cluelessness, not to mention flailing. \n\n\n\nOne time, after a hard day, I said to G as we were leaving a\nlocal co-op, \u201cYou have the most important thing, a kind and loving heart. Now\nyou just need to pay attention to the world around you and work on your common\nsense.\u201d (This is one version of my ad-nauseam-aforementioned Pay Attention to\nthe World lectures.) \n\n\n\nWe had gotten into the car and had just begun to pull out of\nthe parking lot when a woman with a silver bob wearing a striking purple jacket\nand lots of chunky silver jewelry waved me down, practically throwing herself\nin front of the car. Thinking maybe I had forgotten one of my organic, vegan,\nsustainable, equal-exchange, wallet-straining purchases, I stopped and rolled\ndown my window.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cThat was one\nof the most inspiring things I have ever heard,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt will echo\ninside me for a long time. Thank you.\u201d \n\n\n\nNo, thank you, Ms.\nSilver-Purple Angel-Person. I will never forget you.\n\n\n\n\n\nI tell these tales not to brag or make it seem like I am\ndoing such a great job that was duly appreciated by these wise women (ha!), but\nto share that these women actually made it possible for me to Go On. Their simple acts of generosity\nhave resonated in my life for months and years. They allowed me the space and\npeace in which I could settle my heart back into love for my children instead\nof fear. They made it possible for me to celebrate my children, just as they\nare, and so I celebrate them. \n\n\n\nJust so, I hope when my friend who is stuck in the woods for\nnow with her clan reads this she will know how truly I honor her finding a way\nto celebrate her children through it all. In addition, I hope she will\nencounter surprising (yet very welcome) love and acceptance when she does have\nto put herself and her family \u201cout there,\u201d just as I did with these MILCS: huge-hearted\nstrangers, generous-spirited everyday angels who just \n\nWent For It.\n\n\n\nAnd guess what? We can all \u2013 in some way - do the same.\n\n\n\nWe all have the mental capacity to recognize opportunities\nto grow our hearts, to stretch a little or a lot. Sometimes it seems like we\ndon\u2019t have the emotional capacity to\nexecute such acts of kindness and generosity, whether it\u2019s due to emotive\nstinginess (high on the fear spectrum, no?) or the shyness of those on the\nawkward end of the social spectrum. It\u2019s probably easier to be surprisingly\nkind to strangers, as these women were to me, but we encounter countless such\nopportunities of all sorts every day. And I am not talking about the somewhat\ntrite \u201crandom acts of kindness\u201d trope, because these acts are more than random.\nThey are necessary.\n\n\n\nYou never know when your small action may make a real\ndifference in someone\u2019s life. Plus, I suspect our capacity to be generous and\nkind grows with the PRACTICE.\u00a0 Be\ngrateful for any everyday angel you meet\u2026and pass it on!\n\n\n\nLest this seem preachy, I should add I\u2019ve no idea what a\ngenerous spirit means to you in particular and no advice beyond the suggestion\nthat choosing kindness at a given moment may resonate more than you\u2019ll ever\nknow. \n\n\n\nThanks and love forever, MILCS, and all you others trying to\nmake sure your heart isn\u2019t several sizes too small, and all y\u2019all who are just\nplain trying,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ctbites.com/home/2009/9/18/los-molcajetes-seriously-authentic-mexican-in-norwalk.html"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/12/milcs.html", "title": "\nMILCS\n"},

{"date": "Monday, January 14, 2013", "body": "\n\n\nAn attachment disorder can be very isolating. Whether your\nexperience is as a parent, as someone with an attachment disorder yourself, or\nin dealing with someone close to you, knowing others are in the same boat can\nhelp you feel less alone. Count us in on your AD boat, friend, and read on!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some things I wish I had done and/or known earlier\nabout Attachment Disorders:\n\n\n\nAttachment Disorders\n\n\n\n1. Get professional help.\nHealing attachment disorders is tricky and time-consuming and entails very\nspecific directives rarely (if ever) arrived at through trial and error. \n\n\n\nMost loving, engaged parents or\ncaregivers will never come to therapeutic parenting by their own logic.\nParenting an attachment disordered child can be counterintuitive and require\nyou to do things that defy your culture and instincts in order to help your\nchild heal. Caring closely/intimately for any person with this potentially\ndebilitating disorder will entail similar adaptations. \n\n\n\n2. Several readers came to FSM\ncasually, only to suspect -- having learned more herein -- that they or a loved\none might have an attachment disorder. While I am not a neurologist or\npsychiatrist (big disclaimer!), I am a pragmatist. I do hold that in some cases\nif a model of care works for you, professional diagnosis may be a\nsecondary concern (disclaimer: of course, see #1!).\u00a0 \n\n\n\n3. Whether you are dealing with a\nchild or an adult, a loved one or an unloved one, or yourself, know that\ndisordered actions \u2013 however manipulative, cunning, cruel, sneaky, dishonest,\ncontrolling or aggressive -- come from deep pain and fear. If you are\ntruly experiencing an attachment disorder, you will need this compassion in\ntimes to come.\n\n\n\n4. In an attachment disordered\ncontext, therapeutic parenting means setting strong boundaries and\nfollowing through on every. single. goshdang little thing in order to build\nfeelings of safety and trust.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe\nwere able to see instant positive results in many areas when we shifted to this\nform of care. Tantrums, for example, have been a great field of progress for us\n(so long as I handle them as advised; every once in awhile I am all,\n\u201c&&%$# it!\u201d and then things can get ugly: once the tantrum train is in\nmotion it is VERY hard to stop). Other aspects of our lives have progressed\nmuch more gradually, and some have seemingly not changed at all. \n\n\n\nTake note of emotional and\npractical steps forward and remember them during difficult moments and times\nwhen being a boundary vigilante has you bushed. \n\n\n\n5. That said, you will get tired.\nIt will sometimes be hard to see your child\u2019s (or another person\u2019s, or your\nown)\u00a0 heart through the\noft-constant challenges and maneuvers. The more attached an attachment\ndisordered person gets, the more they push \u2013 because they care, and are scared\nabout that caring.\n\n\n\nOne thing that works for us is for\nme to get close to Z and really look at her, and into her eyes. Pausing that\nway, and letting the love rise to the surface \u2013 though not something I am always willing or able to do \u2013 almost always reminds me of\nthe truth of our relationship. It reminds me that we should none of us be\ndefined only by the manifestations of our pain.\n\n\n\nHumor works, too. Actually being\nfunny in those very special moments is Not Bloody Likely. So what about the\nabsurd? \u201cOh yeah? You are going to tell me that you did not take this rotten\nfood item that is hidden in your pillowcase? Well, I am going to tell you that I am going to Get in that SPACESHIP out there\nand fly to a planet where everybody wears pillowcases full of rotten food at\nall times. And if you Don\u2019t wear your rottenfoodpillow you are very WEIRD. So I\nam out of here.\u201d \n\n\n\nGive yourself a break, and another chance. Same for others.\n\n\n\n6. Get support. Find others\nwho are faced with this unique challenge and lean on them for advice, mutual\ncomfort, and commiseration, as well as for the sharing of hopes and progress. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou are not alone. Probably, you are doing your best.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to hope, love, humor, strength,\npatience and second (and third\u2026) chances\u2026\n\nNext week: Anniversary List III.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html", "title": "\nFirst Anniversary Lists II: Attachment Disorders\n"},

Or, at least, our mistakes\nmight prove instructive (diarrhea [still working on that one]).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut surety in these complicated times has never been a\nstrong suit of our household. Readers have been more likely to laugh or cry\nwith us than to follow my commands. \n\n\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I think \u201cparenting\nsolutions\u201d is, um, drinking\u2026For those who are not struggling with substance\nabuse issues, may I suggest a moderate portion of your preferred mood altering\nsubstance? FSM never cottoned overmuch to vino until single motherhood hit.\nNow, if she can remember, a glass of wine or beer definitely eases dinner and\nbedtime transitions [note to self: make note to remind self to drink wine].\n\n\n\nAnd then there is the \u201csolution\u201d \u2013 much needed in a Full\nhousehold - of picking which issues and behaviors to address and which to drop. In the matter of choosing battles, the grandmama of\nall battle-choosing advice comes to mind. Sure, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9. On account of\nbecause it\u2019s super wise:\n\nThe\nSerenity Prayer\u00a0\n\n\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to\naccept the things I cannot change,\n\nThe courage to change the things I\ncan,\n\nAnd the wisdom to know the\ndifference.\n\n\n\nOr, for those who are not religious or do not feel that\nserenity comes from \u201cGod,\u201d here is a version from The Serene Atheist (http://sereneatheist.blogspot.com/2009/10/secular-serenity-prayer.html):\n\n\n\n\nThrough my efforts, I gain the\nserenity to accept the things I cannot change;\u00a0\n\ncourage to change the things I\ncan;\u00a0\n\nand the wisdom to know the difference.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nYears ago, during an unrelated family mental health\nscenario, I learned that some traits are known as \u2018characterological.\u201d This\nterm refers to aspects of personality and behavior that are neither strictly\npsychological nor neurological; instead, they are character traits \u2013 good and bad \u2013 that can be remarkably hard to\nchange. Such traits are not reflections of mental illness or neurodiversity per\nse but have to do with the will and desires\nand tendencies of any individual. Thus, one might be characterologically prone\nto greed or generosity, kindness or cruelty; one might be shy or bursting with\nflair, honest, sneaky, sunny- or surly-natured\u2026\n\n\n\nCharacter can be worked with, its better aspects supported\nand its lesser elements healed and diminished; but it cannot really be\neradicated.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s useful to try to get a handle on what\u2019s what in this\narea, and to know which behaviors are \n\nunhealthy, pathological or\nreflections of disorder \n\nor\n\nfunctions of disability or\ndevelopmentally appropriate\n\nand which are \n\nbasic, natural self-expression. \n\n\n\nThis can bring some insight as to whether or not \u2013 and\npossibly how \u2013 behaviors can be ameliorated.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also imperative to know as much as possible about your\nunique circumstances so that you don\u2019t lament OR excuse inappropriate things,\nor confuse character with a difference, disorder or disability.\n\n\n\nFor example, it\u2019s hard to say how much of G\u2019s generosity\ncomes from his character and how much from his Aspergian non-attachment to most\nmaterial goods. Part of my job is to help him develop enough common sense to\ndistinguish between generous and reckless giving. Z\u2019s giant hambone consists of\none part attachment disorder and one part inborn characterological star\nquality.

{"date": "Thursday, January 10, 2013", "body": "\n\n\nWhen G was a colic-y newborn, I made a list for myself so\nthat I could remember the main reasons he might be crying. Actually, I made a\nfew copies of the same list, and placed them around my tiny East Village\napartment in hopes that\n\n\n\na. I would somehow see them and then, \n\nb. remember to read them and then,\n\nc. Know What was Going On. The list read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Is [G]: \n\nHungry?\n\nTired?\n\nPoopy?\n\nWet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026Did you think I was joking?\n\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n\nOften, I couldn\u2019t remember to look at this exhaustive list\n-- and so was frequently perplexed by G\u2019s vigorous and frequent crying. \n\n\n\nWhat, I continue to wonder, was quite so hard about having a\nhealthy (if fussy) newborn? \n\n\n\nOkay, sleep deprivation. Yes.\u00a0 And, sure, complete re-evaluation of life plan and goals and\nappropriation of all time by baby. But: newborns can\u2019t walk or go anywhere by\nthemselves! They can\u2019t even crawl. All the same, there I was, like every new\nparent, near-paralyzed with overwhelmitude.\n\n\n\nInsofar as I can remember, though, when I did happen upon\nthe list, it was quite helpful. \n\n\n\n\n\nEleven years later, one year ago this month, I was inducted\ninto a very strict and demanding writing group. Having considered myself a\nwriter all my life, this made sense. But for the last decade I had been writing\nin only the most limited fashion. \n\n\n\nWe had less than a month to produce something\u2026and I had no\nidea what to write! \n\n\n\nI sat down in front of the computer and found that I had but\ntwo thoughts in my head: one, \u201cwrite what you love,\u201d and two, \u201cI love my kids.\u201d\nI began to think about something that had been tickling at the edges of my\nbrain for some time: the notion that my children -- both of whom are considered\n\u201cspecial needs\u201d and \u201chigh needs\u201d -- sometimes benefited from very different, one\nmight even say opposite, parenting styles and, other times, needed very similar\ntreatment for very different reasons. I wondered if our travails might be\nhumorous and/or inspiring and/or comforting for others. Having never even\nconsidered doing so before, I suddenly found myself starting a blog! \n\n\n\nA year later, I have written dozens of posts, and they have\nbeen read by thousands of readers. The process has been tremendously rewarding,\nand I am deeply grateful for the support and wisdom that has come our way\nthrough public and private comments. \n\n\n\nIn my last post (http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/12/process-represent-toot.html),\nI was struggling with a number of questions around education and services and\nthings got pretty wordy. After posting, it occurred to me that it might be more\nhelpful to offer what I learned from that situation in a more accessible\nformat. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m still prone to making lists, and subject to forgetting\nto read them. The process of making them, though, has its own rewards, and,\nhere, my purpose is practical: the possible sparing of even just one person\nsome fraction of the ridiculousness and cluelessness that is abundantly\navailable to us all. So, to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Full Spectrum\nMama, I decided to condense a few of the things I have learned this year into\nlists, mini-manuals that I hope will be useful and won\u2019t take too much of your\nprecious time to wade through...\n\n\n\nWe are still working \u2013 often ineptly, generally without\ndefinitive answers -- on diet, the social piece, executive function, body\nawareness and a plethora of other good stuff. For my first celebratory list, I\ncondensed my experience in the world of navigating school as the parent of a\nnon-traditional learner. While this list is entitled, \u201cSchool Advocacy,\u201d it\nmight also be applicable to other bureaucratic situations in which advocacy is\nrequired. \n\n\n\nSchool Advocacy\n\n\n\n1. Know your terms and your rights! I cannot stress this enough. You want to be taken\nseriously, and to present an aura of knowing both the facts around disability,\nlearning differences, \u201cspecial education\u201d programs and schools AND your\noptions and the protections and programs available to your child. If you are informed, you are able to present\nyourself as someone to be reckoned with, and thus, in a time of limited\nresources, your child is less likely to get lost in the system.\n\n\n\n2. Wear something to important\nmeetings that makes you feel powerful.\n\n \nRemember\n      to use a lint brush before you\n      attend the meeting.*\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Know that those you are dealing\nwith are probably good people who got\ninto education (and \u201cspecial education\u201d) because they wanted to serve and help\nchildren; know also that politics, budget concerns, and egos, too, will have a\nplace at the table. Take names. And do everything you can to keep the focus on\ngetting your child the help that he or she needs. \n\n\n\n4. In case your child does not\nqualify for services in one area, know your areas of qualification in order to explore other possibilities for getting\nhim or her the help he or she needs. In Vermont, the areas of adverse effect\nare Written Expression, Reading, Math and Orientation/Mobility. Sometimes a 504\nwill do when an IEP won\u2019t \u2013 and vice versa. You may have to be extremely\npersistent or change tactics if one door closes\u2026\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0 Review ALL documents very, very carefully.\u00a0 Small errors (for example, one report\nstated that my son had a diagnosis of \u201cAsperger\u2019s disorder;\u201d this morphed, as my correcting email crossed the paper trail, into - and I wish I was joking here - \"asperberger's disorder\") may have large\nconsequences later on. If the materials are daunting (chances are they will\nbe), try to find someone to review them with you. Every state has advocacy\ngroups that are willing to assist you in this process. In Vermont, the\nDisability Law Project (http://www.vtlegalaid.org/our-projects/disability-law-project/)\nis a great resource.\u00a0\n\n\n\n6. If you find yourself in a\nposition where you need to advocate for your child, you may be surprised by\nyour own ferocity. (From a private\ncomment on my last post: \u201cBack in my days as a grant writer I did some work\nwith special-needs students' parents.\u00a0\nMy God, [FSM], they were the fiercest advocates I've ever been\naround!\u201d).\u00a0 On so many levels,\nyou and your child will need what that ferocity brings. Just make sure to keep\nyour demeanor a step away from cray-cray. (Please see #1.) \n\n\n\nNext Week: Things I wish I had known earlier about\nAttachment Disorders.\n\n\n\nLove and thanks,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n* Big thanks to Thistle, who suggested this in a reader\ncomment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vtlegalaid.org/our-projects/disability-law-project/"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html", "title": "\nFirst Anniversary Lists I: Advocacy\n"},
{"date": "Friday, December 21, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nThe Meeting\n\n\n\nJust before the holiday break, G, whose autism spectrum\ndisorder presents with a variety of significant motor and neural challenges,\nlost his IEP status. Having access to an IEP (an Individualized Education\nProgram [or Plan]), or what used to be known as \u201cbeing in special ed.\u201d is\nfederally mandated through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, but\nis administered differently from state to state. In Vermont, the threshold for\n\u201cadverse effect\u201d is testing below the 15th percentile.\u00a0 At his three-year IEP evaluation, G\ntested slightly above this percentile on one measure (reading), and\nsubstantially above on another (math).\u00a0\nSeveral of the nine people assembled in that room thought this was\nterrific news.\n\n\n\nThe rest of us knew they had used the wrong measures. \n\n\n\nThose of us with children in the IEP system periodically\nreceive giant stacks of paperwork from which we are meant to glean both \n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat is important in\nour child\u2019s life and \n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich areas are open to our active participation. \n\n\n\nHad I read \u2013 somewhere in the latest bureaucratic morass of\ninformation packets and forms requiring my signature - the single sentence, \u201cWe\nwill be testing G on math and reading,\u201d I would have taken notice. Had I\nunderstood this one piece of information, I could have told them weeks in\nadvance that he wouldn\u2019t qualify and could have saved my son a whole mess of\nunnecessary testing.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, however, I \u2013 holder of an Ivy League Ph.D.\nwho reads every word in these piles \u2013 was unable to discern this simple fact in\ntime. I shudder to think how those parents who are unaccustomed to giant\nmorasses of the written word variety process these packets. \n\n\n\nFortunately, I was tipped off the day before the meeting\nthat G was about to lose his IEP status. I thus was able to PROCESS the\nfeelings and ideas that would have squished me (on my slice of the spectrum big\nfeelings of any sort cause shutdown), and thereby prevented me from any\nmeaningful participation\u2026had they been new to me at the start of the IEP\nmeeting. \n\n\n\nFor maximum authority, I dressed in my teaching clothes --\ngrown-up style duds in my requisite Goth black. In Vermont, not wearing denim\nand fleece is a badge of sophistication and, possibly (I hoped), power.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe district brought in the big guns, the Director of the\ndistrict, to break this news to G\u2019s \u201cteam.\u201d I believe they expected G\u2019s teacher\nand I to be cowed but we were not.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nG\u2019s teacher was a fierce and compelling advocate, who came\nprepared with an arsenal of points in favor of G\u2019s continuing on an IEP. He\nasserted that ALL of G\u2019s teachers feel very strongly that he needs to be on an\nIEP; that indeed his Literature Circles teacher says he is \u201cthe one child out\nof 40-plus in his group who absolutely must be on an IEP.\u201d \n\n\n\nWe were told that the Feelings of teachers don\u2019t matter.\n\n\n\n\u00a0We were told\nonly \u201cobjective\u201d measures can be used to justify (the funding of) a child\u2019s\n(expensive) IEP status. \n\n\n\nDueling acronyms were bandied about, statistics parsed\u2026\n\n\n\nIt emerged that it doesn\u2019t actually matter if someone has a\ndiagnosed disability\u2026 so long as that disability doesn\u2019t place him or her in\nthe 15th percentile or below. \n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sort of a victim of his own success,\u201d one \u201cteam\u201d\nmember explained, making the universal hand gesture for \u201cgettin\u2019 real high up\nthere.\u201d \u201cThese scores show that G is getting higher and higher up the mountain\nof achievement.\u201d\n\n\n\nExcept - he\u2019s not. \n\n\n\nWhere he used to get \u201cSuper!\u201d and \u201c100%!\u201d (with smiley faces\nin the zeros) on his spelling tests, now that he is in fifth grade my gifted\nchild can barely write a sentence. The PROCESS of writing a single word is\nvery, very different from that of writing a sentence or paragraph. In writing\nmore than one word, G loses focus. Although he reads at almost adult level and\nhas marvelous comprehension, he misspells 50% or more of words. Without\nreminders, he does not capitalize first words of sentences, nor does he\npunctuate.\n\n\n\nI was furious, but manageably so, since I\u2019d had time to\nPROCESS: \u201cHere is a kid, I said with deadly calm, \u201cwho should be testing in the\n80th and 90th percentiles based on his intelligence, but\nbecause of his disability is testing in the bottom third and there\u2019s nothing we\nas a school community can do about it???\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d the district psychiatrist informed me, \u201cthat is a symptom of a larger\nsocietal problem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAll we are responsible for,\u201d added the Director, in a tone\nI read as smug (but I am not such a good reader of tone), \u201cis providing a basic\n\u2018free and appropriate public education.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201dThen what is our purpose here? If letting our children down\nis acceptable to you, why are you here?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\nThere was no response. \n\n\n\nSo I continued, calling on some of the many ideas that had\nbeen racing through my mind all night: \u201cI would suggest, then, if you want to\nhelp G you ought to test him on the measures in which he is falling behind.\nPlease tell me the other areas in which students can be found eligible and\n[teacher] and I will let you know which of those are a good fit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2019Written Expression\u2019 and \u2018Orientation/Mobility\u2019,\u201d said the\nDirector, after a pause.\n\n\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Said I. \u201cThose are the very areas in which he is\nstruggling.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaving had the opportunity to PROCESS, I was able to question and to REPRESENT my son\u2019s interests: to bust out my\nbig words and my for-once tangibly-useful doctorate and the statistics classes\nI took in graduate school. Once again, what do parents who haven\u2019t had the\nprivilege of extended education -- or who don\u2019t have the skills or confidence\nto stand up to Important People \u2013 do under similar circumstances? I could never\nhave effectively (confidently, somewhat skillfully) advocated for G if I hadn\u2019t\nspent the entire night before thinking about what to ask and say in this\nmeeting. Spending my entire life in academia probably helped too.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nDo IEPs help?\u2026Sometimes.\n\n\n\nI was told in this meeting, and it makes some sense, that\n\u201cthe three-year evaluation is intended to protect students from being dumped\ninto the special ed. system and staying there even when they have progressed\nout of it.\u201d \n\n\n\nAmbivalence is as much a part of this process as advocacy! I\ncertainly don\u2019t want G to be subject to \u2013 or feel himself \u2013 the stigma that\nsadly remains associated with being on an IEP. So why on earth would I want him\nto receive services if they were not crucial to his survival as a student? IF\nit helps him \u2013 does it? \u2013 I want him to have all the helpful help that can be\nhelped\u2026\n\n\n\nWithout any services, without aid with transitions and\norganization, G might get lost, \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d -- or he might \u201crise\nto the occasion.\u201d He might be \u201cjust another gifted kid not living up to his\npotential\u201d\u2026\n\n\n\nAs his teachers and I watch the gap widen between G\u2019s\nintelligence and intentions, and his written expression and executive function,\nwe wonder if we will be able to get him the services he needs. His teachers\nserve dozens of students and are at the mercy of the system for their\nlivelihood. While G\u2019s teachers are more than willing to advocate ardently for\nG, there is only so much they can do. The rest will be up to his family and\ncommunity. And to him.\n\n\n\nA.A. Gill\u2019s wise recent article in Vanity Fair\n(http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2012/12/aa-gill-schools-ruining-our-kids\n\n-- enjoy!) gives pause to the notion that school success is\nthe sole predictor of life success. But if G struggles academically because of\nhis disability he should have access to help if he, in all good faith, wants to\nsucceed in school!\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn effect, the astonishingly low \u201cadverse effect\u201d threshold\nin VT, coupled with unsuitable testing has turned my son into an experiment. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess, Represent, Toot\n\n\n\nAs rough as the social piece can be for G right now, and as\nchallenging as some aspects of school can be for him as well, my deepest,\ndarkest fear, the one in my mind almost constantly is: what will G do when I am\ngone? I know some of you other parents out there feel me on this. Maybe he will\nbe just fine. I sure hope so! But he might need some help and -- as any parent\nwould -- I hope that when he needs that\nhelp, the help will be there. \n\n\n\nWill it?\n\n\n\nHere, G may be losing his elementary school safety net.\nSince one might naturally assume that childhood is where the best safety nets\nwould be found, this raises doubts about safety nets in general. What about the\nbigger safety net for people, including adults, who are not neurotypical or are\ndifferently-abled? What about the \u201clarger societal problem\u201d to which the\ndistrict psychiatrist referred??? \n\n\n\nWith the recent stigmatization of Aspergers and autism in\nthe media (please see previous post: http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/12/ignorance-ahoy.html),\nit seems a fabulous time to begin to tackle these problems. Chief among them\nare ignorance and limited resources in schools* and communities. Advocacy both\nfor students and their parents (not all of whom know their rights!), as well as\neducation and community efforts around disability might be some directions to\ntake whatever talents and energy we have. \n\n\n\nSo long as I have a good chunk of PROCESSing time, meaning I\nknow IN ADVANCE what issues and objections will be raised, I should be able to\nlend my voice to these efforts. This IEP meeting was a great lesson for me\nabout how to optimize my ability to REPRESENT my own and my children\u2019s best\ninterests. Like G, apparently, I need time to internally PROCESS and then transition into external expression and interaction\nin any potentially intense context. In this post, I am TOOTING my own horn\nabout how I handled the whole thing, because I just learned so dang much.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI want to use that knowledge to foster G\u2019s ability to PROCESS\nhis sensory and intellectual and\nemotional intake, so that he can best REPRESENT himself in his endeavors, and\nTOOT his own horn \u2013 stand up for himself and be proud and, especially, self-advocate\u00a0-- when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution\n\n\n\nG\u2019s remarkably operatic three-year IEP evaluation began with\nsome serious acrimony, officiousness and righteousness. There occurred pounding\nof tables, raised voices, trembling (not even by me!).\u00a0 Praise be, we all managed to stay in\nthe room until some consensus was reached. Thanks to G\u2019s teacher and me, the\nmeeting ended up with the team\u2019s agreeing that G was not well served by the\ntesting that had taken place. He will now be tested in the other two areas of\neligibility in Vermont, \u201cWritten Expression,\u2019 and \u201cOrientation/Mobility.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSo G is about to endure another round of testing, this time\nin areas in which he actually does have significant adverse effect. We shall\nsee if it meets the criteria. If so, may the help he gets be targeted to his\nreal needs. May it be helpful. \n\n\n\nThis is the hope with which many of us left this meeting.\n\n\n\nAs I walked out of the school, feeling I had just, for once,\nmade the best of a difficult situation \u2013 i.e. for once I had not been\ncompletely overwhelmed\u00a0 \u2013 I looked\ndown at my \u201cprofessional\u201d all-black outfit with a feeling of maturity and satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\nI then noticed that I was completely covered in white cat\nhair. Glad I didn\u2019t find THAT out at the beginning of the meeting.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* I cannot imagine the Director of the district got into the\nfield of education in order to deprive students of services due to limited\nresources (which inevitably must result in tighter testing standards). This\nmust be one of the most difficult aspects of the job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2012/12/aa-gill-schools-ruining-our-kids"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/12/process-represent-toot.html", "title": "\nProcess, Represent, Toot\n"},

I think not.) I\u2019m stuck on an incident from a few weeks ago:\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope you are feeling better,\u201d G\u2019s beloved teacher from\nthird and fourth grade had called out to him as we left school.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d G responded, too emphatically.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen why did Mr. __ ask you that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing! No reason!\u201d\n\n\n\nI pushed. It felt right this time (sometimes it\u2019s better to\nlet go, I know). \n\n\n\nAt length, this story, as according to G, emerged:\n\n\n\nG\u2019s teacher likes to start off the day by asking\nthought-provoking questions during \u201cmorning meeting.\u201d Often, these questions\nare like koans,* in that there is no \u201cright\u201d answer.\n\n\n\nThat particular day, the discussion was led by the teacher\u2019s\naide (who happens to work with G) and the question was, \u201cWhat would you do if\nyou we're the least popular kid in class? What would you do if you were the\nparent of that kid?\"\n\n\n\nG\u2019s answer? \u201cI think I am the least popular kid in class and I do nothing because I don't care\nabout being cool; I would say to my child, 'Don't worry about it because when\nyou grow up the weird will triumph!'\" \n\n\n\nHis response, so brave and wise, took my breath away.\n(Mothers are so objective.) Also, the whole thing made me want to throw up,\nespecially after what he said next:\n\n\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d he continued, \u201cfor some reason, I started crying.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou know how you\u2019d do anything on earth for your baby\n(whoever your baby is, maybe it\u2019s your partner, your cat\u2026)? At that moment I\npromised the universe ANYTHING if it would only show me what to do to fix this\nsituation.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAs we shift into the tween and dread middle school years, I\nfear social issues can only gather weight. As it stands, we drive hours to play\nwith kids G has really connected with; plus we have carefully sought-out play\ndates in other local school districts.\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s not like G\u2019s no fun to play with! He\u2019s a really fun kid, if\nsometimes a bit fixated on Pokemon. He\u2019s just stuck in a small school right\nnow, where the particular mix of kids has left him\u2026friendless.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, G asked me, \u201cSo how did you feel when I told you\nthat?\u201d\n\n\n\nI thought about \u201cthat\u201d for a minute. \u201cFirst, I felt proud\nand happy, because you are so wise. But, also, I felt sad, because you felt\nthat way and you must\u2019ve been through quite a journey to get to feeling that\nway. I guess I also felt hopeful, that\nyou will be around a more diverse bunch of kids soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nI paused and then asked, \u201cHow did YOU feel after all that drama?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d\n\n\n\nI pressed him a little bit more. \n\n\n\n\u201cStuff.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2026\u201dSTUFF???!!!\u201d \n\n\n\nNow that\u2019s a\n\u201cnormal\u201d tween answer!\n\n\n\n(To be continued\u2026)\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Merriam-Webster defines koan as, \u201ca paradox to be\nmeditated upon.\u201d The concept arose from the Zen Buddhist tradition.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-least-popular-kid-in-class-part-one.html", "title": "\nThe Least Popular Kid in the Class \u2013 Part One\n"},

The overwhelming quality of intense feelings precludes clarity around\nthose feelings until the strong feelings subside. This can be true of\noverpowering sensory feelings (such as those experienced by\nsensorially-sensitive people in the average classroom), as well as emotional\nones. \n\n\n\nStill, knowing that he needed time to process was not going\nto directly aid G with his lack of popularity, or make him feel better about\ncrying in front of his classmates.\n\n\n\nOutside of suspecting it would not be really, really helpful\nto tell G, \u201cBut you\u2019re my very best\nfriend, buddy!\u201d I was at a loss of how to help my child.\n\n\n\nSo I wrote G\u2019s teacher along these lines:\n\n\n\nDear [teacher],\n\n\n\nI love that you start morning\nmeeting with a question. I do the same in all my philosophy classes [read: I am\nnot about to bust your chops for asking big questions]. And I think yesterday's\nquestion was a great one. I\u2019m just unclear on exactly what happened after [G]\nanswered the question and then, \u201cfor some reason\u201d (according to him), began\ncrying.\n\n\n\nWhen you get a chance could you let\nme know a bit about what happened yesterday so that I can best support [G] at\nthis time? Or if you have any suggestions...\n\n\n\nI know you have your hands full, so\nat your convenience.\n\n\n\nThanks so much,\n\n[Full Spectrum Mama]\n\n\n\nResponding via email, G\u2019s teacher explained that a number of\nstudents had been being inattentive or having side conversations while G spoke.\nOther students had interrupted him, saying that he was wrong about being\nunpopular. These latter, while acting with good motives, \u201cwere not speaking in\nturn or being respectful to the process.\u201d These factors contributed to G\u2019s\nfrustration.\n\n\n\nHe assured me that he had never seen anyone be intentionally\nor directly unkind to G, but admitted that G is often left out or \u201cnot paid\nattention to\u201d\u2026\n\n\n\nHe concluded with some positive thoughts: \u201cAs stressful and\nunpleasant as it was, I believe that the log jam's been broken and we are going\nin a positive direction with this very social class.\u00a0 While I apologized to [G] for him having to go through this\nsituation I also thanked him for giving us all the opportunity to examine our\ncareless and thoughtless behavior and make positive changes.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhew! \n\n\n\nIt was a great gift to have a broader picture of events, and\nto be able to engage G in a slightly more nuanced processing of what had\nhappened. Not that any of this is going to turn G into someone who doesn\u2019t\nsometimes get flappy, or extra-loud, or reveal new heights of dorkitude. It\nmight help him accept himself, though, and that\u2019s more than good enough for\nthose of us who love him. \n\n\n\n\u201cFree to be You and Me,\u201d with its messages of inclusion,\ncelebrations of difference and our family favorite song \u201cIt\u2019s alright to cry,\u201d\nhas been on pretty heavy rotation in G\u2019s room the last month or so. He seems to\nbe feeling less lonely at school, but he\u2019s still asking to spend recess reading\nin the library because, for him, navigating the playground scene is\ntremendously daunting.\n\n\n\nNow, over a month out, I think everybody was right: lots of\nkids grew and stretched to be more inclusive and thoughtful following this\nincident \u2013 but G may still have good reasons to cry in school. \n\n\n\nSometimes, too, he may not even know why he is crying. \n\n\n\nWhat he will know is\nthat crying is healthy and totally, utterly, absolutely super alright: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y52bs0aX6v8\n*\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Best.

{"date": "Monday, April 1, 2013", "body": "\n\n\nTra la la\u2026\u201dSweet lovers love the spring\u2026\u201d*\n\n\n\nTra la\u2026\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see\u2026\n\n\n\nThis time last year, we were in discussions about a possible\n504 Plan** for Z. The year before that, we sought attachment-disorder-specific\ntherapy for a situation that was spiraling out of control \u2013 and out of the\nrange of bearable.\n\n\n\nThis spring we are facing a renewed cycle of tantrums and\nother behaviors, many of which have lain dormant since as long ago as, well, last\nspring. I\u2019ve had to write Z\u2019s teacher several times explaining that she had not\nhad breakfast due to a meltdown; now I know to pack extra snacks \u2013 stuff like\nthat. \n\n\n\nWhile Z sometimes says things she intends to be very hurtful\n(a wee bit embarrassingly for all, these things often seem funny to adults in\nthe vicinity: \u201cYou stupid poopoo mother I will hate you forever and kill you\nWith! This! Doll! And then I will never! Ever! Eat the BAD, DUMB dinner you\ncook again!\u201d), she more often proceeds directly to the pre-verbal, with growls,\nshouts, kicks and screams prevailing.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve come to understand that this regressive behavior demonstrates Z\u2019s\nongoing need to be nurtured as (if she were still) a baby. \n\n\n\nThe cycle of the seasons clearly has deep meaning for\nZ.\u00a0 The merry infant who smiled\nback at us from her taken-in-February referral photo had, by the time we\narrived in China in July (this was as fast as the process allowed) to bring her\nhome, seen and felt things no child should endure. I cannot say whether Z\nendured any definite abuse. We were not allowed to enter the orphanage in\nFuzhou (Jiangxi province). Certainly there was a significant level of neglect,\nand, judging by how skinny Z was -- and how voracious \u2013 a bona fide shortage of\nfood. \n\n\n\nZ\u2019s orphanage experiences are still reverberating in her\nbody and mind in ways unfathomable to those of us who at the very least had\nadequate food and some constant presence in our infancies. \n\n\n\nSure, we\u2019d all like to have been loved unconditionally and\nto have known we came first to our parents and maybe some of us didn\u2019t get that\nand yeah, that sucks. No, it really does.\nAnd we - some of us - do have cavernous, terrible, enduring holes inside where\nthat love should have gone. But anyone privileged enough to be reading (or\nwriting) this blog probably had their most basic needs met. Z didn\u2019t. She\u2019s\ntraumatized. It comes out in the spring.\n\n\n\nAs the years have gone by and we have been able, with the\nhelp of our therapist, to identify this pattern, it has helped all of us feel\nless hopeless. It\u2019s given us some context, rather than leaving us flailing in\nthe dark as our family degenerates, seemingly out of the blue. I can say to Z,\n\u201cSpringtime is sometimes hard for you,\u201d and that might let her know both that\nshe is accepted and that this, too, shall pass.\n\n\n\nWe are not alone in having a child who hits a rough patch in\nthe spring (or in some other cyclical context). Whether through embodied\ntrauma, allergies, transitions\u2026certain times of the year can trigger strong,\noften unhealthy behaviors and feelings. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis spring, partially to address these issues and partly\nbecause we\u2019ve put our house on the market, we embarked on The Deep Cleaning of\nthe Bedrooms. While each child cleans his or her room weekly, with some help\nfrom Mama, this was a whole different endeavor. I swear, between recycling and\nstraight up trash I hauled several hefty bags out of each child\u2019s room. \n\n\n\nG\u2019s room was a giant mess, but Z\u2019s room was a project. A certain kind of masterpiece, actually. Millions\nof tiny twists of paper had been squirreled away in every possible crevice.\nThere were a lot of unfamiliar (to me, anyway) toys, and pieces of candy and\ncandy wrappers and Oreos (Oreos??!) in hidey-holes and in bags within bags\n(whenever I come across a snazzy second hand purse or am given one, it goes\nstraight to Z).\u00a0 \n\n\n\nProgressing from irritation to wonder, and back and forth\nagain, I stood in awe at the complexity and skill of Z\u2019s hoarding.\n\n\n\nWhen we were done (after many, many sensory breaks for all)\nand we\u2019d dealt with the garbage and recycled the recycling, Z was as happy as\nI\u2019ve ever seen her. You could actually see how light she felt, how purged. Without prompting, she\nexpressed her desire to \u201cbe really peaceful all the time now!\u201d and to \u201cdraw\ninstead of ripping and hiding things!\u201d \n\n\n\nNice ideas.

The great cellist Pablo Casals said this about\nchildren:\n\n\n\nEach second we live is a new and\nunique moment of the universe, a moment that will never be again. And what do\nwe teach our children? We teach them that two and two make four, and that Paris\nis the capital of France. When will we also teach them what they are? We should\nsay to each of them: Do you know what you are? You are a marvel. You are\nunique. In all the years that have passed, there has never been another child\nlike you. Your legs, your arms, your clever fingers, the way you move. You may\nbecome a Shakespeare, a Michelangelo, a Beethoven. You have the capacity for\nanything. Yes, you are a marvel. And when you grow up, can you then harm\nanother who is, like you, a marvel? You must work, we must all work, to make\nthe world worthy of its children.\n\n\n\nPablo Casals (1876\n- 1973)***\n\n\n\nSpringtime at the Orphanage might\u2019ve been terrible, but,\nhere, it\u2019s got marvels too.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \"It Was a Lover and His Lass\"\n\nBY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\n\n\nIt was a lover and his lass,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 With a\nhey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,\n\nThat o\u2019er the green cornfield did pass,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 In\nspringtime, the only pretty ring time,\n\nWhen birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;\n\nSweet lovers love the spring.\n\n\n\nBetween the acres of the rye,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 With a\nhey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,\n\nThose pretty country folks would lie,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 In\nspringtime, the only pretty ring time,\n\nWhen birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;\n\nSweet lovers love the spring.\n\n\n\nThis carol they began that hour,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 With a\nhey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,\n\nHow that a life was but a flower\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 In\nspringtime, the only pretty ring time,\n\nWhen birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;\n\nSweet lovers love the spring.\n\n\n\nAnd therefore take the present time,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 With a\nhey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,\n\nFor love is crown\u00e8d with the prime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 In\nspringtime, the only pretty ring time,\n\nWhen birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;\n\nSweet lovers love the spring.\n\n\n\n\n\n** 504 Plans relate to a wide range of \u201cimpairments\u201d to\nlearning, the variety of which may or may not fall under \u201cSpecial Education\u201d\ncriteria.

A 504 plan spells out the\nmodifications and accommodations that will be needed for these students to have\nan opportunity perform at the same level as their peers, and might include such\nthings as wheelchair ramps, blood sugar monitoring, an extra set of textbooks,\na peanut-free lunch environment, home instruction, or a tape recorder or\nkeyboard for taking notes.\n\n\n\n*** http://blog.gaiam.com/quotes/authors/pablo-casals/55416\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://specialchildren.about.com/od/504s/f/504faq1.htm", "http://blog.gaiam.com/quotes/authors/pablo-casals/55416"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/04/springtime-at-orphanage.html", "title": "\nSpringtime at the Orphanage\n"},

He talks at high volume in an unmodulated voice. \n\n\n\nIn other words, my children are sometimes rather LOUD.\n\n\n\nConsequently, we don\u2019t spend a whole heck of a lot of time\nin restaurants.\u00a0 But the other day\nwe had a family date with another mother and her aspergian son and her peppy\ndaughter and, sure enough, the table next to us complained.\n\n\n\nSee, we had thought we could have a peaceful night out with\nthe kids.\n\n\n\nWe had walked into the restaurant and immediately seen a\nlarge, multigenerational family in the big center table. They\u2019d smiled big,\nfriendly, relieved smiles to see us. They knew we, with our four potentially\nrowdy elementary school aged kids, would balance they and their two little guys\nright out.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBut we all knew we\u2019d\nall be trying to keep our children as well-behaved as possible for the comfort\nof other diners\u2026\n\n\n\nOur sons were excited to see each other. They began putting\non raucous, clearly innocent and dorky (vs. aggressive or obnoxious - and why\ndo I feel the need to point this out?) plays with their chopsticks. This\nfriendship has been a beacon of hope for both boys, who struggle socially in\ntheir own schools.\n\n\n\nOur gals were excited to see each other, chatty, berating\ntheir big brothers for being \u201cannoying.\u201d \n\n\n\nMaybe four minutes after we sat down, a server approached our table. She was super sweet:\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind your kids at all but another table is very upset\u2026\u201d They informed\nus we were welcome to eat in the other part of the restaurant. The closed part?\nThat is usually unused? \n\n\n\nWe knew it wasn\u2019t her fault and agreed right away, trying to\nleave as little mess behind as possible, taking our glasses etc. with us, faces\nburning.\n\n\n\nSomeone from the other family asked what was going on.\nLooking straight at the offending table, I informed the nice family in a clear,\nLOUD voice that someone had complained about our children, despite the fact\nthat they were being relatively well-behaved. I explained that we had to move\nto another room. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a ferocity to motherhood that once made polite,\nfeminist me hiss the B word at a woman who sniped about my letting my young\nchild play under the table at a restaurant (at the time he'd been diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder and I knew he was overwhelmed by restaurant stimuli). ...A protectiveness that had me\nretorting \u201cWhat are you whistling at? You better not be whistling at my baby!\u201d\nat pregnancy catcallers. \n\n\n\nAs well as that loving ferocity and protectiveness, there is\na sadness when someone judges your child on his or her appearance or on other\ninevitable aspects of their being.

I thought taking them to a restaurant would be a good thing,\nbut our good thing almost got eighty-sixed along with us.\n\n\n\nDo you think, stern people of the next table, that we have\nnot tried to have our children fit your behavioral standards?\u00a0 Do you not think we are doing our best\nand maybe occasionally deserve the right to go out and eat dumplings? \n\n\n\nSee those first few sentences of this post where I define my kids as\ntheir conditions?

We love and celebrate Z\u2019s power; we never ask her to be \u201cnice.\u201d We only ask\nthat she treat the people around her with basic kindness (different from\nniceness!) and respect.

Does she\nneed me to be kind and encouraging? Strict and boundary-setting?\u201d I thought of\ndifferent people I know and how they might approach the situation. Wise people.\nClever people. \n\n\n\nAnd then I thought of all the people I know who, like Z,\nquestion their place in the world and their own abilities. \n\n\n\nFor so many of us, the worst struggle we encounter is that\nwith ourselves. I see it with my students all the time: some students start\nstrong and then lose steam without family support or the confidence that they\ncan follow through; others begin with resistance, with the attitude that they\nlack whatever it takes to learn. It\u2019s not always possible for teachers to reach\nstudents in these positions, hard as we may try. Feelings of trust (of self and others) and belonging can be elusive in ways that\nare positively debilitating, especially for people with questions about their\nplace in their families and peer groups. Ideally, the basis for healthy\nself-acceptance and \u2013confidence and trust is established at home and in those early relationships\n\n\n\nIf only I could figure out how to approach Z\u2019s notes and her\nfeelings of not being able to be good, not belonging, being \u201cBad,\u201d maybe I\ncould spare her the persistence of some of these grueling conditions into\nadulthood.

Z agreed. \n\n\n\n\u201cSince we don\u2019t have enough to contribute to buy ANY\njewelry,\u201d I added, \u201cwe will simply make a donation and keep her company.\u201d\n\n\n\nSomehow, though, Z found herself with two bracelets in front\nof her. This time, at least, the bracelets were less valuable, less likely to\ngarner real money for this family in need than the other baubles scattered over\nthe table. It seems, unsurprisingly, that Friend Ayi simply could not resist\nthe adorableness and apparent giftworthiness of such a fetching child. As my\ndaughter looked winningly at me in front of a bunch of people, I finally caved\nin and told her she could make a choice of one of the two bracelets.\n\n\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d she thought for awhile, tapping her chin. Then,\npointing at a very costly, bedazzling necklace she asked, \u201cCan I have that one\ninstead?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe and I had a good laugh over that one. We both knew everyone\nelse at the party thought Z was simply being cute, and that is a part of it\u2026said part being rooted in such Will to Power, such persistence\u2026It was nice to just sit with someone\nwho knows. \n\n\n\n\n\nWanna know someone else who knows? Z. She could persuade\nalmost anyone about almost anything. Children are particularly vulnerable. In\nfact, one of her classmates last year informed his mother that Z knows\n\u201cEVERYTHING.\u201d \n\n\n\nWe were at dinner the other day with the Full Spectrum\nGrandparents and somehow the sentence \u201cThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy\ndogs\u201d came up. We talked about how it uses every letter in the alphabet and how\ngreat it was for practicing writing or keyboarding.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has to be 'dogz' with a 'z,'\u201d Z informed us in a very confident,\nprofessional-sounding tone. \u201cBecause the alphabet does not end with \u2018s.\u2019\nEverybody knows that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a potentially perilous combination, Z\u2019s desire for\ntotal control with her appearance of total knowledge.

Obviously, learning about ourselves is NOT the\nmain point of parenting (!), but it sure is a side effect! \n\n\n\n\n\nTake face blindness (prosopagnosia). I always thought I was\n\u201cbad with names\u201d or \u201cnot really great at recognizing people I don\u2019t know well.\u201d\nI assumed that everybody was pretty much the same in this regard, that it would\ntake anyone months or, more likely, years to even begin to distinguish, for\nexample, between the fifteen or so medium-sized, slightly sporty/preppy mothers\nat school with shoulder-length dirty blonde hair. Hey, if not for my\nflashy/freaky clothing I could be one of them and I still can\u2019t tell them\napart.\n\n\n\nBut I guess everyone else...can? \n\n\n\nFace blindness is common in people on the autism spectrum\nand presents in a range of degrees, in this as well as in the general\npopulation. G\u2019s is somewhat more severe than mine, but I know he will develop\ncoping mechanisms. In any case, if G sees someone dressed like me with hair like mine\nand pinky-beige skin, he will think it is me. His mother. He might figure out pretty quickly, from other cues\nlike voice or not being recognized, if he\u2019s got the wrong Mom, but there are\nmoments like that, and many similar\u2026\n\n\n\nAge is a tough one for him, especially because he doesn\u2019t\nreally care about it; Gender he usually gets (though that can be fluid,\nwhich he is totally comfortable with\u2026). But once gender is clear, other aspects\nare fuzzy. The boys in his old fifth grade class, all of Caucasian descent, to\nme were basically either stringy or pudgy at this age, and I could not tell\nthem apart aside from that. With a few exceptions, G seemed to feel the same.\n\n\n\nBoth G and I saw the diversity at his new school as\npotentially a big boost in this area, especially as compared to his profoundly\nhomogenous prior school.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr take another commonality: vocabulary and formality of\nspeech. Watching G interact with his peers has taught me that most people of\nall ages speak much more casually than we do. By the time I realized how this\nmight impact G, we were already far too deep into a lifetime of reading\nold-fashioned books to backtrack.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a little vignette that illustrates both qualities,\nface blindness and unintentionally hifalutin speech:\n\n\n\nWe went to check out the kids\u2019 new school a few days ago.\nThere were two upper elementary school age looking boys riding bikes around the\nplayground in the company of a young man in his upper teens or early twenties. \n\n\n\nG approached the man.\n\u201cDo you attend this school?\u201d he asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, but my friends here do,\u201d the man replied.\n\n\n\nG got right up in one of their faces (which one?

She said that I might think I was going to\nnow be able to do all that stuff I\u2019d not been able to do all these years (so,\nnow, in addition to teaching, I would definitely write that novel I\u2019d been\nmeaning to write, find new work that earned lashings of money, see friends,\norganize our lives, have plenty of time to relax\u2026and, oh, that memorial poetry\ncycle!). \n\n\n\nBut no.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWhat would actually happen was that I would spend a lot of time on catching up on nine years [fill in your number\nhere \u2013 or just insert \u201cthe summer months,\u201d because that counts, too; or tailor your slightly unique accomplishment delusions to \"during my week off\" or \"when I go on sabbatical\"...] of barely\naccomplishing anything outside of work and parenthood, and a lot of energy on imperceptibly returning to human status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure I \u2013 Time/Accomplishment Spectrum Graph\n\n\n\nLack of Accomplishment: as this Scientific Spectrum\ndemonstrates, it\u2019s just\u2026normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Clarification Spectrum\n\nAs just happened with PiMP\u2019s prior post, sometimes I make\njokes on this here blog and people on certain parts of the spectrum take them\nliterally and worry about me/us and ask me if I/we are okay when I/we are\nreally fine and dandy. Sometimes my funny, funny jokes make people on other\nparts of the spectrum take them at face value (literally) and assume I/we are\nall fine when in fact I/we are struggling. \n\n\n\nIs this a metaphor?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Cupcake Spectrum\n\nMore than one person explained what the kids\u2019 new school\nwould be like in terms of cupcakes. \n\n\n\nOne pal told me that whereas at X school one must bake\ngluten-free, not-too-sweet birthday cupcakes - say, nut-free banana muffins\nwith lightly maple-syruped casein-free vegan cream cheese frosting - at our NEW\nschool the ones from the grocery store with the day-glo frosting are more than\nacceptable. \n\n\n\nAnother said that while homemade cupcakes are de riguer at most area elementary schools, and especially at\nthe private schools, at our larger, more urban school nobody even notices such\n[stuff]. \n\n\n\nClearly, at G and Z\u2019s new school, parents are relatively\nfree to simply provide celebratory sugary treats of their choosing without\njudgment or condemnation! People with special dietary needs \u2013 well, I dunno. We\nhave been a gluten-free and dairy-free household and now are mostly sugar-free,\nyet this felt super-liberating, as fall is a barrage of Full Spectrum Birthdays.\n\n\n\n\nAs a trained Sociologist, for what that\u2019s worth, I was\nnaturally* ruminating on the socioeconomic implications of cupcakes, when, come\nto find out, G being the least\nspectrum-y person on the spectrum in his class, he\u2019s got classmates with\ndietary restrictions for the upcoming birthday event.\u00a0 So here we go again with the gluten-free, casein-free,\nlow-sugar (chocolate, though!) cupcakes. \n\n\n\nIn any case, the important question remains: where on the\ncupcake spectrum do \u201callergen-free,\u201d \u201cgood for you\u201d and \u201ctastes good\u201d meet? \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Mess Spectra\n\nNot only do the Full Spectrum children exhibit eclectic Mess\nstyles, with Z\u2019s messes shipshape and lined up and G\u2019s\u2026prodigious \u2013 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Figure II \u2013 Z Room (Mess) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure III\u00a0 - G Room (Mess)\n\n\n\n\u00a0-- they also\nmanifest a Cleaning Spectrum of remarkable breadth.\u00a0 While both children\u2019s messes may cover an equal area\n(area=entire surface area in room), one will take ten minutes to clean her room\nwhile the other will take ten hours. \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly\u2026\n\n\n\nA Tiny Expression of an Eating Pattern Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Figure IV \u2013 Z Plate \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure V \u2013 G Plate\n\n\n\n\n\nA Family Spectrum\n\nDennis and Jules had both come from\nfamilies that hadn\u2019t really felt good.\nThis they\u2019d shared and when they\u2019d come together it was to make a home that did\nfeel good, and even to say: Fuck you, disappointing families.\n\nMeg Wolitzer, The\nInterestings, (p. 299)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure VI \u2013 A Family Spectrum Bell Curve\n\n\n\nWe are just, kinda, on the tryna keep it in the warm color\nrange plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Hoochie Spectrum\n\nA friend started giggling at my bemoaning Z\u2019s back-to-school\nchoices: \u201cthe flashiest, pinkest, cheapest-looking, hoochie mama-est item,\nevery time!!!!\u201d She said that her daughter chose her entire fall wardrobe from\n\u201cThe Hooker Line\u201d and showed me some pretty great examples on her phone. And\nthe thing is, these are smart, strong girls being raised by strong, feminist\nwomen, and, mostly, we are laughing about it.\n\n\n\nSure, this being Vermont, kids have no problem with second\nhand, and we get lots of hand-me-downs from fabulous young\nwimmin/womyn/womin/wymyn. But there are inevitably a very few things that we\nstill have to buy in the Big Stores.\n\n\n\nIn that context, I can see pretty early in on this\nshopping-for-daughter thing that buying gear for Z is going to be a heck of a\nlot more tricky than it\u2019s ever been with my son. It seems some children have\nstrong tendencies toward what one might refer to as pizzazz. And some parents want their daughters to be making\ncreative and satisfying choices that nonetheless skirt the safer boundaries of\nhoochie mama. Hoping for healthy self-esteem and body-awareness to trump mass\nculture and the sexualization of children and tweens. \n\n\n\nAnd then there are those parents who maybe had a little too\nmuch pizzazz themselves and want to shelter their daughters from the dangers of pizzazz\u2026and those who, lacking in pizzazz,\nencourage their daughters to new heights of pizzazzified self-expression\u2026\n\n\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a\u2026Spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the Spectrum, I am trying to\nget G to be more materialistic: \u201cIsn\u2019t\nthis pretty rock n roll? Pretty punk rock?\u201d I\u2019ll ask\u2026\u201dWanna buy it?\u201d\n\n\n\nAs my best friend Lucy used to say, \u201cHorrors!\u201d\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Get it?

My sweet, hunky cousin, Whitey\nMcWhiteperson is marrying one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in\nmy life,* who happens to be from Kenya, although she grew up mostly in the\nUnited States.\n\n* Also, she\u2019s a\ngreat person and a Nurse. Grr. I\nmean\u2026yay!\n\n\n\nWe are surrounded by close to a hundred people from Africa \u2013\nmost are from Kenya but a few are from Liberia, Ghana and Zimbabwe; most are\nimmigrants to the U.S., but some are here from abroad. My family, consisting primarily of real live White people, makes up only a fraction of the wedding\nguests. \n\n\n\nMany guests from The Bride\u2019s side are in traditional dress,\nespecially the women, who are in amazing, architectural headpieces and dresses\nof bright, stunning fabrics. \n\n\n\nThe Bridal Procession begins. The Bride is preceded by a\nwhole bunch of middle-aged women singing exquisite and/or rowdy songs in\nSwahili. Other women are jubilantly ululating. As The Bride proceeds, she is\naccompanied by a rainbow of younger women in a variety of matching outfits by\ngroup (future sisters-in-law in lavender taffeta, friends from the U.S. in blue\nsilk, friends/family from abroad in mixed colors\u2026). \n\n\n\nThe singing, ululating elder women are using large,\nintricately patterned cloths as rugs to cover the ground in front of The Bride.\nEach cloth is removed as soon as she has passed, and quickly carried forward to\nlengthen the stretch of cloths in her path so that she need never touch the\nground until reaching the altar.\n\n\n\nG and Z and I are watching the scene with delight and\nwonder. G has settled down a bit from his initial flailing and neediness (from\nfeeling overwhelmed by all the people and a new environment). I see stars in my\ndaughter\u2019s eyes and am happy to know she is experiencing such a harmonious,\nextraordinary, multicultural and flat-out-super-enjoyable event. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ll look forward to the color-blind (gender-blind, sexual-orientation-blind...sigh) day when such heterogeneity is a\ncommonplace, but for now I\u2019m feeling truly grateful that my daughter gets to\nexperience this diversity in relatively-homogenous northern New England. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Z\n(right) with New Friends at the Wedding\n\n\n\nA hush falls on the guests as The Bride and her attendants\nnear the altar, which is located on a breathtaking spit of land overlooking the\nocean. The singing gets quieter, but no less moving. \n\n\n\nSuddenly, through the reverent silence of the audience, a\nlarge voice rings out from my rather small daughter: \u201cThat dress must have been\nrelley expensive!\u201d\n\n\n\nUm\u2026Whoa.\n\n\n\nAll around us, people are laughing, with a slight\nundercurrent of chagrin. My entire parenting career passes before my eyes: what\nabout \u201cour\u201d values (non-materialism, valuing what\u2019s INSIDE instead of\nappearances\u2026)? Why bother raising kids without tv and consumer culture if this\nis what happens in the end? How is it that, surrounded by marvels of all sorts,\nthe price of the dress is what Z chose to focus on??? Where did this comment of\nhers come from???? Is there some genetic component to character????????? As\nwell, whence the Valley Girl accent?\n\n\n\nBig questions. \n\n\n\nSo, you know, next thing I know I am drinking a teensy bit\nmore than I might be under other circumstances. Right? Right? Doesn\u2019t everybody feel a smidge uncomfortable around\nfamily? \n\n\n\nOh, wait, no. WELLANYWAY.\n\n\n\nLucky for me, after a few hours on the dance floor, what\nremained with me was laughter and the pleasure of losing myself in the festivities\n(with a little help from my old friend Vino).\n\n\n\nThis was partly because Z and I were the last ones dancing\nfrom my cousin\u2019s family, shaking our patooties long after the rest of that side\nhad left the dance floor. Thereby proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that (as alienated as some in my biological family may be) my daughter and I are totally related. \n\n\n\nAnd it was partly because, as a fabulous someone said, \u201cAt\nleast she didn\u2019t say it looks cheap!\u201d\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MICR2Xx0FhQ/UlQp-bHE_kI/AAAAAAAAAOE/q4YLU_6OZAI/s1600/thewedding.JPG"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-wedding.html", "title": "\nTHE WEDDING\n"},

And you tucked your shirt into\nyour underwear and pulled that above the\nwaist of those high water pants. \n\n\n\nYou see? \n\n\n\nNo, I am afraid you don\u2019t, dear son.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t mean to even try to teach you conformity, just basic\nclothing safety. You need to learn to ask yourself, \u201cWill this item of clothing\n(or mode of wearing said item) instantly and inevitably cause people to make\nfun of me?\u201d Some possible starter red flags might include: teal, overly\nembellished, ill-fitting, visible underwear. \n\n\n\nWhy should you care about this? Let\u2019s just say it will ease\nthe next few years of your life. \n\n\n\nActually, I am probably the wrong person to identify fashion\nred flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 FSM, Junior Sartorialist, not much older than G\nis right now. NB: You cannot even see that I had rubber bands on the bottoms of\nthe bellbottoms \u2013 just to kinda bring \u2018em in and then let \u2018em flare out\nagain -- and, gosh, I think Roman sandals?\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, darling, while I do not want to curb your loving\nnature, now might well be the time to learn that not everybody has your best\ninterests at heart. I got called into a Dread Meeting after you were away at\ncamp with your class because your teacher was concerned about your going around and giving\nmassages to adults you didn\u2019t know. He worried that you might be vulnerable to\ngetting hurt because you have no idea that some people can have bad intentions.\nHe wondered, as I do, how we can protect your sweet heart while giving you some\nstrong boundaries as you head into adolescence. \n\n\n\nThis is hard to explain, especially to someone honest,\nliteral and pure-intentioned like you. But everyone gets confused about this\nstuff at first. \n\n\n\nIn the aforementioned meeting, your teacher told me a story\nabout how he was once in an airport with his young son when his son asked him,\n\u201cDad, are any of these people strangers?\u201d It\u2019s so beautiful that there are, for\nyou, no strangers. But it is time to learn to draw the line between who is a\ngood candidate for a massage and who is not. Time to know that no one has the\nright to touch your private parts or hurt your body in any way. There will come\na time for intimacy, but that time is not now, buster. \n\n\n\nSo, for now I will very simply say: you should know \u2013 at\nleast in principle - that there is danger in the world.\u00a0 The best way to avoid \u2013 prevention,\nagain, being the theme - this danger is to reserve your trust for people you\nknow well. Also, to never, ever touch someone you do not know or let them touch\nyou.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, regarding things you should do only in an appropriate fashion to others: courting. \n\n\n\nI remember reading somewhere about Social Coaches for this\nstuff, professionals who offer pointers on just how long one may appropriately look at people\none finds attractive, and things to say and do in romantical circumstances.\nHere, sugar, as at least part of the equation, please think offense prevention,\nhumiliation prevention\u2026\n\n\n\nAs with the clothing issue, I may not be the smoothest\nmentor here, but I can say that you\nshould not be following girls (or boys) around at length or staring at their\nbody parts in a noticeable way.\n\n\n\nFor example, when we are at a party (Why? Why????) and the 6th\nGrade (going into 7th) girl you are crushing on (Yes, G, we know\nthis) arrives, you should not go stand 11\u201d\naway from her and talk awkwardly at her while still holding your food plate while food falls off it, while she\nis talking to three other 6th (7th) grade boys and\ntotally ignoring you. \n\n\n\nWhen you told me, \u201cMom, I can handle this,\u201d well, I tried to\nbelieve you, really I did. \n\n\n\nBut, um, I am afraid you cannot.\n\n\n\nAs I have explained, Crushgirl is about a MILLION years\nolder than you. Yes, she, too, is 11. But she is a grade above you and female,\nergo, a million years older than you. \n\n\n\nShe seems to be a super nice kid, who actually sees the wonderful\nperson you are (versus merely tolerating you as some ignoramuses do), but \n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nshe likes talking to other people, too, and\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nin a Zillion years, a 6th grade gal will never\n\u201clike\u201d a 5th grade boy.\n\n\n\nSo, to return to our example, when I call you over and \n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe fellow next to me joins me in advising you that acting\nlike a stalker is bad, and \n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAyi E fills you in on how her son never talks to any of the\ngirls and they all crush on HIM\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2026To be very clear, we did mean that you should maybe give Crushgirl some space and experiment\nwith being quiet, sure. \n\n\n\nWhat we did not mean\nwas that you should go stand 27\u201d away from Crushgirl and pretend that you are a\nMIME.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nYour (Full Spectrum) Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_u-BQqBkr7w/Udq7fkDUj4I/AAAAAAAAALY/Epo7oOx2ex8/s1600/juniorsartorialist.jpg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/07/dear-son.html", "title": "\nDEAR SON\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, October 17, 2013", "body": "\n\n\nAn October 8th NEW YORK TIMES \u201cProfiles in\nScience\u201d piece on Michael Dickinson and fruit flies (Drosophila\nmelanogaster) completely (technical term\nalert) blew my mind. Although fruit flies, obviously, have very small brains,\nthe flexibility and mutability of their neurons result in a per-neuron superior\nfunctionality than is found in humans. Because \u201cthe presence of different\nchemicals called neuromodulators in the fly brain can change how a given group\nof neurons acts at different times\u201d (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/science/focusing-on-fruit-flies-curiosity-takes-flight.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),\nfruit flies have an astounding capacity for (relatively speaking, of course)\nadaptation and development. \n\n\n\nI was inspired by this article to do a little research on\nneuromodulators in humans and it turns out this is a pretty new concept in\nneuroscience, one which looks very promising for human development in the long\nterm.\u00a0 Neuromodulators include\nserotonin and dopamine, with which scientists have been experimenting for\ndecades with somewhat limited success; however, our knowledge of how neuromodulators\ninfluence and transform brain activity is now expanding exponentially. \n\n\n\nDickinson\u2019s work will contribute to this\nunderstanding, as well as to our respect for the complexity and genius of the\nlowly creatures he studies. The wonders of flying, he suggests, rest chiefly in\nthe brain. Just as the brain flexibility of fruit flies enables flight in an\never-changing variety of circumstances, so might the relatively less-flexible\nhuman brain be influenced to adapt and develop -- if we can more effectively identify and utilize\nneuromodulatory mechanisms.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about neuroplasticity around autism,\nhinting at enhanced brain-healing capacity in spectrum-y brains, but I am encouraged by the potential for healing, among other things, brain traumas\n(such as are found in attachment disorders and PTSD) as well. These\nneurological differences \u2013 autism, attachment disorders and PTSD - are all\nsignificant factors in our Full Spectrum household. (Please stay tuned for an\nupcoming post on HEALING in a Full Spectrum!)\n\n\n\nApart from the NEW YORK TIMES\u2019 \u201cScience\u201d section, just a\nquick dabble shows the world of neuroscience is all abuzz (and awiggle) in\npopular culture.\n\n\n\nIn VOGUE, Rebecca Johnson\u2019s \u201cNew Frontier\u201d (October 2013)\nprofiles the neuroscientist Cori Bargmann and her work with a tiny worm (the\nnemotode C. elegans) that has 302\nneurons (humans have 10 billion). Bargmann\u2019s work sketches filaments of hope\nfor brain-science progress between increasing computer capacities, advances in\nelectrodes for the measurement of nerve cells, and improved\nmicrofabrication\u2026She sees psychiatric medicine as just one of the more promising subfields among the many in which neuroscientific developments will benefit humanity. \n\n\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Bargmann marvels in VOGUE, \u201cwe are not just watching\nthe flow of information [via neurons] but trying to change it.\u201d \n\n\n\nOne part scary, one part breathtakingly hopeful, eh?\n\n\n\nTHE NEW YORKER recently published \u201cMindless: The new\nneuro-skeptics,\u201d by Adam Gopnik, about the mind-brain divisions and debunkings\nposited in some circles (September 9, 2013). Gopnik likens the \u201cbrain\u201d camp,\nwith its currently culturally dominant emphasis on neuroscience, to Mr. Spock\n(now you know I love a good Star Trek reference, plus Spock was my\npretend-fianc\u00e9 when I was little). The \u201cmind\u201d camp, which sometimes compares\nneuroscience to the now thoroughly discredited early-nineteenth-century\n\u201cscience\u201d of phrenology (or mapping the mind through the shape of the skull),\nhe frames as akin to Captain Kirk. He points to the rich literature and inquiry\non both \u201cteams\u201d and concludes that both responsibility and possibility lie in\nthe whole package \u2013 mind-plus-brain (plus environment), all working together in\na way so \u201ccomplex and contingent\u201d as to boggle the, ahem, mind.\n\n\n\nComplexity notwithstanding, evolution of many sorts is\nongoing, whether scientific, philosophical, even personal: \u201cWe learn and shape\nour neurology as much as we inherit it,\u201d says Gopnik. \u201dOur selves shape our\nbrains at least as much as our brains our selves.\u201d \n\n\n\nWhat he said. \n\n\n\nMore neuroscience-boom proof: the Nobel Prize in Physiology\nor Medicine for 2013 went to some neuroscience dudes\u2026And Obama recently\nlaunched the BRAIN (Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative\nNeurotechnologies) project, an unprecedented neuroscience initiative (in fact,\nCori Bargmann will co-chair this endeavor). \n\n\n\nBut then, working on the mind is nothing new. \n\n\n\nFrom ancient philosophers to contemporary mystics, wise\npeople have always known it is possible to train (ideally) and re-train\n(less-ideally, but more commonly) the mind. From Plato\u2019s (and his student,\nAristotle\u2019s) thoughts on ideal environments and habits for exercising the\nvirtues, to the Buddha\u2019s writings on practices to calm and discipline the mind\nand actions; from Confucius on good habits and self-discipline in harmony (the\nTao), to Teresa of Avila on practicing devotions of imagination and\ncontemplation; from Thomas Merton on spiritual disciplines as the way to\nliberation,* to Starhawk on \u201cpsychological techniques and personal disciplines\u201d\nas tools for transformation;** and on and on (I\u2019ve left so many out in the\ninterest of brevity!!)\u2026all the great\ntraditions offer tools for behavioral, mental, emotional, and \u2013 sometimes \u2013\nspiritual development of the mind. \n\n\n\nNow we are just beginning to enter this heretofore sci-fi\nrealm of attaining real knowledge about the brain itself. It\u2019s exciting. \n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Full Spectrum Mama loves her children and self just\nas they are, and is NOT looking for a\n\u201ccure\u201d for Asperger\u2019s!!!! ***\n\n\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t it be great to have the option of tweaking our own neurology in positive ways? Even\nif we have no desire whatsoever to change, this knowledge itself will be\nawe-inspiring: we have the potential to understand, if not emulate, what\nDickinson calls the \u201cgreat success stories\u201d borne of adaptable, flexible\n(fruitfly) neurology.\n\n\n\nFull Spectrum Mama is certainly gung ho about adding new\ntools to our quests for health and healing, especially in terms of reducing\nsuffering.\u00a0 To wit, my neurology\nhas always been sensitive and prone to migraines, but with age and/or a major\nconcussion a few years back and/or something else (?) my migraines and PTSD\ntriggers have increased dramatically over the years. I\u2019d try just about\nanything \u2013 meditation to neuromodulation - to soothe these neurological\nresponses. Just \u2013 don\u2019t you touch my Special Interests! \n\n\n\nI guess that last is the key, though.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Bargmann bemoans\nthe \u201cdismal state\u201d of today\u2019s psychiatric medicines, and the field of\nneuromodulators remains in its infancy. All the beautiful possibilities\nmentioned in these articles are still just ideas. Early on, would tweaking my\nneurology result in unintended consequences such as losing my precious Special\nInterests or other things about me that I treasure or see as integral to who I\nam? Furthermore, the idea of such tools being used against our will or\nunbeknownst to us is unsettling, at best. \u201cNeuromodulism\u201d (I just made that up)\ncould become \u201cthe new eugenics.\u201d Ew. \n\n\n\n\u00a0With all these\ncaveats, I am still intrigued by the potential for human beings to develop and\nadapt more effectively. Reducing certain kinds of obstacles to flourishing,\nsuch as unwanted manifestations of mental illness, physiological trauma and\nphysical pain, will help us \u201cfly\u201d higher \u2013 and with more flexibility. \n\n\n\nNow come on, Homo sapiens! If D. melanogaster can\ndo it, we can too!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n* Admittedly, Merton\u2019s deeply entwined Catholicism and Zen Buddhism were somewhat controversial, but FSM always errs on the side of acceptance.\n\n\n\n\n** http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/nonviolencework.html\n\n\n\n*** Speaking of Asperger\u2019s: between you and me and the\nfencepost, take a look at the picture of Dickinson and then read his words and\nask yourself who\u2019s got Asperger\u2019s all up in that article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/science/focusing-on-fruit-flies-curiosity-takes-flight.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0", "http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/nonviolencework.html"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/10/learning-to-fly-neuro-moment.html", "title": "\nLEARNING TO \u201cFLY\u201d \u2013 A NEURO-MOMENT\n"},

Lucky you. We are a very corny, silly family with penchants for repetition and nonsense.  Z\u2019s sense of humor tends toward the witty, G\u2019s toward the baffling and awkward; both love a good potty joke. As for me, sometimes I feel as a Full Spectrum Mama that if I am not laughing I might well be crying\u2026So when my head is clear enough to make that choice (which is not a given), I choose the giggle. That shared sense of humor may well be our saving grace.This happened when Z was four years old. In order for the story to make sense, a few preliminary details are necessary. First, we do not have any broadcast television and live in a pretty idyllic and sheltered rural area. Second, we do not cuss in our home. I believe I may have said the \u201cS\u201d word once or twice, but that\u2019s it. I manage to eff up on a daily basis in plenty of other ways, but non-cussin\u2019 is one area of success. It is possible that Z and G have heard profanities at their father\u2019s house, but always as exclamations, never as vernacular. Finally, at the time this incident occurred, my now-husband (henceforth referred to as \u201cPardner\u201d) and I were dating, and the kids called him \u201cShushu\u201d (uncle in Mandarin).We are at a cute little restaurant in trendy, charming New Hope, PA enjoying some adequate Mexican food on our way home from visiting with family. Again, Z is four, a sassy, going-on-25-going-on-75-four, but nonetheless she is barely as tall as the table at which we are sitting. Our little family \u2013 Pardner, G, Z and me \u2013 is enjoying some jovial repartee and eating tacos and sides. Z likes her food spicy and G likes his bland, so I have apportioned the food accordingly.In my memory, I am looking at my yellow rice and lumpy brown pile of beans when Z turns to me and says, \u201cMama, Susu Pardner makes you laugh like a bitc#!\u201dI turn to Pardner, sotto voce, \u201cDid she just say laughlikeabitc#?\u201d I feel, simultaneously, a very wide range of emotions. The dominant feeling is: I am about to crack up laughing worse than ever before in my life in a way that will be highly inappropriate on many levels. Also, I will not be able to stop laughing, either, should I start.I lurch into autopilot-damage-control: \u201cSnitch,\u201d I say, \u201cWhere did you learn that funny, funny word?\u201d\u201cI said Bitc#.\u201d\u201cOh, hahahahaha, ditch, yes, that IS funny. Hahaha.\u201d\u201cBitc#.\u201dHas it ever hit you full on that your child, your tiny little child, is already much cooler than you ever have been or could hope to be? The best part was how she said it, all feisty and ghetto, and like she knew what she meant.  Head bobbing a little from side to side and the pointed finger going. For real.Let\u2019s face it, hearing babies and little kids swear is funny. It just is. Cute, too. Yet of course Full Spectrum Mama has to protect her daughter from her own precociousness and from apparent insidious influences. As much as Z has seemed all her life to need nobody, nohow, she\u2019s still a child and she needs guidance.Somehow I kept a straight face. I used the famous parental move \u201cignore and move on,\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cCuban Missile Crisis\u201d). Afterward, I did do my best to figure out where she got the idea to say \u201claugh like a bitc#,\u201d although I never did find out. I believe she has forgotten this particular phrase, though she still can be plenty fresh. I remind myself on the daily that Z may seem like a cooler, more socially-adept peer, even, ahem, someone who might\u2019ve been mean to me in high school but \u2013 she isn\u2019t.  She is my little girl. So I need to be the grown-up.I thought about \u201claugh like a bitc#\u201d the other day when we were walking home from school. There is a beautiful forested area right next door to our house and I sometimes allow G to walk through it en route.  That day he asked, \u201cMama, may I venture into the woods?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, my son, go in peace,\u201d I replied.Wonder where he gets his quirky turn of phrase?G, a major bookworm from birth, has always talked as if he lives in medieval times, or is in a Poke\u00b4mon program (he sees them chez the ex). Back in preschool, he would literally ask the other kids questions like, \u201cWould you care to engage in a playful interaction with me?\u201d (Sample, highly effective Z preschool utterance: \u201cGimme that if you wanna play with me\u2026whatever.\u201d)How did it evolve that my two children \u2013 who have the same parents* -- express such a Full Spectrum of speech patterns? Ways of speaking -- how we tap into the vernacular (or not), how we draw from our reading and other parts of the world around us\u2026how we hit the coolness nail on the head or NOT -- can be seen as more Full and rich Spectrums.(*Oops, I totally forgot that Z was adopted for a moment there \u2013 but let\u2019s agree that certainly she has had the same parental environment as G since she was 9 months old\u2026)Z remains the sharp-witted queen of kindergarten, whilst G\u2019s courtly language flies about as well in fourth grade as it did back then.  Oh, someday he will find his tribe. But\u2026Goddess? PLEASE get him through middle school with his sweet soul intact. And please, please -- I know it is not my girlbaby\u2019s job, but she can handle it -- make Z protect him once they are in high school together.I will do anything!!!Laughing like a bitc#,Love,Full Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2012/02/laugh-like.html", "title": "\n\"Laugh Like a...\"\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, December 12, 2013", "body": "\n\n\nSomeone posted this on my Facebook page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013\nASPERGERS Acrostic Meme\n\n\n\nA bunch of autistic people, people with autism, parents of\nautistic people and parents of people with autism (bear with me on these\nlabels, just tryna make everyone happy!) responded. \n\n\n\nAt some point, early on, someone in my extended family\ncommented as follows:\n\n\n\nummm.. Well I know it's uncool to\nsay it, but those things apply on a LOT of levels to many people, even those\nnot on the spectrum. Aren't we all on the spectrum to some degree? I mean that\nis what a spectrum is, from the smallest degree to the most challenged. We all\nfall on there somewhere.\n\n\n\nThen, perhaps fearing the Wrath of the Autism Spectrum, that\nperson removed the above comment before anyone had a chance to respond.\n\n\n\nBut I thought it might be a good inroad for an important and\nnecessary conversation. So I saved it and thought about it and here\u2019s my\nanswer:\n\n\n\nShort Version:\n\n\n\n\u2026Yes!\n\n\n\nAnd\u2026No!\n\n\n\nLong Version:\n\n\n\nYes, by all means, I hope people DO feel included \u2013 in\ngeneral and in this here Full Spectrum! I want neurotypical people and\nnon-neurotypical people and everybody in-between to relate to each other with\nempathy and compassion. I hope very much that people relate their own \u201cendless\ntalking\u201d or \u201crigidity\u201d or \u201cgiftedness\u201d to those qualities in others, and\ntherefore become more open and accepting. I think that\u2019s the kind part of the\nintention in this comment. \n\n\n\nFinding out about Asperger's syndrome (now officially known\nas an autism spectrum disorder) through having a son with that diagnosis has certainly\nhelped me with my own lifelong struggles with a different neurology (diagnosed only\nlater in life). Based on what people have told me, this blog speaks to a\nvariety of individuals who relate to our experiences, not just vis-\u00e0-vis autism\nbut attachment disorders and family stuff and \u201chuman being\u201d as well. In terms\nof specific differences, readers have told me they\u2019ve recognized\nattachment-disordered traits in family members and themselves and that our\nexperiences have helped them deal better; same for autism\u2026\n\n\n\nAs for the actual person who made this comment, I would say\nthat we are related and we share a lot of neurology. Many of these above traits,\nlike being \u201csensitive to criticism\u201d or having an \u201cadvanced vocabulary,\u201d do run in\nfamilies -- whether from culture or genetics or both. \n\n\n\nBesides, things like a tendency to be \u201ceasily distressed\u201d\nand being \u201csocially challenged\u201d are not restricted to people on the autism\nspectrum and their families. Nor are being \u201cgifted\u201d or \u201cremiss\u201d &c traits\nof only people in the special autism spectrum disorder/Asperger\u2019s association.\n\n\n\nBUT!\n\n\n\n[Names of commenters on this post] and I, indeed all of us\nwho are on the autism spectrum and/or are raising children who are, experience moderate\nto severe social challenges and neurological differences that affect all of our\nlives in significant ways. Some of us don\u2019t just \u201crelate\u201d to the traits on this\nlist, we are defined by them, especially\nby others \u2013 and most especially by the neurotypical world.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Much as we hope\nto \n\nhelp our children/ourselves accept\nand/or transcend disability and/or \n\ncelebrate their/our unique qualities\nand/or\n\nwork toward a culture where neuro-\nand other diversity is a given and all neurologies and disabilities and\ndifferences are \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 VALUED\n\nRESPECTED and \n\nTAKEN INTO\nACCOUNT,\n\nour children (and sometimes we ourselves) experience\nchallenges (and sometimes need services and accommodations) that most others,\nquite simply, don't.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had to fight hard for our kids and ourselves, at times\njust to hold steady at \u201cokay\u201d or \u201cbarely okay.\u201d We\u2019ve got IEPs,* 504s,*\nbehavioral plans, stacks of test results\u2026Most of us have daunting piles of\n(mostly unread) books on the trajectory from Sensory Processing Disorder\nonward\u2026Sometimes we have to get babysitters for our teenagers (if we can afford\nit \u2013 my average is twice yearly). \n\n\n\nWe have to wade through mountains of labels and advice from\nspecialists and experts, and consider (or not! [and then we have to deflect!])\n\u201ccures\u201d directed \u2013 mostly well-meaningly \u2013 at ourselves, our parenting, our\ndifferences, our children, our families\u2026\n\n\n\nWe frequently get asked to participate in unwanted meetings\n-- and then we have to wrangle for the meetings we do want. \n\n\n\nWe get called in to school when our kid is quacking in\nassembly; when the teacher wants to meet with our child\u2019s class without our\nchild present to explain why s/he is not \u201cweird\u201d but \u201cdifferent;\u201d called in\nbecause our kid is \u2018agitated\u201d over a challenge a neurotypical kid would not\neven notice, such as a change in routine\u2026\n\n\n\nDo these things sound familiar? If not, then you and/or your\nchild probably do not have autism or, for that matter, some other \u201cspecial\nneed.\u201d I am not trying to say those on the spectrum are members of some exclusive club, I am trying to be clear on what is what: \n\nHaving autism/being autistic is NOT something everyone\nshares. There is an autism spectrum, and there is a spectrum that leads, in\nspectrum fashion, up to that spectrum, but it is not the same.\n\n\n\nThe same might be said of an attachment disorder spectrum.\nMy other, non-autism-spectrum-y child does not have a Severe\nattachment disorder, wherein people are unable to form meaningful connections\nwith others. On the attachment disorder spectrum, she falls on what\u2019s known as\nthe Mild to Moderate\u00a0attachment disorder\nsection, where attachments are possible but often fraught. Healthily-attached\nchildren without attachment disorders may share some traits that are deeply\nfamiliar to parents of children with attachment disorders (such as controlling\nbehavior or hoarding), but that does not mean they have the clinically defined\ncondition known as an attachment disorder! (More on this below\u2026)\n\n\n\nAll behaviors occur in populations to varying degrees and in\na myriad of combinations. When an individual is found to be \u201cout of the \u2018norm\u2019\u201d\n\u2013 by the schools and/or parent(s) or guardian(s) --\u00a0 they usually get evaluated and labeled and their differences\nmay then be addressed within that paradigm. This process alone can be deeply\ngrueling. \n\n\n\nIt may also sometimes be rewarding, at least insofar as it\nmay offer insights for interacting, processing, succeeding in a neurotypical\n(and/or relatively healthily-attached, and/or typically-abled) world. With that\nin mind, Full Spectrum Mama investigates daily life with a bunch of people who\nhappen to embody some useful labels -- but are more than just these labels! --\nin hopes of offering something worthwhile shining out of our Full Spectrum. \n\n\n\n\n\nRespect for neurodiversity is a key theme for the Full\nSpectrum Project -- and I believe that\u2019s a piece of where my erstwhile\ncommentator was coming from, as well as the intent of the above acrostic. \n\n\n\nOne of the greatest things to come out of the neurodiverty\nmovement(s) is this idea that the ideas and thought patterns of divergent\nneurologies may be equally valid and in some cases superior. Before, we\nmight\u2019ve been inclined to dismiss ourselves. Now, we are gradually coming to value\ndifferent perspectives more \u2013 even if the wider world has a ways to go to catch\nup. \n\n\n\nDivergent neurology is, apparently, becoming more and more\ncommon -- and as such one hopes it will be less and less marginalized, less\noften dismissed as \u201cremiss.\u201d I hope, though, that increasing acceptance and\ndiversity never amount to attempted homogeneity!\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve always been openly against moral relativism \u2013 the idea\nthat all moral views deserve equal respect and are equally valid - on this blog\nand as a longtime professor of ethics. But I do espouse \u201cneural relativism:\u201d the idea that all neurologies\nare worthy of respect and consideration. This is not to imply that\nthey are all the same: commonalities do\nnot necessarily mean shared identity, status or diagnosis. To suggest that they\ndo, as my dear commentator seemed to be doing \u2013 however briefly \u2013 might seem to\ntrivialize the very real struggles many of us face. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example: if you have received a diagnosis of an\nautism spectrum disorder, you know that your neural processes are \u201cnot normal.\u201d\nWhat does this mean, exactly? For many, it has historically meant reduced\nself-trust, a devaluation of one\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d thinking. This is changing. Today, many of us contend that knowing your thought processes, sensory processing and\nreactions might be different from the mainstream is useful information, but it\ndoesn\u2019t mean we should thus dismiss our concerns and conclusions based on that\ndivergence! \n\n\n\nThe mainstream certainly keeps things somewhat on track, but\nit has also brought us witch hunts, slavery, centuries of marriage inequality,\nBritney Spears, Monsanto, \u201cBlack Friday,\u201d the 1%, dodgeball, Flamin\u2019 Hot\nCheetos \u2026\n\n\n\nKnowledge is power. A self-evident and over-quoted phrase?\nMaybe to you (or maybe not!). Until I began to learn about my son\u2019s and my\nnon-typical neurology, until I began to address certain needs (such as sensory\nbreaks) as needs, NOT preferences, I\nspent a lot of time feeling as if I was an alien being assaulted by humans and\nenvironments (tangent: animals were my salvation). Migraines were (and are) a\nmajor factor in life. Other people\u2019s\u2019 brains and actions were so opaque to me\nthat I tended to doubt myself and give others credence when I should not have\nand thereby made myself vulnerable to exploitation, an experience many of my\nspectrum-y friends share. The incidence of exploitation and abuse is anecdotally\nhigher among those on the autism spectrum. I do think and hope that this\nterrible pattern is changing with increased knowledge and awareness.\n\n\n\nLearning about the neurodiverse brain has shown me, finally,\nhow to set boundaries and how to trust in myself, and to teach my children to\ndo the same. I hope G is learning these skills in time to spare him much\nsuffering. I hope it can make him feel less alienated, less \u201csocially\nchallenged,\u201d more connected.\n\n\n\nHaving a daughter who exhibits the mirror opposite of the\n\u201ctypically \u2018autistic\u2019\u201d traits exhibited by my son (and, in many cases, by me)\nhas given me a lot to chew on in this idea of connection. Learning about\nattachment disorders has also shown us how to set boundaries for Z and build\nher self-confidence and trust -- in us and in herself.\n\n\n\nIn short, we\u2019ve seen how the tools affiliated with certain\nlabels and diagnoses may be effective (or, plenty of times, not) in a wide\nrange of contexts.\n\n\n\nIn this conversation about commonalities, meaning and\ncontext also play a huge role vis-\u00e0-vis\nappropriate tools, labels and analyses. When a healthily-attached child of four\nhas a massive, age-appropriate tantrum, that\u2019s healthy; when an eight year old\nwith an attachment disorder does the same, it is an expression of a deeper\npain. Or: when a healthily-attached child tests their evolving independence by\nbeing defiant, their parent may well view that behavior as natural and\nappropriate; whereas when a child with an attachment disorder acts defiant, it\nis typically because they feel unsafe and out of control inside \u2013 and\nuntrusting. The latter child needs \u2013 in order to build trust, heal and feel\nsafe \u2013 a very different response than does the former. \n\n\n\nTherapeutic parenting, as defined by the therapist we have\nworked with, can look very different than your basic permissive vs. strict\nparenting spectrum. In my experience, therapeutic parenting of this flavor is\nnot always looked upon kindly, particularly by the progressive parenting\npopulation. So, parents of children with attachment disorders may live with\nanother difference that is challenging -- and that too may feel trivialized by\nthose who try to say we are all the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, I\u2019m first aiming to make clear distinctions\nwithin connection. Second, out of that clarity, I celebrate the incredible,\nperhaps more-broadly applicable, helpfulness of the tools we have been blessed\nto glean from learning about aspects of\nthe labels that represent elements of\nthe human beings in our family. Sometimes these tools are about healing and,\nyes, \u201ccuring\u201d an attachment disorder; sometimes they are about understanding\nand creating space for divergent neurologies. They are always about growing in\ninclusion and peace. The whole Full Spectrum household has become happier now\nthat we have these tools.\n\n\n\nIf reading about autism or attachment disorders or whatever (identifying with theASPERGERS acrostic, for\nexample) helps you in some way, more power to you! Our journey in this wacky,\ndivergent, polarizing, unifying enterprise was what got me started on this blog\nin the first place, because Full Spectrum Mama embraces connection\nwithin difference. \n\n\n\nLearning more about autism has not convinced me that everyone\nhas Asperger's or spectrum-y tendencies at all. In fact, I wish that were so, as\nchildren are not always particularly nice with those who are \"different.\"\nG's differences from the general population are more than clear (along with his\nmany wonderful qualities!!). He's faced far greater challenges socially and in general\nthan the average kid, as I know the aforementioned facebook-commenting parents'\nchildren have. \n\n\n\nGuess you could say I am not a parenting relativist either.\nI have personal, direct, experiential knowledge that parenting a child who has\ncommon sense and a reasonable level of social skills -- a child who I know with\n100% certainty will be completely fine on his/her own as an adult --\u00a0 is 37 bajillion times easier/less\nworrisome that parenting one who doesn\u2019t share these life skills, though I\nwouldn\u2019t trade or change the latter child for all the world. \n\n\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s not a contest. Of course all children and parents\nand people have challenges. The challenges of autism per se, though, are not really\nexpressed by the fact that, sure, many people might share some of the qualities\non this ASPERGERS acrostic list. At the same time, we want to be really\ncareful to be sensitive around trumpeting the \u201cdifficulties\u201d of autism in a\ntime when fear-mongering around the \u201cautism epidemic\u201d is rampant. \n\n\n\nThis list is just a tool, I think, meant for people with asperger's syndrome and those who love 'em or want to to understand more about it. I can\u2019t speak to\nthe artist\u2019s intention, but I can say with some confidence that s/he probably\nintended the list for a specifically asperger's-related purpose.\n\n\n\nThat being said, the whole point at Full Spectrum Mama \u2013 as\nI hope I have made clear, er\u2026somewhat at length, herein -\u00a0 is the\nconnections between all of us. FSM engages the idea that we are all on a giant\nspectrum and that therefore the similarities and differences between us can be\ninstructive - and funny. It entertains the idea that my two children, as PART\nof who they are, seem often to be truly on opposite areas of that giant\nspectrum. It explores these two vastly contrasting yet sometimes surprisingly\nconnected areas of a Full Spectrum that happen to be known as autism and\nattachment disorder. \n\n\n\nMy intention is to be illuminative of one unique mix, to be\ninclusive, to describe our spectrum, where the tools that work for us might\nhave a higher chance of working for others for the very fact that they are\nworking (or not working, puh-lease!) for\nspectrum locations that seem poles apart. My daughter is not on the autism\nspectrum, my son is not on the attachment disorder spectrum, but they are both\n\u2013 as are we all \u2013 on the inclusive, colorful, beautiful FULL Spectrum. \n\n\n\nWhen I started writing/drawing Full Spectrum Mama almost two\nyears ago, I envisioned the Full Spectrum as a Line.

{"date": "Monday, January 13, 2014", "body": "\n\nThis time last year, we had just fought a grueling but\nsuccessful battle to retain G\u2019s IEP. He\u2019d erroneously been tested for reading\nand math \u2013 his two best subjects \u2013 and been removed from eligibility because of\nthe not-surprisingly good results of those tests\u2026Meanwhile, he was barely able\nto write a word, a sentence, a paragraph\u2026\n\n\n\nWe\u2019d \u201cwon\u201d that fight, with the help of his teachers and\nprincipal, following a lot of foot dragging from the district; what we still had\nto contend with a year ago was a relatively homogenous school environment and a\nchild who struggled with expressing himself coherently in writing and felt\nbullied every day. \n\n\n\nI shared what I learned from that intense experience in this\npost: http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html.\nIf you are looking for basic tips on advocacy, this post is the place to go. Please\nsee the list toward the end for my pointers on dealing with bureaucracy, and\nIEP and 504 meetings, and addressing your child\u2019s/children\u2019s needs in\ninstitutional settings. \n\n\n\nIn retrospect, I can see that \u2013 much as I adore and respect\nthe heck out of him -- beyond words!\u00a0\nPuh-lease!!!! -- on a subconscious level I was seeing G as in some small\nway a part of \u201cThe Problem.\u201d\u00a0 Now\nthat he is in a more diverse environment, with students who are comfortable\nwith a mix of people, and teachers and administrators who are accustomed to\nkids on the autism spectrum, a lot of things have eased up.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAs always, this is what worked for our family. In the balance, making the choice to move our\nentire existence was the right one for us. It was also a huge gamble, a chance\nnot all families are able to make (and we have BARELY made it -- whew!) -- and\none that I am happy to say paid off in our case. Autism was less common in G\u2019s\nold school and this impacted every level of his experience, from institutional\nto educational to social. Obviously, G is still on the spectrum, but his\npresent school is more of a spectrum too. For him, for us, this works.\n\n\n\nAnd so, without further ado, my first second anniversary\nlist:\n\n\n\nSchool Advocacy II \n\n\n\n\n\n1. Context matters. A tiny,\ncozy school where everybody knows everybody might be the right one for your\nchild. Homeschooling might be the right choice for your family. Or perhaps your\nchild will do best in a big school with lots of services and a wide-ranging\nstudent body. Maybe an alternative/private school might be your chosen option,\nif you can afford it, or are able to access scholarships or school district\nsupport. My point: the impact of environment can be more profound than one\nrealizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Sometimes Change is\nnecessary. To say that change and transitions can be challenging for our Full\nSpectrum would be a vast understatement. Sound familiar? If stuff isn\u2019t workin\u2019\nout too well as it is, though, you might consider changing things up. \n\n\n\nLittle changes can matter too: does\nyour child lose focus while doing homework in isolation (something you might\u2019ve\narranged to minimize distraction\u2026)? Try using noise-canceling headphones in a\nmore-busy area and crunchy carrot sticks (haha, I meant chips) to keep things\nlively. \n\n\n\nBigger changes, like moving and\nchanging schools, obviously entail bigger risks \u2013 and possibly bigger benefits\ntoo. \n\n\n\nEase changes where you can with\nstrategies such as advance notice, clear scheduling, and comfort measures \u2013\nsoothing (or stimulating) activities, food, objects\u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n3. Stay vigilant.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that just great advice? Yeah,\neven when things seem fine: stay vigilant. Pfffft. \n\n\n\nBut -- wouldn\u2019t you know it, as\nsoon as I felt like the school had things well in hand I sorta\u2026exhaled\u2026and took\na little breaky-poo? Next thing you know G is failing certain assignments and I\nam called in to a Meeting and then I am writing my Meeting Friend this text: \n\n\n\n\u201c[Censored]! I forgot about\nspeaking up just nodded and said I will talk to [G] when in fact they did not\ndo right by him or create an environment where success was possible. Help! Must\nregroup. But I am okay. Just entered brief complacent fugue state and now will\ntriumph\u2026somehow ;) p.s. Don\u2019t worry. Am bemused but okay. Forgot [G] has\ndisability.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn this particular instance, G was\nfailing a months-long writing project because he was overwhelmed by the combination of his\nclassroom environment and learning new technologies and skills on the\ncomputer.\u00a0 He\u2019s at a point where he\nmight be able to handle one of those things and still reach his potential, but not\nboth.\n\n\n\nSo I wrote his teacher along these\nlines:\n\n\n\nDear\n[teacher],\n\nThanks for\nmeeting with me yesterday.\n\nI was really left with two\ndifferent thoughts after our meeting: on the one hand, [G] does need to learn\nto buck up, get it together, ship shape, etc. but on the OTHER he does have a\ndisability that we need to accommodate and work with to best bring out his\npotential.\n\nI do feel that his failing this\nproject because of new-computer frustration would be a shame. Clearly, he was\noverwhelmed by learning new skills in a busy environment, which is typical for\nhim as well as many children on the autism spectrum.\n\nI will work with him at home. Hope\nyou can give us an extra week or so to whip it into shape in a low\npressure-high achievement environment ;)\n\nThank you,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [FSM]\n\n\n\nHis teacher allowed him to take\nsome extra time and he ended up with a decent(-ish) grade on the assignment.\n\n\n\nYay vigilance!!! Just because a\nschool gets a wide range of students doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have to\nadvocate from time to time\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Cycles: Know that there will be cycles of advocacy challenges.\nAfter a recent blessedly calm, several-week meeting-free stretch I witnessed\nwith chagrin my Meeting Friend looking stricken while being collared by the\nprincipal at pick-up. I was unable to get to her before she rushed off with her\nchild, so sent I her psychic and text support and planned to call her and\ninquire. A few minutes later, Pardner called me and said the school had called US because G\nhad gotten \u201cagitated\u201d over a computer imbroglio (see above). Anyway, when I\ncalled my MF to check in, come to find out her child, too, had been \u201cagitated\u201d\nthat day. Wheee.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.\nServices: \n\nIn this larger, more-inundated\nschool, G no longer qualifies for many of the services he received at his last\nschool. Part of this \u2013 in PT and OT -- is because of great past work by amazing\nphysical and occupational therapists; some progress is G\u2019s own hard work. But\nit\u2019s also because the standards of qualification are more stringent. And I do\nworry that G will fall way, way behind again. His early motor skills and\nkinesthetic test scores were typically all at the very lowest end of low.\u00a0 Now that he\u2019s low-average, will he\ncontinue to grow and improve without help? Or at least not regress? Please see\n#3\u2026\n\n\n\nG no longer has a one-on-one\neither. This is because his classroom already has three embedded\nparaprofessionals in addition to a highly effective, gifted, funny, experienced\nteacher. Do these three have enough time to get to everyone who needs their\nattention? Again, see #3.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, G\u2019s new school\noffers a lot of services, particularly in group-settings, that were unavailable\nat the small school he previously attended. I feel like G\u2019s needs are being met\nin different ways, and that we are in a basic state of balance between services\nand mainstreaming. But I am also ready to put on my official clothes and use my\nlint brush and march in there at once if necessary. Luckily, the parties\ninvolved do what they do because they care about children and education, so I\ndo feel we are all on the same page as to wanting the best for G. \n\n\n\nIf you do not feel this way, if\nyou and/or your child/ren is/are in an environment where the powers that be do\nnot share this best-wanting intention, and are reluctant to change, you may\nneed to advocate more powerfully OR see #s 1 and 2. \n\n\n\n6. Treats: I am going to write more about this in \u201cSecond Anniversary Lists III: Choosing your Battles,\u201d but I am\nimpressed by the power of treats. \n\n\n\na. Treats for Students: G\u2019s new school uses sugar for\nalmost everything and it works. I know, I know: sugar. Regular readers will be\nwell-informed of our sugar aversion. I cringe every time G shows up after\nschool with a neon-colored lollipop. But positive reinforcement \u2013 what does\nyour child love/crave? Maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be so ghastly? \u2013 can make the\ndifference between a child who is functioning, even thriving, within school\nboundaries and one who is flailing and failing. \n\n\n\nI know G\u2019s lollipop represents his\nsitting in his seat, or not interrupting, or closing the bathroom door\u2026and\nsince sugar affects him less than it does me, I make the choice to allow it. I\nmention this in this here Advocacy piece because working with your school to\nput a system of treats in place for rewarding positive behaviors might really\nmake a difference for all parties concerned. \n\n\n\nIf you can figure out what really\nmight feel like a treat to your child (or yourself, or your student, or your\nroommate, or partner, or\u2026) -- whether it\u2019s praise, hugs, Pok\u00e9mon cards, screen\ntime, or something else, perhaps something unique (but it must be something\n\nClear, and\n\nConsistent)\n\n-- you can begin to assess whether\nthat individual responds well to this sort of system.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b.\nTreats for Advocates: sometimes\nnecessary. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c.\nTreats for All, for No Particular\nReason: also sometimes necessary. \n\n\n\nRegarding these treats\nprescriptions, remember: Full Spectrum Mama is a Doctor\n[of philosophy]. \n\n\n\n\n\nStrong and effective advocating to you,\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/01/second-anniversary-lists-i-advocacy.html", "title": "\nSecond Anniversary Lists I: Advocacy\n"},

I figure these are the\nmajor challenges each is facing right now. I also advise them to learn from\neach other, as I estimate that Z has about a million common sense points and G\na million kindness points. \n\n\n\nI try to notice whenever each of them exhibits \u2013 or does not\nexhibit \u2013 their desired trait. Some manifestations are obvious: for G, in order\nto get a point, he needs to zip his pants, not tuck socks or shirts into said\npants, close the mailbox cover when he gets the mail, close and lock public\nbathroom doors, wipe his nose when he sneezes or it is running,* etc. \u2013 and if\nhe neglects these, or similar, he loses a point. In Z\u2019s Battle, I need to be\nmindful to notice and reward her when she does something kind, such as sharing\nwithout being told to do so; when I see that she has told another girl her age that\nshe cannot sit at the kids\u2019 table (for instance), well, she loses points. \n\n\n\nWhen we reach 50 points, we get TREATS. That is, each\nBattler gets to choose a reward that means a lot to him or her once they\u2019ve reached\nthis 50-point target. Having started our Points system in September or October,\nG is now on his third round of 50, while Z is holding steady at 11. Total. She\nrecently announced a personal goal of 16 points for the New Year. \n\n\n\nMama\u2019s Battle? Relaxation Points.

He calls his\nversion of the song and dance \u201cGengar Style,\u201d after a naughty, levitating\nShadow Type Pokemon called Gengar.* He\u2019s way out on the playground with some\nkids he doesn\u2019t know and, between calls to him to come boogie with me, I hear\nthose loud \u201ceeeeeh\u201d noises that he makes sometimes because he likes them -- and\nother times because he\u2019s socially overwhelmed. I hurry over and he\u2019s progressed\nto shouting unintelligible sounds and making faces in the general direction of\na play structure. Some younger kids are cowering and glowering nearby. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask, pulling him away as fast as I can.\n\n\n\n\u201cA girl threatened me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShe told me she was going to beat me up!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat little girl with the sour face, who is much, much\nsmaller than you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d (G tends not to pay attention to his own size or age\nrelative to others.)\n\n\n\nI sigh, hug him. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t, honey.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut she said she had beat up a 15 year old!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut baby, that\u2019s not true.

He\u2019s still figuring out other ways to do so, and in the meantime doesn\u2019t\nseem to have integrated extensive advice against face-in-face. \n\n\n\nI try to seize the teachable moment: \u201cHow do you think she\nfelt when you got in her personal space, you know, \u2018in her face\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026try again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAngry?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTry again. Angry and mad are pretty much the same.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThreatened?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes. So I bet that\u2019s why she threatened you, don\u2019tcha\nthink?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe nods.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd G, did you notice all those kids were much younger than\nyou?\u201d\n\n\"Not really.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey probably thought you were being a bully, G. Which of\ncourse you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nG is the most gentle person I know, but he\u2019s a really big\ndude with no idea of his own size or the impression it might give.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI sigh. Again. \u201cOh sweety, I know you\u2019d never want to scare\nanyone. But you have to try to think about whether other kids are bigger or\nsmaller than you and what they might think you mean in your actions and words,\nokay? Do you think you can remember this next time?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d G says, shrugging. \n\n\n\nBy the time we reach the party shed, the song has ended. G\ngoes in and sits back in a corner alone, looking perplexed. Eventually, some\nextra cupcake frosting comforts and cheers him up.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes G is served well by his unique neurology. His\nomnipresent honesty, truly original creativity, staunch reliability, deep\nloyalty and lack of regard for conventional measures of success or \u201ccoolness\u201d\nare just a few traits that come to mind in this regard. I know he takes\nsatisfaction in living by what he deems right and good. Those of us who \u201cget\u201d\nhim celebrate his living by his own lights as well. Nevertheless, even these\narguably superb qualities are not necessarily ones that lead to mainstream\nsocial acceptance!\n\n\n\nOf course there\u2019s neurologically-rooted stuff to work on\ntoo, like developing the tools to navigate playground dynamics, many of which\nare analogous to adult social milieus. It just sometimes seems the neurotypical\nworld currently remains more inclined to marginalize both G\u2019s particular gifts and his challenges than to celebrate or accommodate\nthem. \n\n\n\nSuppose G \u2013 because, as things stand, it\u2019ll be on him to do\nso - takes a very long time to adapt here, what is the adult equivalent of\nfrosting? \n\n\n\nOh yeah.

Having, via my Guest Writing, complained\nher main COMPLAINTS last year (http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-iv-complaint.html),\nFull Spectrum Mama was in an expansive mood for 2014. Except -- she still\nwanted to COMPLAIN that the wrinkles, plus pimples, plus hair loss, plus,\nadmittedly, the very occasional, minor, miniscule mood swings of The Peri (our\ncutesy nickname for perimenopause) are no fair. \n\n\n\nThis line of reasoning might be summed up in a more general\nCOMPLAINT, one deemed eminently acceptable by THE COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT (TCD):\nSome things are just No Fair. Is this fair? No.\n\n\n\nIn any case, this year TCD opened briefly in order to accept\na multitude of READER COMPLAINTS gathered on behalf of PiMP by Full Spectrum\nMama. Thanks, everybody, for so generously sharing your woes, irritants,\nprotestations, and objections, as well as your grievances, grumbles and\ngrouses; also: your cavils and quibbles, not to mention your jeremiads, beefs\nand whinges!\n\n\n\nThe COMPLAINTS are addressed in two formats: first, a list\nof shorter COMPLAINTS that are self-explanatory and simply needed to be\ncomplained; second, a more in-depth series of COMPLAINTS and RESPONSES from\nTCD. PiMP had originally intended to separate the funny ones and the sad ones,\nbut the uniquely enticing combination of pathos and snorts won out. In the\nlatter section, readers will find the more serious COMPLAINTS clustered toward\nthe end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI.

PiMP suspects that eating just one dumpling is better than consuming\nMANY, MANY Lean Cuisines; therefore, using an unusual kind of circular logic,\nPiMP concludes that the best solution may well be to eat MANY, MANY dumplings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why\ndo some people get all the luck?\n\n\n\nR: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And some\nguys get all the pain.

And when PiMP starts to think this way, PiMP tries to\nremember that for every disastrophe, there must be something equally,\nbalancing-ly wonderful. \n\n\n\nYeah, that works sometimes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Today, my\ncomplaints are:\u00a0 1) I am not drunk;\n2) I am not drunk in Spanish Wells [idyllic Bahamian island]; 3) I am neither\ndrunk in Spanish Wells, nor with the people I find most endearing, amusing,\nfun, capable and awesome.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nR:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please send\nairline tickets c/o TCD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dearest\nComplaint Department\n\n\n\nToday at work i wore a new Asian\ninspired jacket with cranes on it.

Typically\ntheir child is already standing there with them looking like they'd rather be\nwatching Pokemon [yay pokemon!] than hearing the latest school bus gossip, so\nit doesn't appear to be that their child is taking a long time to \"de-bus.\"\nArgh....\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nmight have to annihilate the majority of NH pickup truck owners north of the\nstate Capitol.\u00a0 It's fun to sit\nparked, waiting for the two yin & yang oriented trucks to end their\nconversation about cordwood inventory, who bagged the finer bear or what Bob's\nwife has been up to (except when you're tryna get to work).\u00a0 On the one hand, I can appreciate this\nas charming - that they care enough to stop, inquire & flagrantly disregard\nthe conventions of traffic flow.\u00a0\nOn the other, it is absurdly self-involved!\u00a0 Maybe each of us should invest in one of those\ndashboard-mounted emergency lights. The proper response to obstructive talkers\nmay well be impersonating a police officer.\n\n\n\nR: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PiMP\nrespectfully suggests [censored].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OMGerd...Complaints\u2026\nI have so many, but my son just turned 39, so...I think most complaints of mine\nare outdated. My most basic problem these days is...since he's an adult who\nlives on his own (mostly, a program checks on him 1-2 times a week and gets him\nto Dr visits, etc), he can tell me easily: \"Mom, I don't want to talk\nabout it.\" And there is SO much to talk about. He left better services\nbecause he's fairly high functioning and didn't like being lumped in with\nseriously handicapped individuals (pardon my language...this is the language I\nlearned and have not kept up with whatever the new vernacular is these days). \n\n\n\nWhen young, he had about 20\n'labels'...some of which fit, some of which seriously did not. He spent all of\nhis school years in 'Special Ed'...some of which was abominable and demeaning.\nHe graduated high-school at 21...but was not at all ready to go out into the\nwork-world. Take 'Horticulture' for example; instead of the usual 200 or so\nLatin words a kid had to learn in this class...their idea of fitting the class\nto him was to have him learn just 40 Latin words! Of course, he flunked the\nclass.\n\n\n\nWhile he reads the paper and sports\nmagazines and can talk some about current events that he reads, he has troubles\nwith 'getting things right' (not making mistakes); OCD (big time), smells &\nbodily functions will make him gag & vomit (there goes his job as janitor),\nwanting so much to be liked he'll do things to make another laugh (over and\nover), staying on task (but does well with a supportive buddy who works WITH\nhim), and on and on. He's not worked in several many years (hell, engineers are\nout of work!), and is furious that where he was just forced to move has BEDBUGS\nand COCKROACHES, but changes bed-sheets about 3-4 times a year! [sigh] Oh, and\nhe was loaded up on so many drugs 'to help him' that he resented feeling weird\nall the time and now refuses to take any that might actually help now.\n\n\n\nMY complaint is: HOW can I learn to\ntalk with him in a way where he doesn't feel 'less than'? He clearly needs\nhelp, but hates that he does. Neither of us has the vocabulary...and too many\n'old' words were used in the past. As a kid he had teacher's send him back to\nhis 'special' class with a note: \"I don't have time for him\ntoday\"...a bruised hand print on his butt from a male PE teacher, being\nmade to stand in a corner for soiling his pants or for 'projectile vomiting' on\npurpose (just before the household came down with the flu). \n\n\n\nCrud, I could go on and on. But HOW\nto let him keep what independence he does have and HELP him learn more about\nhis 'disability' (as we've grown up calling it)? Recently he was switched from\nMedicaid to Medicare (I have no reason why), but perhaps that will give him a\ntherapist who will talk to me, too. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\n\n\n\nR: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh dear\nMama, even TCD wishes it could solve this one, and turned to FSM for her\nthoughts:\n\n\n\nI just had to let out a huge breath\nas I had been holding it the whole time I re-read your COMPLAINT.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I often think those\nwords, \u201cless than,\u201d when I think of my son. NOT because he is in any way so,\nbut because he is often erroneously perceived as such. I never want him to hear\nthat in my voice or sense it in my attitude and so I so get what you mean. \n\n\n\nWe had a rough weekend this weekend\nwhere I was trying to explain to him that he is going to have to work so hard\nto live on his own if that\u2019s what he wants and he is still mad at me. I tried\nto explain that everybody has stuff they have to work on \u2013 that his sister has\nto work on being kind, that I have to work on healing myself from hard stuff in\nthe past\u2026\n\n\n\nI talk so much with the few people\nI know who have similar children: the ones who are \u201chigh functioning,\u201d\nacademically gifted, etc. but who struggle daily with social interactions and\ncommon sense stuff like hygiene and transitions and finding things and places\n(some of this sounds familiar for ME, too ;) ). The uneven skill sets that\nsometimes come with disabilities \u2013 great strengths, great challenges \u2013 make\nlife hard in this neurotypical world. We worry, like you, how our beloved\nchildren will make it out there. They are just on that line where they won\u2019t\nnecessarily need daily help or supervision but they will need some. And I think the worst part for most of us is: what\nabout when we are gone? \n\n\n\nI feel sick when I read about the\nstuff that happened to your dear son in school. I wish I could say that sounds\ncompletely out of the question now, but I do feel we parents are still fighting\nfor accommodation and integration in ways that fully respect the needs of our children.\nRight now my son is in a new school that is a much better fit for him, but I\nhave friends whose children are being treated in ways that are quite\ndisturbing. And they are having to fight and fight and fight! \n\n\n\nYou must be tired. I know they are\nand sometimes I am, more than I can say... \n\n\n\nAnd then there are those very basic\nthings too, like low expectations. Research shows that low expectations\ngenerally lead to low learning/achievement. That\u2019s another thing we fight for \u2013\nthat our children be encouraged to reach high: 200 Latin words not 40!!! \n\n\n\nAt the same time, those of us with\nchildren on the spectrum often feel pressure if our children are not \u201csavants\u201d\nin some area \u2013 equally ridiculous!\n\n\n\nI know you love your son above all.\nI know you don\u2019t see him as less-than; I know that for sure. That must come\nthrough in your voice and in your actions. Without the amazing love and support\nyou have shown him where would he be now? (This is true for all children, but\neven more so here!) \n\n\n\nAs a philosophy teacher I often\nfind myself celebrating questions (stuff we have objective/definite answers for\nis called \u201cscience\u201d). I think you are asking the questions that will lead to\nadequate and sometimes even happy answers for you both. Language evolves and I\nthink we do now have more tools in that toolbox. See if you can talk with your\nson about what language feels right for him. Does he have an email address?\nSometimes written is easier to process than spoken.\n\n\n\nIf you DO find any answers, please\nlet us know.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFSM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as\nhard stuff or questions. One of the hardest things for me is when my amazingly\nwonderful unique and mostly HAPPY boy gets so frustrated with his struggles in\ncertain areas, that he feels he should not have been born and states it to me\nlike that. Could kill me right there as you can imagine....\u00a0 Then he calms down, but in those\nmoments -- not easy for both of us!!!!\u00a0\nThat may have been more than you bargained for or not in the direction\nyou had in mind, but telling it like it is.... \n\n\n\nR: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PiMP\u2019s\nicy heart breaks at these words. In fact, this concern was shared by several\nparents in a sentence or two but this really expresses this painful,\ndevastating scenario. So many of our children (and ourselves) are completely\ndaunted by a world that sometimes seems not to understand or include them as\nequals. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children\nare exposed to the knowledge of suicide so young these days. Add to that the\nchallenges and differences some (most) of them face and it\u2019s almost inevitable\nthat in moments of duress that terrible thought might enter their minds.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best parenting advice\nPiMP ever heard was this: \u201cThe odds are with them,\u201d a phrase which sustained\nPiMP through many a high fever or croup and might offer an infinitesimal\nglimmer of hope in those low points.\u00a0\nWe have to use every tool in our arsenals to strengthen those odds, to support\nour loved ones so that they are armed to face those particular challenges with\nwhich they contend. \n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the world at\nlarge.\u00a0 Part of our job as parents\nis to offer a longer-range perspective on that world.\n\n\n\nWhen they feel sad, Full Spectrum\nMama always tells G and Z that things will get better \u2013 as they get older, as\nthe world becomes a more open and all-embracing place.\n\n\n\nPiMP is also a teacher, and\nsometimes PiMP asks PiMP\u2019s students whether things actually are getting\nbetter\u00a0 - more inclusive, less\nbullying-prone --\u00a0 and sometimes, usually, \u00a0people\nsay they are. Here\u2019s hoping that\u2019s true. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I\nam tired of the seeming inability of people to understand that my son\ncommunicates differently. He does not understand nuance. He does not understand\nnon-direct language. Word problems are going to flummox him. If you overreact\nto discussions of body parts two things are going to happen: he will be ashamed\nof his body AND he's going to talk about these things MORE. Negative social\ninteraction is social interaction....That's just a start...\n\n\n\n\n\nR: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What good is this idea that there are traits that\nsome on the spectrum might share such as this one if no one takes them into\naccount in interactions???? Okay, maybe not the FIRST interaction, we all need\nto learn about others, and differences, etc -- but once it has become\nclear??!!!!!!! In the last few weeks alone, PiMP has heard from friends on the\nspectrum and/or with children on the spectrum about family, friends and -\nespecially, sadly - teachers sharing the inability you mention. Step up, people.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nC:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here's\nwhat slays me:\u00a0 the\nwell-intentioned relative, who truly does mean well, but whose remarks just\nsting beyond their imagination. Most recently, my brother told me that my son\ncan't \"blend\" or \"pass for normal,\" so it might be kindest\nnot to keep sending him to the school for normal kids where he struggles to fit\nin.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOuch. Seriously, ouch.\n\n\n\nR:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OUCH!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in another family vein:\n\n\n\nC:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My\nMother does not understand (believe?) that my son has autism. I am not sure why\nthis is, exactly. My son was officially diagnosed when he was 4. His cousin (6\nmos younger) was diagnosed in 1st grade. At which time my Mom tried to explain\nto me what Asperger's was. I said, \"I know. My son has it. I've been\nexplaining that to for 3 yrs.\" Her response, \"Not like this.\"\nWhich is true in the sense that every child is unique and manifests it differently,\nbut she meant it that my son didn't *really* have it or had it to a much lesser\ndegree. *sigh* In the end, it doesn't really matter because we live far away,\nso I let it go...even though I have to remind her like 3 times a year that he\nhas autism. Over a recent trip down to Fl, the cousins spent many hours\ntogether. Safe in an understanding of each other that was simply beautiful.\nTruth be told, my sister-in-law (his Mom) and my sister(his aunt) noticed just\nhaw similar they were to each other..but then my sister (a teacher) and my\nsister-in-law both have a deeper understanding of what's at play.All this is\npreface to the Mom story, my complaint:\n\n\n\nWhen we arrived, I set down the\nrules/limits very clearly to my son and explained what we were doing in\nadvance. This was to lessen his anxiety and to give him parameters to work in.\nAlmost immediately she began with, \"just let him do it. It's alright. He's\nokay\"...etc. Implying I was too strict and overriding my rules. By the 2nd\nday, when he asked me something and I said no, he looked to her to overrule me.\nNot understanding nuance, without always rules...there are no rules... Anyway,\nby the 3rd day, he fully expected her to overrule me anytime I set a rule.\n(This makes complete logical sense btw). She was driving back from my Sister's\nand he kept asking why we were driving the way we were back home. (It was\nadmittedly not a direct route but my Mother has her peculiarities) I told him\nit was okay, but he kept asking because a) he was nervous and worried we were\nlost and b) he expected Grandma to say 'let him be'.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2014", "body": "\n\n\nPardner is a chef and recently texted me during dinner\nservice about a nice family that was at the restaurant. He said he\u2019d been\nobserving them, from his open kitchen, and he thought the teenage son was \u201cvery\nlovable\u201d and \u201cprobably had asperger\u2019s.\u201d He mentioned that the kid had told the\nserver that he wanted to come back and visit the chef after dinner, and was\nhoping that was okay with Chef. Pardner being a cheery and accommodating\nfellow, it certainly was.\n\n\n\nAn hour or so later, Pardner texted me again. This time he\ntold me that the father of the teenager had turned out to be \u201ca jerk.\u201d When he\ncame home (late \u2013 argh), he told me more about what had happened. Apparently,\nthis Dad hadn\u2019t let his son visit with Chef, and had been short with the\nserver. Somehow over the course of the meal, his personality had changed. \n\n\n\nI was really surprised, but I was also sleepy.\n\n\n\nIn the morning, I asked for more detail. It turns out that\nthe server, a well-meaning and sweet person who has some experience with\nchildren, had engaged this family in friendly conversation. When she found out\nthey were not local, she\u2019d asked why they were in the area and they\u2019d said they\nwere looking at schools. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said. \u201cThe ____ School?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ___ School is a school for children with special needs.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d I said, feeling a little sick to my\nstomach for that family.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d retorted Pardner, completely dumbfounded and\nbaffled.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even get it, do you?\u201d I replied, nicely.\n\n\n\nShut the Front Door.\n\n\n\nImagine you are a family. Maybe you have a child who is\n\u201cdifferent\u201d\u2026but you want that child to have every opportunity. So you take them\nout to a fancy restaurant. Part of you, hypothetically, is praying that your\nchild is not disruptive in any way. Another part of you feels that your child\nhas as much right to be in a restaurant as anyone else. Part of you, again,\nhypothetically speaking, celebrates your child EXACTLY AS HE OR SHE IS; another\npart (probably much smaller but still there, okay?) desperately wants your\nchild to fit in, to be accepted, to be able to \u201cpass.\u201d \n\n\n\nSo you are eating your dinner. Maybe it\u2019s been an intense\nday with interviews, maybe with wondering if your child is \u201ctoo different\u201d or\n\u201cless different\u201d than other kids at the potential school. Maybe you just want\nto eat some ding dang dinner in peace. And your chipper, cute, 20-something\nserver just \u2013 out of the blue, basically; trying to be \u201ccompassionate,\u201d or\n\u201cknowledgeable,\u201d or whatever\u00a0 - busts\nout with her \u201cunderstanding\u201d information. \n\n\n\nBecause, obviously, your child needs to go to the \u201cSpecial\u201d\nschool, right???? \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Pardner asked, after I explained this to him\nthrough my tears. I felt so bad for that poor father, and the kid, who\u2019d been\npigeonholed, albeit by someone with nothing but good intentions. \u201cHmm. He\ndidn\u2019t leave a very good tip.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d That was the final proof for me. Even though that\nserver had done her best vis-\u00e0-vis her actual job, and probably deserved the\ngreat tip she usually would\u2019ve gotten, her presumption had not served anybody\nwell.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\nP.S.

To clarify, I have three jobs now. So it\u2019s a privilege to think\nabout this darling blog for even a fraction of a moment. Second, this\nconversation had nothing to do with the blog [until now, anyway] or G\u2019s having\nasperger\u2019s. Did I mention autism during my diarrhea of the mouth**? No. This \u2013\nall this I had been sharing with her about what happened at school, which\nincident was very painful -- was \n\nabout \n\nbeing \n\n12. \n\n\n\nThis was, maybe, partly, also, being a child of a tough\ndivorce. But autism? Not so much. The main crisis-inducer here was, again:\nbeing 12.\u00a0 Luckily, we are good\nenough friends that we were able to clarify our respective perspectives well\nand move on, but it sure got me thinking\u2026\n\n\n\nIs 12 the hardest age? My vote is yes.\u00a0 You are still so young, but bravely\ntrying to be \u201cgrown-up.\u201d You are sullen, self-loathing, monosyllabic; while\nalso still wanting and needing to be taken care of and adored.

Jerk.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s SO moody at 12.\n\n\n\nYour peers are starting to have serious interest in whoever\nthey might be interested in romantically; and, although you might not be quite\nthere yet, you feel it stirring. And it\u2019s confusing.\u00a0\nWatching G sometimes, one can almost see the new feelings and hormones moving inside him,\nmoving him, like the sap running\nin trees this time of year. \n\n\n\nAt 12, most kids won\u2019t admit to still liking to play\u2026and yet\nthey do still\nlike to play, in private or at home with younger siblings. \n\n\n\nSure, maybe for G, he\u2019s a bit developmentally behind his\npeers, but being 12 is something that happens to most people at some point,\nwhether they are 11 or 13 or\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing 12 is, for G, about knowing soon you will have to put\naway your stuffies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 G has a LOT of\nstuffies. His treasured seals [one is a manatee, oops!] are in front.***\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing 12, for G, also\nmeans still being enough of a little one to offer your best stuffies to your\nmom when she is sick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure II \u2013 Healing Stuffies,\nBlanco and Blancli, on Mama\u2019s\u00a0Pillow****\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing both of these is tender, and raw, and HUGE. \n\n\n\nSometimes things in the Full Spectrum household are pretty\nnear idyllic, and sometimes they are decidedly not.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2014", "body": "\n\nParents who have children who were adopted from orphanages\noften have to \u2018teach\u2019 their children to acknowledge pain to themselves and to\nexpress pain to others. Although Z came into our family at only nine months of\nage, she had already learned not to react to her body being hurt, or to express\nhunger or thirst through a baby\u2019s only language (tears).\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, she expressed herself primarily through screaming\nif being put down at any time. Once she found someone to hold her at length, a\nsingle person devoted only to her and her brother (to whom she was immediately\nattached as well), she was not about to be abandoned. This was particularly\nacute during her first weeks with her family, during which not only did she\ndemand to be held at all times but also to be walked around while being held, resulting in SEVERE sleep\ndeprivation for all concerned.\n\n\n\nArriving home, we embarked upon a plan. I had heard that\nchildren whose most basic needs for comfort have not been met may present a\nrange of developmental and emotional challenges and I had bright ideas to \u201cfix\u201d\nsome of these potential issues. Reacting to pain came first: a strategy of\nexaggerated response to any possible injury quickly taught Z that if something\nhappened to her that potentially did not feel good, and there was someone\nnearby to help, she could get a response to her feelings and be the beneficiary of comfort measures, such as an ice pack or\nthe proverbial band-aid.\n\n\n\nTo this day, though, Z doesn\u2019t even blink an eye at pain\nwhen she thinks no one is looking! I have watched from the kitchen window as\nshe has fallen \u2013 hard, or been accidently but vigorously wacked with something\nfrom afar by her clueless brother. She never makes a sound\u2026or even a face. I wonder: did she somehow never\ndevelop some important aspect of the neurology to feel pain because of those\nearly months of neglect? Is she just brave as heck? Does she feel the pain, but\nless? \n\n\n\nG and I, being highly sensitive personages, have to work\nreally hard not to scream when we, like, step on a stray drop of water (no -\nreally), so this is definitely a germane question in the Full Spectrum family.\n\n\n\nWhereas a casual hidden observer could probably catch G or I\nwrithing privately in agony several times a day, I\u2019d wager that observer would\nnever see the same in Z. Z has learned that public expression of discomfort\nleads to results, but when there is nothing to \u201cgain\u201d by reacting, she seems to\nhave decided not to waste her energy. \n\n\n\nSimilarly, she doesn\u2019t seem to notice hunger or thirst\nunless in the environs of potential indulgers, in which case she will avail\nherself of various and sundry treats. G and I, within an hour or two of not\neating, invariably find ourselves starving, even trembling, with hunger. Much\nlonger and we become vague, lightheaded, nauseous. I happen to be hypoglycemic,\nand G may be too; perhaps equally significant is the fact that we both had our\nneeds met as infants. Our physiology (sensitive) and our early environments\n(sensitive to our needs) matched.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nZ, in contrast, seems to be able to function indefinitely\nwithout eating, unless food is offered to her. That is, her energy stays high,\nher focus sharp, her spirits strong -- whether she eats regularly or\nnot\u2026[Obviously, I haven\u2019t performed experiments on her, I am going on seven+\nyears of observation.] It\u2019s hard to imagine she could be experiencing hunger in\nthe profound and extreme way that G and I do and still function so well, but,\nas must be asked vis-\u00e0-vis her pain, doesn\u2019t she feel some hunger? She knows her situation now is one in which her needs\ncan be met, and yet she still self-limits on those needs\u2026unless \u2013 and this is a\nreal possibility -- her physiology just really is that different. \n\n\n\nThat her response varies so widely according to context\npotentially indicates a reduced sensitivity to her own body\u2019s cues and/or a self-imposed\n(conscious or un-) denial of self-nurturing and/or a really advanced mastery of\nsocial capital. Would Z be more sensitive overall, and therefore more\nvulnerable, had she been nurtured differently in her first months?\n\n\n\nPeople sometimes ask me to blurb their books or products or\nblogs on this blog and I recently agreed to read a novel about reactive\nattachment disorder (RAD) by a reader named Michelle Weidenbenner. Her book is\ncalled Scattered Links (http://www.amazon.com/Scattered-Links-Michelle-Weidenbenner-ebook/dp/B00HP3X6R4)\nand it is about a Russian orphan\u2019s journey. I haven\u2019t finished it (and it seems\nto have some Christian undertones, which may be a plus or a minus or neutral\nfor different readers), so I haven\u2019t yet got a blurb. I was struck powerfully,\nthough, by this sentence from the preface, which is written in the orphan\u2019s\nvoice: \n\n\n\n\u201cWe never learn how to ask for what we need because when we\ndo, no one listens.\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019d never connected Z\u2019s inability to acknowledge pain or\nhunger with her inability to ask for what she needs or wants. Z\u2019s refusal to\nask for things comes across as regal, but it\u2019s at base a survival strategy, a sad\nconcession to a disappointing start. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe other day we saw a \u201cWild Women Don\u2019t Get the Blues\u201d\nbumper sticker and Z asked what it meant. I explained that women have often\nbeen taught to do as they are told and that doing so, just for the sake of\nobedience, makes women unhappy. Women should follow their own dreams and\nbeliefs, I told her, and then they won\u2019t get \u201cthe blues.\u201d But sometimes the\nother people who make the rules -- and the other people who follow the rules -- don\u2019t like when you\nmake your own rules, and they might call you \u201cwild\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201ccrazy,\u201d\neven. And that\u2019s okay, because you will be happier -- and stronger -- for\nfollowing your own heart.\n\n\n\nOf course, she\u2019s still too young to make up her own rules.\nAnd I assured her I still get to boss her around for a Long Time. But I want\nher to know, and I will continue to say to her:\u00a0\nif something (or someone!) hurts you, or if you are hungry for\nsomething, speak up, my daughter!!!! How we feel \u2013 in our hearts, our bellies,\nour bodies, our beliefs \u2013 matters. YOU\nMATTER.\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s eat!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/03/pain-squared.html", "title": "\nPAIN \u2013 SQUARED\n"},

This post, about a\nfamily who seemed to have been inadvertently \u201couted\u201d as having an autistic\nmember, really resonated with\u00a0 people and\nparents with a variety of personal and family differences as a common aspect of\nour lived experience. What had actually happened emerged as slightly but\nsignificantly different from what I had reported. The server in question, who\nhappens to read this here blog (? I feel honored!), had mentioned to Pardner\nthat \u2013 actually! \u2013 \n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Dad of the family had been distant, detached\nand fidgeting with his iPhone most of dinner (therefore he was not suddenly\nalienated in some way by feeling labeled), and \n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe family had itself volunteered the name of\nthe school the son was visiting (and therefore the server had not presumed).\n\n\n\nI was chagrined. I spoke about it with a few people, all of\nwhom said stuff like, \u201cOh, the story\u2019s so true that the facts are almost\nirrelevant,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s all relative, anyway.\u201d I (lovingly) disagreed. While it\nis true that families and individuals with differences can potentially have\nrelatively more challenging interactions than \u201cnormal\u201d people, and that this\nmay well have been a painful experience for said family for whatever reason,\nwhat really happened really does matter. I take it as my responsibility to make\nthat very clear, in this scenario and beyond.\n\n\n\nInformation is always partial. As writers, we know this fact\nfull well. Some non-fiction writers even embrace it in pursuit of polemical\npoints. This partiality of knowledge holds for all writing, including that which is considered \u201cobjective.\u201d At the\nsame time, I do believe in Truth. There can be unknown or temporarily-disputed\nfacts, and different perspectives on the same truth, but I am not, never have\nbeen, never will be a relativist. I am always happy to clarify, or to add other\nperspectives, whether or not they are in tune with my own, so long as they add\nto the truth and honesty of a piece. In short, I, along with most writers I\nrespect, aim our endeavors toward truth, at some times getting closer than\nothers\u2026\n\n\n\nIn this case, the parties concerned were totally bighearted\nabout my getting it not-quite-right: I believe the server\u2019s actual words were,\n\u201cOh, I get it! I just don\u2019t want you and [Full Spectrum Mama] to think I am an\ninsensitive bimbo.\u201d Heck to the no.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, because I know it\u2019s just what everybody was waiting for,\nI have developed a model for writing creative non-fiction that suits my goals\nfor integrity and transparency:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure I \u2013 Venn Diagram of Ideal Non-Fiction Writing\nComposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Spectrum Mama is an Anonymous blog, with the vast\nmajority of readers reading from afar.

{"date": "Monday, April 14, 2014", "body": "\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following this blog at ALL, you know that Z\nis a superhero-genius, with a conservatively-estimated IQ of 923. All parents\nare soooo objective, but most especially parents of children who were adopted,\nbecause that latter event basically frees us up to brag in an unfettered way by virtue of not sharing genetics. Naturally, Z being the next Curie/Vos Savant/Sandberg,\nI was expecting a pre-tty fabulous report card this spring.\n\n\n\nAlas.\n\n\n\nShe received threes, meaning \u201cMeets grade level\nexpectations,\u201d across the board. Several pages of threes. Out of\u00a0 **50** possible grades, only three were not threes! She got a two, or\n\u201cmaking progress toward meeting grade level expectations,\u201d in the area of\n\u201cdemonstrates self control.\u201d The ONLY fours she received were both on reading\nspeed, during timed tests. \n\n\n\nZ\u2019s teacher is one of the best in the state, so I knew\nthese grades were more related to Z than a failing on her teacher\u2019s part.\nStill, I hoped her teacher could help with ideas about improving both her work\nand her grades. \n\n\n\nDuring our parent-teacher conference, Z\u2019s very kind, very\nexperienced, very gifted teacher admitted she\u2019s not at all sure how to get her\nto do better. She told me that Z finishes everything ahead of all the other\nstudents. Then, rather than polishing her work or doing a little extra, she\nsocializes, which, depending on who is next to her, can often be a problem for\nthat neighboring student. She has been offered the opportunity to work on an\noptional special project of her own, like other gifted students in her class \u2013\nsomething for which her teacher gives up her own limited free time -- \u00a0but has opted not to do so. Rather than\nfocusing on learning, Z\u2019s focus is often on \u201cside conversations.\u201d Because she\nis quick, she manages to \u201cmeet grade level expectations\u201d \u2013 but only in a\nperfunctory fashion. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing with her homework. She has reading\nhomework every day for twenty minutes? She reads for twenty minutes. She is\nasked to write a sentence using a vocabulary word? She writes the shortest\nsentence possible. Not working hard feels so alien to me, the quintessential\nOVER-tryer, despite having been schooled on this subject by many brilliant\nfriends who were underachievers in school\u2026Something about \u201cIf everything is\neasy for you, why ever make an effort\u201d??\n\n\n\nThere is also the possibility that I am/we are putting too\nmuch pressure on her, that we are having overly high expectations. Perhaps\nshe\u2019s not quite as exceptionally smart as I have always thought. Her teacher\nand I were obviously on the same page in feeling that Z is not even close to\nliving up to her academic potential, but maybe we were basing our assessment of\nZ\u2019s potential academic intelligence on her apparently immense emotional\nintelligence. Or maybe her approach to schoolwork is a survival thing, sort of a \u201cdo what\nyou need to do to get by\u201d scenario? Nonetheless, it\u2019s evident that Z needs to\nup her game a bit; and that we adults need to somehow inculcate an attitude of\npleasurable effort to replace the getting-away-with-the-minimum stance she\u2019s\nexhibited thus far. \n\n\n\nThe parent-teacher conference was a few weeks ago. The other\nday, Z and I had mama-daughter time while G was in drama club and as we walked\nI lectured her extensively (yes! I am fun!) on doing her best, taking\ninitiative, etc. After talking at her for some time, I realized what I was\ndoing and asked her why she is only doing the minimum. She finally confessed\nshe \u201cjust want[s] to get it finished!\u201d She is proud to finish before the others\nin her class, and simply not will to do more, unless it is clearly required. \n\n\n\nI asked her if she thinks she\u2019s as smart as other kids in\nher class, and she said \u201csmarter.\u201d I explained to her that the kids who are really smart are the ones who are\nlearning as much as they possibly can, adding that you can be the\nsmartest person on the planet but if you don\u2019t work hard no one will ever know\n\u2013 and you\u2019ll accomplish little. \n\n\n\nI turned at this point to a beloved longtime educator\nfriend, who also happens to be the Dad of many sons, to see if he had any suggestions.\nHe offered the idea of giving Z extra projects. In his family, African history\nwas the subject of choice. I decided to have Z study Chinese history. I had her\nget all her Chinese history and culture books together. I asked her to begin\nreading a chapter of the top book in the pile that afternoon. Afterwards, she\nwould be expected to write a report.\n\n\n\nI was doing the dishes -- with dinner on the stove \u2013 when, a\nfew minutes later, she called out: \u201cHey, Mom\u2026does this count as doing my\nreading homework?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d Scrub, scrub scrub...wait a minute!\u00a0\u201c\u2026NO!!!! Come\non, [Z], that\u2019s my WHOLE POINT!\u201d\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t\nhave enough brain-space for this malarkey. Available doing-dishes brain-space\nis utilized pondering the truly important things, such as: do we actually have more nose\nhair as we get older? If so, is that why boogers seem to hang down in there\nmore? And if both of these are true, is that FAIR? (My vote? No.)\n\n\n\nBut\nback to the matter at hand: after this interaction I logically must conclude\nthat Z is a genius after all.\n\n\n\nNext:\nCONFERENCE II: FOURS AND TWOS\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull\nSpectrum Mama\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/04/conference-i-threes.html", "title": "\nCONFERENCE I: THREES\n"},

Students, families\nand educators who experience learning differences such as dyslexia, dysgraphia,\nexecutive function challenges and/or ADHD/ADD will see themselves reflected in\nthis documentary in a really beautiful way.

The really wonderful thing about Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's approach is his clear recognition that ALL people have inherent value, as well as the capacity to dream\u00a0and to realize those dreams. While we do need to meet people where they are, there is much to be said for not imposing a priori limits on what people may achieve for ANY reason.\n\n\n\nPeople\nwith disabilities are so often \"tolerated,\" so often expected to have\nsmaller dreams. The Secretary-General explicitly calls the United Nations (and\nthe world in general) to task for just such attitudes and dares to demand more\nfor people with autism (and, by implication, all people with differences from\nthe \"norm\"). In his vision, \u201ceconomic constraints\u201d do not trump\nempowerment \u2013 and different abilities do not preclude fulfilling education and\ngainful employment. Comprehensive inclusion and acceptance are his mighty\nwatchwords.\n\n\n\n\n\nI see\nneurodiversity as one of the big civil rights issues of the new millennium.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2014", "body": "\n\nWhereas Z\u2019s report card consisted almost entirely of threes\n(\u201cmeets grade level expectations\u201d), G\u2019s report card was pretty evenly split\nbetween twos (\u201cmaking progress toward meeting grade level expectations\u201d) and\nfours (\u201cexceeds grade level expectations\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways with the Full Spectrum,\neh?\n\n\n\nBut this was a familiar report card: G is excelling in\ncertain areas, and struggling in others.\u00a0\nAlthough my report cards tended more toward fours because of my\nstrengths in executive function, I knew G was doing his best and I celebrated\nthe quantified results of that effort.\n\n\n\nG\u2019s conference wasn\u2019t spent talking about ways to get him to\nwork harder. His teacher and I both know he is working his fanny off. Even for\nthose twos, he is working. His conference was spent on other concerns.\nConferring about how he\u2019s mostly with adults on the playground \u2013 and how he\nsays, \u201cThank you for hanging out with me\u201d to them. How he sits with his\nteachers on the bus \u2013 and thanks them for letting him sit next to them. How, during\nwinter sports, he, again, stayed back with the grownups and told them, always,\n\u201cThank you for playing with me.\u201d [I\u2019m thinking, please, no, I DO NOT WANT TO\nHEAR THIS YOU ARE KILLING ME! I thought he was playing with other kids! He said\nhe was!] \u00a0That combination of\npathetic and clueless and kind and grateful and well-mannered is also very\nfamiliar.\u2026. \n\n\n\nWhat do you say to your child about this sort of news? \u201cG,\nyou need to be less thankful and also not go near adults?\u201d Clearly, he\u2019s making\nthese choices for reasons that make sense to him. For one thing, according to\nhis teacher the preteen girl posse he\u2019d been rolling with since the start of\nschool was still somewhat friendly and protective, but now they were more teens\nthan pre- -- with the attendant changes and concerns that come with that shift.\nFor another thing: sixth grade/sixth graders. Blech \u2013 who can understand\nit/them?\n\n\n\nThen his teacher explained how he has a hard time working\nwith groups: first, he gets very upset if people don\u2019t do exactly what they are\nassigned to do in the group or what they say they are going to do; second,\nothers try to do his work for him to \u201chelp\u201d him because of his slow processing,\nwhich is insulting. Group work is big these days \u2013 so it\u2019s a big issue for kids\nfor whom it\u2019s not a natural fit.\n\n\n\nFeeling a wave of despair at this point, I wondered if this was\nall just too much for G, and if he would be better off in a different setting,\nperhaps a specialized classroom. His teacher replied \u2013 quite vehemently \u2013 that he\nwould not. She admitted that he does struggle in the mainstream classroom\nsetting, but that she is certain that it\u2019s the best environment for him, just\nas I have always believed. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a child in G\u2019s class who is more obviously\n\u201cautistic\u201d than G. This child receives a lot of attention and is doted on by\nmany of the girls in the class. I\u2019ve already had to explain to G that the\nreason all the girls \u201clike\u201d this other boy is because they want to help him and\ntake care of him. I asked him if he wants people to \u201cfeel sorry for him\u201d in\nthat way and he replied with a very strong \u201cNo!\u201d In his teacher\u2019s words, G \u201cis\nnot quite different enough to be a mascot and don\u2019t want him to be!\u201d Yet he\u2019s\nstill \u201cdifferent\u201d in ways that set him apart, for example: \u201cHe still hugs me \u2013\nsixth graders do NOT hug teachers!\u201d Well, his teacher is pretty durn wonderful\u2026\n\n\n\nAgain, what does one say in this situation, as a parent? \u201cNo\nhugging!\u201d???? \n\n\n\nG is trying to\nintegrate sixth grade social rules\u2026at his own pace! For one thing, as I mentioned\nat the end of the conference, he studiously and elaborately avoids me at All\nSchool Sings. Except \u2013 one time, when we were singing \u201cYou are my Sunshine,\u201d he\nlooked over at me (because he knows he is my sunshine) and I was **sobbing**\nand that was the end of even looking at Mom during such events. \u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd rightly so! I am so embarrassing. No, I am.

I sobbed through the whole movie. \u00a0I am NOT the\none who needs to watch these movies that show how awful bullying can be and\nmake points about why we should not bully. I\u2019ve always been in the get-bullied\ncategory, along with G. (Also, it was like me watching Forks Over Knives \u00a0or Glass Walls. That is, I am already vegetarian, and it HURTS to watch this stuff!) \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBully should be\nrequired watching, though, for all students and all parents just\nin case. And all schools. All people, okay? If you are around children\nand/or teens in any capacity, and have the possible capacity to influence them\nin such a way as to potentially prevent bullying or protect someone from\nbullying\u2026PLEASE DO. You could be saving a psyche or a soul\u2026or a LIFE.\n\n\n\nIn honor of this sentiment, I have decided to publish a post\nI wrote long ago but never published. This situation \u2013 which occurred four\nyears ago - was so tender to me that I long worried that I might have risked\nwriting with bias, or out of anger. Enough distance and space have passed to\nfeel comfortable in what I say, and to know that the post is as objective as it\never will be (bearing in mind that I believe strongly in truth and integrity,\nbut also know that there are always a range of perspectives!). \n\n\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nON BULLYING, or, YAY, PARENT A! \n\n\n\nThis is the story of one of the worst things that ever\nhappened in our household. \n\n\n\nOne time, when I went to pick G up after school, two older\ngirls were teasing him. I saw them from afar, heard singsong voices. G ran to\nme crying and said they were \u201cbullying\u201d him.\n\n\n\nI approached Parent A. She had a talk with her daughter and\nher daughter apologized and in fact became\na friend to G. \n\n\n\nParent A knew that\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nkids sometimes act thoughtlessly cruel and that \n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthey should be called out on it, sensitively of\ncourse, but firmly, and that \n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nmost kids will grow and do better, if given the opportunity to do so. \n\n\n\nI approached Parent B, the father of the other child. He\nagreed to speak with his daughter.\n\n\n\nHowever, when he did so, his daughter completely denied any\nteasing or bullying. Parent B then called me, and insisted that his daughter\nhad not teased my son, despite my having witnessed it, despite the other girl\nadmitting to it, despite my son\u2019s words and tears\u2026\n\n\n\nI knew Parent B\u2019s daughter sometimes had problems with\nlying, and my son had told me she was teasing him on several previous occasions\n(just not through tears \u2013 he had been able to \u201chandle it\u201d the other times). I\nknew that accepting our children\u2019s lies and not giving them consequences for\nmisbehavior cannot be a good thing. But what was I going to say to someone so\ndetermined to believe their child that they would ignore the observations of three other people? \n\n\n\nSo I let it go. \n\n\n\nReally, what is there to say in such a situation?\n\n\n\nA few days later, Parent B approached me in the parking lot\nof our children\u2019s school. I had both kids with me. G ran into the car as, to my\nsurprise, this man began to yell at me and get in my face. Gutsy, tiny Z stood\nher ground, holding my hand in her little one. \n\n\n\nHe began by berating me for what I was wearing: \u201cLook at\nyou!\u201d he sneered. I looked at myself. Yes, I was wearing a sundress. I am\nsometimes \u201cguilty\u201d of an Aspergian disregard for propriety and convention in\nattire and other areas but: sundress. He proceeded to yell at me for what felt\nlike a million years, with choice bits such as, \u201c\"You have a problem and I\nam going to make sure you know it and pay for it\" and \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get\nwhat you deserve!\u201d and \u201cYou know why this is all your fault! You know why you\nfeel guilty! You know you have a guilty conscience!\" and so on\u2026\n\n\n\nHave I mentioned I was completely blindsided? \n\n\n\nI am not at all good at responding to aggression for many,\nmany reasons, some neurological, some psychological\u2026When overwhelmed by\nemotions and/or sensory input, my processing speed drops to ZERO. I am -- quite\nliterally -- unable to feel and think at the same time, never mind talk. The\nonly coherent things I was able to utter, each more than once, were: \u201cPlease\nstop yelling at me in front of my children,\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cPlease step back!\u201d [he was all up in my grill, sort of under my grill,\nactually, as he was shorter than me], and \u2013 the only even slightly offensive\nthing, but in itself kind of a 1950s B-movie sort of utterance -- \u201cYou have a\nlot of nerve!\u201d \n\n\n\nPlus, I wasn\u2019t able to defend myself because I wasn\u2019t even sure what he was talking about: What\ndid I deserve \u2013 and why? Why on earth\nwas I \u201cguilty\u201d \u2013 and how did this rather random fellow know all about it when I\ndid not?\n\n\n\nAlso: why the rage????\nClearly, he was trying to \u201cdefend his child\u201d \u2013 but from what, exactly? From the\nconsequences of her actions? And what\nabout her actions? Considering that he never once mentioned his daughter during\nthe entire tirade, something else was going on there! \n\n\n\nI was so confused. \n\n\n\nThen he went on to my parenting: \u201cEverybody knows there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with [G] and you\u2019ve done NOTHING about it!\u201d \n\n\n\nAfter some more choice invective, he concluded with, \u201cYou\nobviously don\u2019t care about your kids at all!\u201d\n\n\n\nAt that moment, I was able to say my first logical sentence\nof that awful \u201cconversation\u201d (As if somehow I had to justify myself to this\nlunatic!):\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you talking about?\n[Okay, that was not the good part.] My life revolves around my kids!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYour life,\u201d he sneered triumphantly, \u201crevolves around\nfinding more boyfriends!\u201d\n\n\n\nI walked away, dazed and silent, hand in hand with my baby\ngirl. \n\n\n\nLovely, lovely eidetic memory: every foul sentence Parent B\nhad spewed was seared in my mind for all eternity. \n\n\n\nMy baby girl hugged me, hard, when we got in the car and\nsaid, \u201cI am sorry that bad man was yelling at you, Mama,\u201d and I \u2013 usually\ntotally against making our children take care of us \u2013 drank in that hug and\nthose words like the nectar and comfort they were. I had just been literally\nattacked in the parking lot of my son\u2019s darling, cozy elementary school, a\nplace that had felt as safe and sacred to me as a place could feel.\n\n\n\nLater, I took further comfort in knowing that I have spent\nevery possible bit of energy since G\u2019s birth trying to do right by my children.\nI took comfort in knowing that autism is a neurological situation, not a\npsychological one \u201ccaused\u201d by \u201crefrigerator mothers\u201d or some other nonsense. \n\n\n\nI took comfort in my KNOWLEDGE that there is NOTHING \u201cWRONG\u201d\nwith my son! I can\u2019t say it didn\u2019t hurt \u2013 hugely \u2013 to know that \u201ceveryone\u201d\n\u201cknew\u201d there was \u201csomething wrong with\u201d him. I didn\u2019t give a rip whether people\nthought I\u2019d neglected to do something about \u201cit,\u201d but such gross misperceptions\nof a wonderful, kind, loving boy broke my heart. And as much as I knew Parent B was\nexaggerating, I, sadly, never felt at ease in that town again. \n\n\n\nI took comfort in my peaceful and (mostly) happy and healthy\nfamily (remember: peaceful, healthy and [mostly] happy, not perfect!)\n\n\n\nBoth fathers in the children\u2019s lives -- my ex-husband and my\nnow-husband, the gentle and even-tempered Pardner -- wanted me to press\ncharges. (And you know when my ex is mad at someone on my behalf it musta been bad.) \n\n\n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to \u201ccause\u201d more problems\u2026\n\n\n\nAfter a few days of processing, after I finally stopped\nshaking, I was able to have some thoughts: OH! So that\u2019s what this is about?\nLet me get this straight: the reason G has autism is I am someone who, after I\ngot divorced, dated someone and, upon occasion, wore a sundress? \n\n\n\nOr: if only I had \u201cdone something\u201d about G, Parent B\u2019s\ndaughter would not have found it necessary to bully him?\n\n\n\nOr: is it that the reason she bullied my son was because *I*\ndeserved it? And I know why, right? \n\n\n\nAlso: I guess G was not \u201ccredible\u201d because there was\n\u201csomething wrong with\u201d him??? \n\n\n\nBy the same token, I suppose my word, too was worthless!\nEverybody knows lying goes hand in hand with being a liberated female, not to\nmention a gay divorc\u00e9e. You see, there\u2019d apparently been some conjecture around\ntown \u2013 spurred by a neighbor/\u201dfriend\u201d -- that different cars had been seen at\nmy house on different nights\u2026Guess what, gossips, my future husband had several\nold cars when we were first dating. Oh, and I have friends. \n\n\n\n***NB! I reserve the right to date whomever I please! As\nmany at a time as I so choose! Additionally, unlike the aforementioned gossips\nand believers thereof, I reserve the right to reserve judgment about people to\nwhat I\u2019ve directly experienced and know to be true.***\n\n\n\nCall me literal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yes, I was shaken. It was a wretched experience. Even now, I find myself shaking FOUR YEARS\nLATER as I think about these events.\n\n\n\nIn time, I came to realize that Parent B had an extra-large\nhelping of what some of my friends and I refer to as \u201ciss-yews.\u201d He\u2019d\nessentially been taking out his own insecurities and anger (said \u201ciss-yews\u201d) on\nan easy and vulnerable target: a single woman with a non-typical child.\n\n\n\nNice going, Sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe take-away: I\nnow bear in mind lessons learned around:\n\n\n\n\nBullies: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 >> They exist.

I want to have\nthem know and remember each other\u2019s faces so that when middle school starts\nthey will have friendly faces in the halls and classrooms. (Also\u2026I hope G and I\nwill be able to\u00a0recognize those\nfriendly parents\u2019 and kids\u2019 faces!)\n\n\n\nI both got this idea and started my search at the\nMiddle School Orientation for parents with children in the \u201cSpecial Education\u201d\nprogram* (more on this, soon). Every single one of the parents there had\ndirect, specific and personal concerns about their child getting bullied (among\nother things). \n\n\n\nThe woman to my right was crying as she spoke\nabout her daughter being bullied \u201cbecause she\u2019s just\u2026\u2019off.\u2019\u201d Her fear about middle\nschool was both reasonable and powerful. As she spoke, it occurred to me that\nmy G could be a \u201cfriendly face\u201d for her daughter \u2013 a peer who would never think\nshe was \u201coff\u201d \u00a0-- and who wouldn\u2019t care\nif she was, anyway! So I slipped her our digits with a little note to this effect.\n\n\n\n\nI turned to look at another woman a few (empty)\nrows behind us, who\u2019d been talking about her son\u2019s difficulties in tying his\nshoes, how anxious and unhappy he will feel about this if other kids are\njudging him (and we\u2019d almost all been nodding), thinking to give her our number\ntoo and her face was just \u2013 STRICKEN. She looked terrified and devastated and\ndevoid of hope. Almost blank. I \u2013 with my sloooow thought process \u2013 processed\nthat and then vowed to reach out to her as soon as we stood up. But she rushed\nout. \n\n\n\nI am still thinking about \u201cthe lady who left,\u201d\nbecause I feel like we need each other, and our kids need each other more\u2026If I\nsee her again \u2013 and recognize her, please\n\u2013 I will be quicker. \n\n\n\nI will have neither dignity nor restraint when\nit comes to this mission. Nor will team members be limited to incoming 7th graders! Even online and long-distance friendships can be part\nof this new, classy, influential team, TEAM FRIENDLY FACE. \n\n\n\nSo, hey! Lady! And anybody else who might\nparticipate! If you are reading this, email me, okay? At the very least, take a\nmoment to consider joining this team \u2013 or forming your own -- in whatever way\nfeels right for you and yours.

A TEAM-worthy post, courtesy of an\nhonorary TEAM member: http://seriouslynotboring.com/2014/04/10/a-smile-instead-of-judgement/\n\n\n\n\n\n* I wrote to the middle school special\neducation people at the meeting:\n\nDear\nall,\n\nI hope this finds you\nwell. Thank you for last Tuesday's meeting.\n\nI was wondering if\nthere is any way to reach out to other parents, families and kids in this\ngroup. I think it could be enormously helpful to some of these kids to have as\nmany friendly faces as possible in the halls and classrooms as they transition\nto middle school. I would be more than happy to be in charge of trying to make\nsomething happen, and to pay for materials (mailings?), host any event, etc.\nBut I know because of privacy laws you cannot divulge any information to me.\nPerhaps I could write an email that you could then send to the other parents?

Read on to find out where you and yours might fit -- or have a fit -- in our corner of the Sensory Spectrum.\n\n\n\nFor some of the Full Spectrums, Sensory\nProcessing Differences mean that sometimes we simply cannot process the whole\npackage of sensory input in a given context -- or that we process it very, very\nslowly --\u00a0 because one element is (or a\nfew other elements are) overwhelming. In other words, the processing\n(registering, digesting, understanding) of one impression among a multitude \u2013\nwhether visual, auditory, aural, proprioceptive\u2026 -- utilizes all the energy we\nhave available for that function in a given moment.\n\n\n\nSensory Processing Differences sometimes force\nor inspire us to get totally lost in the experience of what we are sensing. In\nsome instances this can be to the detriment of \u201csuccessful\u201d interactions with\nthe \u201cnormal\u201d world; in some instances (sometimes the very same instances), this\ncan result in extraordinary creativity and emotional bliss. \n\n\n\nWith Sensory Processing Differences, when we do\n(or taste or smell or see or feel\u2026) certain things (or do/taste/smell/see/feel\u2026too\nmuch of even non-triggering things) we get anxious, irritable, dazed, even sick\n(helloooo, migraines) because our neurology cannot prioritize or cope with sensory\ninput in such a way that it is manageable. Further, we may not even NOTICE that\nwe are anxious, irritable, dazed, sick\u2026because we are processing something\nelse.\n\n\n\nProcessing one or a few aspects of our sensory\nenvironment -- say, the presence of people, or people plus sounds\n\u2013 can preclude effective simultaneous processing of most other aspects, such\nas:\n\nwhat\nwe are thinking or feeling,\n\nwhat\nwe are learning,\n\nwhat\nwe see, \n\nwhat\nwe smell, \n\nwhere\nour bodies are in space (proprioception, vestibular function),\n\nwhat\nthose people are saying or expressing in social cues\u2026\n\n\n\nLater, we can sometimes put it together, in a\nsort of delayed processing process, if you will.

This means, among\nother things, that they manage and process the sensory experiences of daily\nlife with ease and aplomb \u2013 thoughtlessly, effortlessly... (It might be worth\nnoting that all parties mentioned herein with Sensory Processing Differences\n(G, myself, Full Spectrum Grandmother) are biologically-related \u2013 and all those\nwithout SPDs are not.)\n\n\n\nI once literally shocked Pardner by mentioning\n\u2013 casually, because to me this was obvious\n\u00a0\u2013 that sometimes in the night when I\nwake up I cannot go back to sleep because of the whistling sound my nose makes\nwhen slightly stuffed up. Rationally, I know it\u2019s just a small noise that is\ncoming from my breathing and that I should ignore it, but \u2013 trust me on this- I\ncannot, even as I know full well I am losing precious, precious sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013 Whistle Nose\n\n\n\n\u201cWhistle Nose\u201d was the name we\u2019d made up long\nago for this phenomenon\u2026a phenomenon which apparently had profoundly divergent\nmeanings on the Sensory Processing Spectrum embodied between us. We were both\ntotally surprised to discover after all these years that we\u2019d each had very\ndifferent feelings about Whistle Nose!\n\n\n\nTo Pardner, someone with \u201cnormal\u201d sensory\ncapabilities, Whistle Nose was simply something funny that happens sometimes.\nFor me? Sure, there was potentially a somewhat humorous aspect to it, at least\nduring designated waking hours. But, mostly, to this Highly Sensitive Person,\nWhistle Nose is a mild but pernicious form of torture that can actually adversely affect\nmy quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nSCHOOL\n\nWhere can I even begin with School? Even at its\nmost pared down, there is just way, way too much going on in the classroom for\nmy son G\u2019s learning/academic brain to function anywhere close to optimally. How\nthis manifests is in increased dysgraphia (writing issues, simplistically\nspeaking) and dyspraxia (coordination challenges, ditto), decreased\norganization and intellectual progress, and highly awkward social interactions\non his end. \n\n\n\nGetting the \u201cright\u201d things to be background so\nthat the important thing(s) can be in the foreground for healthy, efficient\nprocessing is a complicated and ongoing endeavor.\n\n\n\nHis Team and I have long agreed that the\nbenefits of being in the classroom outweigh the negatives (another post\u2026), but\nit bears inclusion in this post\nbecause pretty much anyone with SPD is going to find any institutional setting\n\u2013 such as a store, or an office, not to mention school \u2013 challenging. Knowing\nthis, we can at least investigate ways to improve and/or modify such common yet\nimpactful situations. \n\n\n\n\n\nSMALL WINDOW OF COMFORT\n\nFull Spectrum Grandmother uses this phrase to\ndescribe herself, and it resonates for G and me as well. Before we learned\nabout SPDs it was a helpful, slightly jokey way to convey to others that she \u2013\nlike certain other Full Spectrums \u2013 is intensely affected by her environment.\nOne area of sensitivity has always been temperature, and Full Spectrum\nGrandmother has been known to alternate air conditioning with extra socks and\nsweaters in her ongoing attempt to find her \u201cjust right\u201d temperature. Just last\nweekend, she told me she was having a challenging time figuring out where to\nstand in the back yard:\u00a0 \u201cIn the sun,\nit\u2019s too hot; in the shade-too cold!\u201d \n\n\n\nWe get it. We are the ones trying to get comfortable\nover here while you move back and forth in the grass, Full Spectrum\nGrandmother. Really, for many of we Full Spectrums, any number of sensory\nimpressions can preoccupy, consume, even injure, us. (See: G with visuals and\nauditory; Mama with, oh, just about anything, but especially light and\nartificial scents\u2026)\n\n\n\nTextures and tightness are another Window of\nComfort concern for Full Spectrum Grandmother. Things that are too tight can\nmake it hard to focus; things that are too loose can be dysregulating as well.\nRough textures can, in effect, abrade the brain; soft can feel disconcertingly\n\u2013 and distractingly -\u00a0 slimy\u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure II \u2013 Small Window of Comfort Spectrum \n\n\n\nTrivial? Maybe to someone whose brain doesn\u2019t\nred-alert things like temperature, texture and fit so that they occupy the\nneural vanguard of one\u2019s existence to the exclusion of much else! \n\n\n\n\n\nALEXITHYMIA\n\nIn our particular\nAutism Spectrum chunk live two people with extremely advanced verbal skills and\nthe verbal processing ability of two hunks of cheese. Alexithymia is defined as\ndifficulties in perceiving, defining and expressing emotions; and although we\nmay not exactly fit some of the clinical definition (impaired creativity? Au contraire.),\nit\u2019s in many ways a good name for what we experience. \n\n\n\nWhoohoo! There is a word for this! \n\n\n\nFor some, alexithymia\nis permanent; for us, it is mostly situational and sometimes temporary \u2013 but\nalways a challenge. For example, both G and I are extremely sensitive and are\nprone to having a feeling. When we get that feeling maybe we will be shaking or\ncrying or angry \u2013 but we cannot explain what the feeling is and/or why we are\nhaving it at that moment. One very important repercussion: we cannot \u201cjustify\u201d\nthat feeling to others, especially the person (or persons) associated therewith. This can feel very destabilizing and unfair. We know we are having an emotion,\nbut that emotion PLUS OTHER STUFF (people, words\u2026) equals far too much to make\nsense of at once, never mind hold our own in interaction. \n\n\n\nOne problem with this\nscenario is that people often will want to\ntalk about things as they occur -- which is not generally something that we\nwould be able to do with clarity in that moment! \n\n\n\nAfter we have plenty\nof time and space to PROCESS what happened, we can usually (not always) give a\ncogent explanation both of what the feeling was and why we were having that\nfeeling in that context. If people are willing to wait, this is when we might\nbe able to explain ourselves and our reactions\u2026for me, preferably in writing.\n\n\n\nG is being raised in a\nfamily where it\u2019s totally fine to cry, even when you don\u2019t know why you are\ncrying. I was raised in a WASPY family where nobody talked about their feelings.\nIt took me a long time to realize that I was actually unable (vs. disinclined)\nto talk about my feelings because they were too strong to understand in real\ntime. There\u2019s a big difference. WASPS may choose not to talk about feelings;\nalexithymia removes that choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis relates on a very basic level to SPD.\nThink of it like this: If I am listening to you -- and actually hearing and\nunderstanding you -- I am probably not looking at you (or at least truly seeing\nyou). If I have a big feeling about our interaction while I am listening to you,\nunless the understanding of this\nfeeling is given the neurological front seat (which is not under my control in\nthat moment, and so unlikely), it may just look like I am dazed\u2026or barely\nholding my own in conversation\u2026I may seem very upset (possibly for unclear reasons) or I\nmay seem just fine. I will probably remember every word you said because of a\ndifferent neurological quirk (eidetic memory) \u2013 and that\u2019s good, because the\nreal impact/import of our interaction will for me only emerge over time.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nG and I \u2013 not always but a lot of the time and\nmost assuredly when feelings are strong \u2013 do not essentially \u201cknow\u201d what we are\nfeeling until after the fact.\u00a0 For us,\nalexithymia is inextricably linked to SPD. G and his generation, as people\ngrowing up with more awareness around SPDs, will have a lot more in their toolboxes\nto develop self-awareness, moderation and expression than older generations. At\nthe same time, this growing awareness has \u2013 I hope -- enabled many of us to\nfeel more comfortable saying stuff like, \u201cI can\u2019t fully process this right now.\nI will get back to you about it later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that enough input? Probably! Just one last\nbit: Learning about Sensory Processing has brought us some relief, particularly\nthrough the use of Sensory Diets and Sensory Breaks. More good\nnews: using these techniques and insights will probably bring subtle but\npervasive benefits to your lives, not just your, you know, senses and\nprocessing. Once you know you are experiencing Sensory Processing Differences,\nthere are a lot of general resources online, so I have just shared some of our sometimes-quirky\npersonal solutions below. \n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA Sensory\nDiet can be therapeutic and formal, or it can be a way of being more\nconscious and evaluative about how we move through our days. Regulating and\nactively engaging with what you and/or your child consume/experience through\nyour environment, even just a fraction of the time, can be super helpful. This\nmay mean small steps like avoiding the cleaning products aisle at big box\nstores \u2013 or avoiding big box stores (the lights! aaaaaaaack!) altogether when\npossible. It may mean finding new ways to introduce your child or yourself to\nnew textures and tastes -- or it may mean finding ways to get the nutrition you\nneed without exposing yourself or your child to edible agony. It may \u2013 may! - even\nultimately mean transcending food-related sensory challenges by being really\nsmart and lucky about your overall sensory diet over time! It may manifest as\nit does for us in planning plenty of down time on the weekends \u2013 and being\nemotionally prepared for those frequent days when we cannot avoid doing too\nmuch. \n\n\n\nSetting\nboundaries on what you do and where you go can feel burdensome, but it feels\nless so when you realize that you are actually able to enjoy, process and\nintegrate what you do do. \n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is\nlittle a real Sensory Break cannot soothe, if one is available. The key\nis having the wherewithal (a small patch of uncluttered mental space?!) to\nREMEMBER to take that Sensory Break \u2013 or to offer one to your child or someone else\nyou know who needs one! (My dear friend Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg\nintroduced me to this concept and I will forever be grateful.) Many schools now\nhave Sensory Break Rooms. Some kids might need intense movement or \u201carousing\u201d\nactivities, others, complete silence and darkness or \u201ccalming\u201d activities\u2026I\u2019m\nnot crazy about labels like \u201cunder-reactive,\u201d over-reactive,\u201d etc., but you can\nfigure out what works for you and yours with creative experimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor adults and children, that key ingredient of\na good Sensory Diet \u2013 the Sensory Break -- can be as simple as going to the\nnearest bathroom (or even closet), closing the door, covering your eyes and\nears with your fingers and taking deep breaths. Please, in the name of all that\nis holy, let there not be an air freshener in the bathroom. And, thank you in\nadvance, dear universe, if it is not too much to ask, no Whistle Nose. \n\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ovja3J3g3tE/U5HsySBtrrI/AAAAAAAAAZk/BHsQVqWpkns/s1600/whistle+nose.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fFKIB4UsHK4/U5Hu7-t_mXI/AAAAAAAAAZs/dtIODQ47nOA/s1600/narrowwindow.JPG", "http://www.disabilityandrepresentation.com/)", "http://new.inlinkz.com/luwpview.php?id=404103", "http://new.inlinkz.com//luwpview.php?id=404103"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/06/whistle-noseand-other-sensory.html", "title": "\nWHISTLE NOSE...and other Sensory Processing Differences\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 28, 2014", "body": "\n\nAs anyone who deals closely with female\nchildren knows, young girls can be difficult. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of\n\u201csisterhood\u201d in upper elementary school, it\u2019s more \u201csurvival of the fittest.\u201d\nAnd Z is fit, oh yes, very fit.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, that social piece is not a big\nfear for me, which is nice because for Spectrum Child Sr. it\u2019s worrisome enough\nfor two. But some of my major concerns about Z are nonetheless directly related\nto girlhood. I see her acting \u201ccute\u201d and using a demanding yet \u201cgirly\u201d voice to\nget what she wants from lots of other people and it makes me uncomfortable. The\nundercurrent of my very visceral reactions to Z\u2019s \u201cbratty,\u201d \u201cmanipulative,\u201d\n\u201csneaky,\u201d \u201cspoiled\u201d behavior always seemed to me to be apprehension about her\nAttachment Disorder and how it might affect her and make her act in these ways.\nBut my darling friend Wise Ayi recognized a deeper source and schooled me on\nthe root of these concerns.\n\n\n\nI was telling Wise Ayi about a particular\ninteraction of Z\u2019s that I had observed and how it set me on edge and \u2013 I felt \u2013\nreinforced Z\u2019s unhealthy, Attachment-Disorder-related manipulative tendencies. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhoever that was with [Z] isn\u2019t a\nfeminist. That\u2019s what was really getting to you,\u201d Wise Ayi explained. Her words\nsank in with revelatory force, opening up a full-to-exploding can o\u2019 worms.\n\n\n\nI flashed on a big ol\u2019 worm: the memory of\nbeing at a celebratory dinner when Z\u2019s brother G got his Orange Belt in Tae\nKwon Do. This was a huge occasion for G and I had invited my ex, who at the\ntime was dating a very skinny woman with a 13-year old daughter who\u2019d recently\nbecome alarmingly thin. We ordered scallion pancakes and my ex\u2019s ex \u2013 in front\nof both of our daughters (and my son) \u2013 started going off about how they were\n\u201cSo fattening\u201d and \u201call that saturated fat\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\nI was furious! All I was able to\nspit out at the time was \u201cSome fats are good for you!\u201d but I was steaming for\ndays over the prospect of ex's ex \u201cinfecting\u201d Z with that kind of body\nconsciousness. It was my first intense encounter \u2013 I live in a very progressive\ncommunity \u2013 with the idea that Z could be indoctrinated into such destructive\naspects of \u201cnormal\u201d girl culture as healthy girls seeing themselves as (and\nbeing seen as) \u201cfat,\u201d as diets and appearance taking center stage in girls\u2019\nlives. \u00a0\n\n\n\nBut here in the manipulative, \u201ccutesy\u201d behavior\nwe were talking about demeanor, not exactly appearance \u2013 a more subtle thing,\nbut another worm nonetheless.\n\n\n\nWise Ayi was right, as she often is...When Z is\n\u201csassy,\u201d when she ends all her statements so they sound like questions, when\nshe strikes a pose after speaking, she is implicitly buying into the construct\nthat that is how girls get what they want. And it makes me cringe, -- partly\nbecause of the Attachment Disorder aspect, but much more, I now realize,\nbecause I am a feminist. Apparently, these affectations don\u2019t make non-feminists\ncringe \u2013 but I think they should. \n\n\n\nWe all suffer when one half of the population\nis taught to be cute in order to get their way rather than owning their power. \n\n\n\nAdmittedly, in a way, this is a form of\nmisogyny on my part, in that I don\u2019t want Z to use \u201cfeminine wiles\u201d to get what\nshe wants. On the flip, non-mysogynistic side of this stance, I want her to\nsucceed on her own formidable skills and merit. \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want my daughter\u2019s power to be gendered\nany more than it inherently will be by others \u2013 especially by her own actions.\n\n\n\n\u201cFeminist\u201d should not be a dirty word or an\ninsult, though it is taken as such by many. But \u201cbitch\u201d sure is. The voice of\nmisogyny calls women in power \u201cbitches.\u201d Misogynous culture trains women with\none insidious tentacle to be coy and \u201csassy\u201d -- while with another it slaps\nthem down for just such behavior. \n\n\n\nIs it too idealistic or naive to hope that a\nstraightforward, strong person of any gender might avoid the moniker \u201cbitch\u201d? \n\n\n\nPerhaps. \n\n\n\nStill, I want my daughter\u2019s voice and actions\nto be as strong as her heart and mind. And I want her to CHOOSE her voice, even\nto subvert stereotypes -- not be trained by those around her to be \u201ccute,\u201d or\ncelebrated and rewarded for being coquettish or cunning.\u00a0And if she gets\ncalled the F-word or the B-word along the way, I want her to have the true\nmeaning of the F-word \u2013 the knowledge (and the endeavor to disseminate this knowledge)\nthat women are equal to men, and deserve to be treated as such \u2013 to fall back\non\u2026 whatever she chooses to call herself.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething funny happened on the way to this can\nof worms: I realized that \u201cgirly\u201d behavior and Attachment-Disordered behavior\nhave something extremely important in common: \n\nThe\nimpulse to get what you need by any means necessary. In case you can\u2019t. In case\nyou don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d it.\u00a0\nSo, along with a strong voice, I want for my daughter \n\nthe inner knowledge to take root and to animate\nher voice and heart\n\n\n\nthat she does\ndeserve \n\n\n\nthat she can\ndo\n\n\n\n\u2026anything\nand everything.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-f-word-and-b-word.html", "title": "\nTHE F-WORD AND THE B-WORD\n"},

Hadn\u2019t even thought about that! For the\nFull Spectrums who are on the Autism end of our spectrum, both of whom have\nSensory Processing Differences, knowing how an emotion feels in our body AND\nhaving a feeling at the same time AND functioning will be a lifelong project.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a recent example: G\u2019s Graduation from 6th Grade, about which I\u2019d been very apprehensive, primarily\nbecause I thought I would humiliate him with my sentimental sobbing. What\nactually happened was VERY Sensory, but also unexpected. \n\n\n\nG cried, ceaselessly through his entire graduation\nceremony. Big blubbery tears, shaking, trying to stop, humiliated, heaving, producing\ncopious liquid from nose and eyes.\u2026on the stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I- G: SPD/ASD Child:\u00a0\n\nHeat Plus Feelings\n(Crying) Equals Full Brain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo stop crying would have taken some extra\ncapacity he simply did not have, what with the Heat and the Crying/Feelings. \n\n\n\nZ \u2013 our resident Neurotypical, who\u2019s also on\nthe no-nonsense end of the spectrum -- asked, repeatedly, \u201cWhy is he crying?\u201d\nNot so much with scorn but sheer bewilderment. \n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t cry at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure II \u2013 FSM: SPD/ASD Mother: Heat Plus Feelings\n(Psychicly Messaging G to Try to Stop Crying Plus, Especially, to Stop Overtly\nWiping Giant Gobs of Snot on His Arm) Equals Full Brain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo cry would have taken some extra capacity I just\ndidn\u2019t have, what with the Heat and the Sweetie-Can-You-Stop Feelings.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAll my energy was channeled into trying to get\nhim to calm down and breathe \u2013 complete with \u201cuseful\u201d facial cues \u2013 and to\nstop, just - PLEASE, for your own\nsake son! -- with the snot. \n\n\n\nSo many adults came up to me afterwards and\nsaid how touching his crying was, one spoke of his \u201cpure heart,\u201d but I know he\nfelt terrible. It couldn\u2019t have been a big status-builder with his peers.\n\n\n\nG\u2019s an old sap from a long line of softhearted saps,\nand this event was overwhelming on a myriad of levels. Being hyper-empathetic,\nI think he was feeling and expressing what so many in that room were feeling\nand not expressing. And it was a huge year for him, finally feeling like he\nbelonged, in unprecedented ways. \n\n\n\nMost of all, the heat in that room was so\noverwhelming that for both of us it was almost impossible to function. I am\nsure it was awful for everybody, no question, but with Sensory Processing\nDifferences the brain simply cannot prioritize in the \u201cnormal\u201d way.\n\n\n\nHeat plus another thing? That is IT. \n\n\n\nThen G got REALLY SICK. Fever, nausea\u2026I think\nthe latter might have had to do with his eating four desserts during the\n\u201crefreshments\u201d part, but I genuinely think the fever was his feelings in his\nbody. This scared me, because I, too, get my feelings in my body \u2013 and I ended\nup with rheumatoid arthritis, one of the few diseases known by western,\nmainstream medicine to be in many cases the result of trauma. \n\n\n\nIn these ways SPD is so closely linked to our emotions.\nIf we can better process our feelings, we will be exponentially healthier \u2013\nbody and mind. \n\n\n\nBut if you take even just this one little\nscenario, Heat plus Tears or Not-Tears were maximum-capacity situations for us.\nNoodle Ayi\u2019s sage thoughts around figuring out how emotions feel in our bodies\nwere one order above where we sat, blubbering and not blubbering, in that hot\nroom. \n\n\n\nThere was no \n\n\u201chow\ndoes my body feel right now?\u201d \n\nnever mind \n\n\u201cwhat\nis this emotion my body is feeling?\u201d \n\nnever, never mind \n\n\u201cI\nam feeling this way, which represents\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nFor some people with Sensory Processing\nDifferences, even ONE of those factors might be enough, as in: Heat = Full\nBrain = Go Home, or Big Feeling = Full Brain = Tantrum.\n\n\nSo you can see where it might be nice to have\nstrategies to manage all sorts of scenarios involving, oh, life. It could be\nextremely helpful to be able to use another tool to discern how we are feeling,\nfrom the way our bodies are feeling.\n\n\n\nThe first step for our Full Spectrum family,\nthough, has been to acknowledge and begin to understand how we process\nexperiences in ways we could not fathom before knowing we had Sensory\nProcessing Differences. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m feeling\u2026.hopeful?\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vQamjcwmYrs/U7q1Fjo9tsI/AAAAAAAAAas/SHgtvTzyoQU/s1600/heatfeelings1.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BQX_f03aZjg/U7q2mjKPtLI/AAAAAAAAAa4/OPPDB5mKWnc/s1600/heatfeelings2.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jF6lt5NyDbM/U7q_j_9x9lI/AAAAAAAAAbY/o65B55uBZUs/s1600/SensoryBlogHop+(1).jpg", "http://new.inlinkz.com//luwpview.php?id=413882", "http://new.inlinkz.com/luwpview.php?id=413882"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-heat-plus-feeling.html", "title": "\nTHE HEAT PLUS THE FEELING\n"},

I\u2019d never been before because I\nalways have the kids with me at night, but thought I would go since kids were\nwelcome this time. \n\n\n\nEn route to the meeting, we stopped by our\ntown\u2019s First Friday celebration where there is art and music and stuff. That\nwas our first mistake. Two events? What was I thinking? \n\n\n\nI began to get a headache. \n\n\n\nWe arrived at the meeting and there was a\nceiling fan! And bright lights! You can see where this is heading\u2026And there\nwere a bunch of very, very nice people, mostly educators and paraprofessionals,\nat whom I could not look. No other kids, but hey, my kids are a lotta kids. \n\n\n\nBy this point I could barely see or hear. I\ncould feel the inflammation inside my skull (see above), and my head felt like\nit was about to explode. Just throbbing\nwith pain. The fans, the lights, the conversation, the nice, nice people? Unbearable.\n\n\n\n\nI drove home trying not to vomit, got home,\nvomited from pain\u2026\n\n\n\nOne single burning thing I was able to think\nduring this episode: I can only imagine how a child would handle this! \n\n\n\nThis is Sensory Processing Disorder: a relative overabundance of stimuli (whether of activities or sensory input) causes\nmigraines for some people. This same overabundance can also cause some of us to\nfeel overwhelmed with despair, or anxiety, or anger and - especially before we\nare aware of Sensory Processing Differences - to not know why we feel this way.\nKmarie Audrey has written wonderfully about this subject here.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAgain, imagine how this process of Sensory\nchallenges leading to emotional/social/physical pain and/or overload would\naffect a child!\u00a0A huge meltdown or\ntantrum seems almost \u2013 dare I say it? -- \u201dunder-reactive\u201d in this context!\n\n\n\nMy son, who also has Sensory Processing\nDifferences, tends to shut down, or get more flappy and loud than usual when in\nOverload Mode. I talk to him about it, and hope he will have the words and wherewithal to deal with it as he grows up. \n\n\n\nMe? I mostly get Burning Brain these days. Once\nI am in that state (and by this point medications do not help) my migraine will\namplify any sensory input so as to make the smallest thing (lights, sounds,\nsmells, movement) literally agonizing. \n\n\n\nOn the most basic level, I get why a clothing\ntag might make someone scream, why swinging on a swing soothes some and\ndysregulates others, why seeing a bright color could cause nausea or even\nvomiting\u2026\n\n\n\nThere is a great deal of skepticism around Sensory\nProcessing Disorder (SPD), so I write this for those who cannot put their experiences\ninto words as well as I can (at least in writing), and/or who do not have an\naudience. As an adult, I have a certain legitimacy, where a young child might\nnot. I am able to be articulate in ways that a non-verbal or less verbal person\nmight not be...As a college professor and an individual with some level of \u201csuccess\u201d\nin life I implicitly have the credibility that those who are even more\nprofoundly affected by Sensory Differences might not be freely given by others.\n\n\n\n\nSPD is not an \u201cexcuse\u201d for me \u2013 I have a good\nlife! \u2013 but it is very real and very challenging and as a label it does explain\nsome of my lived experience.\u00a0For some of us, including many children and\npeople with autism/autistic people, SPD \u2013 while it may have its positive\naspects (about which I have written before and will write again) \u2013 can make\nlife quite difficult.\n\n\n\nWe may need help. We may need accommodations. We\nmay need creative solutions and adaptations.

Curious about sex,\nhormonal, but very, very innocent. G is similar, but, if it\u2019s possible, even\nmore oblivious. What G lacks in commonsensicals, he certainly makes up for in\nheart-of-gold, but I am not convinced this combo will serve him well for the\nnext year or two.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\nin your infinite wisdom and harmony may you at least try to help him and the\nrest of our children entering Middle School to not embarrass themselves unduly.\n\n\n\n\nPlease\nwatch over our children and prevent them from seeming to be stalkers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe beg - beg! - that you not let them be taken advantage of.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlso,\nplease see that the age of their bodies and the age of their minds and emotions\ncorrespond at least slightly, both within their own beings and amongst their\nfriends.\n\n\n\nAnd\nmay they find friends, O Universe.

Not. \n\n\n\nOr\nmaybe we could give them a list of the above steps to follow (read: give them a\nlist to lose on the first day of school)? \n\n\n\nDear\nUniverse, can you please O please manage this one somehow for the sake of our\ndear children? \n\n\n\nBecause\nthis is one where our fear is mighty and legit, albeit probably\nincomprehensible to some. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMay our\nchildren learn Self-Advocacy \u2013\n\n\n\nFor\nwe are not omnipresent \u2013 and we are sometimes, we admit, exhausted.

Where will my challenges be and how\ncan I access the help I need to be successful? What are my rights and\nresponsibilities - \u00a0here, now?\n\n\n\nIf\npossible, may their Executive Function improve such that they are developing in\nawareness of what they need and how they may best be served in their own\nactions and in the resources available to them\u2026 \n\n\n\nAnd,\nwhether or not our children are mainstreamed or in more specialized programs, semi-independent\nor not-,\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMay the\nhelp they are given be Helpful and not Non-Helpful \u2013\n\n\n\nOver\nthe years there have been periods where I would begin to see some or all of G\u2019s\nwork and assignments written out in someone else\u2019s handwriting. Dear Universe, as you are no doubt aware, G is able to write. Does it take him longer to write something than the average\nstudent or adult paraprofessional? Yes. Does he have dysgraphia and other\nlearning differences around writing? Yes. Yet having someone do all his work\nfor him is unequivocally NON-helpful help.\nI suspect the paras in question were trying to be kind, or to speed things up, make\nthings easier for all parties\u2026In any case I know they were not intending to\ndeprive my son of a learning opportunity. But that is just what they were\ndoing. \n\n\n\nDear\nUniverse, some of us fear that in the larger Middle School context, it might\nseem easier to just sort of pass our kids through the system, using precisely\nthis sort of non-helpful (to our children) help. This would be a great loss for\nour children.\n\n\n\nMay\nour children instead benefit from Flexible Support, where sensitive teachers\nand helpers recognize when help is truly needed but pull back to allow\nstudents to fly on their own where they are able to fly; sometimes, when necessary, fluffing up their\nfeathers and wings, and, the rest of the time, letting students make their own, probably\nimperfect but unique and rewarding flights\u2026\n\n\n\nMay\nwe, the staff, their peers, and their teachers balance our children\u2019s overt needs\n\u2013 for security, for routine, for \u201csuccess\u201d and success \u2013 with the myriad of\nwonderful possibilities for new experiences and learning out there in Your Universe,\nDear Universe.\n\n\n\nBig thanks.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/08/middle-school-prayers.html", "title": "\n MIDDLE SCHOOL* PRAYERS**\n"},

Sometimes that \u201cnoticing\u201d\ntakes the form of bias, discrimination, bullying\u2026\n\n\n\nPeople who are activists for animal rights or\npolitical justice or against other injustices may be activists for causes that\nare urgent, but they have a choice. \n\n\n\nIn any case, there IS injustice in the world. \n\n\n\nSometimes what we need when life deals\ninjustice is someone to say \u201cArgh!\u201d with us. And that can be enough. Actually,\nwe almost always need a fellow Argher -- at the very least to understand and\nempathize. \n\n\n\nThere are several sorts of Arghers:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCO-Argher, who shares your situation;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nWITH-Argher, who just completely Gets\nyour situation;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGENERAL-Argher, who is compassionate in every way\u2026\n\n\u2026We\nwill not deign to discuss the ANTI-Arghing-Argher, who wants the other Arghers\nto can it, pronto.\n\n\n\nOur fellow Arghers make life bearable when\nsomething feels very wrong. But, often, we need more. The \u201cActivist\u201d label arose for me when stupid stuff happened & I chose to call people & institutions out\non their discriminatory behavior. Activists seek to be catalysts for change,\nbecause the status quo is often unacceptable.\n\n\n\nArghing is private, but Activism is public and\noften elicits resentment. People generally want Activists to keep quiet and go\naway so that they don\u2019t have to be inconvenienced by accommodating the equality\nof ALL. \n\n\n\nSo\u2014rry.\n\n\n\nActivists may be sorted into similar\ncategories:\n\nThe\nCO-Activist, who shares your cause (just about everyone I know who has a \u201cdifferent\u201d\nchild has been shunted into Arghing and/or Activism. As a parent, one basically\nhas no choice);\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nWITH-Activist, who just completely Gets\nyour cause and supports it; \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGENERAL-Activist, who is justice-oriented in every way;\n\nThe\nANTI-Activist, who finds Activists burdensome and pesky.\n\n\n\nLiminal people \u2013 minorities, people with\ndifferences, etc. \u2013 often have way more encounters with neurotypical, gender,\neconomic, racial, normative or other privilege. If a given liminal individual (or\ntheir parent or partner or other loved one) is strong/brave/privileged/foolhardy\nenough, he or she may choose to speak up\nabout injustice. \n\n\n\nFor many reasons, however, we don\u2019t always say\nsomething, whether through public Activism or private Arghing. Some of us are\nnon-verbal, some of us are shy, some of us are scared, some of us are tired,\nsome of us are cynical, some are resigned\u2026\n\n\n\nWe DO always feel it, though; of that you may\nbe sure. \n\n\n\nWhat happens, then, is that those of us who by\nvirtue of our own and/or our children\u2019s and/or our loved one\u2019s differences see\nmore injustice and choose to address it sometimes find ourselves in these\npositions: \n\n\u201crebellious\u201d\npeople of color,\n\n\u201cuppity\u201d\nwomen, \n\n\u201cwhiney\u201d\npeople in poverty, \n\n\u201cannoying\u201d\ndisabled people, \n\n\u201cshrill\u201d\nqueers\u2026\n\nA.k.a., Arghers and, perhaps, Activists! \n\n\n\nThe funny thing, vis-\u00e0-vis the people who\nresent Activism, is that the kinds of Arghing and Activising that I am talking\nabout are long-term beneficial to ALL. Sure, it might take some stretching on\nthe parts of certain individuals and institutions. The \u201cprivileges\u201d of\ninequality from which some benefit (and others suffer) may be hard to\nrelinquish, but I cannot hope but believe the rewards would be more than\ncommensurate. Truly, what do we ultimately have to lose by being more inclusive\nas individuals and communities?? \n\n\n\nIdeally, as painful as they are, these\nexperiences of talking about and struggling with and negotiating over and even experiencing\ninjustice make us more fully human, more empathetic to others.\u00a0 Once we have experienced injustice, we don\u2019t want\nANYONE to suffer. \n\n\n\nTake, for example, Hedy Epstein, the 90-year-oldholocaust survivor arrested for protesting against institutionalized racism and violence in Ferguson, Missouri last month.\u00a0My instant take on hearing about her was: OF COURSE: She has experienced and\nrecognizes injustice\u2026She cannot stay silent, having once escaped being permanently\nsilenced.\n\n\n\nShe, too, is an Argher and an Activist. \n\n\n\nWe can be proud to share her proclivities!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama, A. & A.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/holocaust-survivor-hedy-epstein-arrested-ferguson-protest-says-racism-alive-america-265703"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/09/arghers-and-activists.html", "title": "\nARGHERS AND ACTIVISTS\n"},

Because they\nhike up into the woods for camp, I hadn\u2019t met some of the counsellors (the ones\nwho were waiting mysteriously up at the Hogan every day).\n\n\n\nMy student, having watched me for two\nthree-hour classes, said I \u201clook and act exactly like [G],\u201d so he \u201cjust had to\nask.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis gave me so much hope, because I am \u2013\ndespite my differences or because of them or some mixture thereof \u2013 totally\nfine. I don\u2019t worry about me. But I DO worry about my son. And sometimes people\nthink I over-identify with him, but this is because 1. I get him \u2013 profoundly, and, 2. I want him to be okay in the end, as\nI am.\n\n\n\nI always tell people I was almost exactly like\nG at his age, but female, and people who\u2019ve known me only as an adult don\u2019t\nbelieve me, basically because they think G is \u00a0\u201cmore autistic\u201d than they think I would have\nbeen. But I know, and I remember. \n\n\n\nHeck, forget being \u201cokay like I am\u201d I would like\nto see \u2013 and do, often, see \u2013 G as being okay in different ways. And I would love for G to surpass me in the neurological department and anywhere else. Isn\u2019t\nany parent glad to see their child out-do them? It seems like that would be a\nvery visceral survival thing. Differences are welcome and celebrated in our\nfamily as well! When I see Z shining in her acrobatics class, doing things I\ncan\u2019t even imagine doing, I am beyond\nproud. \n\n\n\nIn addition to neurological and physical\ndifferences, we need to take into account temporal differences: when people\npresume that G will stay just as he is, rather than growing as I have and then some, I find\nit highly botherous.\n\n\n\nIn any case, G\u2019s strengths and challenges\nresonate deeply with me, though I always try to respect his separateness and\nunique personhood.

There\nare a variety of reasons for this, but my social challenges would rank up there\nnear or at the top. I was so painfully shy in my new school that I was unable\nto say hi to people. I didn\u2019t want to insult them by implying that they knew\nme. But people took this as my being snobby! And that\u2019s just one example! \n\n\n\nTrust me - it was ghastly.\n\n\n\nG has had some challenges, to be sure. The\nadjustment to lockers was\u2026epic, and most of my concerns in Middle School Prayers remain relevant. \u00a0But the bottom\nline is he walks out of school every day waving casually: \u201cHeeeeyy, so-and-so,\u201d\n\u201cYo, dudette\u201d\u2026And people\u2026reply?\n\n\n\nIs Middle School better than it used to be? How can isolating children in one place\nat their most antisocial, brutal stage, while combining students from several\nelementary schools so that they are naturally forced to jockey for position\nand, therefore, usually, inclined to identify scapegoats, ever be good? \n\n\n\nMy seventh-grader rates every day an 8 or 9. His\ninnate positivity?...Cluelessness? New and improved brand of Middle School? \u00a0I\u2019m surprised \u2013 but I\u2019ll take it!\n\n\n\nAs G headed to school today, his hands were\nwrapped in a homemade \u201cMega Master Mega Evolution\u201d Bracelet for his imaginary Pokemon (Figure I).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure I - \"Hey Pokemon fans out there: this is [G], the Mega Master!\" (Caption courtesy of G)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[G],\u201d I said gently, \u201cyou might want to leave\nthat at home.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo way, mom.\u00a0[Friend A{awkward,\nsweet guy}] and [Friend B{goofasurus maximus darling boy}]*\u00a0will like it, and I don\u2019t care about\nanybody else.\u201d\n\n\n\nI am so proud, and relieved beyond measure.

C\u2019mon hipsters!): the original grooves are deeper, as they are\nmore strongly felt; the grooves that remain over time are worn away more slowly,\nif at all, because of their original depth. Literally, though, it\u2019s the neural\nconnections experiencing and recalling these feelings/events that are more\nrobust. This might account at least partially for G\u2019s and my eidetic memories,\nwith which we are able to visually recall whole swathes of text or things we\u2019ve\nseen or heard (transformed into text, for me). \n\n\n\nAt the same time, the processing and memory\nspace taken up by these strong feelings seems to preclude the remembering of \u2013\nor paying attention to - whole other piles of things.

{"date": "Thursday, November 20, 2014", "body": "\n\n\nI recently read a book review by a person with\nsensory processing differences bemoaning a new compilation of essays by people\non the spectrum as basically all stuff she\u2019d heard before. It\u2019s true: so many\nblogs and books are about similar things. Still, as a teacher (of yoga as well\nas academics), I know full well that it can take a lot of repetition for things\nto get through to people. \n\n\n\nAnother point in favor of repetition: Sometimes\nhearing things slightly differently, or from a different source, makes all the\ndifference. I still remember the first time I really heard a yoga teacher say, \u201cbreathe deeply,\u201d despite the fact\nthat I\u2019d probably been instructed to do so a bajillion times before. A\nparticular iteration just might be the one that - finally, truly - gets through\nto someone.\n\n\n\nAs well, I applaud the normalization of the\nconversation itself! Another post about why someone needs earplugs or a\nweighted blanket or a sensory break?\u2026Sigh? Or be glad that these adaptations\nare being integrated into the realm of \u201cwhatever\u201d (as opposed to\n\u201cweirdo-land\u201d)? \n\n\n\nIn that vein, I offer my take on families and\nfriends learning about difference: \n\n\n\n\n\nA friend posted this question on facebook:\n\n\u00a0\u00b7 \n\nHey friends, I'd like to know how you talk to\nyour kids about people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I'm\nfinding the \"difference\" language, which I generally like and feel is\nempowering, to be somehow problematic.\n\n\n\n[Her son] \u00a0knows that there are lots of ways people can\nbe different, that some people are born different and some people look or act\ndifferent because of something that happens in life (like veterans who use\nprosthetics). If I know someone's diagnosis (like Down's Syndrome), I use that\nin a matter-of-fact way, explaining what it is and how it happens.\n\n\n\nThe issue is when I don't know what someone's\ndifference is diagnosed as, but I want to talk about that person with [son], so\nhe can be sensitive to them. I want him to know it's okay to ask me any\nquestions he might have. I don't see how he can stand up to any bullying of\nkids who are different if he thinks it's something so shameful we don't talk\nopenly about it.\n\n\n\nThoughts? Advice?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I said [combined and slightly\nedited for clarity]: \n\n\n\nGreat question and obviously one we deal with\nfor a variety of reasons and in a variety of ways in our family. I do agree\nthat a matter-of fact attitude is so important in most observation of others.\nAnything from \"Oh, so and so sometimes shouts,\" to \u201cYup, looks like that\nkid has only one arm\u2026\u201d to \u201cYes, some people think it is important to wear\nclothing with a brand name on it,\u201d can be shared in a neutral and implicitly\ninclusive way. There might be some judgment or question appended \u2013 \u201cDoes that\nhurt your ears?\u201d \u201cDo you think brand names are important?\u201d \u201cHow do you think\nshe feels if people stare at her?\u201d \u2013\u00a0\nthat is likewise implicitly inclusive in that it does not intentionally\nrefer to the \u201cnormalcy\u201d of the observed trait.\n\n\n\nOne major caveat when it comes specifically to\n\u201cdisability:\u201d Many people one might label as disabled might disagree with that\nlabel. They might feel they are differently-abled, or even superiorly-abled, or\ncompletely normal in their own way\u2026.\n\n\n\nBecause there are two key underlying things\nhere: \n\nhow\npeople see themselves\n\nand\n\u00a0\n\nhow\nthey are seen by others.\n\n\n\nObviously you want [your son] to know that all\nbeings are worthy of kindness and respect (I hate \"tolerance\" [although\nI know it's meant well in theory, I find it condescending in practice])\nincluding himself (who, as a male of color, will have his work cut out for him\nin some arenas...). This kindness and respect model encompasses both how he\nsees himself and how he sees others, and naturally\nintegrates how others themselves might want to be seen, right?\n\n\n\nWhat I try to convey is that Everybody\nis different...and everybody is equally worthy of kindness and respect. Having\nan autistic kid and a kid of color that's already been kind of an inevitable issue\nand we have our teachable moments at home as well as on the town. Sometimes\nthey are painful. (And, by the way, there are those rare exceptions to these\nideals of neutral observation and kindness and respect for all: those sorry-as$\npeople who do not treat us or others with kindness and respect [because they\nare \u201churting in their hearts\u201d] need to be treated with kindness and respect\nfrom a very long distance\u2026)\n\n\n\nI guess this is a long-winded way of saying: \n\nif Everybody\nis different, \n\nthen \"different in the way her mind [body,\netc] works\" or \"from a different \n\nculture\"\n(or whatEVER) \n\nbecomes\nsimply one difference among an infinite realm of possibility. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty ordinary point for those of us\naccustomed to daily life with \u201cextraordinary\u201d differences in our midst. But the\nimplications are grand: with everybody being different, there is no homogeneous\n\u201cnormal\u201d against which we all must be judged. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/11/different.html", "title": "\nDIFFERENT\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2014", "body": "\n\n\nAt G\u2019s last IEP meeting, someone suggested he join a Social Skills/Pragmatic Language group that was starting nearby. If you are a parent of a child with differences (or a child with interests for that matter), you know how expensive activities (therapeutic and non-) can be. The fact that this group was FREE, because it was somehow part of a graduate program, caught my attention. I signed G up pronto. So far, we have been to three meetings and G has really enjoyed them. The boys (all boys\u2026) play games and build things together and practice learning about each other and asking one another dialog-producing questions. Maybe the best part of all is the lack of eye-rolling: no one in this group has that developmentally-appropriate, neurotypical tendency to roll their eyes when someone acts \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the last meeting, the director of the program came into the waiting room and informed us that we were welcome to \u201cwatch the group\u201d through a one way mirror. Apparently, this had been an ongoing activity for the graduate students and faculty involved, and was now an option for parents. I joined some students (and/or faculty) and other parents behind said mirror as they watched the meeting. It felt a little bit like looking into an aquarium. From time to time, people would comment, stuff like, \u201cOh, watch him, he\u2019s really communicating,\u201d or \u201cFascinating: watch how he\u2026!\u201d Several were taking notes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI felt like the children were specimens in that aquarium.

In the presence of\nmy children, I had a major \u2013 and, apparently, noticeable -- \u00a0lapse of my usual Momveneer* of steady\ncompetence and cheer \u2013 and Guess What! \n\n\n\nThe kids could actually handle it. \n\n\n\nG, usually happily \u2013 to his mother, scarily - devoid\nof Executive Function and Mundane Practical Concerns/Attention, became suddenly\nattuned to things he\u2019d never seemed to even register before: \u201cMom, don\u2019t you\nneed to put your turn signal on here?\u201d he asked, to my utter astonishment (filtered\nthrough a murky haze of despair). \u201cYou seem like you are not focusing,\u201d he told\nme a few minutes later. \u201cDo you need to take a break?\u201d \n\n\n\nMeanwhile Z, who is not known for being\nforthcoming about her intentions or actions, became crystal clear, meticulous\nand solicitous: \u201cMay I get a glass of water?\u201d (My reaction, percolated via a\nthick fog of dejection: HUH???) \u201cMay I get you\na glass of water too?\u201d \u201cHow are you doing, Mama?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt gradually dawned on me that what I was\nexperiencing was a manifestation of The MATURE Hard Times Alternator. I had\nbeen well aware of the machinations of The Hard Times Alternator (THTA) in my\nchildren, but did not know that it was also potentially a major player in any\nFull family dynamic. Adults are usually a peripheral factor in the HTA equation.\nI hadn\u2019t realized grownups sometimes \u2013 however momentarily - merit this sort of\nethereal (yet, when necessary, child-incorporating) intervention!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 The Mature Hard Times Alternator in\nAction, utilizing the \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoorly Behaved\u201d Model of \u00a0Poor Behavior\n\n\n\nThis flare-up of The Mature Hard Times\nAlternator is not something I would want to incur too often. I like to let my\nkids be kids, and I think some of their response was out of anxiety. Plus, that\nsort of disastrophe pile-up is not\nsomething I\u2019d like to endure with any frequency. It was nonetheless liberating\nand reassuring in the way it revealed the junior Full Spectrums\u2019 potential\ncapabilities -- and to see them step up when called for by TMHTA. \n\n\n\nThis holiday season, may your HTA in be in good\nworking order; and may your MHTA be at the ready\u2026should that by any chance\nbecome necessary. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n*Veneer!

{"date": "Thursday, June 26, 2014", "body": "\n\nHere\u2019s a spectrum for you: a Sneaky Spectrum.\n\n\n\nOn one end we have G, who does stuff like\nshouting \u201cDon\u2019t look! I\u2019m changing!\u201d when doing a changing-inside-towel thinger\nat the beach. As you might imagine, he\u2019s not much of a sneaker. His sneaking is\nalways cartoonish and ridiculous \u2013 stomping down the stairs on his tiptoes with\na sheepish expression on his face as he tries to sneak a granola bar after\nbedtime, spitting his greens into the toilet then forgetting to flush\u2026\n\n\n\nMy father told me when I was very young that I\nwas a bad liar and I\u2019ve pretty much not lied since. That was a pretty good\nteaching. He also tried to teach me to be subtle and ladylike. Which did not\nwork. Both of which \u2013 not lying, not being subtle (subtlety usually reads\nto me as manipulative) \u2013 now totally\nmake sense in my corner of the spectrum.\n\n\n\nAt the other end of the Sneaky Spectrum, we\nhave Z, who is a Master Sneak. And it scares me because I have no idea how to\ndeal with it. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example: WADS. One of Z\u2019s special\nhabits is making little balls of chewed up paper with water and spit. She likes\nto take them in and out of her mouth, and store them for long periods of time.\nThis results in a reeking, festering mess; and, in her mother here, a mixture\nof exasperation, disgust and compassion. Obviously, wads fulfill a deep need in\nmy daughter, whether for oral sensory seeking or something more emo-, and\norphanage-related. But\u2026I need to help her fulfill that particular need in a\nhealthier way.\n\n\n\nSo I tried Solution 1: No Water in the Bedroom.\nThis did not work, as Z is worlds above me in the Sneak Department. She found a\nmyriad of ways to sneak water into her room and create wads. Stashing water in\nthe containers of \u201cbeauty products\u201d I gave her so she wouldn\u2019t eat mine\u2026a tiny\ndoll\u2019s mug under the bed with murky, saliva-y water\u2026wads hidden wrapped in\nnon-masticated tissues next to her bed \u201cin case she needed to blow her nose\u201d\u2026 \n\n\n\nOver years,\nwe\u2019d have the talk \u2013 \u201cPlease don\u2019t chew up paper and leave it in your room.\nIt\u2019s not healthy because the wads get full of germs and smell bad too.\u00a0 If you need food or a drink I will give them\nto you\u2026\u201d OR \u201cYou may NOT have water in your room!\u201d \u2013 and a few days (or weeks)\nlater I would find a glass (or another vessel) of water and an (increasingly\ntiny) container full of paper/water/spit wads. \n\n\n\nInnovative. \n\n\n\nThe mildly unsanitary aspect of the wads gets\nto me less than the sneaking. The worst part is feeling that I am somehow\nhelping her to become a Master Sneak.\n\n\n\nTelling Z not to do something just doesn\u2019t work. (Lest you forget that\nthis is a Full Spectrum we are working with, telling G not to do something\ndoesn\u2019t always work either. But he\u2019s \u2013 I was going to say more sanitary, but no\n\u2013 less potentially dangerous in his\nefforts.)\n\n\n\nLike many children with attachment disorders, Z\nhas a deep underlying need for control. I can wear myself out supervising her\nevery moment, but we are already almost there. And I need to help her learn\nhealthy habits and heal her attachment disordered behavior, rather than training her to stay one step ahead of The\nLaw.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve long known I need to do something\nindirect, something subtle in this, the Matter of the Wads. Unfortunately, my\nbrain just does not work that way!\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, over the years, my early bird G\nspends his mornings reading; early bird Z seems to spend them making wads. \n\n\n\nUntil now! \n\n\n\nSolution 2: After years of worrying about the\nimplications of Z alone in her room with needles and scissors, I finally gave her\na whole bunch of sewing and weaving stuff to play with at her own discretion. \n\n\n\nI noticed a few weeks after the crafty gifts that\nthese activities seem to have worked to channel/redirect her wad-making energy,\nindirectly and subtly! \n\n\n\nThis was so indirect and subtle I didn\u2019t even know I was doing it. \n\n\n\nAnyway: Huzzah! \n\n\n\nFingers crossed on the sharps. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/06/wads.html", "title": "\nWADS\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 9, 2014", "body": "\n\n\nPlease\nnote: this post is part of the Sensory Blog Hop, which is sponsored by the\nfabulous Jenny (what a great name!) over at The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and The Jenny Evolution.\nI accepted the invitation to participate as a way to get more exposure for FSM,\nbut it has become a wonderful, inclusive, helpful community for all us SPD Blog\nHoppers. Please do click on the links below for fresh and inspiring\nperspectives and meet some very worthwhile new pals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen my little fella started seventh grade this\nfall, I very nearly had a nervous breakdown.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, it seems to be going very well..socially...which\nis...a surprise. \n\n\n\nAnd then there are his grades. Which are\nterrible.\n\n\n\nYou see, his ASD and SPD are a big part of his\nDEFD and this causes a decline in his ABCs. \n\n\n\nGet it? No? Please allow me to break it down:\n\n\n\n\n\nASD officially\nstands for Autism Spectrum Disorder. I don\u2019t like \u201cDisorder,\u201d so I end the\nphrase with Difference. G is on the Autism Spectrum. He\u2019s autistic in the way\nthat used to be officially called Asperger\u2019s. \n\n\n\nAmong\nother things, this means G has challenges in the social realm.\n\n\n\nSPD\nofficially stands for Sensory Processing Disorder. I do the same here, calling\nit Sensory Processing Differences. G has sensory processing differences, as\nmost people on the spectrum do, as many people in his biological family \u2013\nincluding me \u2013 do\u2026\n\n\n\nAmong\nother things, this means that G is extraordinarily neurologically and\nsensorially sensitive in certain ways, while in other ways he may seem\n\u201cundersensitive.\u201d Put another way, the systems of people with SPD tend to pay\nmore or less attention to feelings and sensory input than is \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nEach\nperson with SPD is different. (Sometimes when one area seems \u201cundersensitive\u201d\nit is because an individual with SPD is already overwhelmed from\n\u201coversensitivity\u201d in another area!) \n\n\n\nDEFD\nstands for Determinants of Executive Function and Dysfunction. Executive Function\n\u2013 the ability to process and enact a series of thoughts and actions in an\neffective way -\u00a0 has never been a strong\npoint for G. This fall, his already low levels of EF took a major dive. \n\n\n\nSo did his grades \u2013 his ABCs, if you will. \n\n\n\nThe way I see it, these acronyms and what they\nrepresent in my G (and others) are all intimately connected: Each person has a\ngiven amount of energy. When it takes More\nenergy just to function socially, resources\navailable for other aspects diminish.\n\n\n\nI figure there\u2019s only so much G to go around,\nand, currently, it\u2019s almost entirely being utilized in this area of Social Skills\n-- which has been a lifelong challenge for him. \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013 Allocation of Energy Pie Chart \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's enjoying seventh grade (?!) \u00a0\u2013 and \u201cextremely popular.\u201d I should note that\nfrom what I can see and from what G tells me (limited!) this all seems to be\nhappening on G\u2019s terms, that is to say he is popular and liked For Himself, the\u00a0quirky and brave kid\nthat he is [sniff!]. \u00a0Given this turn of\nevents, I pooh-pooh EF and the desire for As (\u2026and Bs\u2026).\n\n\n\nFor now.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thesensoryspectrum.com/", "http://www.thejennyevolution.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AbJ-7H6E8sA/VIXpMWOt9mI/AAAAAAAAAlA/BcsfQiM5HnA/s1600/energy%2Bpie.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KXUUPH9gf9M/VIcNeHCa8KI/AAAAAAAAAlY/JHLkl8UK1eo/s1600/SensoryBlogHop%2B(1).jpg", "http://new.inlinkz.com/luwpview.php?id=465882"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/12/spd-asd-abc-defd.html", "title": "\nSPD, ASD, ABC, DEFD....\n"},

I had one such experience this\nsummer, and it was one of the most painful of my life. I haven\u2019t been up to\nwriting about it yet, and so will just say that I removed and protected G from\na discriminatory situation and called the institution out on its very large mistakes\nin handling the whole situation. It took me a long time to get results, and I\nhad to go to the board because the administration itself was astoundingly\nunresponsive, but I don\u2019t believe any other family will have to endure what we\ndid at that particular place again.\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0KEY TOOLS:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a.

I am sure many of you can relate to the agony it causes me that the more I try to fix it the worse it gets. Something funky in my blogger template?]\n\n\nThe Mixup:\n\n\nOftentimes, advocacy becomes necessary\nbecause a situation is misunderstood. People, especially children, perhaps most\nespecially those with differences - such as my autistic son, G - may have a\nhard time articulating what they are feeling or what they have experienced,\nespecially under pressure and/or with authority figures. \n\n\n\nMixups may necessitate Social\nAND/OR Academic Advocacy.\n\n\n\nHere is something in this vein that\nhappened this fall: G got suspended from his school-sponsored after-school\nactivity for punching two boys. It seemed to the school like he was the \u201cbad\nguy\u201d in the interaction, in both the phone call and the serious letter I\nreceived. \n\n\n\nBut I know my son. He\u2019d NEVER been\nviolent before. So I asked him some key questions, you know, starting with a\nsimple \u201cWhat happened?\u201d It emerged that these two boys had been teasing him for\nthe last few weeks and he\u2019d finally lost it at the moment when one of the boys was\nwriting \u201c[G] is a blundering idiot\u201d on the blackboard. \n\n\n\nI remembered that he\u2019d told me some\nkids were teasing him, but hadn\u2019t felt it warranted a talk with the teacher\nsince G hadn\u2019t seemed to be very upset\nand I assumed he would handle it himself with the IGNORE method we often\ndiscuss\u2026Over the week in question, the teasing had crossed the line over into\nbullying. The leader of this after school activity \u2013 who, it turned out, was a high school student \u2013 had clearly been\nin over his head with this bunch of zany boys playing Pathfinders (for my\nfellow old fogies, that\u2019s basically the new version of Dungeons & Dragons).\n\n\n\nSO, what I did: I wrote the head of\nthe program as well as the school principal and vice-principal explaining my\nchild\u2019s perspective and giving them some context. I acknowledged that hitting\nis never, ever acceptable and assured them that I supported their stance on\nviolence and would speak firmly with G. But I also I asked that the other\nchildren be spoken to as well, and possibly suspended from that same activity for\ntheir bullying behavior. I asked that they ALL recognize that this was not a\nsituation where a violent kid bullied others, but one in which a non-violent\nkid was pushed too far for too long. I think they got it, but only after my G\nhad been labeled as violent and suspended from the program, which did have some\nimpact on him.\u00a0 However, with Mixups,\nthere\u2019s always that initial\u2026Mixup. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a different example: G was\nfailing math, his best subject, this fall. I worked with the teacher and with G\nand we were able to figure out that he was doing\nhis assignments but not turning them in.\n\u00a0We adapted his homework assignment\nprotocol to include turning things in immediately upon completion rather than\nwaiting until the next class. Mixups usually have solutions\u2026if people will\nspeak out \u2013 and listen!\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0KEY TOOLS:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Detective Work: \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a.

It was a\ndoozy \u2013 but those of us who were on the kid\u2019s team won. In my experience, the\nmost common and daunting obstacles to students receiving the help they need are\nbudgetary. Schools are required to \u201cprovide\na free and appropriate public education\u201d to all students. Those who don\u2019t fit\nthe cookie-cutter mold of the average student (and I would argue that\npercentage is very high) are harder\nto educate because they require Individualized Education, which is more costly!\nA formal IEP (Individualized Education Plan) obviously costs districts much\nmore than warehousing \u201caverage,\u201d \u201cnormal\u201d students with one-size-fits-all\nteaching. \u00a0So, naturally, they want to \u2013\nor HAVE TO - minimize the proportion of students served thereby.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t\nencounter people who want the best for a given student.

{"date": "Friday, February 27, 2015", "body": "\n\nDoes anybody else obsess over self-driven cars?\n\n\n\nOne of the battles I am most loath to contemplate is that\nwith my son over driving. \u00a0As focused as\nG can be, he may be easily distracted, especially in unpredictable environments\n-- and his judgment and sense are \u201cstill developing.\u201d\u00a0 If those self-driven cars could just hurry up\nand become available and affordable, I could sidestep the whole thing!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of other battles we are fighting here and\nnow, though, reducing the free time I have to think about future technological\ndevelopments. I do this particular yearly list because it\u2019s a handy format to\nshare some insights from the last year\u2019s struggles. While there have been a\nnumber of individuals and institutions that the Full Spectrums might\u2019ve\nconsidered deserving of a nice smack with the hateball bat this year, I am going\nto stick with the positive, dedicating this post as usual to stuff you can try at home. \n\n\n\nThe critical differences between my children \u2013 my son is\nautistic, socially-awkward and very open-hearted; my daughter was adopted from\nchina and has an attachment disorder; she is very savvy, and kind of a tough\ncookie \u2013 necessitate a lot of soul-searching in terms of how to best parent\neach/both. Parenting these two very distinct persons may (best case scenario) help\nme see what sorts of parenting strategies might work with a variety of\nchildren. \n\n\n\nHere are some battle-choosing tips for my FULL spectrum:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BOTH\nchildren benefit from Tackling One Task or Trait at a Time. I have found\nit\u2019s better to monitor/learn something specific\nlike \u201cmaking the bed\u201d over a more broad category such as \u201cneatness.\u201d The way\nthat I CHOOSE which tasks or traits are addressed rests on which skills and\ntraits will be most necessary to their lives as they grow up. With G, my\nchoices tend toward practical skills and self-disciplines that will allow him\nto live independently; with Z, I tend to focus on skills and traits that\nencourage her to \u201cgrow the good,\u201d to feel safe and secure enough to be kind and\ngenerous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Try\nto) Be Consistent and Patient. Once you\u2019ve chosen a battle, stick with it.\nIt can take a loooooong time for habits to become ingrained. I am still working\nwith G on \u201cmaking bed,\u201d while with Z it took a few days. Consistency is key \u2013\nand a challenge to maintain on top of everything else\u2026\n\n\n\nIf you are like me, you get\nt-i-r-e-d. Sometimes you may need to take a break from enforcement and get back\nto it once you\u2019ve recharged. You\u2019ll know pretty quickly whether you\u2019ve been at\nit long enough for something to become a true habit when you start that break. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Find\nthe Right Reward. Z\u2019s pretty easy: food. For a long time I was using\n\u201ccommon sense points\u201d for G and \u201cgoodness points\u2019 for Z, and when they reached\na certain number they got to choose a reward. This worked really well with G --\nso well that he chose to stop doing it \u201cbecause I have so much common sense\nnow.\u201d But it was, I think, a little too vague for Z, who never seemed to get\nabove 10, anyway. So now we have malted milk balls that Z gets when she listens\nin school: \u00a0Specific Goal (see 1) and the\nRight Reward (3). For G, gum and screen time are enticing rewards; he has a lot\nof Specifics to work on, though and I haven\u2019t been as Consistent as I should\u2026\n\n\n\n(Oh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026was that new-mama-ME\nwho vowed she would \u201cnever bribe her kids\u201d??? Welcome to reality, my old\nfriend.) \n\n\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assuming\nyou\u2019ve truly chosen worthwhile battles, you\u2019ll want to eventually find ways to\nmake the battles you are trying to choose for your kids become Their Own.\nTransfer control to them eventually so that you won\u2019t have to do whatever it is\n(making bed) or remind them of it (be kind!) FOREVER. \n\n\n\nI see autonomy as an ultimate goal\nand challenge for G, since his neurology can make basic daily tasks a struggle (mostly\nin terms of simply remembering to do them).\n\u00a0So a big goal and challenge for me, then, is to help him see why he should and how he can take on practical skills. \u00a0\n\n\n\nHelping Z develop her superego\n(that part of the self that has a conscience and promotes pro-social, ethical\nbehavior), so that she will be kind and honest when I am not monitoring her, is\nalso an \u201congoing process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nlast battle is not a FULL spectrum issue, as Z is a voracious and completely\nun-picky eater. But G, as with many people on the spectrum and/or with sensory\nprocessing differences, would prefer to \u201clive\u201d on a diet consisting entirely of\nwhite, sweet, bland food. \n\n\n\nSo, here are the Food Battles We\nChoose:\n\n\n\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u201cOne \u2018No\u2019 Rule:\u201d G is allowed to refuse one\nitem at each meal. \n\n\n\nBecause he is by far the pickiest\neater in the house, and the rest of us tend to eat all sorts of things, this\nseems reasonable. \u00a0On a given night, I\nmay find myself picking spicy greens out of the mesclun, mushrooms out of the\nrice, eggplant out of the relish\u2026 before even presenting Himself with His\ndinner. Egg-zaust-ing. Now I allow one choice of a food that will not be on his\nplate; the rest is up to him as below:\n\n\n\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u201cOne Bite Rule\u201d is the perfect corollary to\n5.a. Sometimes it means at the very least that all the remaining foods offered\nwill be tried, however reluctantly\u2026Sometimes it actually leads to a changed\nopinion: one time, I made G try the romanesco cauliflower which had been his\nexpected \u201cno\u201d choice and then, having decided he liked that better than\nexpected, he chose not to eat the cooked bok choy. \n\n\n\nFascinating, I know, but the \u201cOne\nBite Rule\u201d does sometimes create such mini-revelations.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing up, the next Sensory Blog Hop plus\u2026 what you have all\nbeen waiting for!\u2026the most popular, putrid post of the year! : THE COMPLAINT\nDEPARTMENT! FSM has been a smidge behind the ball these last few weeks and is\nvery much still accepting last minute complaints at jineffable@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/02/second-anniversary-lists-iii-choosing.html", "title": "\nThird Anniversary Lists III: Choosing your Battles  \n"},

Oh \u2013 and your daughters are going to be VERY SPICY!\u201d \n\n\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know so much about how little Ashley, Brooke\nand Jade turned out\u2026And from what little I know they seemed to be coming along\nquite mildly\u2026But I can assure you that Z [whose original Chinese name we kept]\nis most decidedly \u201cspicy.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe other day, she asked me, \u201cMama, why am I still so angry from\nbeing in an orphanage when that was so long ago?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI think part of it is that you are a really smart kid, who\nhad a lot of feelings even at a very young age,\u201d I told her, \u201cand I think part\nof it is that you naturally have a strong temper!\u201d\n\n\n\nAs with autism, if you\u2019ve met one kid with an attachment\ndisorder, you\u2019ve met one kid with an attachment disorder. My Z would probably have\nbeen \u201cspicy\u201d no matter how she grew up. Still, some things tend to be shared by\npeople who have attachment disorders, such as certain types of behavioral issues\nthat may be otherwise uncommon. Attachment disorders in children often\nnecessitate therapeutic parenting, which looks very different from \u201cnormal\u201d\nparenting -- and was, for the Full Spectrums, a MAJOR revelation.\u00a0 I\u2019ve written every year on this specific\ntopic to share our experiences and what we\u2019ve learned. Here are the past two\nposts on this subject: \n\n\n\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html\n\n\n\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/01/second-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some details on the three main strategies for attachment disorders\nthat I have tried over the past year, restoring omniscience, channeling and\nventing:\n\n\n\n\n\nRE-ESTABLISHING OMNISCIENCE\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the importance of this strategy, I offer this anecdote: \n\n\n\nFull Spectrum Mama, having found Z in\npossession of something of questionable origin (i.e. not from known source and\nnever seen before by FSM): \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\n\n\nFull Spectrum daughter, Z: \u201cIn my room.\u201d\n\n\n\nFSM: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never seen it before. So I am\nasking you where it came from.\u201d\n\n\n\nZ: [Blank.]\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that moment when your kid realizes you\nDon\u2019t Know Everything. That moment gets more loaded when your child has an\nattachment disorder and the typical attachment disordered tendency\nto\u2026appropriate things. LOTS of things. \n\n\n\nThe worst part of the blank non-reponse is, as\nseveral loved ones noted: Why not a\nbetter story? Something along the lines of \u201cSomeone gave it to me,\u201d or, \u201cI\nwon it at school.\u201d \n\n\n\nWhy not? Because\nI don\u2019t even merit that! Anyway, she\u2019s known for some time that if she gets\ntoo specific, her story may be refuted (see, most recently, new rhinestone\nhair-doodad collection, courtesy of \u201cAyi Fern\u201d\u2026\u201dNo! Full Spectrum Grandmother!\u201d...\u201dNo\u2026\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nHence; \u201cIn my room.\u201d\n\n\n\nBack in the day when I could be convincing in\nmy omniscience I was able to coax the truth out of Z. Then we could make things\nright by returning things whence they came and making amends. I would say, \u201cIn\nfive minutes, I will give you a chance to tell the truth about that,\u201d and, in\nfive minutes, she would. Then we would figure out a solution.\n\n\n\nWe are entering a new realm now. \n\n\n\nI have only one hope for a way out without\ngetting professional help: RESTORE OMNISCIENCE. Just today, Z asked me, \u201cMama,\ncan you fry stewed meat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy on earth would you ask me that? You know I\nam vegetarian\u2026Oh, wait\u2026because I\u2026know\neverything?\u201d \n\n\n\nThe response was something between an eye roll\nand a nod. \n\n\n\nSigh. I\u2019ll be\u2026in my room.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s say OMNISCIENCE isn\u2019t happening right\nnow. What are some alternatives? \n\n\n\n\n\nCHANNELING\n\n\nThis may be a bit trial-and-error, but I have\nfound that CHANNELLING disordered behaviors, especially compulsive ones, can be\nvery effective. The idea with channeling is to replace a disordered activity\nwith something more healthy and pro-social. You may have to try a bunch of\nalternatives before you hit upon one that works, or you may just get lucky! I\nwrote about one major 2014 success in WADS.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nVENTING\n\n\nNot long ago, Z was on an extended tear of\n\u201czesty\u201d behavior: constantly testing, pushing, on edge\u2026Having some experience\nwith these cycles, I was able to keep her adequately on point, but only barely\n\u2013 and it was exhausting. As I have written in previous posts on this subject,\nboundaries are key; as I learned from our therapist, who specializes in\nattachment disorders, even small boundaries must be held in order to keep\nattachment disordered fears in check. So basically I have to be holding my\nground on every little thing as she, typically, gets increasingly relentless\u2026It\u2019s\nnot the most pleasant scenario. \n\n\n\nAnyway, after a few weeks where I could sense Z\nwas struggling quite a bit with something, she got angry (I don\u2019t even remember\nwhat about) and stomped her foot and had the most comical expression on her\nface that I laughed when I looked at her. She became furious and stomped up to\nher room where she began to rage and throw and break things and scream\nceaselessly for some time. After which she emerged, apologized, and has\nremained pleasant ever since. \n\n\n\nI am not trying to advise you to send your\nchild around the bend by teasing \u2013 which I did NOT mean to do! \u2013 just\nadvocating for the occasional recognition of a tantrum as, perhaps somewhat paradoxically,\na potential healing tool. The occasional VENTING session can be extraordinarily\ncathartic. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext in the Anniversary Lists Series: Choosing Your\nBattles!!!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\n\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/01/third-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html", "title": "\nThird Anniversary Lists II: Attachment Disorders\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2015", "body": "\n\nIn Booty Crumbs I,\nwhich was mostly about how some of us notice certain things a LOT, there was a discussion\nin the comments about how hard it can be to get some kids with sensory processing differences to notice Crumbs (boogers,\ndribbles\u2026), on their faces and elsewhere, under any circumstances.\n\n\n\nHygiene is a huge\nissue in the Full Spectrum household because G \n\n1. Doesn\u2019t notice schmutz, or \n\n2. Acknowledge the necessity of basic, routine\ngrooming, \n\n3. Doesn\u2019t care about either, and \n\n4. Doesn\u2019t have great executive function and so\nforgets even with multiple \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 reminders.\n\n\n\nBottom line, G\ndoesn\u2019t give a rip \u2013 and getting him to do stuff like wash his face in the\nmorning or clean giant glops of food off his fingers could be a full time job.\n\n\n\nI worry about this for\ntwo reasons. First, I fear it threatens his hard-won social belonging. Second,\nit is part of the underlying sensory overwhelm that G experiences in many\ncontexts \u2013 what the Asperger Experts call \u201cdefense mode.\u201d G\u2019s general awareness of how/what he feels \u2013 physically, emotionally -- can be\nundermined by an underlying overabundance of sensory and emotional\ninformation.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBefore I was aware\nof how certain experiences and environments affect me, I would feel anxious,\ndesperate, dull, angry, numb \u2013 and I\u2019d have no idea why I felt that way, and\nvery few resources to quell these inner (for me \u2013 others may tend to lash out) storms\u2026I\nnow know this phenomena is known as a MELTDOWN. Things like unrelenting social\ninteractions, feeling cold or, yes, Booty Crumbs, can trigger overload in me\nand lead to a wide range of negative feelings that are too big to process\nunless I am able to remember at that moment why I am having the feelings. I am\nlearning to find environments that better support my neurology \u2013 and to take\nsensory breaks when that is not possible. \u00a0\n\n\n\nSeeing the\ndifferences in G\u2019s awareness and demeanor in different contexts has shown me\nthat he is intensely affected by his environment. That sometimes means that he\ndoesn\u2019t have the attention or mental space for noticing stuff on his body, or\ndoing things to keep his body \u201cpresentable.\u201d Just as I\u2019ve begun to address my\nown sensory and neurological needs, what it might take to create a context for\nmy son in which he is willing and able to attend to his own hygiene routine and\ngeneral bodily cleanliness without so much effort on my part? \n\n\n\nJust the other\nnight, I asked G if he had brushed his teeth. \n\n\n\nHe said he had. \n\n\n\nI felt his\ntoothbrush: bone dry! \n\n\n\nHaving spent\nseveral minutes brushing our teeth together morning and night for the last few years (since the dentist told me this\nwas non-negotiable if G wanted to \u201chave teeth\u201d), and having each of those times\npainstakingly wrangled him into participating, letting G self-regulate on tooth\nbrushing has been a big leap forward. \n\n\n\nI was \u2013 maybe I was\nlacking perspective but \u2013 devastated\u2026and mad: \u201cDon\u2019t you realize you could die???? If your teeth are rotten and\nyou don\u2019t take care of your mouth you will get diseases! And you will NOT be\nhandsome!\u201d \n\n\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\nneeded to go meditate. (Since G was a baby who needed a lot of support in going\nto sleep, I\u2019ve tried to practice meditating nearby \u2013 usually in the hall\noutside our bedrooms -- after bedtime. Note: this does not always happen as\nplanned!) \u00a0\n\n\n\nG walked into the\nhallway where I sat, then into the bathroom to brush his teeth.\n\n\n\nAfter a few\nmoments, I saw this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013 The\nSideways, and Therefore \u201cInvisible,\u201d\nSneaky Peek\n\n\n\nHe saw me seeing\nhim: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure II \u2013 The Seething\nMeditator\n\n\n\n\u2026and went back to\nbrushing his teeth.\n\n\n\nHow does tooth\nbrushing relate to Booty Crumbs? Well, in both cases, is constant vigilance the\nanswer? Already, with one kid with an attachment disorder, I have to watch the\nevery move of one person in our home. With G, I\u2019ve tried charts, lists, points\u2026and\nam beginning to conclude that these are not the solution.\n\n\n\nMy own experience\nshows that -- for those of us with sensory processing differences -- self-awareness\n(emotional, social, physical\u2026) may have more to do with finding ways to\nmodulate one\u2019s overall sensory and neurological situation than with the rote\nlearning of ways to manage schmutz. I am in a place now where I am just very\nmuch hoping that somewhere in his own particular developmental process he/we\nwill create the mental/physical space in which it becomes possible to note the\nintrinsic value of Booty Crumb removal. \n\n\n\nFor now, though, it\u2019s\nback to brushing our teeth together.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aspergerexperts.com/misc/3-simple-secrets-to-getting-your-child-out-of-defense-mode/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WPWe84QEoV8/VSv-Aif3IzI/AAAAAAAAArM/j4lAiPwlI3c/s1600/fsminvisible.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--UgiWuOUKvU/VSv-JwL_QjI/AAAAAAAAArU/zhFq9Mx7NF0/s1600/fsmseethingm.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OWkeMzzJ9U8/VSv-ZRtN1gI/AAAAAAAAArc/Ce8i6pFdZ7s/s1600/SensoryBlogHop%2B(1).jpg", "http://new.inlinkz.com/view.php?id=504502"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/04/booty-crumbs-ii.html", "title": "\nBOOTY CRUMBS II\n"},

I was particularly moved to join the \u201cI Don\u2019t Need a Cure\u201d gang because\nof having used these very words to my son (before hearing about the\nblog) just a few weeks ago:\n\n\n\nMy son G and I were\nhiking up a local, kid-friendly mountain with the rest of the Full Spectrums --\nmy Pardner and Z, my daughter. I noticed G\u2019s extremely rosy red cheeks and I\nknew he was feeling drained. \n\n\n\nI remembered having\nthose same red cheeks. I remembered how, as a child, everything seemed harder\nfor me \u2013 not just the social stuff (!), but physical stuff like biking or\nrunning. I would get very red and work very hard when other people just coasted\nalong or put in a reasonable (non-grueling, -agonizing) effort... \n\n\n\nI would try to tell\ngrown-ups how hard I was trying, but they thought I was lazy or out of shape. I\nhad what I now know was low muscle tone, and sensory processing differences\nthat made it super-challenging for me to follow team play. I know it NOW because\nMY normal course of development resulted in higher, more \u201cnormal\u201d muscle tone\nlater in life, and I am now able to see very clearly that I truly was\nexperiencing challenges on a different level than others. I think I am\ngenerally a \u201cfit\u201d person now, though team sports have remained out of my\npurview (perhaps that can be attributed to a complete lack of interest on my\npart). \n\n\n\nI know many\nactivities feel harder to my son than they do to most. While my nine-year old\ndaughter virtually runs up the mountain without breaking a sweat, my 13\nyear-old son is as red as a beet, even though his general levels of fitness and\nactivity are basically the same. \n\n\n\nPerhaps the hardest\nthing for me as a child was feeling misunderstood. I\u2019ve always accepted\ndifference, even (mostly) in myself, but I\u2019ve never been able to learn to\ncountenance injustice. So I wanted to validate G\u2019s experience, and help him\nfeel understood, in part by sharing with him how he is \u201csometimes a lot like me\nas a kid.\u201d \n\n\n\nI told him that \u201cEverything\nwas harder for me, when I used to go on family bike rides or runs, or when \u2013\nthis was the worst! \u2013 my family would make me join in soccer games.\u201d\n\n\n\nI remembered how\nagonizing those times were \u2013 how exhausted I would be, how misunderstood and\nalien I would feel because I didn\u2019t enjoy the \u201cenjoyable\u201d activities my family\nshared, and because I felt like they judged me for how I felt, both physically\nand emotionally\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cI would get super\nred cheeks, just like you do! I was kinda soft, and floppier and ganglier than\nI am now. I got stronger and stronger as I grew up. I think you will too. \n\n\n\n\u201cGrowing up is a\nprocess, and everybody does it in their own way. I suspect that for you, like\nfor me, it\u2019ll take a little bit longer for some parts of your brain and body to\nget in their best shape.\u201d\n\n\n\nI explained that my\nred cheeks and difficulty keeping up came from low muscle tone, a physical\ndifference sometimes associated with neurological differences that made all my\nmuscles have to work harder. I added that it was tough for me growing up neurodivergent\nin a way that I don\u2019t think it is for him because the people around him and\nunderstand and completely, unconditionally accept him. \n\n\n\nI thought about how\nwatching my child encounter similar experiences in a very different context has\nbeen healing for me, and how grateful I am to be able to show him some aspects\nof life as a happy, healthy, self-accepting (all relative terms of course!) neurodiverse\nadult. \n\n\n\nWe walked a little\nfurther in silence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks for giving\nme asperger\u2019s and low tone, mom,\u201d he said, sounding sarcastic and resigned.\n\n\n\nI took a deep\nbreath. \u201cBuddy\u2026don\u2019t you like me? Because I like myself. And I like you too \u2013 a\nlot! It\u2019s not that I want you to be just like me, you are absolutely your own\nperson. But the things that make me a little bit different make me who I am and\nit\u2019s the same for you. You\u2019ll grow up at your own pace.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course I like\nyou, Mom,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I want to be strong.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what YOU\nwant, you\u2019ll have to work hard to be strong, maybe harder than other people.\nBut you\u2019ll get there,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI promise. You can do anything you set\nyour mind to!\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd once you do get\nstrong, you will never forget how it felt to try that hard and succeed. You\u2019ll\nalways feel compassion for people who are having a hard time and accept and\nunderstand people who are different. Those are really good things! \n\n\n\n\u201cI like us both\njust the way we are. We can grow, when we\nwant to.

{"date": "Friday, May 29, 2015", "body": "\n\nUm...warning: You\nmight not want to read this if you are new to yoga.\n\n\n\nFor nine years I\nwas a yoga teacher, co-owning and co-directing yoga centers in New York City\u2019s\nEast Village and New England with my ex-husband. For a variety of reasons, I\ncame to dislike that world. My neurology leans toward the literal -- and black\nand white distinctions -- and I was chronically unable to reconcile what I saw\nas rampant hypocrisy by yogis, especially yoga teachers (not to mention yoga\nstudio owners!), with the practice and philosophy of yoga. I came to feel that\npeople in the \u201cyoga community\u201d \u2013 most egregiously those in positions of authority\n-- often used what they knew of yoga philosophy to justify their actions: cruel\nactions were \u201cawakening people to their own egos,\u201d greed was \u201cremoving other\npeople\u2019s attachments,\u201d stuff like that...\n\n\n\nBut in terms of the\nteaching itself, I think my biggest obstacle came down to this: while I would\nbe saying the first part of the instruction in a sweetypoo way, I would be thinking the second part (in italics),\nlike so:\n\n\u201cFeeeeeeeel the\nbliss of being in the present moment\u2026because\nwe are all going to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nSometimes it got\nworse. Even though I liked and even loved most of my students, there would be\npairs like this:\n\n\n\n\u201cLet gratitude\nsuffuse every fiber of your being\u2026You\nknow what? You are so totally privileged to be here at 9am in the morning when\neverybody else is working or worse, and\nyet you still complain!\u201d\n\n\n\nOr:\n\n\n\n\u201cBe kind to\nyourself. Lift the corners of your mouth. Give yourself a hug\u2026.we all know that as soon as you leave this\nroom you\u2019ll pretty instantly turn right back into the total beyotch [bastahd]\nyou were before class.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I got divorced,\nI left everything but the kids behind, including the yoga center my ex and I\nhad run together for almost ten years. I haven\u2019t had the time or money to\nattend yoga classes since becoming a single then working (of the non-running\nyoga center and teaching yoga variety) mother. Instead, I\u2019ve been practicing at\nhome, which I very much enjoy on those rare occasions when I am able to make\nthe time for it. \n\n\n\nThe big news for me\nis I\u2019ve just started back to taking public yoga classes -- on a super-limited\nbasis (two classes in three months)\u2026Guess what? I am having a very hard time\nwith it! Every sweetypoo thing the sweet, sweet teacher says sounds inherently\nvapid to me, and I keep adding those dreadful non-sweet codas to the sweet\nsentences the teacher utters: \u201cNow, just let go of all those thoughts\u2026[Oh...Really? Do you think we should just be\nable to do that so easily? Have you ever actually truly suffered? Been worried about putting food on the table? Worried\nabout being harassed just for the color of your white skin?...Do your children,\nif they are lucky enough to have enough to eat, get bullied???]\u201d \n\n\n\nI know this is\ntotally unfair. I probably even sound bitter and evil! The funny thing is, the\nrest of the time \u2013 when I am not in a yoga class -- I am usually thinking\npretty kind thoughts. TRULY! Also, I know the teacher is probably sincere. \n\n\n\nYet the thoughts\nkeep popping up. It\u2019s like when someone tells you not to think about something\nand you Just. Can\u2019t. Stop.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSo, even though I\nalways secretly criticized people for viewing yoga as a physical thing, I\u2019ve\ndecided to try to just focus on the physical for now -- the breathing and the\nmovement and precise alignment of the body -- since I am clearly still disillusioned\nwith the spiritual side of the yoga world after so many years of seeing people\nnot \u201clive their yoga.\u201d \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a tradition\nof practicing silence in yoga known as Mauna. With Mauna, one practices clearing\nthe brain and mouth of chatter, bringing clarity and peace and spaciousness to\nlife. I\u2019ve actually gone on Mauna retreats (back in a very different reality)\nand loved them. But for now, I am just trying to be as mentally and\nphilosophically silent as I can in my practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this have\nto do with the Full Spectrums? Recently G has been getting up to no good at\nschool. Being sneaky and lying about assignments to avoid the whole new academic\nsuccess program we have him on. So that he doesn\u2019t fail out of 7th\ngrade? (That\u2019s another post). And Z has been up to some of her old RAD* tricks\ntoo.\n\n\n\nAs I revisit the\nwhole sweetypoo yoga thing, it occurs to me that I am a talkative, and, yes, sweetypoo\nmom. Despite my ramblings herein and my scoldings to them, I always think my\nkids are fundamentally perfect and am prone to telling them so. And G\u2019s\nteachers and the ex, even Pardner, are sometimes incredulous about my inability\nto really see and accept the more trifling aspects of G\u2019s behavior and/or character.\nZ is better at \u201cpassing\u201d for healthy outside of the home, and hiding her\nbehaviors, but she, too, could improve her act at school and at home.\n\n\n\nIt occurs to me\nthat the kids are \u2013 consciously or not \u2013 adding on to the exchanges we have.\nClearly, I am not always getting through to them, as evinced by their actions,\neye rolls, &c. -- and perhaps it\u2019s because there\u2019s too much sweetypoo talk!\nHere, the italics are their add-ins: \n\n\n\nTypical\npraise-fest:\n\n\n\nMe to G: \u201cWonderful\nJunior, I just can\u2019t believe how much I love you!...Mmm hmm, that\u2019s because you\u2019re my mother.\u201d\n\n\n\nMe to Z: \u201cMy very\nown darling daughter! You are so fun to have special time with!...Give me more sugary treats now!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, too, it gets\nworse, especially with my \u201cfamous\u201d advice:\n\n\n\nMe: \u201c[G], make sure\nyou remember that if someone is mean to you it is because they are hurting\ninside...blah blah blah. Heard this\nbefore.\u201d\n\nG: Yes, Mom...yeah right\u201d\n\n\n\nMe: \u201c[Z], always,\nalways listen to your teacher!\u201d\n\nZ: \u201cSure Mom...except when you\u2019re not around...\u201d\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s my\nfifteenth philosophical exhortation or admonishment for the day, what should I\nexpect? \n\n\n\nOTOH both children\ntruly are happy most of the time, and seem to be on the right track in most\nareas. They\u2019ve been told enough times which fork to use, and when to say please\nand thank you, and to wipe, wipe, wipe....At a certain point the ball is in\ntheir court, right? So I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time for me to can it a little bit\nwith the yapping. Dare I say...Let go a little? \n\n\n\nYou see, the second\nhalves of my yoga sentences above are true. People who get into yoga are\nusually looking for healing on some level, and they are flawed and broken just\nlike the rest of humanity. Perhaps many yogis are seeking because they are more hurt, broken and flawed than the\naverage person. And then yogic practices can take some time \u2013 not hours or days,\nbut years, even lifetimes - to be effective. So teachers and students alike aim\nwith their sweetypoo words toward what they hope is true...yet we do not\nnecessarily live that truth in all our thoughts and actions. \n\n\n\nThe first parts of\nmy yoga sentences above are sweet...and potentially insipid; the second parts\nare ugly...and real. Same with what\u2019s going on with my children\u2019s sentences. And\nI want to change that. Call it Parental Mauna: I want to try to be more mentally/philosophically/verbally\nfrugal (silence being impossible for the obvious reasons) as I can in my\npractice of parenting.\n\n\n\nSo here\u2019s my PLAN:\n\n\n\nLess talking, more showing. \n\n\n\nIdeally, less thinking.\n\n\n\nMore listening.\n\n\n\nIn place of lavish praise - more hugging.\n\n\n\nKeep it simple. \n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see if they\nnotice.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. Dear readers,\nfeel free to share your own such sentences in the comments section below! I\nwould LOVE to hear them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*RAD=Reactive\nAttachment Disorder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/05/sweetypoo.html", "title": "\nSWEETYPOO\n"},

So that when you wake up first thing in the morning and think \u201cI can\u2019t do\nthis day,\u201d or when you get that precious three minutes where you sit on the\ntoilet ALONE pretending to poop, you can take the book in your hands and Sugar\ncan be your oracle and give you exactly what you need to open the bathroom door\nand emerge human and more whole just by\nopening up the book and reading?\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf not Dear Sugar, what is your DEAR? What\nshows you TRUTH, on a bed of laughter, with a chiffonade of tears? HOPE,\nwrapped in brutal honesty, with a core of sweet, sweet love? PERSPECTIVE,\nnestled in a can of whoop-as$, with a side of I-get-it-though?\n\n\n\nIdeally, everybody should\nhave something like this, a tiny escape-comfort that is always there when needed.\nMaybe for you it\u2019s music, or cooking, or...? Books have always been that thing\nfor me, as they are for my son. Even at parties.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was recently\ninvited by a Very Big Deal Agent to write a book proposal for her agency. I am\nstill struggling with the requirements of the proposal, above all, the\nselling-of-self. But I think that very quality of being there for others in a\nvery honest way makes this writing worthwhile, and makes a book a valid\nproposition for this blog. So I am doing my best to get it done. \n\n\n\nAt the same time,\nsummer is looming. I see people posting on facebook about how they \u201ccan\u2019t wait,\u201d\nand I try to share their enthusiasm, and heaven knows I want my children to\nhave those idyllic summers of which people speak, but\u2014but...: I\u2019ve never had a\nchance to not be working in the summer, which makes things sometimes quite\nrough. This year I at least had the foresight to coordinate what few camps the\nkids attend (hey, both kids in camp during\nthe same week: my big insight from summer 2014!), so that I will have some\ntime to work while both kids are having summer fun. (Have people noticed that\ncamp often costs more than one can earn? What\u2019s up with that?) \n\n\n\nLike so many of us,\nI also hope that I too will get some glimpses of summer fun. That during the\ntimes when I am with my kids, I will actually be with my precious kids, rather\nthan being physically present while mentally worrying constantly about keeping\nus afloat or getting other stuff done, such as The Proposal. I guess that would\nbe a form of practicing mindfulness. \n\n\n\nEver wonder,\nthough, why it\u2019s so hard to remember to be mindful? Perhaps it\u2019s because one\u2019s mind is...full? In those full-brain and heavy-heart moments (big and small), I\nknow Sugar will help. Mostly, she\u2019ll remind me that it\u2019s on me to make things right, to feed the\ngood wolf, to see clearly and be present and not take things personally.\nBasically, you know, to be mindful. But she says it in a way that I can really\nhear, my dear, dear Sugar does.\n\n\n\nWell, my friends, I\nam heading out now for the last-day/half-day* pickup rounds. Here\u2019s wishing you\nplenty of whatever Sugar-esque entity feeds your soul this season and beyond.\nSummer...starts...NOW!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Wee tad of a rip-off there?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Beautiful-Things-Advice-Sugar/dp/0307949338"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/06/sugar-dear.html", "title": "\nSUGAR, DEAR\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 19, 2015", "body": "\n\nWelcome to the Complainable COMPLAINTS of 2015. I am your\nguest host of this blog post, Partial/incomplete Monochrome Persona, or PiMP.\nFull Spectrum Mama usually takes the free time afforded her by my guest posts\nto sleep and grade and eat the necessary chocolate to prepare to teach long,\nhopefully non-boring philosophy lectures travel to exotic locales where she\ncombines saintly deeds with sybaritic indulgences. So here we are, just you and\nme, dear reader\u2026ready?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost a year ago, following 2014\u2019s COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT,\nPiMP got a COMPLAINT for apologizing to a Complainant about something cruddy in\ntheir life. This Complainant argued\nthat such soothing and comforting hogwash was not PiMP\u2019s way and I agree. Here,\nCOMPLAINTS are about being heard -- not being answered sweetly \u00a0or fixed, especially when THE COMPLAINT\nDEPARTMENT (TCD) is only officially open one day a year (on the 32nd\nof Nevruary).\n\n\n\nThis year, your COMPLAINTS are all jumbled together, from\npathos to bathos, giggles to grumpers, from COMPLAINTS about difference to\nCOMPLAINTS about conformity to COMPLAINTS about, well, shopping\u2026\n\n\n\nWe accept ALL acceptable COMPLAINTS here at TCD, and then we\nCOMPLAIN them; although sometimes, people, you should stop flapping at the jib in public.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS\n\n\n\n* Let us begin with a deceptively innocuous COMPLAINT from FSM herself, who has shared\nmany of her COMPLAINTS in previous posts, although she is saving up some\ndoozies: I could be doing any kind of housework and the kids are nowhere to be\nseen but the instant I reach into my\nsecret [medically-necessary] candy stash\u00a0\n-- \u201cWhat are you doing, mom?\u201d \u2013 here they come!\n\n\n\n* My complaint is I am too overly busy to complain.\n\n\n\n* Online adoption groups that act all surprised that people\nare curious about inter-racial families.\n\n\n\n* This. Winter. \n\n\n\n* In dealing with the oh so numerous challenges of adult\nlife (single parenting, chronic illness, work stress, etc.), as the parent of a\nchild on the spectrum, I am held to an absurdly high standard.\u00a0 Spectrum-y kids use their parents as a\nbarometer, often co-regulating off of us, so we can never, ever lose it, or\neven falter a little, without throwing a wrench into an already challenging\nsituation.\n\n(NB: Neither Full Spectrum Mama nor PiMP wrote the above\nCOMPLAINT?!) \n\n\n\n\u00a0* Some special angel who has a son with Sensory Processing\nDifferences sent PiMP an entire LIST of COMPLAINTS \u2013 MWAH!\n\n\n\nComplaint #1: I HATE that he bites his hand. It drives me\nCRAZY!!!\n\nComplaint #2: I HATE that he hits our puppy when he gets mad\nat her. She is a puppy and when she chews on something of his or tries to steal\nhis food, he hits her causing her to go into attack mode.\n\nComplaint #3: I HATE that he jumps up and down, biting his\nhand and holding onto his sister's head. Oh...and she hates that too.\n\nComplaint #4: I HATE that we have no OT services in our area\nand have to try and make time to do all of it at home (except for the 30\nminutes per week through the school district).\n\nComplaint #5: I HATE how I feel like I am ridiculed for my\nparenting skills.\n\nComplaint #6: I HATE unsolicited advice.\n\nComplaint #7: My biggest complaint is that I still don't\nknow or completely understand all of his triggers and what will send him into\nmeltdown mode.\n\n\n\n* My biggest complaint is the school system in ignoring\nundiagnosed children who have obvious learning disabilities, and blowing them\noff\n\n\n\n* Family/\"Family\"\n\n\n\n* Competitive Parenting\n\n\n\n* The magnetic force that draws children/husbands toward\ntheir mother/wife when said mother/wife most wants to be alone.\n\n\n\n* The crust that forms on maple syrup bottles after a few\nweeks and makes it impossible to close the cap all the way.\n\n\n\n* Not having time to head outside to enjoy that\nheartachingly beautiful hour between 2-3pm on a sunny winter afternoon.\n\n\n\n* Not being able to prevent pine needles from getting\neverywhere when you take the Christmas tree out, and having to do it anyway.\n\n\n\n* Mucus. The sidewalks and stairs to and from my workplace,\nrestaurants and shopping areas are all dappled with glistening puddles of sluggy\noysters in such concentration that it's nearly impossible to preserve ones\nshoes.\u00a0 Men of the earth:\u00a0 it should not be news that this makes you\nmore a vector of viral plague than a testosterone bomb.\u00a0 I am not convinced of your genetic\nsuperiority by the volume of sputum you produce.\u00a0 Furthermore, It is uncivilized to leave a\ntrail of bodily fluids in your wake.\u00a0\nPlease knock it off. Just swallow it already.\u00a0 Keep your contagion to yourself.\n\n\n\n* Husbands who are so Modern/Liberated that they don't mind their\nwives bringing in most of the income.\n\n\n\n* People who stop their cars to force you to jaywalk on\ntheir terms. Dear Driver:\u00a0 My skilled\nsense of timing was finely honed by the great city of Boston.\u00a0 I am not a squirrel.\u00a0 I need neither your permission nor your\nhelp.\u00a0 So, piss off.\u00a0 I'll cross when I feel like it.\n\n\n\n* I hate oatmeal. I hate it. Every morning. Healthy.\nDisgusting. Hate hate oatmeal.\n\n\n\n* People who say \"no problem\" instead of thank you\n, or you are welcome.\u00a0 This isn't new,\nand it is getting worse!\n\n\n\n* My son with Asperger's is just starting to understand the\nsubtleties, ups and downs, and fluidity of friendship.\u00a0 I am thrilled -- that's not my\ncomplaint.\u00a0 My complaint is that he is\nlooming on the cusp of puberty, and the rules he has worked so hard to learn\nand understand are about to start changing and shifting at a crazy fast rate. I\ndon't think he can keep up.\u00a0 Not only\nthat, but before he got the hang of friendship, he wouldn't have cared.\u00a0 The double-edged sword of helping my kid to a\nhigher functioning level is that now he will notice and care more when he is\nnot successful. \n\n\n\n* I hate it when you are paying for something and the\ncashier asks you if you would also like \"something else.\" Why would\nyou?\u00a0 Or asks u if you want to contribute\nto the supermarket charity? No I want to pay for my @/&;@$ item.\n\n\n\n* Not enough snow [flag: unacceptable COMPLAINT]\n\n\n\n* Non-stop Christmas music - \n\nAll day,\n\n24 hrs.\n\nIncluding the Salvation Army ringing the bell before Thanksgiving\nand you feel guilty because they are nice to you.\n\n\n\n* Supermarkets don't want to double bag and the managers\ncome over to tell the staff not to and the bags are thinner than ever.\n\n\n\n* Men's bathrooms run out of soap all the time and how are\nthe employees washing their hands?\n\n\n\n* Professional offices where they have the large TVs on with\nnews blaring.\n\n\n\n* When you buy newspapers and they have all the ads and\nflyers in them, or when you buy a magazine and they have all those subscription\nthings in them, and they all fall out.\n\n\n\n* Cereal boxes that are hard to open inside and you rip them\nand the cereal explodes.\n\n\n\n* I think we should find the person who invented the halogen\nheadlight for automobiles, strap him to a chair, tape his eyelids open &\nforce him to witness the birth of a star... From six feet away.\u00a0 Because that's what my drive home is like.\n\n\n\n* Having my early morning time (that I only take once in a\nblue moon) invaded by breakfast needing children would certainly be high on the\nlist if I was compiling it today.\n\n\n\n* Parenting a special needs child can put a hell of a lot of\nstrain on a romantic relationship.\u00a0 Mine\ndidn't survive it (the relationship, I mean -- the kid is thriving).\u00a0 Undoubtedly, there were other reasons the\nrelationship fell apart, and I will never regret putting my children first, and\nparenting my children is the most important thing I have ever done -- but I\njust needed to complain about how hard on a relationship it can sometimes be to\nparent these wonderful, challenging, different kids. \n\n\n\n* My friend received her new \u201cCounty Gardens Magazine\u201d on 3/13,\nwhile I received mine several days later.\n\n\n\n* You are the only parent at every school event, every\nmeeting every everything. Your ex calls during one such event \u2013 an event you\nhave notified him of several times even though you yourself only know about it\nfrom investigation and hearsay \u2013 and leaves a message saying he just got your\nmessage and nobody ever tells him anything and so naturally he is not at said\nevent, because it is your fault. Because, you know, he is very special and\nshould be sought out and personally informed by both you and your child\u2019s\nlarge, urban school, of every event that might interest him.\n\nThen your kid asks if he can call his father, so of course\nyou say yes. He tells his father, \u201cSorry you were unable to make it. I love\nyou.\u201d And gets off the phone. Then your kid says, \u201cIsn\u2019t dad awesome?\u201d And you\ncrack: \u201cYou know who\u2019s awesome?\u201d you say, \u201cthe person who drives you\neverywhere, who attends every event you have ever been part of, every meeting,\nevery school supply trip, every, everything. And you know who else is awesome? the\nkid who forgives someone who lets him down! THAT is who is awesome!\u201d \n\nLater, you say. \u201cYes, honey, your dad is awesome.\u201d And your\nkid says, \u201cYou used to think he was awesome, didn\u2019t you?\u201d and you say, \u201cWhen I\nmarried him I did, but\u2026and I still do. And he loves you very much.\u201d\n\n\n\n* With three sons I worry about each one having the same\nstruggles the oldest one has. It took until he was in middle school for him to\nget a diagnosis. \n\n\n\n* Dear Complaint Dept.,\n\n\n\nI have diarrhea.\u00a0 And\nI am at work.\u00a0 Every time I run to the\nloo and attempt to achieve a modicum of relief, two people walk in.\u00a0 I\u2019m outraged, bloated, embarrassed and\nlurching.\n\n\n\nThank you, \n\nCrappy Complainer\n\n\n\n* People are so in search of acceptance and approval.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes the COMPLAINTS for 2015. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s never too early to begin feeling outraged for 2016 \u2013 so\nbear in mind that while TCD is rarely open per\nse, COMPLAINTS are always being reviewed for possible acceptability at jineffable@gmail.com. \n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nPartial/incomplete Monochrome Persona\n\nFactotum, THE COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT\n\n\nGuest writer/Troubleshooter @ Full Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["mailto:jineffable@gmail.com"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/03/third-anniversary-lists-iv-complaint.html", "title": "\nThird Anniversary Lists IV: The Complaint Department\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 9, 2015", "body": "\n\n\nMy challenges have\nalways been social\u2013neurological\u2013ethical-familial, never academic. My first encounter\nwith academic challenges came when I \u2013 in my third and final (and, finally,\nsuccessful [after a year as a runaway in the East Village]) attempt at high\nschool \u2013 landed in a struggling Quaker boarding school that accepted a lot of\nstudents with learning differences. The dean there, the man I now call \u201cDad,\u201d\nshepherded his motley crew of misfits with infinite love and respect. Students\nlike me who were fleeing troubled, if wealthy, families, were treated just the\nsame as wealthy, healthy, happy-familied students, scholarship students,\n\u201clearning-disabled\u201d students, all combinations thereof...all students, period. That is to say, equality really happened\nunder his watch.\n\n\n\nUntil I began\nraising my son, who happens to have some learning differences, I actually never\nknew that the official term for such differences is \u201clearning disability.\u201d You\nsee, Dwight, our dean and my \u201cDad,\u201d referred to students who learned\ndifferently from the \"average\" student as having...wait for it...\u201dlearning differences.\u201d And I spent most\nof my life thinking that this was how everybody\nthought about the matter. \n\n\n\nHow much did that\nlinguistic switch mean to those students, my friends, some of whom had felt\n\u201cless-than\u201d most of their lives because they didn\u2019t process and/or express\ninformation in just the same way as everybody else? You can bet it meant a great\ndeal. \n\n\n\nG\u2019s early life\ninvolved quite a lot of testing, always at the request of his teachers. I\nbegan early on to use different terms for many of the labels that were used by\nprofessionals for my son and, later, me. I\u2019ve suggested -- whenever the online\nor in-person conversation comes up -- that we use the phrase \u201cSensory\nProcessing Differences\u201d in place of\n\u201cSensory Processing Disorder,\u201d and people have generally agreed. I do\nunderstand that there are contexts in which a disability label may be more\neffective in managing our differences. However, for the sake of our selves, and\nour communities, and our children, I contend that the following labels need to\nbe changed, for daily use, if not for services and adaptations (and this is by\nno means a comprehensive list, just getting this here manifesto going!):\n\n\n\nSensory Processing\nDisorder \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sensory Processing\nDifferences\n\nAutism Spectrum\nDisorder\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Autism Spectrum\n\nAccommodations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adaptations\n\nDisability\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diffability\u00a0\n\nDisabled\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Differently-Abled \n\n\n\nYes, we are\ndifferent. That doesn\u2019t always make us fundamentally disordered or syndromed. \n\n\n\nWe are all\ndifferent. All that difference is not the same. Some of it is MUCH harder, because this world was constructed primarily\nby people who are embodied and think in \u201cnormal\u201d ways. The adaptations some\nof us may need are framed as \u201cspecial\u201d \u201cservices\u201d because of the way this world\nis designed \u2013 and for whom \u2013 NOT BECAUSE THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH US. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example I\nsee as very simple and non-loaded: because of my Sensory Processing\nDifferences, when I go into a big box store the artificial scents used in\ncleaners and scented candles etc. give me an instant migraine. Does this make\nme defective? In my humble opinion, it makes me more of a canary in a coal\nmine: Nobody should be breathing\nthose chemicals...and it\u2019s not \u201cdisordered\u201d to know so in a very visceral\nway.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAnother thing about\nlanguage: it\u2019s okay to ask! There\u2019s been so much discussion, much of it rancorous,\naround whether or not to use person-first language. How about using the\nlanguage that the person/people in question prefer/s? I, for one, aim to use\nlanguage that is respectful and egalitarian. When I speak with others, I am\nwilling to use the language they deem respectful and egalitarian, so long as it\ndoes not demean me. \n\n\n\nChanging the ways\nwe talk about difference are an important step toward healing this world so\nthat we are all included in the spectrum of equality. Although there is some\nweight to having \u201cdifferences,\u201d the word itself also implies variety and, in\nsome important ways, validity. We must continue striving to speak and write in\nways that are increasingly fair, as language evolves to better fit reality.. \n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll note I\u2019ve no\ncute rainbow graphic for this Full Spectrum manifesto.

{"date": "Monday, June 1, 2015", "body": "\n\nJust a little\nexample of PP from the Full Spectrums:\n\n\n\nPardner used to be\na dawg. Not literally, but \u2013 let\u2019s just say he spent his twenties, most of his\nthirties (there was that...brief\nfirst marriage), his forties...even the first part of his fifties, as a single, hunky, zest-for-life-filled, man-about-town\nchef who had a great appreciation for female beauty of all sorts. \n\n\n\nAnd I do mean all. \n\n\n\nWhen we first\nstarted dating, I asked him this highly original question: \u201cWhat is the most\nimportant quality you value in a woman?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFun,\u201d was his\nsimple answer.\n\n\n\nWell, I felt very\nsuperior when he said that. How trite, I thought. How superficial! And how hard\ncan it be to have fun with no kids, a thriving/rewarding/creative business,\nexcellent health, and that special freedom of the non-married to extricate\noneself from any less-fun relationship? A person who thinks fun is the most\nimportant thing must be pretty durn trifling, no?\n\n\n\nThen I got to\nthinking about it. Here I was, newly-divorced and unemployed as yet, with two\nyoung high-needs kids (neither had labels yet, but the high-needs part was Not\nSubtle). I was shattered, really, at the time. And yet there he was...into me in a big and, to him,\nvery new way. \n\n\n\nMaybe he meant\nsomething different by \u201cfun\u201d than I thought. \n\n\n\nAs we got to know\neach other, I began to see how fun actually encompasses everything I truly\nvalue in life. It dawned on me that a most precious sort of fun was our finding\na way to laugh together while courting despite my being in precarious mental,\nphysical and fiscal health. \n\n\n\nFun isn\u2019t just\neverything always being easy, lighthearted, and effortlessly sparkly all the\ntime; sometimes fun is finding the\nsparkle in the (heavyhearted, hard, crusty, messy) mud, my friends. It\u2019s choosing to giggle when you get to that\ngiggle/sob crossroad (or at least to gigglesob). As well, fun is exercising our\ninnate capacity to recognize and appreciate\nthat sparkle, that giggle...\n\n\n\nNow, we Full\nSpectrums hold FUN as our High and Sacred Family Virtue. Fun is finding a way\nto ENJOY each other\u2019s company \u2013 even just for a few minutes, even after a\ncrapola day.\u00a0 Fun is being GRATEFUL for\nthe kids you have and the family you make, whoever and however they are. \n\n\n\nYeah, this isn\u2019t\neasy all the time; heck, it\u2019s not even happening\nmost of the time. But when it is? That\u2019s\nfun. Thanks, Pardner!\n\n\n\nPositive\nparentingly,\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n#Positiveparentingday is the brainchild of the Introverted Matriarch. <3\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DmWW1U_F-tE/VWxWotPOSmI/AAAAAAAAAuw/3F7ZRs8BfPE/s1600/pos%2Bpar.jpg", "http://inneraspie.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/06/positive-parenting-fun.html", "title": "\nPOSITIVE PARENTING: FUN!\n"},

It's been all kids (and lots of fun, truly) all the time since school got out and there hasn't been a whole lot of writing time, but I did manage to pick up a \"People\" magazine today. All in the interest of research, of course.\u00a0\n\nNow I love a trashy magazine as much as the next person, maybe more, so I was stunned in my relaxing reverie to read this headline: \"Heros Among Us: Crusading Against Autism.\" Against my better judgement - I Was trying to relax! - I read this piece on, guess who, Autism Speaks. Apparently, what Autism Speaks does is \"restore the spirit and hope that autism tried to take away.\"\u00a0\n\nWith all due respect to a wide range of families and situations, I very much beg to personally differ with that assessment !\n\nI managed to quell the kiddos long enough to write this letter because I wanted to, you know, Speak:\n\n\nRe: \"Crusading Against Autism\"\nTo the Editor:\n\nAre you aware that many\u00a0autistic people are able to read? In fact, many are avid readers.\n\nAs a mother on the spectrum with an autistic son, I was deeply saddened to see this headline. I will NOT be keeping\u00a0this issue in the house, in case my dear boy, who is perfect just as he is, happens to fall upon this article. I would never, ever want him to\u00a0feel that he himself is seen\u00a0by some as something to be fought against, or someone who takes hope away.\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. [FSM]\n\n\n\nLove,\u00a0\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/07/trashy.html", "title": "\nTRASHY\n"},

THANK YOUR NOMINATOR:\n\nThank you,\nKelly Dillon. I remember the first time I fell upon your blog, I was AMAZED \u2013\nno other word \u2013 by how gifted you are as an artist and by your terrific sense\nof humor. I feel truly honored that you nominated me!\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. ANSWER THE QUESTIONS GIVEN BY THE NOMINATOR:\n\n1. Harry Potter or\nLord of the Rings?\n\nBooks\nor movies?\n\nNo\nfair. Both! If forced over a pot of boiling oil to choose I\u2019d go with the\nlatter.\n\n2. What\u2019s your\nzombie apocalypse survival tool?\n\nMy\nglasses! So I can see?\n\n3. If you could be\none animal for 24 hours, which one would you be and why?\n\nA\ncat. Oh, to be sooooo self-satisfied, and cozy!\n\n4. If you had to\nchoose between living 200 years in the past, or 200 years in the unknown\nfuture, which would you choose?\n\nThe\nfuture. Since science will surely soon find a way in time to way extend my kids\u2019\ngeneration\u2019s lifespans, I want to make sure my son is not riding motorcycles\nand my daughter is running an only partly\nevil empire, and also check that she is supporting my son in the style to which\nhe has become accustomed. I cannot choose the era you say? Bah. \n\n5. I have 5\napples, I gave one to your friend, and then I gave 3 to you. Finally, I gave\nyou 1 apple. How many chickens crossed the road?\n\n4.\n\n6. Name one food\nand one beverage to consume for the rest of your life.\n\nOOOH.\n\n\nWater\n\u2013 so dull but true. \n\nBiBimBap\n\u2013 Korean rice dish with lots of vegetables on a hot stone pot. With chocolate\nconsidered a veg.\n\n7. Number of Pixar\nmovies that made you cry?\n\nALL.\n\n8. Speaking of,\nname your most favorite Pixar movie.\n\nUp.\nIn my all-time top ten for sure!\n\n9. Respond to the\nfollowing statement:\u00a0\u201cLast\nweek, Japanese scientists explaced \u2013 placed \u2013 explosive detonators at the\nbottom of Loch Ness to blow Nessie out of the water. Sir Court Godfrey of the\nNessie Alliance summoned the help of Scotland\u2019s local wizards to cast a\nprotective spell over the lake and its local residents and all those who seek\nfor the peaceful existence of our underwater ally.\u201d\n\nShhhhh!\n\n10. Meow?\n\nMeep.\n\n\n\n\n3. NOMINATE OTHER\nBLOGGERS:\n\nAs I just this morning commented on one of these very blogs,\nwe don\u2019t always share the exact same language, beliefs, or views on life, but\nthe words of these people comfort and uplift readers, and help them to constructively\nconfront challenges and injustice nonetheless. These are the bloggers who make\nme laugh and cry and think and hope every visit. They\u2019re also extremely good looking. Please visit\nthese wonderful blogs:\n\n\n\nEating Off Plastic (Is that allowed? It would be a genuine top\nchoice!)\n\nRunaway Mama\n\nPutting Socks on Chickens\n\nTreasures in the Dust\n\nSammiches & Psych Meds\n\nContemplative Chaos\n\nStay Quirky My Friends\n\nRaising 5 Kids\u00a0\n\nChanged for Good \n\nKatherine Sanford\n\nThe Jenny Evolution\n\nStephanie Allen Crist\n\nOne Quarter Mama\n\nDays of Whine and Ros\u00e9\n\n\n\n4. CREATE TEN NEW QUESTIONS FOR YOUR NOMINEES:\n\n\n\n1. On a scale of 1-10, how seriously do you take yourself? (How\ndo you feel about that?)\n\n\n\n2. Let it go or get it done?\n\n\n\n3. All-expenses paid vacation with free and actually effective\nchildcare, where appropriate/necessary: what are the details \u2013 where, what, etc\n- for you and yours?\n\n\n\n4. What is the thing you worry about most?\n\n\n\n5. What is your favorite thing about yourself?\n\n\n\n6. Off the top of your head, what are your four best-loved\nbooks?\n\n\n\n7. Same for movies?\n\n\n\n8. Three last meals, breakfast, lunch, dinner (this includes\ndessert, duh): go! \n\n\n\n9. What do you miss from the past?\n\n\n\n10. What are you looking forward to today?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so go the four rules of THE LIEBSTER AWARD. Nominees\nare welcome to accept and pass on the award following these tenets, or to\ndecline for whatever reason, knowing they retain my undying, slobbering\nadmiration.\n\n\n\nAgain,\nhuge thanks to Kelly at Eating Off Plastic for thinking of me!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull\nSpectrum Mama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://eatingoffplastic.wordpress.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xKFVAsNnBYE/VaQAsAnJZBI/AAAAAAAAAww/8d1vSSbv0e0/s1600/liebster2.png", "https://eatingoffplastic.wordpress.com/", "https://eatingoffplastic.wordpress.com/", "http://therunawaymama.com/", "http://www.puttingsocksonchickens.com/", "http://treasuresinthedust.com/", "http://www.sammichespsychmeds.com/", "https://contemplativechaos80.wordpress.com/", "https://stayquirkymyfriends.wordpress.com/", "http://5kidswdisabilities.com/", "http://changedforgoodautism.blogspot.com/", "http://katherinesanford.com/", "http://www.thejennyevolution.com/", "http://stephanieallencrist.com/", "http://www.onequartermama.ca/", "http://daysofwhineandrose.blogspot.com/", "https://eatingoffplastic.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-liebster-award.html", "title": "\nTHE LIEBSTER AWARD\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2015", "body": "\n\nAs people and as parents some of us are lucky\nenough to have a perfectly generous level of empathy for others as well as a\nbalanced perspective on events. Others of us learn to understand others\u2019\nfeelings and have perspective on our own lives the hard way(s).\n\n\n\nLast year saw G\u2019s heretofore good grades\nplummet, but he was accepted and happy at school. It was clear that G had\nchosen, consciously or un- to put all his energies into that realm of his life\nthat had for so long been an area of suffering. For a \u201ctypical\u201d parent with an\nacademically gifted kid this would be a disastrophe but the perspective and\nexperience I\u2019ve gained (kicking and screaming) about my kid show me that a\ndecline in grades is a small price to pay for the gains he\u2019s made in confidence\nand self-esteem. \n\n\n\nBy the end of last year, G\u2019s team had begun to\nidentify effective strategies for executive function and focus in order to\nimprove his academics; and I am very much hoping we can bring more balance between\nthe social and the academic this year in 8th grade. That\u2019s going to\nbe a tall order, but at least I am only mildly terrified this year. (Sure last\nyear was a social success, but there can be so much drama in middle school, for\nmiddle-schoolers of all persuasions, and peer-group rejection is so common.) \n\n\n\nHere are two posts I wrote around this time\nlast year, in case they are of use to any readers:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\none is about my deep terrors for my son as he entered Middle School:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MIDDLESCHOOL PRAYERS\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis\none is about trying to find other kids who might be extraordinarily challenged\nentering Middle School:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0TEAM FRIENDLY FACE\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s an inspiring thought from a VERY\nWISE Dad I know and love, from his facebook page (posted with permission,\nlightly edited for anonymity); it helps me remember that I know my child and I know what he is capable of...: \n\nHappy\nbirthday to my son [name]. Apologies for this post, son, but \u201cI had to say it.\u201d\nThe year that he was age 3 I was on lecture tour. In Indiana he was the only\nblack child in childcare. After my talk a teacher said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you,\nsir, but your son is slow.\u201d The next week in New Hampshire a different\nchildcare teacher said, \u201cWow! Your son is brilliant.\u201d I\u2019d already played a significant\nrole helping parent my three much younger brothers and [name] is my second son.\nI knew he was blessed. Now he has a bachelor\u2019s from Princeton and both a Ph.D\nand J.D. from the University of Virginia. At no point did I give permission to\nsome stranger to define my child (or his 3 brothers). If you\u2019re a parent,\ngrandparent, teacher, friend... I suggest you follow the same route. You have\nto nurse greatness to find greatness.\n\n\n\nObviously, blessings and greatness come in all\nstripes and do not necessarily mean academic blessings and/or greatness, but I\nplan to nurse the academic aspect of my son better this year, along with his\ngreat heart -- and I plan to make sure the rest of his team does the same. \n\n\n\nWishing all parents and students and teachers\nand staff many blessings for a smooth transition into this next school year. People\nwho are already fully-equipped for school should not be posting that on\nfacebook and making the rest of us feel inadequate.\n\n\n\nRemember, if we do not believe in \u2013 and\nnurture! -- the unique greatness of our loved ones and children, who will? \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/08/middle-school-prayers-revisited.html", "title": "\nMIDDLE SCHOOL PRAYERS, REVISITED\n"},

You will notice \u2013 but\nI will not, at least until my neck pain tells me something is off, several\nhours in \u2013 that I am sitting at an extremely\nawkward angle. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013 Awkward\nand Ultimately Injurious Angle of Seatedness, Not Noticed\n\n\n\nThose of us with\nsensory processing differences may find ourselves in a myriad of awkward and\nuncomfortable situations/positions because of our divergent vestibular and\nproprioceptive systems, the systems that tell us where we are in space and how\nour movement and body location relates to what is around us. \n\n\n\nWhereas my daughter\nZ\u2019s balance, movement, and self-awareness in space are appropriate and allow\nher to do things in healthy, if sometimes snotty, ways, I fear I\u2019d be barely\nable to function without my many, many years of ballet and yoga.... G\u2019s study\nof Tae Kwon Do has done similar remediation for his vestibular, motor, and\nproprioceptive functioning. \n\n\n\nI was uncomfortable\nsitting there at a random angle from the table, but I am so used to feeling\nawkward that I didn\u2019t even wonder why, or take steps to address my discomfort,\nuntil my neck pain began to eclipse my concentration. When the normal smells\nand lights and sounds of daily life hurt your brain, what\u2019s a bit more pesky\ninput? \n\n\n\nBecoming aware of these\ngoofy and discomforting phenomena is the first step in trying to devise ways in\nwhich to avoid actually harming myself. But here\u2019s the thing: mostly, I don\u2019t\neven know I am doing things \u201cdifferently\u201d until something lets me know \u2013\nanother person (\u201cHey, [FSM], why don\u2019t you put on a sweater, since you are\nshivering?\u201d \u201cOHHHHH! Great idea!\u201d), or actual pain...\n\n\n\nWhat other things\ndo G and I do like sitting at wide angles to tables? I don\u2019t even know. Probably\nplenty! Do you know a wide-angle sitter? A curb-tripper? A walker-into-walls? \n\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop -- a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 8, 2015", "body": "\n\nI read a lot (a LOT) of posts \u2013 whether in\nadoption communities or neurodiverse ones - about how people\u2019s children are \u201cmaking\nprogress.\u201d Progress with sensory differences is one major theme, and uplifting,\ninspirational posts can be found in abundance. I find a lot of news around\n\u201cprogress\u201d with a range of challenges in autism as well. \u00a0Since I tend to only follow writers who start with the basic assumption of accepting\ntheir diverse selves (and the diversity of their children) unconditionally, as\nthey are, I typically enjoy such posts, and think they give us all hope.\n\n\n\nI've read and learned a lotlotlot about adoption and attachment disorders, too; and I'm grateful to have done so since it felt like we were desperate and failing as a family until we gained some context and strategies for my daughter's behaviors. For Z, who was adopted and has struggled with an attachment disorder, progress means healing - gradually - enough to let go of attachment disordered feelings (distrust, panic), and the habits and actions that come with those feelings. Progress, in Z's part of the Full Spectrum, is a unilaterally good and necessary thing.\u00a0\n\nI think a lot (a LOT LOT) about how much I do\nfor my son, who is on the autism spectrum and has motor and executive function\nchallenges, compounded by raging teen hormone fog (that\u2019s a medical term). I\nwonder how much my \u201chelp\u201d is actually enabling him -- in a codependent,\nnon-helpful way -- to not learn how\nto do things, take responsibilities, etc. I try to remember that, but for\nsafety concerns, it\u2019s generally best for him to learn to take responsibility\nfor himself and do his own stuff (dishes, cleaning, \u201corganizing\u201d...) even\nthough he may actually make a much bigger mess doing so...\n\n\n\nHe\u2019ll never learn to live even partially on his\nown if I keep waiting on him hand and foot \u2013 something I do basically because\nit\u2019s easier for me. As G takes on more day-to-day tasks, that is PROGRESS \u2013 and\nit\u2019s a good thing. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s also made huge strides socially, verbally,\nin athletics...His momentum in all these areas is a testament to his hard work\nand efforts. \n\n\n\nAs a neurodiverse adult, however, I sometimes\nquestion a narrow view of the necessity and function of progress. I also I see\nmyself making so much less \u201cprogress\u201d than my son does\u2026\n\n\n\nBig breath.\n\n\n\nI wonder if, for me, it\u2019s at this point more\nabout acceptance, whereas for him he\u2019s still growing so, so much.\u00a0 While his presence during this period of\ngreat growth certainly benefits those around him in increased awareness and good\ncompany, it\u2019s primarily about him. Teaching people is not his job, being his best G is his job. \n\n\n\nMy job, as his mother, is to help him become\nthe most content, competent person he can be, while respecting his unique\nwonderfulness. I would also like him to \u201cprogress\u201d in self-advocacy: both in\nlearning what he needs to succeed socially, academically, and so forth, and in\nbeing able to express those needs in order to grow into who he wants to be. In any case, much as he\nhas never, ever been interested in even the slightest efforts at \u201cpassing,\u201d he\nwins most people over with his exuberance and huge heart and humor. \n\n\n\nMe, I\u2019m still growing inside to some extent,\nbut my PROGRESS is really more about learning about neurodiversity and\nspreading that awareness, as well as advocacy in general -- and for my son and\nme. \n\n\n\nIn images, I think it might go something like\nso:\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 Progress for G and Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure II \u2013 Progress for Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike so many phenomena, progress may be viewed as a Spectrum: for my daughter, it's a straightforward positive; for my son and me, it's more complicated. We need to make sure that our attempts at progress are in line with our inclusive values, rather than succumbing to the biased standards of a neurotypically-inclined mainstream. Ideally, my efforts at public advocacy, along with those of others in this blog hop and beyond, expand the possibilities for defining -- and celebrating\u00a0 -- our own progress, goals, and selves.\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop \u2014 a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by The Sensory Spectrum and The Jenny Evolution.\n Click on the links below to read stories from other bloggers about what\n it\u2019s like to have Sensory Processing Disorder and to raise a sensory \nkiddo!\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nGf79U1im4k/VehX0nqbeCI/AAAAAAAAA1A/eQTbNyIybGs/s1600/sensory%2Bblog%2Bhop%2Bgraphic.jpg", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesensoryspectrum.com%2F&h=IAQHp1Vvs&s=1", "http://www.thejennyevolution.com/sensory-processing-disorder/", "http://new.inlinkz.com/view.php?id=560386"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/09/what-is-progress.html", "title": "\nWHAT IS PROGRESS?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 18, 2015", "body": "\n\nThe Full Spectrums\nwent to see a movie a few weeks ago, which is, in itself, a rarity. We went\nwith my Meeting Friend\u00a0and her family, and chose the only movie that was\nplaying in a matinee, Mr. Holmes.\n\n\n\nDuring a sad,\nmoving part of the movie where Sherlock is really, really old and feeble and\ndecrepit and does something pathetic, Z suddenly laughed aloud. I cringed.\nPerhaps she was uncomfortable, but it just felt very awkward and\ninappropriate...I tried to convince myself it was a mistake, but it happened\nagain a few minutes later during a similar part. Everyone else in the theater\nwas quiet...real quiet. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cGood luck getting\nold,\u201d said my Meeting Friend as we left the theater. As we always do, my dear\nMF and I looked for the bright side: \u201cShe\u2019s very practical and realistic!\u201d we\nassured one another; \u201cGreat sense of the absurd!\u201d\n\n\n\nOn another note, the Full Spectrum\nchildren are very into any and all\nSecret Agent/Detective-y stuff, and were absolutely fascinated by the way\nSherlock Holmes can detect things about people just through observation. As we\nwalked back to the car, I asked them what Sherlock Holmes could know about them\njust by using his powers of discernment. \n\n\n\nZ answered\u00a0immediately:\u201dThat I\u2019m a sister, and that I was adopted.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll G had to say\nwas, \u201cThat I\u2019m awesome!\u201d [See forthcoming post, \u201cAND MODEST, TOO.\u201d]\n\n\n\nI wanted to hear\nmore from both children, though I found Z\u2019s response quite touching, so I told\nthem, \u201cFor me, I think Sherlock Holmes could tell that I am a mother, wife, and\nartist. Those are the most important things to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m awesome,\u201d G\nrepeated.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mean,\u201d said Z.\nThough it\u2019s sometimes true, I don\u2019t think mean is who Z is. I looked at her skeptically. \u201cWell...I can be mean,\u201d she amended.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to\nchange that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nOne thing that IS who Z is is a\nmaster obfuscator. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to not be mean?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe paused. For a while. \u201c...Yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you think you\ncan change? I do! You\u2019re just a kid still!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think\u201d \u2013 very matter-of-fact \u2013 \u201cI will always be a little bit mean.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but\nI can tell I always will.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell...that is\nsomething you will always have to work on then,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI know you can\ndo that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\n\nHmm. Guess that\nconversation was over. (WHO, exactly, is in control all up in here?)\n\n\n\nWhen I started\nwriting this blog, I did not know anyone \u201clike us;\u201d I felt alienated, alone, and,\nmuch worse, so confused about parenting my two very different \u2013 from each\nother, from the \u201cnorm\u201d -- children. \n\n\n\nI felt like a\nfailure in the most important role I\u2019d ever had: motherhood. \n\n\n\nI did not know,\nback in the day, that Z\u2019s seemingly cruel laughter, her obfuscation, her\nself-proclaimed meanness are all attachment-disordered behaviors. I would have\nblamed myself for not raising her to be kind...I would have blamed her for\nbeing unkind and manipulative. \n\n\n\nA number of factors\n(my own kinds of detective work: reading, researching, developing an online\ncommunity, meeting others through the blog, finding a good specialist in\nattachment disorders, having a Meeting Friend) have helped me to become someone\nwho is able to share the fruits of my detective work \u00a0in hopes of reaching people who feel as I have\nfelt in the past (confused, alone) and feel now in the present (confused,\nalone, AND inspired, connected, and \u2013 every so often \u2013 just a little wise in my\nold age).\n\n\n\nAs for Z, if I were\nto name a third fundamental aspect of her identity that Sherlock Holmes might\nhave discerned, I would say that she has a fabulous, quite broad sense of humor. That may be her, and OUR, saving grace. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3168230/"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/09/detective-work.html", "title": "\nDETECTIVE WORK\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, October 22, 2015", "body": "\n\nDear Persons,\n\n\n\nThe fall semester\nbrings my favorite season and also, this year, an unexpected bout of teaching\nIntro Phil, which class only enrolled after\nregistration closed so I was rather\nunprepared, the class that is by far the hardest class I teach because there\u2019s\nno room whatsoever for winging it and I have to think \u201cdeep thoughts\u201d and understand them, at least\nmomentarily, so it takes a ton of prep, which is hard since I did not think I\nwas teaching and took on other work, and even I don\u2019t know where this sentence is\ngoing.\n\n\n\nFrankly \u2013 and\nperhaps the above is indicative of this, hmm? -- my life generally feels out of\nbalance, especially because of the difficulty of earning a living in a rural\narea while raising two high-needs kids. I\u2019ve taken some steps to try to remedy\nthis, but the biggest one was going to be firmly establishing a new, wildly\nlucrative line of work (Ramp up the editing? Finish book proposal and become\npublishing sensation? Teacher coaching???) this semester while I wasn\u2019t teaching.\n\n\n\nOh well. \n\n\n\nMy Laotong (old\nsame, best friend) recently shared some thoughts on balance. She said one of\nher wise teachers once told her that stable,\neven balance is a myth. That to really accomplish something you need to\npour everything into that bucket, rather than trying to just dribble a little\nso your other bucket(s) stay(s) evenly filled. Except. If I pour any more energy\ninto my career there just won\u2019t be anything left for my family...and meanwhile\nmy career is a hodgepodge that\u2019s confusing even to me. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also time for\nG\u2019s three year evaluation. At times like this -- with multiple daily emails,\ncalls, written correspondences, meetings... -- parenting my older child alone\nfeels like another full-time job. Our last three-year eval was a Battle Royale\nabout which I wrote in PROCESS, REPRESENT, TOOT, so grueling I am\nloathe to even recall it. But recall \u2013 and strategize - I must. His current school\nis proposing more testing, including adding testing for ADHD, which I thought\nwas ruled out by/folded into his autism diagnosis years ago. Their explanation\nis that with more results they will be able to develop more tools for helping G\nsucceed as he heads into high school next year.* \n\n\n\nBut I have to\nbalance the school\u2019s need for testing, documentation, and tools with how much G\nhates testing, how vulnerable he is to feeling singled-out, how much time this\nbarrage of testing will take away from his much-needed academics. And we also\nmust, at the same time, make sure their assessments reflect how G really\nbehaves in real life contexts (he\u2019s great at social skills in a two or three\nperson small group environment, for example; outside of that, not so much; there\u2019s\na similar disparity for academics). \n\n\n\nI need to try to\nget the right balance between the labels/tools/testing bucket and the\nacceptance bucket. And it\u2019s hard to even know how to find that balance when I\nam facing piles like that in Figure I in addition to my work piles (not\npictured).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I - \n\nThe Behavior Rating\nInventory of Executive Functioning\n\nThe Social and\nAtypical Behavior Questionnaire\n\nThe NICHQ\nVanderbilt Assessment Scale\n\nThe Behavior\nAssessment System for Children, Second Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure II \u2013 \n\nCloseup, Random\n\n\n\nWhen you see such a\nplethora of tests you cannot help but think as to how this is your child's\nLIFE! The answers to these questions will be used to evaluate a human being,\nyour beloved child. \n\n\n\nYou want them to be\naccepted and celebrated as they are,\nas well as situated in school so as to best Learn.\nYou wonder how the oversimplifications of what feels like millions of multiple\nchoice or scaled (always-often-sometimes-never, and so on, see Figure II)\nquestions\u00a0 can possibly reflect your\nchild, and pray the testing will somehow be helpful.\n\n\n\nYou never, ever,\never want your child to read these generalized forms that aim to identify,\nproblematize (so as to receive services), and label (ditto) and feel bad about\nhim or herself, or judged, or reduced to a standardized series of questions and\nanswers.\n\n\n\nYou have to go to\nthe bathroom many times while filling them out. \n\n\n\nOr maybe that\u2019s\njust me?\n\n\n\nConsider that while\nI try to find balance in testing and school in general for my son, the time\nthis effort takes shifts the aforementioned balance I am trying to find in\nwork...and the balance I am trying to find with my zooming into\nteen-land-three-years-early (she just turned 10!) daughter...\n\n\n\nI need less in the\nbucket that holds stuff like me crying in the bathroom for an hour because I\nsuddenly find out there\u2019s a random, last-minute half-day and my schedule is so precariously\nmicro-scheduled that this puts me over the edge. That\u2019s a balance that\u2019s too\ndelicate!\n\n\n\nWhen I look around\nme, I see that I am not alone in feeling unbalanced. Perhaps that\u2019s because I\nnow know \u2013 thankfully! \u2013 a lot of other families and people who fill a Full\nSpectrum of their own. But it\u2019s not just them. As my fall 2015 Intro Phil\nstudents say, this system is hard.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible for most of us to do as\nAristotle advised and become a \u201chappy philosopher,\u201d spending your time\nreasoning and pondering...\n\n\n\nBut we get up every\nday and go after that elusive balance, don\u2019t we?

If you only\nhave three minutes, please read the above profile of an astounding and\ninspiring woman instead. Otherwise, read about her and then come back. Please\nand thank you. \n\n\n\nI\u2019d been writing\nthis post on advocacy and activism (topics dear to the Full Spectrum heart) when I heard that\nGrace Lee Boggs had passed. A fellow Mawrtyr (graduate of Bryn Mawr College:\nMs. Boggs was a Bryn Mawr Ph.D.), she was known for a lifelong commitment to\njustice and equality for ALL. In a time in which all of the following combinations\nwere practically unimaginable, she was a *Chinese-American *female *scholar\nmarried to a *Black man. She was a lifelong feminist, worked hard for labor and\nthe environment and her community, and advocated powerfully and effectively for\nuniversal civil rights \u2013HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\n\n\nMy original post\nexplored how we come to activism: how I\u2019ve watched people with cancer (or loved\nones with cancer) become cancer activists, people with sensory processing\ndifferences become SPD activists, autistic people and their families and loved\nones become autism activists... \n\n\n\nBut my main point\nwas and is that I believe and hope that people whose hearts and minds are\nopened up by the particular, personal\ninjustices of the world are inclined to open those hearts and minds further to\ninclude the desire for justice, fairness, equality, and inclusion for ALL.\nGrace Lee Boggs represented this beautiful tendency.\n\n\n\nShe had the vision\nto see the humanity and worth in all\npeople. Knowing what I know of that vision, I know implicitly that she would\nhave embraced the concept that autistic and neurodiverse people are inherently worthy\nof equal rights and respect, and that families of mixed ethnicity are simply,\nand fully, families, and that people with sensory processing differences\nexperience the world in completely valid ways, and...and...\n\n\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s this\nlittle word, \u201cand,\u201d that\u2019s key. We choose \u201cand\u201d instead of \u201cor:\u201d because there\nare enough rights to go around. We\ndon\u2019t have to choose whether it\u2019s race OR ability OR sexuality OR identity OR whatever particular \u201ctype\u201d that \u201cgets\u201d\nto have rights. \n\n\n\nWe ALL do.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThose with big, generous hearts remind us of the world's potential, sometimes-hidden bigness and generosity, even when it is hard for others to see. Those of us with growing hearts can look to people like Grace Lee Boggs and take hope.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure I \u2013 When We\nBecome Rainbows of Inclusion in a Sometimes Limited-Vision World\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve wondered why\nsome people come to activism on their own, through a strong sense of more\ngeneralized compassion, or whether most come only through experiences of\ndifference, discrimination, challenge... \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve also\nconsidered how \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 TIRING it can be to see injustice everywhere,\nnever mind to combat it with all you\u2019ve got.

That dance [her \u201chomework hokey pokey\u201d] is\nentirely too familiar. The balance is so much harder and feels more crucial\nwhen your child has learning and neurological differences...He'd be failing\nwithout oversight (MAJOR oversight) and yet is highly intelligent. I try to\nmake sure he DOES and HANDS IN his homework, without ever doing it FOR HIM. If\nthat makes sense...That alone is practically a full time job...\n\nYuck.\n\n\n\nTo ponder: \n\nOn Validation, as a\nSort of Loving-Kindness (Metta) Meditation, from the Asperger Experts (a duo of young\ngentlemen on the spectrum who tell it like it is {from their points of view} and\nadvise families):\n\nWhat we want is for our support\nsystems to step in and actually support us by validating our struggles...\nINSTEAD of always trying to \"fix\" the situation.\n\nHow do you validate someone?\n\nYou listen to them.\n\nYou hear them.\n\nYou take them where they're at\ninstead of asking them to be somewhere or something they're not.\n\nYou stop what you're doing and\nbecome available for them.\n\nThis does not mean offering\nadvice. This means simply listening.\u00a0\n\nPeriod. The end.\n\nI LOOOVE me some Asperger\nExperts. But this homework situation unquestionably needs \u201cfixing.\u201d When they\nadvise parents \u2013 AKA \u201csupport systems\u201d -- to listen deeply, to validate, and we\ndo so...Do we then get to do the\n\u201chomework hokey pokey\u201d? I will keep listening, but how will that get my son to\nbegin to take some initiative with his homework and not fail eighth grade?\nSurely he is validated by now; in fact, I sometimes think an overabundance of\nself-esteem is part of the problem. \n\n\n\nTo ponder: \n\nOn the Universal\nNature of Universal Design:\n\nIs it possible that\nUniversal Design is not as universal\nas it is intended to be? This question comes up in my own teaching: which\n\u201cmalfunctions\u201d in the homework department stem from learning differences per\nse, which are a result of executive function challenges, and which arise from\nsheer triflingness? And how on earth do we distinguish between these, as\nstudents, as parents, as teachers????\n\n\n\nTo ponder: \n\nOn the Practice of Email:\n\nWhen you are\nemailing about homework with your son\u2019s case manager [Thank you, C, you are an\nangel!], at length, more than once, on a\nSaturday night, is it too much? \n\n\n\nDeep, Responsive Thought: \n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas that scary\nenough for Halloween?

{"date": "Monday, January 27, 2014", "body": "\n\n\nI posted my first second-anniversary list, on Advocacy,\nabout two weeks ago. Immediately following that post, I had a startlingly\ndepressing IEP meeting, hence, the delay in this second list \u2013 and this disclaimer:\nnone of us knows what to do all the time! Sometimes life is hard, and there are\nmajor and minor disastrophes, however hard we try.\n\n\n\nIt was \u201cfunny\u201d to have this second second-anniversary post\nin the back of my mind as I endured one of the most attachment-disordered\nweekends we have had in recent memory.\u00a0\nThe drama was epic, with violent and threatening tantrums starting\nFriday afternoon - and the consequences (effective or not) were many. Still, I\nstand by my lists \u2013 I just may need to adhere to them with more vim and acumen\nmyself!\n\n\n\nThis time last year, I wrote about attachment disorders in\ngeneral and listed some of the things I wished I\u2019d known about them before embarking on some painful and discouraging times\nwith very little knowledge of how to help my child. I had moments of\ndesperation, regret and despair that I would not wish on anyone. If you are\nlooking for general definitions and tips, or are new to attachment disorders,\nhere is the link to that post:\nhttp://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2013/01/first-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html.\n\n\n\nThis year, I decided to write about our current state of\nslightly more advanced (partly more healed\u2026and partly more \u201csubtle,\u201d as\nfine-tuned by Herself, La Z) mild to moderate* attachment disordered-ness. \n\n\n\nThoughts on\n\u201cAdvanced\u201dAttachment Disorders\n\n\n\nTherapeutic\n     Parenting helps. \n\n\nThanks to what we\u2019ve learned and\nimplemented about therapeutic parenting, Z\u2019s tantrums are down to once a week\nor less. They usually (usually \u2013 hahahaaaaaa) occur on Sundays, when we have\nspent what feels to G and me like a relaxing weekend. While G and I both\ndesperately need such extended sensory/social breaks, they entail much less\nstimulation/world domination than Z, even on a purely kinesthetic level, craves\nand needs. Either \u201cside\u201d usually has to compromise on a given day, but on slow\nweekends tantrums are likely\u2026Less likely,\nhowever, than they were during the Pre-Therapeutic Parenting Era!\n\n\n\nThe\n     Sooner the Better. \n\n\nI know: they say this with ALL interventions\u2026And sometimes\nyou just don\u2019t know what is going on.\u00a0 (For example, G wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until second\ngrade.) But if you do know that your\nchild has an attachment disorder, and are dilly-dallying\u2026Don\u2019t. I know single\nmoms who are raising teenagers with attachment disorders -- big, male teenagers\n\u2013 and it\u2019s a lot harder to tackle in that dynamic than it is for me with Ms.\nPuny Stuff over here. \n\n\n\nCycles/Patterns.\n     \n\n\nIt\u2019s so important to bear cycles\nand patterns in mind when things seem bleak: change will come, for better or\nworse (hopefully the former!).\u00a0 Z,\nas I have explored at length elsewhere on this blog, has certain times of year\n(spring in particular) and certain types of events (holidays) that seem to\ntrigger her most disordered behavior. Other times, we may have positively\npeaceful stretches; these are what we look forward to \u2013 if we can remember to\ndo so \u2013 when times are rough.\n\n\n\nPresumed\n     Omniscience.\n\n\nPresumed omniscience seems to be a\nhallmark of many people with attachment disorders, including Z. I\u2019ve recently\nhad to disavow her of the habit of saying \u201cI was thinking that,\u201d or,\nalternatively, \u201cI was just about to say that,\u201d every few minutes. She tells her\nfriends she has done/seen [fill-in-the-blank] \u201cabout a thousand times.\u201d Also,\nshe openly pities those pathetic and inferior individuals \u2013 and this is not\nlimited to fellow children -- who have not done/seen/known [fill-in-the-blank].\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the mom\u201d is a phrase that\nis in common usage chez the Full Spectrum, especially when Z (8) mimics my\ninstructions to G (12) regarding his \u201cteenager practice\u201d activities (you know,\neye-rolling, grunted replies to all questions, slouching at all times\u2026). As one\nmight imagine, G does not take kindly to his bossy peanut of a sister\u2019s\nreprimands. \n\n\n\nOmniscience also encompasses the\nalleged inability to make (admit) mistakes. So when Z and I are working\ntogether on learning a new skill, say\u2026sewing, mistakes are not made in the\nusual sense. Rather, the thread often \u201cneeds help\u201d \u2013 or the fabric \u201chas a\nproblem.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis omniscience may represent\nefforts to make sense of a world that feels unstable. It\u2019s something we, as\nindividuals with attachment disorders (or in interactions with those who have\nan attachment disorder), or as parents of children with attachment disorders,\nshould consider. \n\n\n\n\n\nControl.\n     \n\n\nChildren and adults with AD may\nfeel the need to control their environments because on a very basic level they\nfeel unsafe. Although the connection may not always be evident, that fear\nimpels a state of constant inner vigilance and is expressed in controlling\nbehaviors. \n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any potential\nhuman servants non-family people at the house, much of the time Z spends at\nhome is spent corralling one or both of our cats. She will \u2013 for long stretches\nof time - hold one cat very close and march him or her around the house,\nignoring any wiggling or desire to escape, and \u201cshowing\u201d him or her the views\nout of our windows and so on. Alternatively, she will bring both cats into a\nsmall, enclosed space and \u201cplay\u201d with them. \n\n\n\nWe have really nice cats.\n\n\n\nAdults need to set impeccable\nboundaries so that, on the one hand, a child with these challenges may feel\nmore safe and, on the other, the child (and their pet{s}) really is safe. With attachment-disordered adult relationships,\nthis may be more tricky. In my experience, though, the principles of boundaries\nand consistency will hold across quite a Full Spectrum and so it certainly\ncannot hurt to try this sort of healing work.\n\n\n\nHere is a really fascinating\nexample of boundary setting: last night, I politely asked Z to put away the\ndeck of cards with which she was playing. She continued to spread out the\ncards. I reminded her of my request and she explained that she \u201cwanted to show\n[me] the cards.\u201d I insisted that she do as I had asked. Therapeutic parenting?\nDone! For that moment at least\u2026\n\n\n\nAs potentially boring, relentless\nand annoying as such boundaries may feel in their enactment \u2013 and from day to\nday it can feel endless -- these baby steps help heal that frightened impulse\ntoward constant control.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nSubversion.\n     \n\n\nThe first thing I learned about\ntherapeutic parenting was that everything I was doing as a progressive, choice-\nand respect-offering parent was wrong. To put it in less-loaded language, it\nwas not working. My child needed me to\nset strong boundaries and make most choices on her behalf in order to feel safe\nand learn to trust. Bit by bit I got this down. But Shawty is SMART. She turned\nit around on me!\n\n\n\nErgo:\n\n\n\nZ: \u201cCan I go in\n[G]\u2019s room?\u201d\n\nMama: \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nZ: \u201cCan I take\nthree steps in the hallway?\u201d\n\nMama: \u201cZ, come\non.\u201d\n\nPause.\n\nZ: \u201cMama!\u2026Mama!\nCan I walk through his door?\u201d\n\nOr--\n\nMama, shouting (nicely) upstairs\nto bathroom while doing 17 other things: \u201c[Z], please wash your hair now!\u201d\n\nZ: \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nOne minute later,\nZ again: \u201cMama?\u201d\n\nMama makes way back to bottom of\nstairs from doing 19 things: \u201cYes?\u201d\n\nZ: \u201cShould I now rinse my hair?\u201d\n\n\n\nI think you can see where I am going with this.\n\n[Insert informative \u201cAnswer Section\u201d\nwith instructions on how to handle this development.]\n\n\n\n\n\nRefusal\n     to Ask.\n\n\n\n\nDoes Z need me to charge one of\nher contraptions? Does another toy need batteries? Does she know how to sew a\ncomplicated project without ever having been taught? Is there something important\nthat she wishes or requires? I won\u2019t know unless I ask her. Because she Will.\nNot. Ask. For. Anything (Help-Related). See: Control. See: Presumed\nOmniscience\u2026\n\n\n\nThat being said\u2026is this an\n\u201cAttachment Disorder\u201d thing? Or is it\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperament\n\n\nZ is a strong personality in a\nfamily of strong personalities. It\u2019s hard to imagine she would have been the\nshy, retiring type under any circumstances. Some of Z\u2019s less-pro-social\nbehaviors are personality-derived, some are rooted in her attachment disorder.\nI have to try to strike that elusive balance between accepting Z as she is \u2013\nobviously not a unique issue in any relationship -- and helping her to heal\nthose aspects of her being that are affected by her attachment disorder.\nWhereas with G, who has aspergers syndrome, I use general health-promoting\npractices and promote radical acceptance of neurodiversity, I do actively want to \u201ccure\u201d Z of her attachment disorder,\ninsofar as that is possible. As we grow together, I hope all the different\nparts of Z\u2019s life\u00a0 - personality,\nenvironment, history, dreams\u2026 -- will come together in increasingly healthy\nways. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe main themes here can be summed up in a two concepts: \n\n\n\nTRUST \u2013 and trust promoting\nactions, and \n\nBOUNDARIES \u2013 and setting them\nconsistently. \n\n\n\nThis latter should, ideally, set a foundation for the\nformer. NB: this process may unfold in a remarkably extended and painstaking\nfashion! I hope someday Z, as her trust in the world grows, will be able to\nlook upon such things as letting go a bit, or needing help, or not knowing\nsomething as normal human activities \u2013\nboth in herself and in others.\n\n\n\n\nMeantime, do you know\neverything? Do you never need to ask for information or help? Do you never make\nmistakes? Are you in command and\ncontrol at all times? Do you not need new batteries? Just in case the answer to\nany of these is \u201cno,\u201d I will leave you, dear reader, with these words, uttered\nby Z when I lost a mean game of Apples to Apples: \u201cSorry you\u2019re\nkind of a loser.\u201d\n\n\n\nComing Soon: Anniversary List III: Choosing Your Battles\u2026\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* I have written elsewhere on the differences between severe\nand mild attachment disorders, and there is much available on this subject\nonline. Z has what is known as a \u201cmild to moderate\u201d attachment disorder. \n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/01/second-anniversary-lists-ii-attachment.html", "title": "\nSecond Anniversary Lists II: Attachment Disorders\n"},

It\u2019s also known as\nface-blindness. And both G and I have it.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t realize\nhow severe my prosopagnosia was until I moved to Vermont. Living in this state\nis harder for me, recognition-wise, for two reasons. First, the population is\nalmost entirely white. Living in New York City and other more diverse,\ngenerally urban environs most of my life enabled me to identify people partly\nby skin color and hair texture. Second, there was a style factor in these\ncities which is, shall we say, not so much in play here: flamboyance of dress\nis not as common in Vermont as I\u2019d like it to be \u2013 and not just because I can\u2019t\ntell anyone apart. As my dear friend Fern once said when we were in graduate\nschool at Columbia University \u2013 an environs that felt to us downtown denizens\nlike a bastion of preppiness in the midst of a then-freaky New York City -- \u201cI\nfeel like a drag queen here.\u201d Come to think of it, we need more drag queens in\nVermont, too!\n\n\n\nANYway, in a state\nwhere most people are white and dress casually, sportily. I find myself\nfrequently faced with a friendly person who knows me, and expects me to know\nhim or her. Which I probably do. But not by face. \n\n\n\nOh and another\nthing: small towns. In small towns you don\u2019t just see someone where they work\nor attend a specific activity with you, where you naturally might develop\ncontextual identification. No\u2026in a small town, you also run into them and are expected to recognize them IN OTHER\nPLACES. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure I \u2013 Basic\nDistinctions \u2013 Weak to Strong Recognition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure II \u2013 Bonus\nDistinctions \u2013 Strong Recognition\n\n\n\nNone of these\nobservations \u2013 from skin color to hair length or texture or color to age to\ngender identity\u2026--- is a judgment for G or me (well, maybe style -but I\ncelebrate style diversity!). We are\ngenerally much too engaged in attempting to navigate this neurotypical world to\nfeel critical of others\u2019 looks. Visual differences (there are others uncatalogued\nhere that may be helpful: moles, glasses, braces\u2026) are just ways to recognize\npeople. \n\n\n\nOnce I get to know\nsomeone well, I am able to recognize them\u2026most of the time. Certainly close-up!\nThis is not the case for all people with prosopagnosia, some of whom are never\nable to recognize even their closest associates. G has thought other women were\nme from time to time, and continues to do so; only when he gets right in front\nof them is he able to see that he was mistaken. Disconcerting \u2013 but I get it. In\nfact, it was through watching G have some pretty notable encounters of this\nsort that I began to realize that I had the same tendency. Before this dawning,\nI\u2019d been prone to wondering why I could not distinguish between most of the\nmothers at drop off (or their kids, or who went with whom\u2026), but I\u2019d just put\nit in my \u201cquirky me\u201d category, with a side of \u201cpathetic.\u201d Around the same time,\nthere was a great article in the New Yorker by Oliver Sacks ***http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/30/face-blind***\non this very subject (which also goes into topographical agnosia \u2013 another form\nof visual agnosia [lit.: not-knowing] - that I also share, but, luckily, G does\nnot), and I realized there was a name for what G and I were experiencing!\n\n\n\nG realizes that he\nhas this Sensory Processing Difference, and that it\u2019s something I, too, deal\nwith. He\u2019s learned to check himself in this area, and he\u2019ll often say, now,\n\u201c\u2026Is that? \u2026No.\u201d He\u2019s become more careful over time of calling out to his peers\nunless he\u2019s sure it\u2019s the person he thinks it is, which, frequently, it is not.\n\n\n\nAs G grows, he will\nbe able to develop tools for recognition and hone his skills in this area. As\nawareness grows, he\u2019ll know his face-blindness is a sort of Sensory Processing\nDifference that is shared by many. He\u2019ll figure out his own best Distinctions,\nrecognition-wise \u2013 and never need to call himself \u201cpathetic.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nAn InLinkz Link-up\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdFk3fEl19k/VNYxJ3wM8uI/AAAAAAAAAnU/v_YIDGUW--Y/s1600/basic%2Bdist.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1ePmC7Vr1ZE/VNYxT9_kaPI/AAAAAAAAAnc/m6U6qLmia5E/s1600/better%2Bdist.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KLXe-KrVyjE/VNkIe5sNAmI/AAAAAAAAAns/-9Vwx2j1U3A/s1600/SensoryBlogHop%2B(1).jpg", "http://new.inlinkz.com/luwpview.php?id=475068"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2015/02/prosopag-what-y-who.html", "title": "\nPROSOPAG-WHAT-Y-WHO????\n"},

A friend posted a recent-ish (2010) interview in the Guardian\u00a0in which Williams' struggles to connect and succeed socially were striking. The interviewer stopped short of making fun of his accents, obsessions and tangents...but the undertone was perceptible.\n\nTonight at dinner, G began reading aloud in an exaggerated robot voice. I know people have told him he sounds like a robot. At that moment it hit me: perhaps Williams was using his multiplicity of voices as my son was using his robot voice -- essentially as an alternate or cover-up for his own quirky cadence.\n\nI wish Robin Williams felt accepted and heard just as he was. I hope if he's in heaven it's a wildly, happily neurodiverse (and wildly, happily diverse diverse) place; I hope - if what happens is that we come back - that he comes back in a context that **unconditionally** accepts and celebrates him; I hope if this life was all there was for him that we learn from his pain.\n\nI hope younger generations feel that \u00a0their own quirky, heavenly voices are valid, worthwhile, beautiful. Because they are.\n\nLove,\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://m.ranker.com/list/famous-people-with-aspergers-syndrome/celebrity-lists", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/20/robin-williams-worlds-greatest-dad-alcohol-drugs"], "link": "http://fullspectrummama.blogspot.com/2014/08/heaven.html", "title": "\nHEAVEN\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, October 30, 2014", "body": "\n\n\n\nMy gal A and I love to have Spectrum Fests at a\nnearby lake where we talk feminism and injustice (our shared special interests)\nand our boys try to work out how to play together when their special interests don\u2019t match.\u00a0These are special times for us because once the school year hits the fan we both get pretty buried.\u00a0A is a single Mom with a son\non the spectrum. She used to be a student of mine at the\nCommunity College and is now about to graduate from a Seven Sisters college via\nits 100% full-scholarship program for non-traditional students. Go, A!\n\n\n\nLast summer, A told me about a study she\u2019d read\nclaiming that logical people actually have more interest in justice, and tend\nto act more from the impetus of justice than do less-logical people. This made\nsense to US, as logical, spectrum-y, eggheaded, highly empathetic people. But\nit flies in the face of a lot of allistic ideas around autism. \n\n\n\nThe article, \u201cConcern for justice linked with reason, not emotion,\u201d contends that those of us who are \u201ccognitively\ndriven\u201d tend to make the sorts of\u00a0\n\u201csophisticated analysis and mental calculation\u201d that lead us to act\nbased on logic rather than desire.\n\n\n\nIn other words, we don\u2019t do kind things because\nwe feel we should because it would\nbe \u201cgood,\u201d but because we know we should\nbecause it is right. That type of motivation has been\nshown to be significantly more compelling\nthan emotional incentives. It leads naturally and inevitably to increased\njustice-orientation \u2013 and, thereby, to an increase in just actions.\n\n\n\nReason \u2013 a.k.a. logic \u2013 is the enemy of moral\nrelativism as it is often used: as a tool for justifying asocial desires and\nactions. By asocial, I refer (perhaps somewhat polemically) to desires and\nactions that increase inequality and injustice. I contend that my logical\nnature, and that of most of the other spectrum-y people I know, precludes\njudging such actions as acceptable.\n\n\n\nOne of the many, many benefits of being a\nProfessor of Ethics is learning to distinguish empathy from moral relativism.\nI\u2019ve always felt that the gross disparities in peoples\u2019 lives were unfair \u2013 and\nresented the attempts of people I saw as privileged to equate their problems\nwith those of others who clearly \u2013 to me \u2013 had harder lives. Empathy means\nhaving compassion \u2013 literally, with-feeling \u2013 for someone; it means understanding\nthem as best you can and, to a reasonable extent, acknowledging their concerns.\nIt does not mean acting as if all struggles and challenges are equivalent \u2013 or\naccepting cockamamie, hypocritical excuses for what basically amounts to doing\nwhatever the heck one wants. As Albert Einstein (a beloved Aspie role-model and\nethicist, among other things) said, \u201c\u201cIt is abhorrent to me when a fine intelligence is paired with an unsavory character.\u201d\u00a0Logic precludes using intelligence to\njustify selfishness, or to equate the inimitable.\n\n\n\nMundane example: I recently mentioned to\nsomeone that there\u2019ve been times when I\u2019ve gotten upset in the grocery store\nbecause of money issues. They were sympathetic but then added, \u201cThen, once you\nhave enough money, you might start to feel guilty about having more than\nothers, or have a hard time choosing what to buy!\u201d \n\n\n\nUm\u2026no? Not. Equivalent.\n\n\n\nIt seems...logical to assume that if one has more than one needs one should do something about that rather than \"feeling guilty;\" and that the luxury of choice is a gift, not a burden (and, if the latter [?], not one that should be publicly bemoaned).\n\n\n\nWhen A and I sit around discussing -- \u00a0and, okay, sometimes bemoaning -- \u00a0our\nsituations, I know she, as a single mother, has it harder than me. We\nboth know if we were Black or transgendered or more differently-abled than we\nare (or any of the other ridiculous things that can label one around here and\nmake one, therefore, to some, \u201cless-than\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d or \u201cautomatically criminal\nand/or stupid and/or degenerate and/or inferior and/or, at the very least, suspect\u201d in ways that limit opportunities and inclusion) it would be harder. That\u2019s just logical!\nI think I have said this before: the only people who ever say stuff like \u201cit\u2019s\nall relative\u201d are those privileged enough\nto have that belief and clueless\nenough to express it.\u00a0 Most of us know\nbetter \u2013 and we\u2019ve learned the hard way. \n\n\n\nI make this point not to punish all the\nannoying people who think they have it sooo hard and don\u2019t. What I want to do\nis draw a link to the sorts of persistent economic and social injustices that\nare fundamentally grounded in these types of self-rationalization \u2013 and that\nare typically unavailable to deeply logical people, including many on the\nautism spectrum. \n\n\n\nLogical people just can\u2019t get around numbers.\nIf Person A has a salary of $200,000 and their \u201clifestyle\u201d demands a new car\nevery year and Person A is not logical, Person A can say to herself, \u201cI need\nthis new $30,000 car,\u201d with no qualms whatsoever about those in need, such as,\nsay, Person B, who makes $10,000 a year and is struggling to feed her family\nand has a car that barely functions. Person A can tell Person B, \u201cIt\u2019s all\nrelative.\u201d But Person B, if she is logical, logically knows this is not true: A\nworking car is a working car. $1=$1. $30,000 can feed four families for a year.\n\n\n\n\u2026Logic.\n\n\n\nI like to believe that a logical Person B, if\nshe somehow secured a job making $200,000 a year, and was in the same situation\nas Person A, above, would use that $30,000 to help those in need rather than to\nbuy a new car because it is reasonably\nthe right thing to do. A and I sure would. We don't just bemoan. We also plan for the day when we will be better able to help others. Those are our Special Fantasies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2026Logic,logic, logic.\n\n\n\nTruly logical people cannot ignore the fact that torture is torture:\n\n\n\nWhen Dick Cheney calls torture \u2018enhanced interrogation,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t make us understand torture in a different way; it\u2019s just a means for those who know they\u2019re doing something wrong to find a phrase that doesn\u2019t immediately acknowledge the wrongdoing\u2026\n\nWhatever name Cheney\u2019s men gave torture, they knew what it was. A grotesque euphemism is offensive exactly because we recognize perfectly the mismatch between the word and its referent. It\u2019s an instrument of evasion, like a speeding getaway car, not an instrument of unconsciousness, like a blackjack.\n\n\u201cWord Magic,\u201d by Adam Gopnik in\u00a0The New Yorker\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOstensibly, the more logical you are, the more you recognize this sort of internal, mutual and/or institutional subterfuge; ideally \u2013 and in fact \u2013 logic thus makes one less prone to evasion, rationalization, justification\u2026.\n\n\n\nTruly logical people know, logically, that\nthere is plenty for ALL on this planet, if we omit greed on the micro (personal\nwealth hoarded and/or spent on thing after thing) and macro (nationalism,\nimperialism, huge corporations oriented primarily toward profit) levels. I am\naware that\u2019s not going to happen right this very minute \u2013 tho A and I wish\nit would! \u2013 but what if, bit by bit, people and institutions became more\nlogical, and thereby more justice-oriented?\u00a0What if empathy was linked primarily to real-life actions\nand choices that actually promote justice (rather than to a nice-seeming attitude)?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt makes me bonkers when allistic people assume\nthat autistic people lack empathy. Here\u2019s just ONE reason why: \u00a0for many of us,\nlogic is linked to empathy as a value that must\nbe enacted, rather than as a feeling that may be ignored \u2013 or rationalized\naway. Some people on the spectrum may seem self-centered, focused on their\nSpecial Interests and/or socially inept, but their literality and logical-tendencies\ntypically make them among the most fair, just, unselfish, empathetic people\naround. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\nP.S.

This holds equally true \u2013\nin very different ways \u2013 for my son and me.\n\n\n\nJust as I often\nsuspect I feel \u201ctoo much\u201d as compared to others, I think too much as well.\nHere\u2019s an example: I was in a local coffee shop, reading a sign on a muffin:\n\u201cUni\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corn Muffin,\u201d it read, with\nthe \u201cCorn Muffin\u201d part all typed and official and the \u201cUni\u201d handwritten.\n\n\n\nI began to consider\nthis puzzling marker...Did it herald some sort of prestigious, single-source,\nlocally-farmed corn? Just one particular type of corn, a Silver Queen or Butter\nn Sugar perhaps? Or were they referring, trendily, to \u201cuni\u201d as in sea urchin?\n\n\n\nI definitely didn\u2019t\nwant that!\n\n\n\n\u201cUm...what does\nthat mean?\u201d I asked the incredulous cashier, pointing to the sign.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnicorn?\u201d she\nsaid, with pity.\n\n\n\nOh. \n\n\n\nPardner asked me\nnot long ago, \u201cWhen do you decide to put on lipgloss?\u201d\n\n\n\nI think he expected\nan answer along the lines of, \u201cWhen I don\u2019t have any on.\u201d\n\n\n\nI, however, gave\nhim a very long, involved answer, touching upon the vicissitudes of being a\nghostly-looking white person, what sorts of textures there are in lip things,\nthe many, many sensory and chemical qualities that can be wrong with various lip-related\nproducts, what makes for a good lip gloss, and, most importantly, how\nincredibly painful it feels for me when my lipgloss wears off in even a tiny\npart of my lip...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure I \u2013 Amount\nof Dry Lip That May Lead to Crisis\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a potential\nworld of pain in a dry lip, and I say this as someone who bears the chronic\npain of rheumatoid arthritis with nary a whimper (rheumatoid also brings me\nraynaud\u2019s syndrome, which adds to dry lip \u2013 help!). I say this as someone who\nhas lived quite a life and is amply endowed with \u201cperspective.\u201d I am pretty\nbutch...but don\u2019t leave me stranded without my chapstick. Burt\u2019s Bees original,\nto be precise, with the Lip Shimmer on top. \n\n\n\nSome of you will be\nreading this aghast. Indeed, I might be called an over-thinker, and/or an\nover-feeler by many, be it regarding muffins, lipgloss, or just about anything\nelse. Others will be nodding along, having experienced life with sensory\nprocessing differences.\n\n\n\nI am not saying people\nwith high physical sensitivities necessarily have high emotional ones, just\nthat our physical, emotional, neurological, intellectual, and all other \u201cparts\u201d\nare so intricately related. Sometimes our \u201cparts\u201d complement each other \u2013 and sometimes\nthey exacerbate each other. We notice and feel and think and so on, more or\nless, more and less, more and more, less and less....It\u2019s part of who we are. \n\n\n\nTake my G, he\u2019s a\nsmart, caring, and thoughtful giant little dude, but, as I have mentioned\nbefore, he wouldn\u2019t notice if there was a pound of schmutz on his mouth. In\nsensory processing lingo, he\u2019s an \u201cunder-responder.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure II \u2013\nPutative G Mouth: Yes to Schmutz, No to Crisis/Cleanup\n\n\n\nPerhaps partly\nbecause of this less-sensitive-to-irritants way of being, G is so relaxed and\nnatural about life. He\u2019d read \u201cunicorn,\u201d no problem. He has a carefree heart. He\nfeels a lot, but his feelings, so far, are remarkably positive. In contrast, I\nhave to work pretty hard to stay upbeat, because of all that\u2019s literally weighing\non me. Being more sensitive overall \u2013 an \u201cover-responder\u201d - has a lot to do\nwith this need to make quite an effort just to function at times. \n\n\n\nG\u2019s executive\nfunctioning is almost non-existent, and I know this, along with some social\ndifferences typical of neurodiverse persons, as well as non-noticing of schmutz\n(and other hygiene issues), will bring him many, many challenges in the years\nto come. But how about his EQ (emotional intelligence)? Off the charts. What\nbalance and wholeness this seems to bring him!\n\n\n\nJust yesterday, G pulled his socks on over soaking wet feet\nwithout screaming. In fact he was smiling and chattering while he did so. How\nliberating would that be? I wouldn\u2019t change either of us \u00a0\u2013 and I am not crazy about the judgy aspect of\nterms like \u201cover-\u201c and under-responsive\u201d \u2013 but I do find our differences\nfascinating. I watched him doing this little thing I could never do, and I marveled\nat the range of ways of being whole,\nat how our mores and lesses -- RATHER THAN MAKING US MORE OR LESS -- make us, us. \n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Sensory Blog Hop -- a monthly gathering of posts from sensory bloggers hosted by\u00a0The Sensory Spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0The Jenny Evolution.

Well, at least as light as it is\npossible to be when certain things that\nother people barely notice can make you completely nuts. Those tiny crumbs of\ncheese or vegetable dust from eating any sort of snack food that has a tasty\ncoating (my favorites are Pirate\u2019s or Veggie Booty; this category also includes\nSmartfood, Cheetos, Cheez Doodles\u2026) that get on my hands make me CRAZY.\n\n\n\nHere are some\nsimilar things I am actively choosing NOT to write about, or even think about,\nbeyond this paragraph: unidentified particles on bare feet (there\u2019s a long-told\nstory in my family of how I stepped into a small puddle of water in the kitchen\nonce and screamed. Well\u2026yeah. Right?); seeing Booty Crumbs on someone else\u2019s\nhands (shudder). This latter is a particular issue as my son falls on the\nstrongly not-noticing Booty Crumbs\n(or any schmutz, anywhere) end of the Spectrum. \n\n\n\nI imagine \u2013 the\noperative word being imagine \u2013 that a\n\u201cnormal\u201d response to Booty Crumbs would be to notice a mild dust on your digits\nand brush it off or calmly wait until you have a chance to wash your hands.

Scandalous!), taste them (still in my mouth, but\nalso from smelling), even hear them (that oily-dusty\nsound)\u2026Consequently, if I have Booty Crumbs, I cannot stop thinking about\nsaid Booty Crumbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure II \u2013 Booty\nCrumbs, Sensory Sensitive\n\n\n\nLike anyone, I like\nto eat a nice snack of cheesy or vegetal goodness.

Being a bit slow on the uptake, largely because I am often overwhelmed\nby feelings and environment, it has taken me, ohhhh, 45 years to, first,\nrealize why I felt so discombobulated every time I had a snack of this sort,\nand, then, to come up with a solution: \u201cdrink\u201d my snacks out of a cup.\n\n\n\nHappy snacking \u2013\nand please do check out the links below.\n\n\n\nComing up next: THE\nCOMPLAINT DEPARTMENT!!!!\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nFull Spectrum Mama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S.
