{"date": "October  9, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0My day started off great with a nice smooth shift at work, but went rapidly downhill from there; Hotter is sick and a nail in one of the MFA Beater's NEW tires (couldn't be one of the old ones, ohOOOOO no) turned ino $221, a new wheel hub, tire, studs and nuts, and two hours in MFA Mechanic's waiting room, then Hotter slept through Daddy Dinner Date Night after finding out Lefty is getting out of prison late next month (despite having committed SEVERAL felonies ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO) for having ratted on someone, which means Lefty is highly likely to get shot over the holidays so MERRY FUCKING TURKEY-KAH-MAS. Then when he brought the kids back my ex beckoned me out onto the front porch to try to gaslight me into believing Little Child had actually ASKED for growth hormone shots at the appointment that I attended where the endocrinologist pronounced him a healthy shrimp with normal bone age and the child expressed nothing but satisfaction with his own stature, and when I gave him the hand and said he needed to stop trying to bend reality and project his own securities onto our son he screamed at me. YAY! Wait, no, SHIT! The XY has furthermore diagnosed yet another child with yet ANOTHER endocrine condition that I won't be discussing publicly but am pretty sure is Not Actually A Thing, and honestly I think he probably just needs his psych meds tweaked or possibly a beating with the Narcissist Be Cool Stick. And only because I don't think my back is quite up for this yet:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So here are some things that I did not write, because anything I write today is going to be about Hotter's shitty timing and how cars and junkies are fucking whores and my ex needs to get over his Lilliputian penis (because the rest of the world already has, and it's less because of the size of his gear and more because it's dangling off a GIANT FESTERING ASSHOLE).\u00a0\r\nThis is hilarious. Who is going to help me stab The XY in the leg?*\r\nThis is thought-provoking stuff, and I thinks she's right. Lord, I miss the gym.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm sure I read something else awesome at some point today, but I think I'm going slightly blind from rage so I'm going to go bed.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0In case his imaginary lawyers are reading this, that was tongue-in-cheek; if I ever stabbed the XY I'd aim higher**** \u00a0Which isn't to say I'd ever actually stab my ex-husband, solicit anyone else in seriousness to stab him for me, or be creative enough to find any way of effing up his life any further than he already has on his own. Yes, I have an MFA in the creative field, but that shithead is a self-sabotage savant and half the reason we divorced is that I realized he didn't need me in his life to accomplish his evident goal of being a miserable fucking wretch, but I DID need him OUT of MY life to accomplish my own goal of remaining a pacifist.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834019affe63256970c-pi", "http://thebloggess.com/2013/10/im-probably-going-to-get-yelled-at-for-this/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amber-rogers/body-composition-that-las_b_4066450.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/10/two-things-worth-reading-that-i-didnt-write.html", "title": "two things worth reading that I didn't write"},
{"date": "November 13, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Last night I had to have an actual phone conversation with my ex-husband. Oy. I only actually speak to the ex maybe once or twice a month, because it's highly unproductive, unpleasant, bad for the kids to witness if it's face-to-face, and did I mention how freaking unpleasant it is? But I had an open-enrollment counseling session scheduled and wanted to see what The XY's dental plan would cover as far as orthodontics, since Big Child was just referred for a braces consult by MFA Dentist; if it didn't cover braces or didn't cover very much I thought it might be worth adding just Big Child to my dental insurance and using it as a secondary plan for him. OHMYGOD. It was, at most, a five-minute conversation and I STILL have a headache, plus I didn't learn much about the XY's dental coverage, although I now know that if I expect him to pay the court-mandated 66% of medical expenses over $250 on this one I better make damn sure Big Child sees the cheapest orthodontist in town (ummmno, he will see the one MFA Dentist, who we trust, recommended, thankyouverymuch), because the XY knows how naive I am and the world is full of con-artists. Sigh.\r\n* \u00a0 This morning I waited on a table consisting of a man, his wife, and their teenage son, and the man was just THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE EVER. Not to me, he was perfectly pleasant to me, but he was berating his wife nonstop. \"GET A BAGEL, ORDER SOMETHING, IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR STOMACH WILL BE GROWLING AND IT WILL EMBARRASS ME. YOU DO NEED TO DIET BUT YOU CAN START TOMORROW, HURRY UP, THE SERVER IS WAITING!\" I wanted to slip the poor woman a note telling her she looked great and didn't have to put up with that crap and offering to be a witness in their divorce hearing should she ever need one, or at the very least spill something ice-cold on the guy's crotch. The worst part was their poor son, who was staring fixedly at the table as his father scolded and belittled his mother. Just...ugh.\r\n* \u00a0 I saw on the Twitter where a blogger (many of you probably know who I'm talking about, but let's leave any naming of names out of this post and its comments) proudly posted a picture drawn by their young elementary-aged child that included the word \"fucking\" as part of the caption, and wanted to cry. See, I'm no prude but here is the thing: I was a foul-mouthed little kid raised by damn-the-man parents and in retrospect it SUCKED. Adults disapproved of me (and having been taught that it was perfectly okay for kids to curse if their parents said it was cool I just thought grownups didn't like me because there was something wrong with me), kids weren't allowed to play with me, and I spent a lot of time with the guidance counselor in elementary school until I learned to act a different way in public than I did at home. I know I'm probably offending a couple of readers by saying this, but people there is nothing cool or hip about letting your small child swear with abandon. You don't necessarily have to shelter them completely (in fact, I feel like that's almost as harmful because then you're letting other kids educate them on What Those Words Mean). My kids never hear me curse, EVER (with the exception of Festivus), because while I have a mouth like a trucker when I'm among other adults or blabbering on the innernet, I want to set the example that swear words are Not For Daily Use (that way when the first one crashes my car and I go YOU WRECKED THE FUCKING CAR??? they'll understand that shit has gotten real). I've never punished anyone in this house for language, mostly because it's never been an issue. They know they can ask me what any word means without fear of punishment for saying it. I'll provide an age-appropriate definition and describe the type of context the word might be used in and then let them know it's not a word they're allowed to use, and so far nobody in this house under the age of thirty has engaged in any swearing outside of Festivus. At Hotter's urging I've lightened up a little; the boys are allowed to say \"fart\" now, because yeah, it does sound weird for a middle-schooler to say \"poot\" and I don't want my kid to get picked on by his peers. But that's probably about as far as I'll go while these people live under my roof.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/11/things-that-made-me-say-ew.html", "title": "things that made me say \"ew\""},
{"date": "June 24, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJob: Nothing to report as of yet. DAMN IT.\r\nFeelings Pills: Effexor XR for the moment. Hotter keeps trying to surprise me with sad animal pictures and see if I burst into tears. So far, no tears! Although I had a nightmare that the pills were not working and I lost my shit over someone crumpling up a brown paper bag. I don't know if that's clinically significant or not. Am hoping to have insurance soon and therefore be able to switch back to Pristiq if Effexor XR and I do not play nicely together, which brings us to...Insurance: I just talked to Anthem's underwriting department, which made me feel totally dumb and inadequate. They were like \"When was the FIRST time in the past two years that you were treated for bronchitis?\" and I was all \"do normal people know this kind of thing?\" Then they were wanting to know what DOSAGE of Symbicort I took that one time and look, it was whatever my doctor had a free sample of, it was a red and gray plastic inhaler that tasted like ass. After that they wanted to know my exact diagnosis for which I take antidepressants, which DUH, DEPRESSION. Major or minor, they wanted to know. I was like \"well I guess minor, I mean, I've never been in the hospital for it or anything.\" One three-way call with my psychiatrist's office later and I can state with authority that I have been billed in the past for treatment for \"dysthymic disorder.\" AKA non-major depression. Which, that's pretty much what I said, but apparently Anthem was questioning either a) my memory or b) my mental health after my not knowing or caring what was in the red and gray inhaler. By the end of the call I kind of didn't blame them. So yeah, no word on THAT just yet either.\u00a0\r\nThe Crazy Person Who Reads My Blog: Stopped checking umpteen times per day from their iPad via the IP address I mentioned\u00a0after I called them out and started reading just as feverishly from their cell phone.

{"date": "October 16, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 I haven't blogged lately mostly because I've been lowly worm. I reinjured my back a bit uprooting pokeweed with my barehanded feelings (the same ones I had when last I wrote), and caught the 'flu-like ailment that's been making the rounds in my workplace. It's this super-awesome virus that takes ten to twelve days to resolve and runs the gamut from GI unpleasantness through chest, throat, and sinus pain, with general malaise throughout. FUNTIMES!\r\n* \u00a0 The kitten somehow got out and spent several hours IN THE COLD, WHILE IT RAINED. Despite that he's fine. I'm not!\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of the kitten, those of you familiar with pitbulls will not be surprised to hear that Isis has adopted him. After his outdoor fright the kitten was chilly and scared enough to try returning the feelings, and now Isis is the proud mama to a hairless kitten. He nurses on her and everything, which freaks Hotter out, but bottom line is Isis + Skeeter = <3 <3 <3 and it is RIDICULOUSLY CUTE.\r\n\r\nFigure One: \"Pieta.\"\r\n* \u00a0 What's NOT cute, even a little bit, is that Hotter found a possum in Squatter Workshop on top of the henhouse--A FUCKING POSSUM! He chased it outside with a shovel. I am NOT OKAY WITH POSSUMS and was disappointed that he didn't come get me. \"You're sick! What would you have done?\" \"GOTTEN OFF MY SICKBED AND BEAT IT TO DEATH,\" said I, and then he tried to make me feel better about there having been a possum by saying it didn't move very fast and he thought it was sick. And also it had a fuzzy tail (yes, I know, they don't HAVE fuzzy tails, but Hotter says he saw what he saw). So it's a sick, mutant possum. Greeeeat.\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of Hotter and seeing things, I took him back to the eye doctor today and they confirmed that his cataract is worse and scheduled a date before the end of the month to remove it.\r\n* \u00a0 And speaking of major medical procedures, the younger two children both got 'flu shots today, as did Hotter. Big Child and I did not have doctors' appointments today and so remain unvaccinated thus far, which caused Big Child to lament that when he does get his 'flu vaccine this year he doesn't know which side to ask for it in, because his left side is the side where \u00a0he broke his collarbone and has been through quite enough trials and tribulations this year, plus he didn't want to re-injure anything with a needle, but his right side is his favorite one because he is right-handed. Both littles and I pointed out that the 'flu shot doesn't GO in your collarbone but rather in your upper arm, and Big Child insisted that when his collarbone ached from the recent change of weather it ached exactly where he'd gotten his last 'flu shot. \"Then that wasn't your collarbone aching,\" I informed him. \"IT WAS SO, I REMEMBER THAT PAIN,\" he insisted, and so I think this has become like Sophie's Choice for him. Will he incapacitate his writing arm and risk academic ruin? Will he rebreak his Achilles Heel collarbone and become a mere mortal? WHAT WILL HE DO? Stay tuned!\r\n* \u00a0 Cat farts: fecking 'orrid things! Lord.\r\n* \u00a0 Today the visitor deck at Local Teaching Hospital was full, so I had to valet-park the MFA Beater to take Hotter to Transplant Clinic. I left the Beater reluctantly in the valets' hands, worried its' trick clutch would act up but lacking a better option, and we emerged two hours later to find the Beater exactly where we'd left it (blocking half the valet circle in front of the hospital). Hotter doesn't think I should have paid them anything, seeing as how they failed utterly to park the car. I...am willing to call the cash a storage fee.\r\n* \u00a0 Because they bother the everloving shit out of me, Hotter has taken it upon himself to advocate for the possums of the world. \"What's a possum again,\" one of the children wanted to know. \"THE POSSUM IS ONE OF GOD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURES,\" Hotter intoned. I'm going to throw a shoe at him, I swear...\r\n* \u00a0 My mouthguard is missing. I am very, very sad about that.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU? Have you seen my mouthguard? Battled any possums lately? Had your 'flu shot? Tell me all about it.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834019b00151911970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/10/worm.html", "title": "worm"},

This means that I am still in the running! I've been angsting over not having gotten a call back yet (as those of you who know my on the facespace or follow me on the Twitter are WELL-aware), but I guess they just wanted to make sure my criminal background check came back okay before putting the time and wo/manpower into calling references. YAY!\u00a0 \u00a0If I get the job, I may just be able to avoid getting evicted/having something vital turned off/sending the kids to live with my ex. It won't be PRETTY, but...I might be able to keep all the plates spinning on top of their wobbly sticks with a little creative juggling.\u00a0 \u00a0Also, some GREAT news: we got a letter from the elementary school today letting us know they are recommending that MIDDLE CHILD begin participating in the school's accelerated learners program for mathematics next year! What the HECK with my kids and all the crazy math achievements lately?!? Apparently the hospital switched that baby, too, but I am not giving HIM back either :) GO MIDDLY! I am especially proud considering that when he was three and four we weren't even sure he'd be able to successfully participate in a mainstream classroom. Three cheers for early intervention and one very hard-working little boy!*\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I debated even sharing this here, because that awful woman who sent me the eleventy-kajillion increasingly incoherent and outrageous e-mails seems to have a hard-on for my pride in my childrens' accomplishments in particular and accused me of making up Big Child's awards and recognitions. As those of you who saw the photos on the facespace are aware, I most certainly did nothing of the sort, but it still stung because I really don't brag about my kids half as much as I'd LIKE to on here. I don't want to be that obnoxious mommy-blogger who thinks her kids are better than everyone else's (and I don't, I just think they're the best kids I'VE got). But y'know what, FUCK HER. I'm not going to let some random stranger's psychotic break keep me from sharing something so amazing, so yeah: I'm proud of my kid and I bragged on my blog. Mea culpa!

{"date": "June  6, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Today got off to a rocky start, and didn't really get much better from there. I e-mailed The XY yesterday to ask whether, seeing as how his late payment of the child support had cost me my health insurance coverage, he'd be willing to cover the most expensive out-of-pocket drug as a goodwill gesture.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Go ahead and laugh at me, Hotter did. But see, I can't maintain the level of ill will I bear for my ex-husband in good conscience without at least giving him the OPPORTUNITY to Do The Right Thing. As I explained to Hotter, The XY and I are both Jews, and the fine arts of guilt-induction and blame-assignment are very important to our people.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The XY remains committed to his course of ever-increasing twatwhistlery, however, and threw in some bonus bullshit about how HIS child support isn't for MY health insurance, and Anthem wouldn't just DROP me like that (hahaha oh how I wish he was right about that), and it's my fault for not paying the bill on time anyway, but he guessed this was my way of asking for a loan and he SUPPOSED he could swing it in order to help me out AS AN OLIVE BRANCH even after all of the grief I have caused him IF I could promise a swift repayment. And then he launched into this long, sad tale of why he can't take the children for his weekend THIS time. And I will say that I'm proud of myself for not telling him to shove his olive branch up his arse. Instead I counted to ten and e-mailed him back saying that I'd only wanted to give him a chance to help mitigate the damage his delinquent payment had caused, but clearly he still did not prioritize doing the right thing any more than he ever had and clearly didn't care what happened to me AS A DIRECT RESULT of his actions (or, in this case, inactions), and I was not interested in setting a precedent of money-lending between us and thought it best that we both go back to keeping our personal struggles to ourselves. I then told him that a simple yes or no to his visitation would suffice in the future and life happens, so spare me the crying and oversharing about his life, the weather, and the traffic because *I* really didn't care what his latest excuse for not taking the limited parenting time available to him was.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0TL; DR - The XY retains his title as The Lord of the Douche.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0From there my day continued to suck with a desperate paperwork faxing hustle to avoid Big Child being dropped from his summer program for the gifted (mission accomplished THERE, thank goodness), me blubbering all over poor Hotter for no good reason (except that I'd skipped a dose of Pristiq trying to buy some time for Anthem to potentially pull their heads out of their arses, because once I pay out-of-pocket for the Pristiq I won't be able to pay Anthem even if I do get a managerial exception and they're willing to take all my money and give me back my coverage), spraying perfume in my eye while getting ready for work, and walking into everybody at work in shitty moods.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At work I was at least able to pull it together; something in me turns on the perky at all costs in front of co-workers and guests, and despite having sniffled most of the way there I managed to fix my face in the parking lot and wade into the shitstorm with a smile. And I guess maybe there's something to the whole \"fake it till you feel it\" thing, because I'm drained and anxious and bone-weary of everything being such a fucking struggle, but at least my face has stopped leaking.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If I disappear for a bit don't necessarily assume the absolute worst, but if things get any worse it'll definitely be for the best that I clam up for a bit, both to deprive Stalky of the spank-bank material and also to avoid being a bummer to y'all in general.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Send baby animals, prepaid hitmen, and brand-name SSR/Norepinephrine Inhibitors, please.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/06/faking.html", "title": "faking"},

{"date": "June 10, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I'm still alive! Things are considerably less grim here now that my bloodlevel of Pristiq has stabilized, or at least they SEEM that way, and perception is everything, AMIRITE? Here are some updates:\r\n* \u00a0 I bit the bullet and picked up the Pristiq, which meant giving up on Anthem, but oh well. As long as I don't get bronchitis or break a bone in the next month or so I'll be able to get on my employer's coverage at that point and this'll just be one more cringe-worthy memory. A reader-turned-Twitterfriend-turned-facespace-friend gave me a discount program code that saved me $30 on the prescription, which was a huge moral victory in that it took the cost from just OVER my former monthly premium amount to just UNDER it. SUCK ON THAT, ANTHEM!\r\n* \u00a0 The title comes from the fact that one of the Feed Store Six is...not a hen. About a week ago SOMEbody started up with this sad, half-whispered puberty-crow, and we've been trying to identify the culprit ever since. We'd hear the pathetic little quasi-crow, and turn around, and all six birds would be standing in a clump looking at us going \"peep?\" This morning Hotter caught Flash II in the act, though. Chicken soup to follow! If I'm honest it's kind of a relief that one of the six younger birds is not keeper-material, because that means I can let one of the older four stay, and while I am not one to get emotional about smallstock (anymore) (much), there is one bird among the older ones who thinks she is a pet and runs up to crouch at my feet for petting when I go outside. And while I have a heart shaped like an axe, I don't think I can butcher something that LIKES me! The other three would cheerfully kill and eat ME if they could, so they're fine to go in the pot, Blacktop (the friendly chicken) can stay on as our \"chicken emeritus\" and show the five younger girls the ropes, and we won't be in violation of the c(o)unty's six-bird limit or in danger of landlordly censure thanks to Trashcan Neighbor, who has our landlord on speed-dial, over a rooster.\r\n* \u00a0 The new job continues to be good! It's slightly less money than \"The Ritz,\" but MUCH less physically demanding, and a much friendlier environment. I actually like some of my co-workers! The kitchen staff fills scrap bags for my animals! Management appreciates me, and tells me so on the regular! The hours are less favorable in that I now mostly work evenings (at \"The Ritz\" I mostly worked mornings), but evenings at The Ritzier are where the money is, so I'm okay with it.\r\n* \u00a0 The only thing I really dislike about the new job is that the most expedient route from home to work takes me directly through the neighborhood where I last saw The Narcissist alive; it's a long and unpleasant story but her final shitfit caused there to be a police search for her involving everything up to and including HELICOPTERS, and me, mere days out from not one but TWO abdominal surgeries, being stranded with my kids talking to the police about the old bitch IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. It's a nice neighborhood (another plus to the new job is that I don't have to drive through any shady areas of town where I feel compelled to lock the doors of the MFA Minivan), but puts me in a funky frame of mind that's not the best way to start a workday. Taking an alternate route only adds about two minutes to the commute but feels like admitting defeat, or at least it did...the past few days I've given myself permission to just go ahead and take the long way; I rationalize it by telling myself that highway miles are easier on a vehicle and more fuel-efficient. I think I'm going to give myself permission to take the highway from now on.\r\n* \u00a0 The XY is spiraling down into utter douchebaggery of late; he hasn't taken his visitation since he paid the child support late earlier this month except for one dinner visit where he picked the boys up two and a half hours late and returned them half an hour early, and the boys reported that they spent most of that abbreviated visit at Home Depot running errands with him.

I don't want to be overly specific, but my day involved, in various effed-up ways, the US Military, a minor on-the-job accident (I am totally fine, but there are procedures that must be followed with these things...), a good-faith attempt at mandatory post-accident drug-testing on my part that revealed a monumental paperwork SNAFU between The Ritz and the local Urgent Care clinic, a brush with upper-level management at The Ritz ON A WEEKEND to straighten things out and ensure that we were all in compliance with company policy, and Hotter going missing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The end-result is that I can't go back to work until my pee is processed, which is why I was so eager to get that done in a timely manner (I even offered to pay for the test myself out of pocket if someone would reimburse me, which was why Management got involved in the first place), and that takes two to three days, so I have some unexpected and unpaid time off during which I get to stew over how I sometimes seem to be the only person working at The Ritz who actually remembers all of the policies and procedures (the security supervisor who processed the Incident Report wasn't aware I had to be drug-tested, didn't have the proper forms to give me for that, and wasn't aware of the \"no working until drug test comes back\" rule...and then they asked me out, which OMG I AM TECHNICALLY YOUR SUBORDINATE AND MARRIED TO BOOT). I am going to have one HUMDINGER of a debriefing with HR tomorrow! As for Hotter going missing, he was well aware that I had had a very stressful day but chose to disafuckingppear without any keys, jackets, or dogs so that I got home and spent twenty minutes searching the house and yard for a body, because I have NEVER come home and not been able to find him. He just doesn't go anywhere. EXCEPT FOR YESTERDAY. And when he finally did turn up, I discovered that Pfeffer had had babies AND EATEN THEIR BRAINS LIKE A FUCKING ZOMBIE GAHHHH!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At that point, I will not lie, I decided that tennish weeks of not drinking was long enough to satisfy me that there was no chemical dependency issue at play and I did purchase and consume some Real Absinthe, with wormwood and everything, and take a hot bath (with Hotter supervising to ensure that I didn't pull a Whitney Houston). I am mildly disappointed to report that I did not hallucinate or anything, although as I pointed out to Hotter, given the kind of day I had had if the walls started to bleed I would have doubted that I was actually hallucinating and just put on a pair of gloves and gone looking for bodies (AGAIN. OMG HOTTER).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then I slept for fourteen hours.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. Big Child says \"How do you make a plumber cry? KILL HIS FAMILY!\"\r\nP.P.S.

Shortly after I wrote my last post, I got glutenated by some pizza that I am guessing was cross-contaminated (it was from a large pizza chain that until last week had managed not to cross-contaminate me, to my delight UNTIL LAST WEEK). As soon as I finished eating I had a horrible stomachache, like I'd swallowed a burning bowling ball, and things continued to follow the usual pattern of glutenation with me of Day One GI Unrest, Day Two Everything Hurts, Day Three EVERYTHING IS A HORRIBLE URGENT TRAGEDY OH GOD WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE CRYING? Day Three reminded me that while I may have a chronic depression issue, at least it does not generally get in the way of my living a fairly normal life. Day Three, though...boy. THAT was in the way!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Somewhere in the middle of the glutenation my ex-husband got up to some fairly epic fuckery.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter courteously waited until the day AFTER that to get sick. And by \"sick\" I mean \"his usual GI stuff got so bad that his electrolytes were out of whack and his BP was low and I invoked the Local Teaching Hospital.\" Funnily enough, Hotter's sickness came on shortly after he abandoned the gluten-free diet he'd been sticking to and started eating wheat again, and when he went back to being gluten-free things improved again so HMMM! You guys, I swear I'm not going to turn into one of those gluten zealots who claims that going GF will cure anything that ails you from acne to autism. But...damn. *gives gluten the side-eye*\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Every once in a great while, when life has been kicking my ass more than usual, I harken back to my fat alcoholic roots and hold a \"cake and a six-pack\" day wherein I bake a cake for no good reason and purchase a six-pack and silence my internal nutrition nag and spend a day consuming the cake and the six-pack.

Look of outrage on my face not pictured (to preserve pseudonymity, natch).\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently Steve had grown to the size of a baseball and put up quite a fight on the way out, so my doctor had had to abandon the robotic procedure, re-drape the field, and get all scalpel-happy on my midsection.\u00a0 Okay, said I, fair enough; my lawyer was having a harder than expected time removing the other malignancy in my life at the time and whattayagonnado, y'know?\u00a0 I wasn't even all that surprised when I got peritonitis a couple of days later and got a bonus second surgery, from which I awakened attached to a couple of these bad boys.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Good times.\u00a0\u00a0 Steve turned out to be benign, I lost twenty-five pounds from not eating while I had peritonitis, and all in all the entire Steviction debacle of Aught-Nine had started to look like a boon to MFA-kind once firmly ensconced in the rosy glow of the rear-view mirror.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 But.\u00a0\u00a0 Oh yes, there is always a but.\u00a0 See, I had naively figured that with no uterus and 50% less grrlnads I'd be done with PMS forever.\u00a0 And PMS?\u00a0 It's not my friend, y'all.\u00a0 It makes my boobs all ouchy for like, a week, then I get a giant zit in some really odd location and crave sex, salt, and chocolate, usually in that order, and finally I get monumentally stupid and spend the next two or so days in a fugue-state during which I can't finish a sentence or stay awake for more than a couple of hours at a time (I also cry at the drop of a hat and become convinced that I am going to die: poor Hotter!).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It turns out that doing a hysterectomy and removing one grrlnad is kind of like castrating rapists: the rate of recidivism may drop for the most part, but sometimes you'll end up with an outlier who not only continues their crimes against humanity, but now as a result of the surgery leaves no forensic evidence when they commit their crime of choice.\u00a0\u00a0 Last month Hotter and I realized that there was a cyclical nature to my\r\nperiods (oh ha!

family therapy, time with a lawyer, and time in front\r\n of a judge are not--SEE?), which would just give me a permanent and \r\nunbecoming case of The Crazy Eye, I thought maybe when I found something\r\n that helps me save a little I'd share my experience with y'all and \r\nmaybe it'll help you too.\u00a0 I am not receiving any compensation from any of the companies I'm about to mention (although if one of them reads this and wants to offer me a kickback my e-mail is on the \"About\" page!), just sharing information because I am a giver.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 For example, if you haven't already signed up for a Bing.com cash \r\nback account?\u00a0 You're totally missing out.\u00a0 It's free and you can earn \r\nvarying percentages of \"cash back\" on purchases from participating sites\r\n (which include some of the big names like Sears, Home Depot, Circuit \r\nCity, Best Buy, etc. as well as a lot of specialty retailers of just \r\nabout anything--you can either search Bing.com itself or if you're \r\nlooking for a particular store you can go to the \"shopping\" tab and \r\nselect \"cash back stores\" you can get an alphabetized list--it's worth noting that you can usually order gift cards from participating sites at the cash-back rate as well) if you go to\r\n the site via Bing.com and pay with PayPal.\u00a0 There's not really a catch, although you have to wait 60 days to get your cash back (you can have them deposit it directly into your PayPal or bank account, or get it in Amazon.com gift cards and I think there's an option to get a check but with a fee).\u00a0 You can even use Bing.com to get cash back on e-Bay purchases, but only on \"Buy it Now\" items, sadly.\u00a0\u00a0 Drugstore.com (which gives you 10% cash back and free delivery on orders over $49, plus 5% \"drugstore dollars,\" which you can only use on their site) is probably my personal favorite, because they sell all of the non-food items you would ordinarily buy at the grocery store at fairly competitive prices (sometimes you can do better at your local supermarket if you take the price at face value, but remember, 15% TOTAL CASH BACK).\u00a0 If you've never shopped there before, it's worth doing a search for \"Drugstore.com coupon codes,\" and you can find deals for new customers ranging from 20% off your entire order to $10 off plus free shipping on orders over $25.\u00a0 They also have \"online coupons\" you can click to use on certain products, and occasionally offer 20% cashback on just Nintendo or Hamilton Beach products (my kids' holiday gifts and our new crockpot came from Drugstore.com!) or free gifts (like right now if you buy two Fekkai products you can get a free travel-size Glossing Cream with olive oil, and I'm a total slut for Fekkai; the Glossing Cream is my favorite product of theirs).\u00a0 We get all of our paper products and toiletries from here, and stock up on sale items (if you happen to need Miralax, which Little Child does, daily, they often have the big bottles on sale for $19.99 so I keep an eye out for that).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 If you're looking for grocery-groceries, at least the non-perishable kind, Meijer's participates in the Bing.com cash back program (their regular rate appears to be 4% currently, although for a new customer it's 15%!!!), and if you sign up for a Meijer's \"account\" on their site (not a line of credit or anything, just creating a login) you'll get a welcome e-mail giving you a coupon code for free shipping on any order over $75 (ordinarily the cut-off is much higher).\u00a0 They only sell by the case (and the selection is limited but includes some stuff we use, like Campbell's soups, Gatorade, Stovetop Stuffing, canned tomato sauce, etc.), but it's worth doing at least once at the new-customer cash back rate.\u00a0\u00a0 We usually buy \"EUC\" (excellent used condition, yo) clothes on e-Bay, but Old Navy does Bing, and there are a ton of shoe stores on Bing.com, some of which give hefty cash back percentages (we've bought sneakers from Shoebuy.com and had good experiences with them).\u00a0\u00a0 Looking for appliances, furniture, a lawnmower or something else gigantic and heavy to ship?\u00a0 Most of the home improvement chains will let you buy online and pick your item up at a local store.\u00a0\u00a0 And that's about all I have to say right now, because we're mid-drama here and if I started complaining this would be ten pages long.\u00a0 What are you doing to save money lately that's worth sharing?\u00a0 Talk to me!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fekkai.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/03/a-cheapskates-guide-to-online-shopping.html", "title": "a cheapskate's guide to online shopping"},

This isn't something I'm likely to be doing very often, but I've discovered that once you have a job code for a department, you can usually pick up work there if they are desperate for bodies or someone calls out on a busy day. So that's nice.\r\n* \u00a0 I also went back to work in the department I quit working in a while back. They fired the two worst workers since I was there last, and it's a much more pleasant environment now in terms of the people I work with there. That's the good news! The bad news is that it's still pretty chaotic and really physically grueling. But it pays well! I don't know, I may well end up quitting it again, but this is something I'm very good at that can be a lot of fun when it goes well.\r\n* \u00a0 It turns out the culprit in my recent glutenation was a handful of jellybeans I ate at work during a moment of stress when a co-worker offered me the bag. I started to say no thank you but I really like jellybeans and figured there wasn't much chance of there being gluten in them, except no: modified food starch. Which contains gluten. GOD DAMN IT. I learned this when I went to buy myself a bag of the same brand of jellybean at the grocery store and now I'm sad.\r\n* \u00a0 Because life loves me, right after my last post I came down with pinkeye, although I didn't miss any work because I went to the doctor BETWEEN the shifts of a split double at the first signs of trouble and got some antibiotic drops before my eyes looked bad enough to advertise that I had The Filth. Don't worry, I practiced obsessively good hand hygiene. Like, more so than usual even :)\r\n* \u00a0 There has been some epic fuckery of the interpersonal variety amongst various parties at work, which has made life unduly interesting in a \"DO NOT WANT\" kind of way, but I think it's winding down now, so that's good.\r\n* \u00a0 I am SO tired/broke down/busted-up/burned out. Ten shifts in six days may just be the last stop before my absolute breaking point. I think I need to find myself a foot and ankle specialist, because between Paul on one side and my jacked-up ankle on the other that started hurting mid-February and has only gotten worse, I think I need at least one cortisone shot. But then I might just need to rest for a bit, since one knee and the other hip and my back and everyotherdamnthing is also acting up and it's possible I'm just really fucking worn-out.\r\n* \u00a0 I was simultaneously outraged and elated to find that the closest feed store was giving away six chicks with any feed purchase, and came home with six \"Araucanas.\" Although I'll be surprised if any of them are rumpless and only one has wee puffy cheek tufts. They'll be cool-looking birds that lay blue and green eggs, though, I'm sure and that is all I really want. Well, that and for Skeeter to quit acting like MFA Birdie's old cage is his personal Easter basket:\r\nFigure One:\u00a0Although I'm not really sure what I *thought* would happen when I put out a six-pack of nuggets under a warming lamp with a cat in the house.

In that dream, convincing the authorities that I had the flat-Stanley Fuhrer in my house and to come and remove him was a challenge, and nobody else seemed nearly as exercised about the whole thing as I was. Other than that it's just the usual run-of-the-mill anxiety dreams that I have when something's eating at me, with a ridiculous twist here and there.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Things at work are kind of here and there. The Bastard has taken a leave of absence, which is nice, because it means I'm able to work in the more lucrative department I left to avoid him. Someone else is acting the fool though, which sucks. But hey, it's always SOMEthing in life, and at least my next paycheck will be less pitiful than the last one (we are SO BROKE at the moment).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I checked Bravo Hive and they died after all. I'm not having much luck in locating more bees at this late (bee-wise) date, and may have to be bee-less for a year.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I guess maybe I'm a little depressed at the moment, which is no fun, but it could always be worse, right? RIGHT.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/04/the-flat-stanley-fuhrer-and-other-tales-of-ridiculous-woe.html", "title": "the flat-Stanley Fuhrer and other tales of ridiculous woe"},

GO BIG CHILD!\r\n* \u00a0 Middle Child has been reading a ton. Whenever he mentions a book he really wants to read and can't find in the school library, I buy it for him and send it to his Kindle if the budget allows, because BOOOOOOOKS!\r\n* \u00a0 Little Child...oh Little Child. When Little Child was a baby I spoiled him. Some of it was by necessity; he spent several months with an NG tube in and couldn't be further from me than arm's reach, and later on after he got his g-tube he was on continuous overnight feeds for a pretty long time, so he slept next to me because he's an active sleeper and I didn't want him to get tangled up on the food-line and pull his tube out or get formula all over himself. Some of it was stuff like letting him keep his pacifier until he was three and generally terrorize the household, because until he was about five no one was sure if he'd live or die, and if my baby was possibly going to die I wasn't going to deprive him of anything his health allowed that he enjoyed. A lot of people asked me what I was going to do if the kid DID get better, because he'd be a rotten little shit, and I always said that I would be delighted to have that problem and wouldn't be bothered. Now? I am having to walk my talk on that one, and that is all I'll say today about Little Child :)\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter has diagnosed himself via the innernet with Celiac disease, and decided to go gluten-free to see if it helps his ongoing GI woes and extreme difficulty with maintaining enough bodyfat to not shiver all the time and have to wear Big Child's hand-me-downs. I pointed out that his GI doctor had run some blood tests that indicated he did NOT have Celiac disease, but conceded that an intestinal biopsy, which he has NOT had, was the definitive test \u00a0and agreed that his going gluten-free for a while was a less-risky proposition than general anesthesia (which disturbs his precarious neurological state in scary ways) and messing with his intestines, which his donor pancreas is attached to, in ANY WAY.

{"date": "July 18, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't want to admit it, but a lot of my depression of late has been work-related, and the reason I didn't want to admit it was a) didn't I just HAVE a shitty job? I'm giving mySELF the side-eye here because I am the common denominator in two back-to-back shitty jobs now and b) Hotter would be pissed at me. But I just can't go on being this miserable, and after last night I can safely say that what is going wrong at The Ritzier is NOT in any way my fault.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Ritzier is a great establishment, but unfortunately my manager there is a verbally abusive, belligerent drunk. This isn't just my assessment. There have been statements as to his drunkenness made and signed by entire shifts' worth of employees. Upper management has flat-out said things like \"this guy needs to go. We are trying to fire him, but he's already threatening to sue us and we need a blood alcohol level to support terminating him, and he keeps evading that. We are so sorry you have to work with him\" and \"____, what the hell is wrong with you talking to MFA Mama like that?!? That is inappropriate, unprofessional, and constitutes harassment!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The whole thing kind of breaks my brain, and last night Drunk Boss tried to send me home \"for being a whiny little bitch\" (I needed a manager override for something and he resented being called to the restaurant because he is always super-busy elsewhere) (by which he means drinking and perusing the job listings on Craigslist), I went to the AGM and tried to quit, he begged me to \"hang in there\" and talked me down and yelled at Drunk Boss and said he wasn't allowed to send me home for asking him to do his job, and I spent my entire lunch break LITERALLY crying on the shoulder of my gay work-grandpa (that's a story for a happier post but I just love that guy!), finished my shift, came home, and told Hotter I'm looking for another job.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That did not go over well. Hotter's concern for our family's financial survival manifests in the form of a lot of \"every workplace has issues!\" and \"you'll never find a serving job without drama, so why leave a place with benefits?\" and \"you just need to be more assertive!\" (which frankly sounds very victim-blamey to me, that last one, and also really fucking insensitive given that I've been on the receiving end of a lot of violence in my life and therefore REALLY DO NOT ENJOY CONFRONTATION) (plus also I TRY! Last night I stood up to Drunk Boss, with the AGM's support and backing, but you can't reason with a belligerent drunk and I don't think it'll improve the situation any).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, I'm looking for another job, and Hotter initially tried to be all \"I support you doing whatever will help you be happier\" (I suspect because I was a total wreck last night and female tears are Hotter's kryptonite) but has, as I feared, devolved into making a lot of \"I love you, but...\" statements, and yes I broke the Blogging Prime Directive and talked about work, but the worst-case scenario there is that Stalky somehow figures out where I work and I get Dooced and honestly that would kind of be a relief at this point (mind you, being even very temporarily jobless would suck, but I can handle poverty better than THIS).

IT) - found me through The Checkout Girl, who is hilarious, and left a link.\u00a0 Funny stuff, y'all!Allison - another blogless wonder, but she delurked and I <3 her for it!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://childing.blogspot.com/", "http://nannyanya.blogspot.com/", "http://the-view-from-the-hill.blogspot.com/", "http://www.ps121ismyfriend.blogspot.com", "http://www.devivo.blogspot.com/", "http://www.nutsinmay.wordpress.com/", "http://hairyfarmerfamily.wordpress.com/", "http://www.stellarparenting.blogspot.com/", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/", "http://rocketscientista.wordpress.com/", "http://www.twitter.com/justarikia", "http://www.thesweetnesswithin.blogspot.com/", "http://www.demosmedpub.com/prod.aspx?prod_id=9781932603323", "http://whendidmyhairturngray.blogspot.com/", "http://80srule.blogspot.com/", "http://www.dirtandrocks.blogspot.com/", "http://thegeekylibrarian.blogspot.com/", "http://fawnahareo.com/", "http://wellohyeah.blogspot.com/", "http://www.thecheckoutgirl.net"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/02/and-it-only-took-me-a-month.html", "title": "and it only took me a month..."},

The Wrath lost her job a couple of months ago and has been collecting unemployment while looking for another one, but the job market is grim in general, and especially for someone who is pushing eighty and doesn't own a car. Plus Lefty is out of jail (WHY? WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE FELONIES?) and I'm sure that's expensive for The Wrath, since she can't say no to him. My brother-in-law, Loud and Crazy, who lives off with her, has apparently started to panic that they will lose her their house and be out on the street. I'm not sure how likely that actually is, although it's certainly a possibility since Lefty drained her retirement account via a checkbook he stole (she never pressed charges because he's FAMILY and so the money is gone) and unemployment doesn't last forever. What I wasn't expecting to hear was that Hotter had assured The Wrath that she AND HER THREE CATS could always come and live with us.\u00a0 \u00a0I just...in THEORY I am not ENTIRELY against this; The Wrath is good people, she's Hotter's mom, and she has helped us out before. I certainly wouldn't turn her away if she had no other option. But we are already five people in 1,200 square feet sharing one bathroom (and one breadwinner, who is allergic to cats with fur).\u00a0There would need to be some very firm boundaries (i.e. This Is How Much You Contribute To The Household Bills From Your Pension Without Exception, Absolutely No More Animals, Lefty Isn't Allowed Here) that would, in and of themselves, probably be dealbreakers on her end (plus she doesn't want to live in The South).\u00a0And even then it would be A LOT. By which I mean I am 90% sure it would break me, or at the very least my marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0So that's swell.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In other news I have a job interview tomorrow for a position I don't exactly love the thought of, but I'd like to have a second job lined up just in case things go south at The Ritzier (Drunk Boss being gone is fabulous, yes, but we don't know who will be replacing him and it's possible the New Boss will be just as bad or even worse so I'm not letting my guard down or celebrating anything just yet).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/07/sandwich.html", "title": "sandwich?"},

I thought I could be cool with that, but no. I walked in and looked around and immediately felt all itchy. Strike one. Then the \"manager\" came to \"interview\" me. She had a tattoo of a pentagram on her middle finger. Strike two*. \"You...went to...college?\" I'm used to having the WTF Higher Education conversation with potential employers. They generally want to know why I want to be a waitress or bartender if I have a terminal degree. If they're educated themselves, they get that degrees (or at least, liberal arts degrees) do not unlock these magic doors that blast money at you any time you choose to open them, but this girl...not so much. She looked like she maybe had gotten a GED on her second or third try**. She explained that working the shifts I had indicated I was available, I would most likely earn $30-$50 per (six-hour) shift (STRIKE THREE YER OUTTA HERE!), and asked me if I was interested.\r\nFigure One:\u00a0This was me. I NOPE'd all the way to Trader Joe's, bought some wine and some organic kale for a baking project I intend to complete with the kids tomorrow on my day off, and went home. Tonight I work at The Ritzier, where I suspect I will be MUCH more content than I was before today's interview showed me what else was out there.\r\n* \u00a0 I have no problem with tattoos. I have tattoos. However, generic, ill thought-out tattoos in places that cannot be covered? NOPE.** \u00a0 I have no problem with GEDs. I have a GED. It was the most expedient way to skip high school and get started on my college education, which was what I had to do to avoid being homeless given that dorms are the only safe place a minor can live without either being emancipated or having a family/sugardaddy. When The Narcissist went buckass crazy and threw me out of the house at fifteen I decided I didn't want a sugardaddy, so I went to college. By the time I was seventeen The Narcissist decided I wasn't suffering adequately from being thrown out and ordered me to drop out and come home so that she could torture me, so I briefly acquired a lawyer sugardaddy in order to get legally emancipated. AH, MEMORIES! Anyway, having taken the GED I can honestly say that if it takes you more than one try to pass the thing and you weren't super-sick at the time or something, you should go ahead and have yourself sterilized. GED = SUPER EASY.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401a511e84622970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/07/nope-.html", "title": "nope   "},

Am a little disgusted with myself, honestly.\r\n* \u00a0 The Ritzier has been slow lately. I'm thinking of getting a part-time job, because Hotter really wants to take a trip to the Arctic Tundra to visit his family and the MFA Minivan is terminally ill and I think one of my front teeth is about to need some serious dental work.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Coincidentally, today I was offered a job at a strip club. Not taking my clothes off, just waiting tables (in a corset, booty shorts, and leggings). I'm considering it because a) it's crazy money b) I'm flattered, and c) it would be an interesting life experience to have that, if I want to give it a try, has a definite expiration date of sorts (I'm not getting any younger).\r\n* \u00a0 Last time I went to Trader Joe's I bought a jar of cornichons, because they are adorable and I'd always wanted to try them. Then I tasted them, and...WHAT FUCKERY IS THIS? Something tastes like...fennel? Anise? TARRAGON. I'm not sure how I feel about that.\r\n* \u00a0 Big Child's summer program for the gifted had a competition that parents were invited to attend, and I went. Big Child and his partner bombed in the first round but did well in the second. They didn't win or even place, but they weren't in last place or even next-to-last, and Big Child handled it with grace and good sportsmanship. I told him I was prouder of that than if he'd been a gracious winner, because it takes a lot more class, and that I couldn't be happier with him as my Number One Son. I'm pleased to report that thirteen is not too old to hug your mother around these parts.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter has taken to doing this thing lately where he kind of swings his dick around in a \"here is how it is going to be\" way and it's not cute. It shuts me right down, because I refuse to fight, especially in front of children, but I'm not sure he realizes the big-picture price of that kind of victory in the context of a marriage.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm still pretty fucking depressed. A longtime friend of mine recently started working at The Ritzier, but we have opposite schedules. Tonight was the first time we've worked together there and she kept kind of poking at me. \"Why aren't you more excited to see me? I feel like you should have all of these things to tell me, and you're just...quiet. WHAT IS GOING ON?\" I was like \"well, Hotter has been sick, and my ex has been a douche,** and I'm a little worried about my mental health because I can't seem to cheer the fuck up lately.\" Said friend is self-centered enough that she was like \"oh\" and proceeded to discuss her boy-problems. Which was fine. Or maybe it wasn't? I don't even know anymore.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n** \u00a0 The XY has hit a new low in co-parenting, and I'd be outraged except it wouldn't change anything and I kind of forget how to make the face for that emotion anyway. I haven't written about it on here because I try not to trash my ex online and there is nothing amusing about how badly he sucks as a father of late.

{"date": "February  1, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Gentle readers, I will not lie, we have been having a tough time here lately at Casa MFA due in part to the current pox on our household but largely to things I can't share with you here.\u00a0 Some of you who follow me on Twitter are already aware that...let's just say that there are serious factors external to my blended nuclear family under this-here roof that are having a terribly negative affect on my children's physical and emotional wellbeing, and that are quite emotionally taxing (but OH so necessary) for yours truly to talk through with them, and that is all we'll say about THAT.\u00a0\u00a0 So I have a kid who doesn't eat.\u00a0 He has a developmental delay and the accompanying array of sensory aversions, so the wrong flavor, texture, or level of overall messiness (things eaten with the hands that have sauce are out, as are things thinner than oatmeal that require a spoon because if they drip on his shirt GODIVA HELP US ALL) will not only turn him off at the table, but if you push the issue he'll gag and even vomit.\u00a0 It's frustrating as HECK.\u00a0 It's also not his fault.\u00a0 Said kid doesn't eat well when he's sick, which he is, or when he's sad or scared, which...yeah.\u00a0 Some things, like cheese, are not okay at all UNLESS on pizza, and other things, like eggs (good, cheap protein...mmm...) are just never okay, except when thoroughly disguised in baked goods, waffles, and French Toast, which I often make Big and Middle Children for breakfast, and lately that's been out too.\u00a0\u00a0 Middle Child is way too skinny; my ex-husband remarks on this to me constantly in a \"this will help me prove you suck as a mother in court\" sort of way, and likes to claim that Middle Child wouldn't be so skinny if HE had custody because the boy ALWAYS eats for him, but he has literally never fed the MFA Children anything besides restaurant pizza and Happy Meals when he's had them for visitation (according to the children anyway, and that's not them trying to get one over on me--Big Child actually laments the monotony of the menu).\u00a0 If that's all I ever served then Middle Child would probably eat without overmuch persuasion or creativity from me, too.\u00a0 Because I'm a sadist masochist bit more concerned with following the food pyramid and building healthy eating habits than the XY, though, I insist on things like WHOLE GRAINS and VEGETABLES and SUFFICIENT PROTEIN that does not contain KNOWN ALLERGENS.\u00a0 I know, right?\u00a0 I'm such a mean mom.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I promise y'all I'm not one of those \"we eat this because it's healthy even though it tastes like cardboard dipped in Omega-3 oil and dusted with wheatgerm on a bed of wilted spinach\" types (not that there's anything wrong with that; I'm not here to judge or condemn).\u00a0 I just do things like use half Splenda and half sugar in baking, half whole wheat and half regular unbleached flour in pizza crusts, lean meats cooked in EVOO and drained before adding to sauces, etc. and not to brag but most people, my ex-husband included, think my cooking is delicious.\u00a0 Also, it's a good thing I like to cook, because I usually end up making three separate menus per meal.\u00a0 The regular, delicious one that Big Child, Hotter and I eat, with spices, and sauces and flavor combinations.\u00a0 The \"hypo-allergenic\" version for Little Child with no dairy or soy products, strong acids that will aggravate his reflux, excessive fat or fiber to slow his GI motility even further, or artificial colors, cut into very tiny and easy-to-chew pieces on a tiny, tiny plate and mind you, Little Child takes PERHAPS five or six TEENSY bites per meal (usually less and often none at all) and is dependent on his g-tube and elemental formula for nutrition but I feel the social benefits of his having a meal with the family and the oral-motor practice he gets make the extra effort worthwhile.\u00a0 And finally, the Middle Child menu, with extra-light spices, nothing slimy, mustard on all meats, foods NEVER touching each other on the plate, and condiments served in medicine cups so that they don't make premature contact with the food itself and render it inedible.\u00a0\u00a0 This morning we had a snow day, so I agreed to make French Toast at Big Child's request (Big Child loves EVERYTHING I cook; that kid just likes to eat, period, and is the most gratifying person on earth to cook for because each meal is \"THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD, WOW MOMMY YOU SHOULD OPEN A RESTAURANT\" but he does have favorites and my French Toast is one of them) (bless!\u00a0 Every cook should have a Big Child around to make them feel good about themselves), and Middle Child started sobbing immediately about how he HATED French Toast, he wouldn't like it, he wouldn't eat it, he wouldn't get to play games because he'd be WASTING HIS TIME sitting at the table, he'd starve to death and die FOREVER, etc. (he will do this the entire time I cook on bad days even if it's something he likes; he's kind of like the little brother from A Christmas Story at the table, but, you know, TURNED TO ELEVEN as the kids say).\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes a change in texture makes all the difference in the world, and I was trying to think of a way to create sog-free French Toast.\u00a0 The result?\u00a0 Hotter was impressed.\u00a0 Big Child was in hog-heaven.\u00a0 And even Middle Child proclaimed it to be \"AWESOME\" (eventually...).MFA Mama's Very Fattening, Texturally Inoffensive French Toast(serves two adults, one child of average constitution, and one underweight five-year-old)You will need:\u00a0Implements of DestructionTwo mixing bowlsA large cast-iron frying panAn electric mixerA rubber scraper (you might call these \"spatulas\"--I am referring to those white thingies you use to frost cakes, which I call spatulas--but Hotter has informed me that that is a good way to flaunt one's culinary ignorance and spatulas are what you use to TURN things, not scrape or frost them)A spatula (the turning kind, a.k.a. \"a REAL spatula!\")IngredientsSix slices of bread (we use whole wheat)Two large eggs\r\nThree ounces of heavy whipping creamTwo tablespoons plus one teaspoon of sugarThe seedy goodness from a one-inch section of vanilla bean (I heartily recommend these)CinnamonA pinch of salt (I used this stuff, the fine version, because I happened to have some)ButterOptional (for you; mandatory for me)Ativan The Patience of Job1.\u00a0 Toast the bread on \"medium\" and put the frying pan on the stove over medium heat.2.\u00a0 Separate the eggs, reserving the yolks, and use an electric mixer to beat into stiff peaks, adding one tablespoon of sugar slooooowly as you beat (tip from the resident chef: adding sugar to egg whites as you beat them helps them fluff up faster and with less effort, which is particularly nice if the bowl you're using wasn't TOTALLY dry or you're beating them by hand).3.\u00a0 In the other bowl, whip the heavy cream, then add one egg yolk, cinnamon to taste, the pinch of salt, vanilla bean guts, and a tablespoon of sugar; beat until all of the vanilla bean goo has broken up into flecks.4.\u00a0 Pour the creamy vanilla mixture over the egg whites and whip them all together until they're thoroughly blended and the consistency of pancake batter.5.\u00a0 Using the scraper, spread this on both sides of five of the six pieces of bread so that they appear smooth, and set those in the bowl from the creamy vanilla mixture.\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Add the second egg yolk and the remaining teaspoon of sugar to the coating mixture left and coat the sixth piece of toast with that, leaving it to sit and absorb as much as it will take in (this is for the underweight five-year-old).7.\u00a0 Whirl a big hunk of butter around on the surface of the hot frying pan and fry the first five pieces until golden-brown and delicious (I usually add another sliver of butter to the pan when I lift each piece with the spatula before dropping it back down--this is not because the French Toast will stick, at least not if you've properly seasoned your pan, but because it ensures uniform golden-brown deliciousness).8.\u00a0 Put another big hunk of butter in the center of the pan and drop the sixth (extra-yolky) piece in the middle.\u00a0 While the first side is browning, use your scraper to pile coating mixture on top until it threatens to overflow, then stop.\u00a0 Slide the spatula underneath it, toss another big hunk of butter onto the pan, and flip.9.\u00a0\u00a0 Serve dusted with confectioner's sugar and choice of topping to the other adult, the child of average constitution, and yourself.\u00a0 Cut the underweight five-year-old's into bite-sized pieces, don't you DARE put anything on them, and present them on an otherwise-empty plate.\u00a0 Assure the underweight five-year-old that this is edible.\u00a0 Offer confectioner's sugar, maple syrup, honey, jam, whipped cream, or a nice crisp twenty if he'll just take a bite.\u00a0 Threaten to ban him from video games.\u00a0 Wipe his face.\u00a0 Tell him lovingly that this is not, in fact, \"torture\" according to the Geneva Convention.\u00a0 Studiously avoid eye-contact with your husband, lest one of you bust out laughing.\u00a0 Confiscate the underweight five-year-old's fork and remind him that we don't hurt ourselves or others, especially at the table, and give him until the count of three to put a piece of French Toast in his mouth or he can go and calm down in his room.\u00a0 Return the fork and deny having put eggs in any part of the food before him, because you KNOW he hates eggs, then remind him that you dislike the h-word.\u00a0 Count to two-and-a-half, surreptitiously reach for a bowl just in case as the first bite goes in, then say \"See?\u00a0 I told you it was good\" and eat your cold French Toast.FTC Disclaimer: I received samples of some of the finer spices in this recipe (namely the sea salt and vanilla beans) from Justin at Marx Foods, who is awesome.\u00a0 I did not receive financial compensation for this review, nor did anyone except me have any influence over the opinions I expressed or editorial content.\u00a0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/8437880492", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1T3yrWQfSo", "http://www.marxfoods.com/Bourbon-Vanilla-Beans", "http://www.marxfoods.com/portuguese-sea-salt", "http://www.marxfoods.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/02/french-toast-so-good-my-fiveyearold-will-eat-it-a-recipe.html", "title": "french toast so awesome my five-year-old will eat it (a recipe)"},

Cut you in your face. You will not be pretty anymore.\r\n 3.\u00a0 Dr. Danielle of 6YearMed: I went to college with a guy who was pre-med, but in all of my undergraduate writing classes because dude could write.\u00a0 He was also insanely good-looking and so nice and generally kind and cheerful that you couldn't even hate him properly; I've never met Danielle but I have a feeling she's a lot like my old friend from college.\u00a0 She's a fine young physician who shares her observations about the medicine she practices with an amazing blend of naked, unflinching honesty and compassion, and I would probably never, ever lock her in my older boys' walk-in closet if I was lucky enough to meet her someday.4.\u00a0 Kathryn, of Ryn Tale's Book of Days: I found Kathryn's blog through Dr. Danielle, and reading about the way she and Dave parent their amazing daughter Ellie with attitude, gratitude, and beauty is a privilege.\u00a0 I occasionally drop her a g-tube-related comment, but mostly I just nod and blink a lot and leave silently, because I have nothing to add to what she says.\u00a0 Good stuff, y'all.5.\u00a0 terri c. of PS 121 Is My Friend:\u00a0 Faithful reader, constant commenter, keen wit and gentle soul.\u00a0 Her ability to appreciate the beauty in one of the most interesting but potentially depressing jobs I know of is, in and of itself, amazing, but the lady can also write like whoa.\u00a0 I've talked about her here before; while she deserves a medal on a daily basis, my little blog-awards are what I have so I am passing them along to her.6.\u00a0 Tiffany of Three Ring Circus:\u00a0 She's a huge Aussie blogger and will probably never read this, but I'm giving her the awards anyway because...well...I stumbled across her blog while I was researching rare medical conditions in the process of trying to get to the bottom of The Question Mark that hovers over the sweet, curly head of my youngest and she stole my bloggy heart.\u00a0 Tiffany is an amazing woman, mother, writer and photographer who has seven individually amazing children, one of whom, little Ivy, captured the innernet's hearts (and signatures!) in her quest to obtain much-needed IVIG treatment.\u00a0 Tiffany knows the weight of The Question Mark, and occasionally rails against it, but mostly she finds (and photographs!) beauty in life anyway, and shares it in her wonderful blog.7.\u00a0 Gwendomama:\u00a0 My friend Gwendolyn is a force to be reckoned with--OH YES YOU ARE YOUNG LADY, YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH WHEN I'M WAXING MAUDLIN ABOUT YOU!!!\u00a0 Gwendolyn has been through so very much, and yet she continues to be one of the most involved and walks-her-talk-y parents I've ever had the privilege of knowing.\u00a0 She and I met because she spoke about her sweet (late) son Elijah, whose medical quirks and oddities are so very similar to some of my Little Child's, on her blog and I hijacked her comments section then took it to e-mail.\u00a0 She very generously shared medical information that may have saved Little Child's life, and now she's sharing information about the messy inner workings of an abusive relationship's unraveling via her blog with stunning bravery and heartrending honesty, and y'all, if more educated women had the ovaries to talk about this stuff it probably wouldn't happen to so danged many of us.\u00a0 8.\u00a0 Katie, of the intermittently-defunct Maybe Expectant: Oh, Katie.\u00a0 Sweet, smart, loving writer of some of the best posts you'll never read because she just tweets now and again and fellow MFA mama.\u00a0 I've read her since the beginning and she's made me smile with tales that aren't mine to tell here during some very dark times.\u00a0 Posts like this are why I am giving her these awards, and I'm also hoping they'll guilt her into writing more.\u00a0 There is lots left to say, lady.8.5 is for k, fourth-world blogger without a URL to share, occasional figment on Twitter, and true, good friend for the past five years.\u00a0 She sent me care packages when Little Child was at his sickest bearing stamps of a foreign land, a postcard with cows and windmills that is on my refrigerator four, five, I forget how many moves later, and much love, late-night intellectual discourse, and steadfast encouragement from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\u00a0 We've never met face to face but she's added so much to my life with her ephemeral friendship that she deserves a shout-out.\u00a0 Smooch!\r\n \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://nutsinmay.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/no-really-i-am-beautiful-so-are-you/", "http://musingsofafatchick.com/?page_id=2", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401310f71fe17970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401310f7205c2970c-pi", "http://www.thecheckoutgirl.net/", "http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/", "http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/letters_to_reviewers.php", "http://6yearmed.blogspot.com/", "http://ryntales.blogspot.com/", "http://ps121ismyfriend.blogspot.com/", "http://www.mythreeringcircus.com/", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/2/7/the-purgatory-of-in-between.html", "http://gwendomama.blogspot.com/", "http://childing.blogspot.com/", "http://childing.blogspot.com/2009/09/shards.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/03/the-one-with-the-awards.html", "title": "the one with the awards where I had something in my eye as I was writing it"},
{"date": "January 14, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 So remember when I said I was going to do a review of a certain product that Eden Fantasys was kind enough to send me for free?*\u00a0 Well, I wanted to wait until Hotter and I could both weigh in under the bonds of holy matrimony.\u00a0 Because not that there's anything wrong with using a sex toy alone, but he's a total techno-geek and lover of gadgets in general and so a sex toy that hooks up to an iPod was right up his alley (no, that was not any kind of euphemism or anything, GAWD).\u00a0\u00a0 Remember how 2009 tried to redeem itself by bringing me the package from Eden Fantasys and a box of Godiva chocolates?\u00a0 Not that it worked, because 2009 was seriously SO BAD that I kind of want to send it a sex tape of me and 2010 loving it up.\u00a0 And then 2009 was all \"here, have some female troubles?\"\u00a0 So I didn't even take the \"machine,\" as Cecily called it (yes I am still giggling over that), out of the box until Hotter moved in.\u00a0 We both admired the elegant packaging and then opened it up to find not only the \"machine\" itself but also adapters to allow you to charge the Freestyle pretty much anywhere in the world that has electricity, which is pretty neat (although I don't know that I would have the ovaries to try and fly anywhere with this thing, because I don't like to think about TSA agents touching my PANTIES even).\u00a0\u00a0 Y'all know I'm a recovering prude, and also that I have kids in the house, so first and foremost the Freestyle's case is EXCELLENT; it's lined with foam shaped exactly to the \"machine\" and the latch is pretty difficult to open but that is ABSOLUTELY a plus in my book (although if you're playing with this and also with, um...personal lubricants you'll want to open the case BEFORE you have those on your hands or else some totally unsexy hilarity would ensue).\u00a0 While the \"machine\" was charging I had a brilliant idea--Hotter bought me an iPod dock/boombox (I have the model you'll see over at the bottom right in \"stuff I use and like\" but mine is pink, and the shade of pink happens to coordinate perfectly with the Freestyle) with an \"audio out\" jack, and the Freestyle's wireless transmitter that you plug into your iPod has a headphone jack.\u00a0 Since we are a household of geeks it was pretty easy to find a cable to hook these things up so that we could both listen to the music when Freestyle is in music mode.\u00a0 It was like a gadget ORGY, y'all, which in and of itself is enough to get Hotter and me pretty excited.\u00a0 Someone may or may not have commented that the boombox and my little silver Nano were \"spit roasting\" the transmitter, and if you're not familiar with that term and also aren't easily offended then here is an explanation of what THAT is and no, not ever but HEE!\u00a0\u00a0 After we played around with the Freestyle's modes and such fully clothed and got all the giggling over with, we had a romantic dinner and a talk.\u00a0 Hotter asked me what I was going to do with the \"machine\" since I have him now and was not comfortable with the idea of, um, putting the machine to its intended use in front of anyone.\u00a0 I said well, we'll see, and we set the gadgets up, left the dishes in the sink and went to bed.**\u00a0\u00a0 After that it went kind of like:Hotter: So do you want to...MFA Mama: Eh, why not...Hotter: Here--MFA Mama: No way!\u00a0 You um, hold the......MFA Mama: Okay gimme that thing...Both: WOW.Hotter: I'm going to go take a shower.\u00a0 Want me to wash the--MFA Mama: Leave it here!Hotter: I see how it is....Hotter: Hey, I--wait, did you...?MFA Mama: Did you forget anything?\u00a0 Still need to wash behind your ears maybe?Hotter: I'm totally going to hide that thing.\u00a0 Why're you putting it on MY side of the bed?MFA Mama: [grinning] BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE SPOUSE SLEEPS!\u00a0 Don't worry, my couch is very comfortable.Hotter: [laughs for a while before he catches his breath] Lord.\u00a0 So what are you naming him?MFA Mama: Her.\u00a0 I think I'll name her after the hot UPS lady.Hotter: Her?\u00a0 Seriously?MFA Mama: Well yeah.\u00a0 It's pink, duh.\u00a0 Definitely a girl.\u00a0 Also if I die before you I want to be buried with it.\u00a0 The transmitter has a 25-ft range so it should go through six feet of dirt no problem.\u00a0 Just charge it up before you put it in the...casket.Hotter: [cracks up laughing again] Ohhhh my.\u00a0 I could get used to you doing product reviews!\u00a0\u00a0 So Hotter and I give the OhMiBod Freestyle, which is exclusively available through Eden Fantasys, a combined total of four thumbs up, and are very grateful that I had this opportunity to review the thing.\u00a0\u00a0IF YOU WANT A FREESTYLE OF YOUR OWN, EDENFANTASYS IS HAVING A 30% OFF SALE TODAY ONLY!*\u00a0\u00a0 Oh hai FTC if you're reading.\u00a0 Yes, they sent it to me free of charge so that I could review it here on my little blog.\u00a0 It was the best $125.99 I never spent.** \u00a0 If my ex-husband's lawyers are reading this, the children were with HIM at the time, so there was zero potential from them hearing the product-testing or seeing the \"machine\" out near the bed or anything; when not in use it's in its case on the very top shelf of a closet behind some cleaning products where the children couldn't see it unless the oldest got up on a chair or something, and my kids know that only grown-ups use the cleaning products so I think we're good.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.edenfantasys.com/", "http://www.edenfantasys.com/vibrators/traditional-vibrators/freestyle", "http://www.uppercasewoman.com/wastedbirthcontrol/", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spit%20roast", "http://www.edenfantasys.com/vibrators/traditional-vibrators/freestyle"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/01/a-very-nsfw-product-review.html", "title": "a very NSFW product review"},

{"date": "January 12, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I am thrilled to share with y'all that on January 11th, 2010 Hotter and I became man and wife in a small, unconventional, and utterly perfect ceremony at our home that also recognized us and the boys as a new family unit (Big Child was the Best Man and Middle Child and Little Child bore a ring apiece, making up in enthusiasm anything they might have lacked by way of aplomb).\u00a0 While I have richly enjoyed toying with those of you who know me in real life and on Twitter by making assertions to the effect that I fully intended to marry the new Mr. MFA in my Apple Bottoms and a \"This is What a Feminist Looks Like\" t-shirt, I actually wore something a little nicer but no less apropos: a form-fitting little black dress with a brightly-colored sarong tied around my hips, my hair hanging loose to my waist, and no shoes (Hotter and I used to joke that we'd elope to the Bahamas; he wore khakis and a polo shirt that matched a shade of teal in my sarong perfectly and a pair of docksiders).\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I are both rule-breakers by nature, in case you hadn't gathered as much already based on our wedding attire, and so it shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that while he is a chef, I made the meal we enjoyed with our guests, and while I am a writer, he wrote his own vows (in which he promised to never intentionally hurt my feelings, support me in all of my choices, and love and respect me until he died) and I did not.\u00a0 Instead I quoted from \"God Speaks*\" by Rainer Maria Rilke.\u00a0 Which might not seem to make a lot of sense if you just look at the title, especially when you factor in that Hotter and I are both lifelong atheists, but if you look at the words I quoted it was, in my humble opinion, actually perfect given the lives that he and I have led prior to yesterday:Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJust keep going. No feeling is final.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't let yourself lose me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNearby is the country they call life.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou will know it by its seriousness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGive me your hand.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I literally took his hand and slid a ring that matched mine onto his finger (smooth, right?) and we both cried like babies (I mean um, I put my waterproof mascara to the test and he had something in his eye...) and the Amish pastor's wife in attendance (yes really, and no, the Amish pastor did not officiate because we wanted a civil ceremony) took digital photos (seriously: I couldn't make that up) and we cut the coconut cake and called his mom and my dad and slow-danced to some Weezer as performed by my children on Rock Band.\u00a0\u00a0 I am SO happy, y'all.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 I used the title of the translation I quoted; alternate titles of alternate translations vary from \"Before He Made Each One\" to \"God Speaks to Each of Us\" and your mileage may vary depending on your source and how many languages you read.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/01/just-married.html", "title": "just married"},

{"date": "December 23, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Separation and divorce bring their own special brand of suck to the holidays.\u00a0 One year ago the Y chromosome had just sued me for full custody for the FIRST time and was claiming I was unfit; I not only had to pull the holidays pretty much out of my arse since he'd only made one child support payment in three months but was also afraid that at any moment Social Services would come and knock on the door and judge me for having a rotisserie chicken instead of a roasted turkey on Thanksgiving or wrapping the Festivus presents in newspaper, and take my children away (because when you're new to the world of custody disputes you think The Powers That Be will care about that kind of thing).\u00a0 That first check barely kept the utilities on with the amount that was past-due by that time, and the pressure was still on to give the children, whose world had just been rocked to the core, a happy holiday (oh yeah, and figure out how I was going to support us, and where we were going to live when the foreclosure the Y chromosome was forcing rather than let me speak to the mortgage company and keep the family home was over, and how to get us through this with minimal therapy).\u00a0\u00a0 Then there was the guilt, because the thing that Big Child wanted most in the world (and he was taking the split the hardest) was completely beyond what I was going to be able to do for my kids gift-wise.\u00a0 He wanted what every other kid on Earth wanted last year: a Nintendo DS Lite.\u00a0 I plotted, I schemed, I vented to friends and entered give-aways, but things were looking grim.\u00a0\u00a0 Enter a certain very generous Redneck.\u00a0 Who PayPal'd me a very generous amount toward the purchase of the DS Lite, because, as she said in her e-mail, \"sometimes you might not be able to afford toilet paper but you still need to remind your kids that mom can work magic, and you can always just steal toilet paper from a public restroom.\"\u00a0 She's a poet, is Tanis.\u00a0\u00a0 I couldn't believe it.\u00a0 I ordered the thing, it came, Big Child's fondest holiday wish came true (with a little help from Katie W., who sent us a game for the thing that she'd bought, played, and beaten), and overall we had a pretty good time (also thanks to Mel, who sent us a gorgeous wooden train set that I gave the Littles).\u00a0 The innernet saved our holiday!\u00a0\u00a0 This year, things are better.\u00a0 We're not rich, but between the child and spousal support and what I earn we have enough.\u00a0 We're renting a nice little house in the kids' school district, and none of our bills are past-due.\u00a0 There's even a little left over for things we don't have to have, but just want a whole lot.\u00a0 I'm spoiling my kids ROTTEN this year.\u00a0 How rotten?\u00a0 Oh, only so rotten that due to some miscommunication about who was getting what we ended up with an extra Nintendo DS Lite in the house.\u00a0 I KNOW!\u00a0 Ridiculous.\u00a0 Wretched excess.\u00a0 I was filling out a return slip while chatting online with a friend about holiday plans, when she mentioned that her oldest wanted something very badly, but it wasn't going to happen and she felt bad that her divorce (which is complicated by factors not so very different from those that complicated my own, which up the suck-ante on divorce with children a notch) and the current lack of child support from her ex were putting her in a place where she couldn't do something magical for her little girl (did I mention that her daughter wanted...a DS Lite?).\u00a0\u00a0 Well, crap.\u00a0 I mentioned the inventory surplus to my friend.\u00a0 She asked me to name a price.\u00a0 I thought about it for a moment and remembered what the innernet did for us last year.\u00a0 I named a price that was pretty much what I paid out-of-pocket for Big Child's DS Lite last year.\u00a0 My friend asked me if I was serious.\u00a0 Oh yes.\u00a0 I absolutely was.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 She sent me the amount by PayPal.\u00a0\u00a0 So I finished filling out the return slip and sent the DS Lite back.\u00a0 Because it was a very boy color, and I noticed when I was shopping for it that the place I bought it from also had pink ones.\u00a0 I don't get to buy pink stuff ever, so this was big fun for me.\u00a0 Since I had to send the thing back as an exchange, SuperGirl's present came to my house.\u00a0 I took a phone-picture of it and e-mailed it to my friend:  \u00a0 We chuckled gleefully and agreed that we kind of wanted to lick the thing.\u00a0 I refrained from licking it because I had The Sickness, and instead repackaged it lovingly with freshly-washed hands.\u00a0 Since I was sick and out of packing tape, I cocooned the box in Medipore (we always have a roll of that stuff around since one of us has a feeding tube that needs a dressing on it at times).\u00a0 It wasn't pretty, but it needed to go all the way across the country in time for Christmas.\u00a0 It took...a while.\u00a0 My friend and I started to worry.\u00a0 I tracked the package online.\u00a0 It was almost there.\u00a0 And then?\u00a0\u00a0 I am happy to report that the eagle has landed!\u00a0 My friend has the goods and now her only holiday gift dilemma is whether to let the fat man take the credit for this one or give it to SuperGirl from MOM.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I vote mom.\u00a0 Because sometimes?\u00a0 You need to remind your kids that mom can work magic.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t",

certified copy of my final divorce decree in the mail on the last day of the year.\u00a0 WHOO TITS!*\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, I can't do much more than look forward to what I plan to do with those three things, because when I was all \"too late, suckah, to the left with you\" anyway, 2009 was all \"fine then, remember that Cold From The Hot Place that became sinusitis and an ear infection and finally you caved and took the antibiotics?\u00a0 Well here's some female trouble for you!\"\u00a0 Plus Hotter has a couple of loose ends to tie up in the Arctic Tundra where he currently lives before he jumps on board the MFA Ship of Fools.*\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever, 2009.\u00a0 I was totally faking it when you thought things were good anyway.*\u00a0\u00a0 So about the \"machine\" I mentioned above (Cecily called it that on g-chat today, which cracked me up).\u00a0 Some of y'all probably read Cecily's excellent blog but in case you don't or haven't read it recently, Cecily recently started working for Eden Fantasys, which (cough okay, here goes my New Year's resolution I mentioned in the last post in action y'all) is a company that sells sex toys.\u00a0 She manages blogger relations for them, among other things.*\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, that big resolution?\u00a0 I decided I'm going to lose my inhibitions when it comes to (sotto voce) the sex.\u00a0 Hotter has gone a long (ohgod, no pun intended there) (well I mean certainly he...nevermind) way toward loosening me up OKAY YOU SEE THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE PROBLEM.\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 I'm MFA Mama, and I'm a recovering prude.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Which is why when Cecily put it out on Twitter that anyone interested in reviewing a sex toy for Eden Fantasys should e-mail her and I hadn't taken my Ritalin yet and did just that, kind of for the heck of it, I was all \"what did I just do???\"\u00a0 Because, well, I mean, my goodness y'all.\u00a0 I had just re-opened the blog (password-protected at first until I decided that haters will hate whether I hide from them or not) and hadn't even decided what my position on reviews (paid or otherwise) on my blog was, never mind addressed my little...issue...and just like that I had a discreet package from a sex toy retailer on its way for me to review on my blog.*\u00a0\u00a0 Fact: undermedicated ADD and courage can sometimes be indistinguishable to the naked eye.*\u00a0\u00a0 So anyway, I decided that a) no more Twitter before the Ritalin kicks in, b) I'm going to try an actual sex toy, and c) I'm going to review stuff on here from time to time.* \u00a0 So sometimes I'll do a review or link to a product just because something is awesome (like the link to Godiva up there?\u00a0 Yeah I got nothin' for that, I just love them and really love that they have a 50% off sale after Christmas!\u00a0 But hey, Godiva, if you're reading this and need reviewers?\u00a0 CALL ME) or, I dunno, I find an interesting new product that I feel like sharing my \"road-test\" of with y'all (probably because it's hilarious in either its great success or monumental failure), and sometimes because a company offers me something I'd like to try in exchange for an honest review of said product (that would be the \"machine\").\u00a0 What I will do is this: see this new category called \"reviews?\"\u00a0 I will tag all posts having to do with reviews as such and put a little disclaimer for our friends at the FTC at the top stating whether I did or did not receive any compensation for said review.\u00a0 That way if you don't want to read a review post, you can skip that one.\u00a0 What I will not do, ever, is write a dishonest word on here about any product, whether I'm reviewing it for fun, profit, or any mixture of the two (that way if something sucks you've been warned, and if I say something is awesome you know I'm telling the truth).*\u00a0\u00a0 Look for the review of the \"machine\" mid-January-ish :)*\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, yeah.\u00a0 I said several resolutions last time didn't I?\u00a0 Well there's the one I already mentioned, the one where I get serious about writing (that resolution is practically a tradition at this point so why stop now?\u00a0 Plus this time I REALLY MEAN IT), and the one where next time I'm sick and it goes on forever?\u00a0 I will just take the stinkin' antibiotics after, say, a week.\u00a0 Because I do this every winter without fail, and am always like \"gee I should've caved sooner.\"\u00a0 The end.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links":

I have no plans to break up with it for real, but I'm perusing the Help Wanteds and considering seeing other employers on the side.\r\n* \u00a0 The XY still seems to be seething with courtlust, despite Little Child's lack of growth challenges and the whole HGH thing becoming a non-issue.

I sometimes forget that I must live as a paragon of internal and external housekeeping virtue as a result of my ex-husband, Stalky, and Life In General being out to get me at any possible opportunity, but then life reminds me. While I was at it, I ordered us a 96-gallon recycling bin with a tip-bar since the C(o)unty-provided bin doesn't handle more than a week's recycling, and recycling pickup is only every other week. I'm thinking of painting it hot pink just to see how long it takes for someone to report it as a public nuisance.\r\n* \u00a0 So that's the phone and electric bills that've gone UP, my income's gone DOWN, and it's fucking snowing AGAIN.

{"date": "March 17, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I never did get around to an update on the whole Brazilian situation, but after having two done by a professional I started doing my own at home and haven't looked back. My reasoning went something along the lines of \"$50 a pop ($40 plus tip, and maybe 25% is high for the tip but if someone has touched my taint I kind of feel like I owe them) vs. $5 for a home-kit = no-brainer.\" Granted, there IS more pain involved with a home-jobby, not because of the quality of the wax or anything so much as the fact that it's hard not to wuss out and go too slowly, but it's not awful. I got a mark like this one, except down there, from my second pro-job; the waxer said they just happen sometimes, especially with bleeders, regardless of technique, and that was most of my rationale when it came to paying a pro (trying to avoid THAT). I also find that I can actually do a better job getting the stray hairs that are closer to the center of the universe on my own, probably because it's my own junk and I have no problem handling it in ways that might seem inappropriate in a spa setting.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0For those of you playing along at home, would I recommend trying to do your own Brazilian? Yes and no. Yes in that the end-result is just as good if not better than going with a pro, no in that you have to have a pretty high pain tolerance and possibly hyperflexible joints to git 'er done, both of which I possess, so YMMV. If you do decide to give it a whirl, here are some tips:\r\n1. Use this stuff! It's great, it smells nice, and if you keep an eye out for sales and buy in 3-packs you can usually get it for less than $5 per jar:\r\n 2. WEAR GLOVES. The wax will absolutely stick to and get under your fingernails if you don't.\r\n3. Put down newspaper to protect your floor, because you WILL drip wax.\r\n4. Don't forget to use the oil that comes with the kit before you wax. Trust me on this.\r\n5. Use something on your skin afterward to prevent infection (pros also apply hydrocortisone, but I skip that step because yeast loves steroids and...yeah). I use this, because it's what the waxer I went to swears by:\r\n Disclaimer: Those up there are affiliate links.

I don't like it when blogs I read start looking like one big dollar sign but if someone manages to do it without being obnoxious in order to pay their hosting fees and maybe even earn a little bit of money writing the stuff I read and enjoy for free then I kind of look at it as win-win.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to try and do the latter, mostly because blogging is a hobby of mine and I'm not so rich (or so proud) that I'm going to take money I could be using to support my family to pay for my hobby if it can support itself and still be fun for me (and hopefully for you).\u00a0 To that end, I put \"stuff I use and like\" at the bottom of the sidebar where you can look or not look, and won't be doing in-text links for profit (meaning that any links in the body of my posts are to help illustrate a point about or attribute information or ideas to the proper parties, and not \"product placements\" or anything I stand to profit from in any way).\u00a0 You also won't see those \"floating\" ads or any interstitial advertising on here, because this is my personal space and I try to create the kind of reading experience I enjoy here; personally I find those things annoying (they don't usually stop me from reading someone else's blog, but I value the personal connections I make through blogging more than the few extra cents including those things in my own blog would earn me, and I still value the opportunity to connect and exchange ideas with those who are less tolerant than I am).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 If you have feelings on my ads and the \"stuff I use and like\" (positive OR negative), I'd love it if you'd open a dialogue with me by sharing it in the comments section.\u00a0 Y'all are welcome to give me a reality check at any time if I do something on here that you don't like, either in relation my ads and product reviews or just, you know, in general, and I'm open to constructive criticism.\u00a0 At the end of the day I look at the blogosphere as a community.\u00a0 MFA Mama is who I am within that community; it's the only name I use when I blog here or anywhere else and the only name I comment under, and this site is my home.\u00a0 If you as my neighbor feel that it's an eyesore you have every right to come up on my front porch (in the form of the comments section) and tell me so, as well as visit with me (or even try to sell me something if that's your thing; everyone who's not an evangelist or or a vandal is equally welcome here).\u00a0\u00a0 You should also feel free just outright criticize me if you feel like it; I may or may not respond (probably not if it seems like you're just being mean unless your spelling, grammar, punctuation and/or overall reasoning amuse me and Satan gets the better of me that day) but I'll read it and so will everyone who reads this blog unless your comment fails the Miller test and/or discloses information about the name I go by offline and where I and my family are that I wouldn't share on here of my own accord (this is what I mean by vandalism).\u00a0 Some feel that taking measures like this to preserve pseudonymity is cowardly, and maybe you do too, but I want to protect my children's privacy and safety, and don't want them (or my students) reading the things I write here unless I decide to share it with them.\u00a0 I'm not ashamed of my words or I wouldn't publish them, but I also wouldn't discuss my sex life, my politics, or my warped sense of humor with my children or my students face-to-face the way I do with my grown-up friends offline or on here with y'all either, y'know?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I don't give enough identifying information about the parties I would prefer not to share my blog with for them to find this without help, nor do I let them see me writing this, simply because I like to compartmentalize that way and I think boundaries are a good and healthy thing to have in general.\u00a0 I'm the same person as MFA Mama that I am at a dinner-party; I say the same things and follow the same personal moral code, but not everyone present knows or needs to know exactly where I live and work or my childrens' full names and what they look like.\u00a0 I might share that information with someone if we form a connection, but only at my discretion.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Does that make sense?\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, I don't moderate comments because I want to censor anyone or am unwilling to hear dissenting points of view.\u00a0 I moderate comments because there are a handful of former friends, bitter ex-lovers, and all-around stalker-types who from time to time like to let me know that they know my legal name, and where I live, and my birth-mother's and former in-laws legal names and where THEY live, and what my childrens' names are and where they go to school.\u00a0 While these folks are entitled to their feelings, and fully capable, if their access to the technology and morals (or lack thereof) allow it, of publishing things (such as connections between this blog and my legal name, home address, or pictures of me and my family) that I'd rather not be out there for my kids and my students and the prospective publishers' fellow...let's say \"non-respecters of boundaries\"...to read, at least for as long as it takes me to reason with their hosting company and/or get a restraining order, I'm not going to let them make my hobby less fun for me by doing it here in my space that I pay for.\u00a0 I'd probably hesitate to keep a blog at all if it weren't for the fact that a) none of these people know me solely through the blogosphere; I won't say they're not bloggers because some of them have blogs, but instead that they're folks I have associated with offline who also know about the blog, b) they do what they do whether I keep a blog or not and I don't like to do things (or not do things) based on how I think they might react, and c) I take precautions, such as moderating comments on here and locking the doors and windows of my brick-and-mortar home offline.\u00a0\u00a0 How about you?\u00a0 How do you feel about the monetization of personal weblogs, blogging under one's legal name vs. a pseudonym, and \"Internet home security?\"\u00a0 I always enjoy your comments and words of wisdom, and hey, it's still National Delurking Week...\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_webpage", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_test"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/01/blogkeeping-like-housekeeping-except-you-can-do-it-lying-down-if-you-have-a-laptop.html", "title": "disclosures on monetization and pseudonymity"},
{"date": "August 13, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0The uniform for my new job is kind of a big deal to them (as it should be, since it's a spiffy place and they have an image to maintain). It's also a huge pain in the ass. Not only is it wildly impractical for serving food and busing tables in, but it's also really hard to find certain key components, especially for women (for reasons I won't go into, the hardest-to-source component of the uniform is commonly worn by a trade dominated by male workers). I checked several local stores, couldn't find what I needed, and ordered two sets from different online merchants, reasoning that one or the other would get here within a fairly reasonable timeframe. In the meantime, I purchased a cheap, nearly-suitable iteration of the garment in question, which unfortunately shrank with each washing, to the point that it went from \"almost-okay\" to \"not okay\" by company standard. I was well-aware of the problem, and pretty self-conscious about it, and checking the tracking numbers online every time we had a break, but...the uniform is A BIG DEAL (I kind of think The New Job should either provide the whole thing or at least find a way to make it available to employees for purchase, but currently that is not A Thing). As in, you line up before each shift and might get sent home (or to the back, where there is an ironing board and iron) if your creases aren't crisp enough or you are missing a collar button. I don't fault New Job (which still needs a damn blog name but I'm stumped) for this, after all the employees' image contributes to the prestige and therefore the success of the place where I will only be making decent money if there is good business. But when you're poor and can't just buy another almost-suitable garment every two days until the TWO you ordered arrive, it's a kick in the teeth to be called into the office and told that your clothes aren't up to snuff and you can't continue your training (much of which from tomorrow onward will take place in the public eye) until you address that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All of which is to say that today I think I set a new personal record for \"shortest length employed somewhere before crying at work.\" Cringe.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Please don't think New Job are a bunch of meanies who are persecuting me. They're not. The moment my chin first quivered, the previously-terrifying higher-up who had been scolding me (she has the personality of a drill sergeant and Takes No Shit) bundled me into the one-person employee ladies' room (honestly I kind of thought she was getting ready to beat my ass, she's that tough) and told me to explain myself, and I outlined the situation and she went into mother hen mode and smooshed me to her bosom and assured me that nobody was going to fire me for being broke and she'd help me pull something together to wear for tomorrow if need be, and offered me free dessert, and was generally just incredibly nice. And then she took a step back, got her warface back on, and said \"now don't you tell anybody though, I rule by fear around here\" and stalked back out into the employee locker area where my fellow trainees all appeared to be wondering if in fact she HAD beaten my ass. The classroom facilitator, who didn't know what was going on and apparently thought I was just cracking under the strain of the class and all of the information when she saw my face, pulled me aside and was like \"don't worry about the test, you'll be fine, honestly you're my best trainee and I am NOT worried that you'll fail so you shouldn't worry about it either!\" Which was good to hear.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then I went home and found that the fucking uniform components had arrived while I was at class, and I lost my shit for nothing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Sigh.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Tomorrow will be a better day.

{"date": "January  7, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 Last night I couldn't sleep because my ear was killing me.\u00a0 So I stayed up messing around on Twitter with the laptop turned on its side and my ear full of numbing drops.\u00a0 At first they helped a lot and I was all \"OMG numbing ear-drops are great!\"\u00a0 I couldn't go to sleep until I'd given Little Child his midnight dose of Zofran and decongestant though, and sleep deprivation makes my hand-ear coordination get dodgy, apparently.* \u00a0 End-result?\u00a0 Maybe numbing ear-drops aren't so great.* \u00a0 I told you Little Child has a g-tube.\u00a0 Mic-key buttons are great (no, that is not Little Child).\u00a0 When Little Child was tiny he had to be on a feeding pump overnight to get enough fluids/calories into him without triggering his volume intolerance and making him throw up.\u00a0 So I'd hang an eight-ounce bag of elemental formula on the IV-pole by his bassinet next to my bed (which was pretty much a stand for his bouncy-seat since he had to sleep upright due to reflux), set the pump to 30 ml/hr, swaddle him up and secure him in the bouncy-seat, and we'd sleep for eight hours.\u00a0 And being able to sneak into a coughing, feverish preschooler's room with an extension tube and a couple of syringes and slip him half the medicine cabinet and some generic Pedialyte?\u00a0 Is a thing of beauty.\u00a0 Mic-key buttons are great.*\u00a0\u00a0 So is guafenesen.\u00a0 I remember back in the dark ages before it was available over the counter.\u00a0 You know what's not great though, at least not right now?\u00a0 Mucinex Mini-Melts.\u00a0 I mean, great idea, and great with my older kids, but YOU try getting those little son-of-a-whore beads through a g-tube extension sometime.\u00a0 Mic-key extensions are about as big around on the inside as a pencil lead.\u00a0 And then?\u00a0 There's a right angle where the extension hooks up to the mic-key button.\u00a0 See?*\u00a0\u00a0 And yes, you CAN get guafenesin in a syrup form, and that WOULD be a lot easier.\u00a0 But the problem with that is that a) I have not yet found the syrup in a dye-free form, b) Little Child is allergic to red food dye, and c) while I would imagine that a dye-free version of the syrup exists, and that I could track it down and purchase it over the innernet, Little Child's GI doctor insists that Tylenol-brand dye-free children's cough and cold is the only thing to give him for congestion that doesn't POTENTIALLY have a negative impact on GI-motility.\u00a0 Which was why I was talking motilin-agonists with the pediatrician yesterday, because he wanted me to give Little Child guafenesin and I really wanted to listen to him, but I also didn't want go against the GI doctor's advice because he seems to be the only physician who understands what makes Little Child tick and once someone has mentioned TPN in connection with your own personal baby you tend to freak out and get paranoid about anything that might have an adverse effect on gut motility.\u00a0 So it's not something I plan to keep in stock, although in this one case giving Little Child some guafenesin to help clear his lungs up while the antibiotics kick seemed like a reasonable thing to do in order to keep us out of the hospital.\u00a0 And Mini-Melts come in yellow.*\u00a0\u00a0 So you end up with the mic-key extension being like a narrow, hardened artery and the Mini-Melt beads being like red blood cells or maybe platelets and then this happens at three in the morning and you and your child's mic-key extension have simultaneous coronaries because the kid is asleep (coughing and gagging, but asleep) and tossing around and it's dark and you're trying to be stealthy.*\u00a0\u00a0 If that ever happens to you and the blockage is in the mic-key button itself and not the extension (which most insurance companies are pretty miserly with extensions but much more so with the buttons themselves), you can sometimes force Coca-Cola through with a syringe and salvage the equipment.\u00a0 I doubt that very many of you need that particular Parenting Hack, but if you do?\u00a0 You're welcome!* \u00a0 I kind of have to wonder about you if you're still reading this, but you deserve a prize, so here:\u00a0 This is maybe the funniest thing I've ever read.\u00a0 They had me at the title (which I kind of want to put on a line of Zazzle products now) but then they refer to \"the gays\" in total seriousness and compare anal sex to cigarettes and MTV, and...wow.\u00a0 If you're just the right combination of hurting and sleep-deprived and stressed-out and sick in the head that will win your heart entirely with its combination of dead-earnestness, bigotry, and bad logic and you will giggle for a WHILE.\u00a0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/ycobrfw", "http://tinyurl.com/y8jw39z",

{"date": "August 17, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Blogging will likely be pretty sparse until next weekend, as I am working both jobs full-time this week (regular shifts at The Ritzier and training shifts at The New Job) and studying for my Big Terrifying Exam next Saturday. If I pass that then I will be a full-fledged employee at the new place. YAY! Failure is not an option.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I've gotten a couple of e-mails asking about Hotter's Transplant appointment. It was...I dunno, it just WAS. I wasn't there (I had to drop him off way early on my way to training and pick him up afterward), his weight is way down (shocker), they did a CT scan of some things along with the usual labs, and we haven't heard a damned thing about any of that. I have been asking Hotter to call and follow up and ask what the results of the tests were, but he pretty much refuses on the grounds that navigating their phone system is frustrating, and since I haven't had the time to play Mommy and call on his behalf I'm going to have to assume they found nothing that they need to act on (usually they call if his labs are wonky and I like to think that if they saw, say, a TUMAH on the CT scan they'd speak up about that as well). Big Child deserves some recognition for the fact that he babysat the littles during both Hotter's and my absence and kept everyone alive and happy (he is now old enough to do that per local laws; I wasn't thrilled with leaving him in charge for so long because I still feel like he's a really young thirteen in a lot of ways but The XY refused to take the children so it was a day of everyone doing what they had to do around here).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Ritzier has continued to go downhill; upper management has been doing some really effed-up things to middle management, making them cranky, which in turn means that line-level employees are more disgruntled than usual. Drunk Boss's position was finally filled, and initially I thought people were overreacting when they said the new guy made Drunk Boss look good, but then yesterday I met the new guy, and...wow. I don't even know where to START! He appears to possibly have Tourette's, which a lot of line-level employees are spouting off about but isn't something I would be comfortable criticizing, for obvious reasons (although it does mean he is unable to help on a hands-on basis due to being unable to hold onto things like glasses, trays, etc. without flinging stuff). Aside from that he has incredibly poor social skills, doesn't seem to understand personal space (HE'S A CLOSETALKER OH HELL NAW), and then there's the fact that HE PATTED ME ON THE ASS. I...well geez, there is a lot going on and I'm not exactly feeling VIOLATED or anything...I'm not really sure what to make of the encounter, honestly. He was standing behind me at the time so I didn't see him move in; it SEEMED to be deliberate based on context clues (he was saying \"Seeya later everybody, nice meeting you MFA Mama\" and then PAT!) but the guy definitely has some motor-control issues so MAYBE it was accidental (although I think most of us would be like \"oh whoops sorry!\" if we accidentally touched someone's ass at work and there was nothing like that afterward)? The middle manager who was standing next to me when it happened asked me how I wanted to handle things when I was like \"dude he just patted my ass\" and I said I was willing to call it an accident THIS time, but if it happened again he was going to be shoving his cocaine up his butt while his nose heals (yeah, he's also pretty obviously a cokehead, but it's kind of the least of his problems). After which she slapped me on the arm and then laughingly apologized, and I was all \"don't feel bad, inappropriately touching me seems to be The Done Thing today, anybody else wanna get in on this?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0...\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yeah.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0My original goal was to hang in there at The Ritzier until long about Thanksgiving and build up a little cushion for when the MFA Minivan or my front tooth goes, but I don't know that I'll last that long.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Other than that, I am a flashcard-making FOOL over here and will be trudging around in an overcaffeinated fugue state mumbling lists of allergens and garnishes for the next week.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S.

That said, I suck with numbers, and while I starred all donations marked \"loan\" in Gmail and paid those back, I am paranoid that I have overlooked someone who will then think I am a deadbeat, hate my guts, and join forces with Stalky in slandering my good name across the innernets. IF YOU LOANED ME MONEY AND DID NOT GET A REFUND VIA PAYPAL, PLEASE COMMENT OR E-MAIL ME AND LET ME KNOW SO THAT I CAN PAY YOU BACK! I don't want to miss anyone, and have you think I just suck.

Yay, egg!\r\n* \u00a0 We're getting lettuce and mesclun greens from the garden, as well as kale and zucchini and sweet potato greens and turnip greens.

{"date": "March 11, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Management has capped overtime at about twenty hours per week LESS than I've been aiming for of late, and I Am Not A Fan. Largely because this means I'll have to get another job in addition to The Ritz and juggle two schedules, and I don't WANT another job. I like all five of my existing jobs within the one resort property, and the simplicity of the single paycheck, HR department, timeclock, etc. In the short-term, however, this may mean more blogging, so there's that.\r\n* \u00a0 Today I only worked the one shift, so since the MFA Children had expressed an interest in trying duck (it came up in the context of it being one of the courses in a five-course Special Dinner Thing I worked at The Ritz, which I was describing to Hotter and the boys), I broke down a whole duck into skin, legs, wings, and boneless breasts and thighs, sliced the breast and thigh meat thinly, pounded it, and then put it to marinate in ginger, garlic, wheat-free soy sauce, and honey with a dash of vinegar. I then rendered the skin over low heat, pouring off clarified fat until I had a goodly amount. Two dogs and a cat then got the cooled skin bits to eat and licked their chops for the rest of the damn night. Meanwhile, I salted and scored the legs and wings, poured fat over them, and made confit for the grown-ups. For the kids I cut the tenderized and marinated boneless meat into bite-sized bits, dredged them in cornstarch, salt and pepper, and fried them in the rest of the fat until crispy. Then I popped the crispy duck-bites into the oven to make sure they were cooked through, and made a sauce with ginger, garlic, soy sauce, honey, and the juice and chopped peel of an organic navel orange. I made \"deconstructed springrolls\" (spring-roll veggies over rice) to go with the duck and sauce, and served it up, and EVERYBODY LIKED DINNER. *preens*\r\n* \u00a0 Suddenly it is ridiculously gorgeous outside! To celebrate, Poppy gathered an assortment of ticks around her...bathing-suit areas. If dogs wore bathing suits. Which ours do not. I don't know who I felt sorrier for during the removal process, Poppy herself, Hotter, who was tasked with holding her, or me (ticks are TINY, Poppy is covered in tick-MARKS, which it would be inadvisable to remove with tweezers, and my eyes are apparently not what they used to be) (which means my face was way closer to dog...underbelly...than I'd ever like for it to be again).\r\n* \u00a0 Valet continues to be a lot of fun. I got to drive one of these that was either brand-new or in mint condition. Black with a tan leather interior. It smelled like happiness inside! Sadly there was a space very near the entrance to The Ritz's garage and so I had no legitimate reason to take her out of first gear :(\r\n* \u00a0 I have a burgeoning chest cold, and I would rather not.\r\n* \u00a0 I am beginning to think Bravo Hive may still be alive after all! That would be fabulous news, for obvious reasons. Hopefully it stays nice and I don't get any sicker so I can check on the hive tomorrow after work (after that it's doubles for the rest of the week), although the last time I did that before working in the restaurant, as I will be on Thursday, I got to wait tables with a grotesquely-swollen face as a result. Hmm...\r\n* \u00a0 The TL;DR version: I heartily recommend Porsche Boxsters and well-cooked duck, ticks, money and chest colds suck, and bees are confusing, which is exacerbated by their hatred of close study.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Boxster"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/03/drive-by-bullets.html", "title": "drive-by bullets"},

We went to Trader Joe's and stocked up on the things that we get from Trader Joe's, and went to the pet store to buy Poppy a new food bowl (she finally, after months of effort, broke her ceramic one so we got her a stainless steel replacement).

I thought maybe I was viewing the world through shit-colored glasses and it wasn't that bad, but then Big Child took me aside and privately asked me if Hotter was okay, because \"lately when he sleeps he looks...dead.\" OH SO IT'S NOT JUST ME THEN. He sees Transplant in two weeks and so far my most recent attempt to use Ensure to put weight on him has only exascerbated things further.\r\n* \u00a0 Work. Oh, work. Things at The RItzier are kind of post-apocalyptic in the wake of Drunk Boss's departure, rumors of a wildly unsuitable promotion based on strategic fellatio have abounded (but thankfully seem to be unfounded as of this posting; the position remains unfilled), and I got another (second) job, the one I interviewed for AFTER\u00a0the one I posted about. It's another waitressy gig at a new ethnic restaurant opening in a prime location, and I'm pretty excited about it, because it's food I really like that is by nature gluten-free in many cases, and I've never helped to open a new restaurant.\r\n* \u00a0 The health insurance at The Ritzier sucks rather a fat hairy one. There's a $3,000 deductible, and the plan only knocks about $40 off the price of Pristiq. One small bright spot is that they (inexplicably) lower the cost of generic Mirapex by 80%, so I've filled that and am hoping that better-quality sleep will make things look less grim, although currently I doubt it will.\r\n* \u00a0 The XY announced a few days ago that he was TAKING A WEEKEND for the first time in months, but then yesterday was like \"oh, nope, PSYCH!\" Hotter and the boys have all logged fewer years of being let down by that motherfucker, and are less sanguine about it than I have become of late. So while I have finally reached a point of being resigned to the XY's congenital inability to keep his own damn word, everyone I love is still processing, and that's just PEACHY.\r\n* \u00a0 The fact that I am still paying out of pocket (for all intents and purposes) for Pristiq AND paying a health insurance premium means that it's still up in the air whether I'll make rent for this month, so we're economizing a lot here currently. By which I mean that I made some surplus (wheat-containing) pasta for the chickens today, since they are out of feed, and have been trying to cut greens enough for the rabbits to not need much bought feed.\r\n* \u00a0 I've been working on the fall garden and am moving forward with a goal of growing more fodder and forage for the rabbits and chickens in addition to fruit, vegetables, greens, and cooking herbs. Our spaghetti and butternut squashes are looking good, and we my actually get some muskmelons this year as well. Currently we're getting beets and kohlrabi, and I've been making a lot of stirfry. Red stir-fry (from the beets) is delicious, but slightly offputting. Backyard honey and gluten-free tamari makes decent faux teriyaki sauce. I've yet to put beets in an omelet, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time as the Feed Store Six ought to be laying shortly.\r\n* \u00a0 All of Pfeffer's \"final four\" are still with us, and I had separated them into four cages to keep them from snuggling in the heat and/or breeding unchecked, but there was more rabbit drama. One of them got a little sickly for a bit; it knocked its water down and went without overnight while it was pretty hot out, and got a bit doddery and stopped grooming itself for a couple of days. Another got out of its cage when Poppy got off her leash and knocked the cage from its base; the rabbit was missing at first and then I saw it wedged halfway behind the chicken coop and not moving, and gloved up and grabbed its hind legs and pulled, thinking it was injured or dead. Turns out it was just really, really stuck, either because Poppy wedged it in there or it wedged itself in its terror to escape her. Once I pulled it loose it recovered and tried to eviscerate me. The doddery one I thought I'd need to euthanize, because it just sat and looked confused when confronted with food and water, and was really filthy, but Hotter had an idea. \"I'm putting another rabbit in there. It maybe just needs to be reminded what to do and they'll groom each other. HERE IS YOUR NEW GROOMING BUDDY!\" And he placed another rabbit in with the doddery one. I'll be damned if it didn't work! So we have two cages with one rabbit each and one cage with two.\r\n* \u00a0 My bad ankle has taken to buckling under my weight and forming a perfect right angle several times per day seemingly at random, and I'm rather dismayed.

Despite this though many people\u00a0find themseselves simply watching TV after the kids have gone to bed when they could be truly enjoying themselves doing something they really enjoy.\r\nNetflix offer more TV shows and films than anybody else for instant streaming and so if you do enjoy watching TV after the kids have gone to bed this will allow you to watch whatever you truly enjoy instantly.

The ability to customise your own Reddit homepage allows you to see links to any subjects that you find interesting personally.\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a little more fun in terms of engaging entertainment then look no further than an online casino as they offer thousands of different games for people to play whenever they want. Some people will tell you that you can play the most popular casino games at JackpotCity online casino\u00a0and though it may be down to opinion,\u00a0there is definitely a game for you to play.

The more I learn about the company, the more I can see myself working there until I am old and gray. There are so many great things about the place, but I don't want to say too much because pseudonymity. I will say that they are currently one of Fortune 500's \"100 Best Companies to Work For,\" and with good reason. They offer excellent benefits (PET INSURANCE, FFS!), donate every scrap of unserved food (including their fryer grease, which fuels biodiesel taxis in the nearest major city), do lots of good and charitable work to eradicate hunger, and any employee can have all of the soup and bread they want for free \"because we're in the business of delicious food, and our employees should never be too hungry to do a good job\" (coming from The Ritzier, where a line cook was recently written up for letting a hungry employee who is down on their luck have a bowl of oatmeal that they were about to throw out at the end of breakfast service, I think that is especially wonderful) (no, I was not the cook or the down-on-their-luck employee in question--The Ritzier's oatmeal is not certified GF). Today the GM let us all order whatever we wanted from the menu for lunch (within reason, as in \"no filets, y'all! You'll get to taste one during training anyway\"), and I had a cheeseburger on a GF bun that was less a meal and more a religious experience (IT WAS SO FREAKING GOOD OMG). Employees kept stopping by the table and introducing themselves and welcoming us, and I didn't see a single person wearing the \"I hate my life and my job\" face I've grown so used to seeing (and wearing) at The Ritzier. At the end of the meal, we were each encouraged to order a complimentary dessert to go to take home to our family and celebrate our new job, which is exactly what I did (yes, they have GF desserts and they are AMAZING).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Today was a good day.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As far as The Ritzier, I do not plan to quit any time soon (although they may well fire me for blowing them off for this week's training class at The New Job, and I wouldn't be terribly sad about it although it's not what I want to have happen) because my minivan and my loose left front crown are in a race to see who can screw me first. Ideally I would like to work both jobs until I've replaced the minivan and built up a bit of a cushion to fall back on should the tooth fall out, but we'll see...I've held back a LOT on saying how miserable that place makes me, and they're breaking a LOT of labor laws involving things like minimum wage, breaks, favoritism, EEOC stuff, tax laws...the list goes on and on. I don't know a single person there who likes their job and is optimistic about where the company is headed. Which is a real shame, because from the outside it looks like a great place to work, they have a nice location, and there is no reason for them to be as inconsiderate as they are to their employees. We'll see if I can hang in there, and if I can't it's not the end of the world.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm still worried about a lot of things (Hotter's health, my tooth and the van, how money will work out until I start earning the big bucks at The New Job*), but I'm feeling more optimistic than I have since before things went to hell at The Ritz.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0About that...as of right now things are still not quite going to work out, but we're getting close!

The Ritzier is a great place to work (we have a DAILY POSITIVE MESSAGE from Corporate, FFS, and a guide to letting go of negative thought patterns through meditation posted on a bulletin board in the break room!), and some of my worries about potentially making less money have been assuaged by PAYDAY today; it turns out that while I make a lower hourly rate in the job function I spent most of my first week in, and the same or a little less in the restaurant, BANQUETS at The Ritzier are fantastic money (yes, I have already worked in three departments and it is just my first week--there are two more I plan to train in, but probably not until they have a call-out and I swoop in to save the day, muahahaha), and serving at The Ritzier is much less physically grueling than it was at The Ritz. The other day I had a large table in the restaurant, and when the food was ready and I had stacked it on a tray, a muscular young houseman stepped in, hoisted it with ease, and followed me to the table because MANAGEMENT NOTICED I HAD CHECKED YES TO \"HAVE YOU EVER SUFFERED A BACK INJURY\" ON MY NEW-HIRE PAPERWORK AND DIDN'T WANT ME TO HURT MYSELF. The same thing happened when I was helping out in Banquets--I filled a tray with dirty dishes and immediately a houseman came, handed me an empty tray, and whisked the full one off because SERVERS DO NOT LIFT HEAVY TRAYS AT THE RITZIER. I could get used to this!\r\n* \u00a0 Pfeffer is dead, and we have no idea why. She was out in a grazing pen with her litter a couple of days ago; it was hot but they had access to cold water and shade. I went to work and then got a text from Hotter that \"we have a problem.\" Problem being that Pfeffer had keeled over dead, her bunnies were not weaned, and in fact they hadn't yet started to eat and drink rabbit food and water from the bottle. Rabbits are nearly impossible to successfully hand-raise, too, as their milk is incredibly nutrient-dense and their gut flora are a complex and delicate balance. Hotter fretted and worried, but the bunnies figured it out and are eating, drinking, and frisky, so that's good. Except now we are down to ZERO broodrabbits, as Iden is far too vicious and nasty to keep around.\r\n* \u00a0 We have bees again! The Italian package bees I ordered had the decency to arrive on my day off yesterday, and I hived them without incident. Italian bees are supposed to be very docile, and I have found that to be true so far (I didn't even get stung yesterday!), although we'll see how they act when they're established in the hive and protecting their queen as opposed to dazed from transit and just getting to know the lady.\r\n* \u00a0 The garden is doing great this year. We're starting to get strawberries and baby greens, and I'm excited to see how everything else does this \u00a0year. My peppers, cucumbers, melons, and tomatoes are all looking good, and this year's Compost Vulture has popped up already:\r\nFigure One:\u00a0The \"Compost Vulture\" is a volunteer squash that graces our compost pile yearly. It could be a triamble, could be a pumpkin, could be spaghetti squash, hell, it could even be a muskmelon.

YAY! The benefits do not suck at all (they're actually pretty freaking amazing), and this looks like it will be a really good opportunity. I got a tour of the place today, and have to say I am VERY impressed with their kitchens (yes, plural), their expediting system (it's computerized AND they have human expos working the line), their technology (OMG SO COOL), and their food. I have orientation tomorrow and training Monday through Friday of next week. I currently have $27 to my name (although all of the bills are up to date), and need to come up with a new shirt, belt, and pair of pants for MONDAY (I also have to come up with new shoes, but they have a catalog to choose from and can take the cost out of my first paycheck, and if I order through them they're okay with me wearing my current shoes until the new ones arrive). I'm absolutely hitting Goodwill, but the uniform is mostly white so I'm worried that stains will be an issue, plus I have to put gas in the MFA Minivan Tuesday or Wednesday to get to and from work, plus Hotter is going to have to take a cab to his Transplant appointment on Thursday (I can pick him up after training, but will already be in class when he needs a ride there). I have one evening shift at The Ritzier on Sunday, but will have to blow them off tomorrow for orientation (I'll probably call in \"sick\") and won't be able to work next week since they have me on day shifts. I already told The Ritzier about the new job and the training schedule, and they are...not happy for me. I'm not fired, but they're pissed (which hey, I'm pissed at them too). I asked about potentially rescheduling the training class, but that's not possible; it's a once-per-quarter thing and while I can defer my employment until the next training class, I can't pay the bills with what I'm making at The Ritzier and really need to get started at the new place.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I somehow have to come up with the uniform (~$50), cab fare for Hotter on Thursday (also ~$50), a tank of gas (~$60), and some groceries ( at least $50) to last until the fifteenth when I'll (hopefully...) get a child support check. I'm told I can expect to start working the floor and making cash tips Tuesday or Wednesday of the week after next, so after that we'll be able to squeak by (barring disaster), and nobody is close to running out of any expensive prescription drugs (thank goodness) so if I can come up with about $250 all will be roses.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Would any of you be willing and able to make me a short-term loan of any part of the above (to be paid back by the end of the month)? I hate to ask, but I don't have any other ideas and I have to make this work. If you can help, please use the \"donate\" button to the right and put \"loan\" in the \"purpose\" field. I'll keep an eye on PayPal and let y'all know if/when I hit the goal amount. Thanks :)ETA: I just went in and did paperwork at the new job, and unfortunately payroll deduction for shoes is do-able for everyone BUT servers (in New Job's defense, server minimum wage is $2.13/hr and most of servers' checks go to taxes). So I have to come up with an additional $46 by Tuesday-ish when the shoes arrive. EFF. WORD. The good news is, I'm almost at the halfway point thanks to some generous blog-land micro-lenders, and it's starting to look like this MIGHT all work out...somehow.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/08/asking-for-help.html", "title": "asking for help [ETA]"},

Yesterday I thought perhaps I'd celebrate by getting a large back tattoo, but my artist of choice was booked last night and is closed today in observance of Memorial Day, and the place with the highest Yelp rating in town could do it but Hotter decided he didn't feel like coming and sitting through the work with me, and I in turn decided that I didn't want to waste hours of precious child-free off-time I could spend with my husband by going somewhere else by myself to spend a bunch of money. The tattoo parlors of MFAville will be there when the timing is right, and I'll get another two-day stretch at some point (the ink I have in mind will cover approximately 50% of the skin my bra strap rests on, so I don't want to do it the day before I need to work or the day before that, ideally). Instead I stayed home and got a cold, because a successful work-life balance hinges upon knowing how and when to treat yourself, right?\r\n* \u00a0 The new honeybees seem to have settled in well. I haven't done a hive inspection, because I can see that they're bringing in lots of pollen, and bees only do that if they're feeding brood, and the presence of brood indicates the presence of a laying queen, so why crack them open simply to be able to go \"yep, there she is?\" One of the main lessons in my Sustainable Beekeeping class was that the less you mess with your bees, the better they tend to do, which makes sense. They're pretty strongly motivated to survive and multiply, and if they can, they will. If they can't, there's not much you can really do within the confines of organic, sustainable beekeeping methodology to help them, although you CAN easily harm them by opening the hive and bumbling around, as it were.\r\n* \u00a0 There's a large construction project going on along the street that connects our little dead-end neighborhood to the local thoroughfare, and the first thing the contracting company did was to grade the earth and build a drainage pond on the site. It's been there for a few months now, and naturally some Canada Geese have moved in and hatched a bunch of slow-moving, buff-colored babies ACROSS THE STREET. This means that several times per day Ma and Pa Gander stop traffic to shepherd their progeny across the way for a swim, or back home for a nap, and it's pretty damn annoying. Hotter sometimes walks the half-mile to the main drag to buy milk or TUMS if I'm at work or home sick, and got into An Altercation with the geese earlier today. According to him, he threatened to kick those mofos right in their saw-toothed beaks if they didn't quit hissing and waving their necks about menacingly, which probably means he screamed like a girl and fell in the ditch. I'm alternately Googling recipes (the purportedly outrageous greasiness and fat-shedding is a little offputting) and hoping the C(o)unty will turn some of its anti-avian sentiments toward Solving The Goose Problem now that my chickens are legal.\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of meat, I really need to process Iden, but...I'm a little skeert. I've killed plenty of rabbits, but Iden is VICIOUS and I'm not 100% certain I'd come out on top in a melee scenario. So I keep putting it off, and Googling ways of cooking older rabbit-meat so that it isn't dry or tough. Many recipes suggest incorporating grease from a fattier meat such as bacon. I wonder if goose would work?\r\n* \u00a0I'm a little up-in-the-air about the new job still. On one hand, I really like a lot of the people I work with. On the other hand, the last time I worked a dinner-shift I had THE WORST TABLE OF MY CAREER, and they left an electronic device at the table and I did some extra work to negotiate its safe return (despite the shitty tip), reasoning aloud to co-workers that surely this would bring me some good karma and mean that good things were coming my way. Then my next table was exponentially worse. As in, they were yelling so hard about the way the bartender made a drink and the texture of the complimentary dinner rolls and the way their steak was cooked (it was one of those \"ate the whole thing but sent back the LAST BITE\" scenarios, which is extra-silly given that if you're eating in the restaurant of The Ritzier you can absolutely afford to pay your tab) that they were SWEATING, and then they called Management over to the table and insisted that I be fired or harshly disciplined for throwing their check onto the table in a rude manner. Except that since Management had already advised me they were taking care of the bill I never *gave* these people a check. WHO DOES THAT? YOU ARE ALREADY EATING AND DRINKING FOR FREE AND I WAS NOTHING BUT NICE TO YOU! TRYING TO GET ME FIRED BY LYING LIKE THAT WAS UNNECESSARY, WRONG, AND JUST MEAN. I make good money at The Ritzier, but this is a new breed of customer, the \"being jerks for sport\" sort, and I'm not sure I care for it. The very rich are not unlike those Canada Geese; you can't build something nice without them showing up with their heedless offspring and getting in everybody's face just for the sheer hell of it! And eating the rich is frowned on in the service industry, so there's no Final Solution, either!\r\n* \u00a0 There's a mole in my garden, and it has eaten all but one of my pepper plants that were looking so good. Moles are definitely not good to eat, and apparently Juicy Fruit doesn't work as well as one so often hears, so I'm looking into guillotine traps, although that seems like a lot of work and I may just give up on peppers for the year or plant some in containers.\r\n* \u00a0 The nearby new construction has riled up and displaced the local wildlife, to the point that I have recently seen both a possum (I nearly ran it over and then though of how old and bald my tires are and decided to brake after all) and a raccoon. Also, Hotter just came and informed me that we have a new Undertoad in the yard ENOUGH, ANIMALS!\r\n* \u00a0 In an act of (perhaps) misguided kindness, I bought Skeeter a catnip plant. Now he's constantly trying to get outside and have a nip, and he's a mean drunk. I can't win!\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-0lAhnoDlU", "http://www.molecatchers.com/doesnt_work.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/05/bullets-the-woman-vs-nature-edition.html", "title": "bullets, the (wo)man vs. nature edition"},

{"date": "June 23, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Man, it has been a rough seventy-two hours over here. I was barrelling through an hours-heavy workweek, worrying because the MFA Minivan appears to have a degenerative neurological condition of some sort (all of the dash instruments and now also the transmission have these kind of absence seizures where they just blip out for a second or a few minutes...but only every couple of days so far) and we are broke and I was starting to get one of my laryngitis/bronchitis combo platters and there is drama at work (of the usual hotel restaurant sort, so scandalous but not overly troubling to me).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then the night before last I got a text from Hotter that Skeeter was MIA. At first I didn't panic, because I've gotten the \"Skeeter is out\" text before and it's generally followed by \"Ha! Got him! What a slut for freezedried beef liver that cat is!\" This, however, was different;\u00a0nobody could recall seeing him that day. His last known whereabouts had been the night before when Hotter and I replaced one of his Soft Paws claw caps. And I? FREAKED THE FUCK OUT. I couldn't breathe, and told my boss I had to leave work. As I drove into our neighborhood I looked in the road, in the ditches, hoping and fearing I'd see Skeeter and be able to help him. In our driveway I jumped out of the minivan and started calling. Skeet always comes when I call him, and part of me thought I'd call, he'd come, I'd scoop him up, and I'd walk into the house and yell at everybody not to scare me like that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Instead, I found nothing, said some hurtful things to Hotter, filed a missing pet report with the local Animal Shelter, kicked myself repeatedly for not having Skeeter microchipped (I worry that a chip will stick right out on top of his poor scrawny little shoulderblades...but no longer to the point that I am against chipping him) and did a lot of Ugly Crying down at Squatter Workshop.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I just...2014 had already killed off so many people, animals, and things I love that surely that was what this was, and I couldn't. I was not okay. It was...really bad. I kept thinking about Skeeter's soft little body and all of the terrible things that could happen to it, and how the two most likely scenarios, someone nabbing him and something making a meal of him, would leave us always wondering, and how I was never, ever loving anything with paws EVER AGAIN.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At 6:14 a.m. the day before yesterday Middly woke me up yelling. \"MOMMY SKEETER IS HOME I FOUND YOUR CAT MOMMY LOOK!\" A second later a very dirty, hungry, dehydrated and bedraggled hairless cat landed in bed between me and Hotter and began whirling like a tiny, filthy dervish, rubbing our faces in turn with his cheeks and leaving smudges. \"OH BABY BUDDY,\" I exclaimed, and made an unashamed ass of myself (seriously, I have clearly started to go soft in my old age because YOU GUYS THIS CAT). Hotter and I gently bathed Skeet, and I cleaned the numerous scratches and punctures on his back, haunches, and hind legs with peroxide, and then we all took a nap until our vet's Saturday hours began (as soon as Skeeter finished eating and drinking he burrowed into my arms and fell into an exhausted sleep).\r\nFigure One:\u00a0Poor Skeet's poor rump. There are also wounds all over his back and legs :(\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the vet, Skeeter was charming and schmoozed the pet nurse and the vet, although he was not very happy with the exams he received at their hands. The vet said he was pleasantly surprised to find that Skeeter wasn't severely sunburned over most of his body (apparently that is the number one concern they have with runaway Sphynx cats and a very real danger), but concerned about the bite-wounds. \"The good news is, he doesn't have a fever so I think these darkened spots are bruising, not abscesses. The bad news is, bite-wounds are nasty and a few of these go pretty deep, plus we don't know what bit him or whether it might have rabies.\" After counting the months since Skeeter's last rabies shot (seven), the vet said that he didn't think it was absolutely necessary to administer a booster shot, but he was willing if I was still concerned. \"How much is the shot,\" I asked, and when he said twenty-three bucks I told him to go ahead and do it. He did absolutely recommend, and I agreed to, a long-acting, broad-spectrum antibiotic injection that should cover Skeeter for about ten days without us having to restrain him while he's sore and freaked out to administer daily oral meds. We also agreed that Skeet needed to go on immediate heartworm and general parasite prophylaxis (Revolution) and stay on it for at least three months, and when the vet said they recommend it year-round even for indoor cats I bought an eight-month supply (buy six, get two free) without batting an eyelash or even asking how much it cost. I questioned that decision a little at the front desk when I found that it would take all of my hoarded cash tips, plus the entire remaining available credit on our \"break glass in case of emergency\" card, plus everything we had in the bank to cover the bill, but only because I hadn't asked about the cost of the Revolution prior to going with the eight-month supply.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I've been sick as a dog and emotionally hung over since then; I actually called in sick yesterday, which I generally don't do even if I am miserably ill. I spent most of the day curled up in bed with my Skeet, and I think it was good for both of us. Today I am not really any better physically, but mentally it feels like I've got most of the pieces back together, I guess. We need the money more than ever, but the difference between \"almost completely broke and my cat is gone\" and \"COMPLETELY-completely broke but there is a purring kitty in bed with me\" makes things seem kind of alright.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401a73ddea315970d-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/06/skeeter-the-explanation-post.html", "title": "Skeeter (the explanation post)"},

When I got home, Little Child overheard me thanking Hotter for the \"happy anniversary\" text, and said \"OH DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN HAVE A SPECIAL DINNER, LIKE PIZZA???\" I said no, that neither Hotter nor I would choose pizza to celebrate the occasion, and that it was really more about us than him, and then I went to take a nap because I worked a double yesterday and didn't get home until seven hours before I had to leave for work again.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The next thing I knew Hotter was standing over me yelling my name, and I opened my eyes to blood EVERYWHERE. He'd had a glass break in his hands as he was doing dishes and slash his wrist, hitting at least one blood vessel in the process. I unrolled several paper towels, had Hotter apply pressure to the wound, and told him to get in the car so we could go to the ER. He said he wasn't going to Local Teaching Hospital and to take him to Urgent Care. I said the cut looked too deep for Urgent Care, and that they'd probably send us to the ER, and Hotter's legs promptly buckled so I decided to get him in the car and just head to Urgent Care and see what they said.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Wouldn't you know it, they took one look, said they saw tendon and the wound was therefore too deep for Urgent Care, and we then had to double back, give Big Child Hotter's phone and some pizza money, and go to Local Teaching Hospital after all.

GET YOUR FLU SHOTS, PEOPLE! I may have succumbed to a strain that wasn't covered by the vaccine, but I pick up snotty napkins for a living so it was kind of bound to happen. YOU DO NOT WANT THIS.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0/PSA\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In other news, Poppy and Skeeter are ALMOST getting along. I mean, they LIKE each other. They like to PLAY together. They both want to sleep in the big bed with us, and yet...they can't seem to leave each other alone if they're both in with us at night. This is mostly the cat's fault. He's an asshole. Our solution thus far has been a $10 pressure-mounted baby gate across the open bedroom door; the cat can jump it if things get too rowdy, and the dog knows she's not supposed to try. After last night, when we were awakened by the cat on my head and the dog on Hotter's head performing an intricate\u00a0pas de douche, our next-step solution might just be amputating everyone's paws and installing casters on their leg-stumps.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Stay tuned for a picture of the dog and the cat lying in bed helplessly side-by-side, with their casters locked, captioned \"WHEELIE BUDDIES BFFS!!! <3\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/01/flu.html", "title": "flu"},
{"date": "January 20, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Hotter's arm is still all messed up from when he gashed his wrist, and I am starting to wonder if the curmudgeonly hand surgeon who came, flexed his wrist while peering intently into the wound, declared it to be mostly superficial and not in need of surgery, and sewed it up was wrong in saying it would heal okay without further intervention. Either way I am getting tired of having to work AND take care of much of the stuff Hotter usually does at home, or maybe I am just getting tired, period.\r\n* \u00a0 My health: I've done another round of antibiotics and steroids for flu-related bronchitis since last I blogged about my health, and am still coughing. Effing flu!\r\n* \u00a0 The MFA Honeybees: Alpha Hive is dead (RIP Alpha Hive, 2012-2014). I'm not sure whether I inadvertently killed their queen or they got Colony Collapsed or what. It looked like they all just dropped dead at once. With a full \"deep\" of honey on top of the hive. So I took the brood chamber off the hive, put Bravo Hive's brood chamber on Alpha's bottom board (Bravo was balanced atop an old cabinet door because I couldn't afford another proper setup), and gave them the deep full of honey to help them get through the rest of the winter. Hopefully Bravo will flourish, and it will all turn out to be worth waiting tables today with no chin but just a continuous, wraparound cheek (singular). Because yeah, Bravo stung me in the face THROUGH my veil as I was moving them, and it took a double dose of Benadryl and some steroids we had lying around to halt the swelling that moved up from my chin to my entire bottom jaw and then started on my tongue. OOF.\r\n* \u00a0 The XY continues to be the source of much vexation to me and mine, and I had to take tomorrow off of work because we have court. Not the \"maybe something to do with ending the miserable, soul-sucking, day-destroying child-exchanges that make everyone so unhappy\" kind of court or \"now that effer will pay a FAIR amount of child support\" kind of court, but rather \"maybe the XY will go to jail for a bit or pay a fine, but everything that sucks about this situation will continue to do so if not get even WORSE and most likely it will have been a total waste of time\" kind of court. Nobody wins! Whoo tits...not.\r\n* \u00a0 Isis. Banfield lost her ashes. Or rather, they blamed the cremation company, but when I raised hell and said \"YOU TOLD ME TWO WEEKS, I PAID $300 TO HAVE HER CREMATED AND RETURNED TO ME, WHAT THE FUCK\" and they \"researched it\" I got a voicemail today saying that they had \"found...er, not FOUND but um, the cremation company DELIVERED Isis's ashes, so you can pick them up now.\" So I picked her ashes up today. They're in a nice wooden box that says \"Isis. A Good Dog.\" The place also sent along a paw print and fur clipping, and a nice pewter frame with paw prints on it to put a picture in and display with the wooden box, all in a black cloth bag with a sympathy card. So that's nice, I guess? Fucking Banfield.\r\n* \u00a0 Things at work are...different. There's kind of a Day Shift/Night Shift Sharks/Jets thing going on, so The Powers That Be put the management in charge of Day Shift in charge of Night Shift, and vice versa, I think with the idea in mind that it would help the two groups to better understand each other, make the managers more versatile, and expose the workers to new ideas. It's a good idea. IN THEORY. In practice it's kind of disconcerting and I don't think anybody is enjoying it very much. I am not among the unhappiest workers, because I simply do not care about workplace politics and just show up to pour people's coffee and have them give me some of their money in return. Other than that, I pretty much do what Management tells me, go to HR when I need help with my benefits or a Pervy Busboy situation, and mind my effing business. However, I'm not a fan of change in general either so MEH TO THIS, POWERS THAT BE. MEH I SAY!\r\n* \u00a0 I have made some really good stuff recently, including homemade coconut oil and beeswax hand balm that I am hoping will help my hands not fall apart under all of the washing they go through, this bacon and root-veg dinner that was AMAZING, and bangin' mango salsa to go with tuna steaks and black beans and cilantro-lime rice.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter is being kind of a jerk, I think largely because pain brings out the best in no one. The Hippie Food Coop delivery service we order from is due to come today and deliver a bunch of food, and I told Hotter it would either be between 3 and 5 or between 5 and 7. He remembers it as me having said \"they WILL be here between 3 and 5, just came at me with The Angry Face, and wanted to know when they were REALLY coming. I searched my Gmail for the order receipt, saw that it said between 5 and 7, and relayed that information to Hotter, who shouted that he just wants me to STOP LYING. So that's swell. I'm going to go...something. I don't know. Probably make dinner while Hotter enumerates my various shortcomings for my edification, or maybe jump off the roof? We'll see.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/01/monday-evening-bullets.html", "title": "Monday evening bullets"},

However, the brilliant writing and extremely high Bad Fun Quotient have won me over in the case of this series, and so it came to pass that a co-worker and I were discussing it the other night after I watched the last new episode (previously she would try to talk about it and I would run away yelling with my fingers in my ears).\u00a0\r\nMFA Mama: Okay, I finished watching.

{"date": "June 28, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday I got a package, and because Hotter is obsessed with mail, and unopened packages, he asked eagerly what it was. \"Vitamins,\" I said. \"For Poppy?\" \"No, for me. Probiotics, to be exact.\" He looked puzzled. \"I take them every day. They prevent female problems, and some studies have shown that they lessen anxiety and help with depression.\" He pondered on that for a moment, and then said \"maybe you ought to take something else for the chronic depression. You're still pretty depressed.\" I pointed out that I take the maximum dose of the most effective SSRI/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for me. \"Well, but...like maybe another vitamin or something. I read that sometimes depressed people are low on Vitamin D.\" Yes, I said, which is why I take 5,000 IU of that per day. \"Maybe you need more Synthroid?\" I told him that actually according to my most recent bloodwork I could maybe use slightly less, but my doctor had agreed to leave it alone since my mood is so heavily influenced by my thyroid and my heart is okay with things the way they are. \"Oh. Well is there anything else natural or whatever?\" I told him I also take a shit-ton of fish oil, which is supposed to be a natural mood stabilizer, and Co-Q-10, which allegedly improves mentation in some subjects, and eat a lot of blueberries and take b-vitamins, because those are supposed to fight depression too, and that short of sticking a fork in an electrical outlet to try and replicate ECT there wasn't much else I could do to try and boost my mood while I'm uninsured. \"But I guess once I'm insured again I can go back to my psychiatrist and see if any new drugs have come along since we last spoke,\" I said, and kind of mentally cringed at how flat my voice sounded, even to me. And then I went and laid down and opened my laptop, because if you lie down while awake and stare at the ceiling you look depressed as hell but if you lie down and stare at your laptop you're reading.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter came into the bedroom and stared at me. \"What's wrong?\" Nothing, I said. \"No really, what?\" I said I thought I was hiding it better, and then started crying out of nowhere. Crap. \"I didn't mean to make you feel bad. I just want you to be happier, for...\" I held my breath, because I was afraid he was going to say \"the kids,\" and my entire goal in life is to not let my mental health fuck up my children, because if I can accomplish that much on top of not breaking any of their bones or letting them catch me at any adultery then I'll be totally winning at life and doing a WAY better job than The Narcissist did. And we all just want to do better by our kids than our own parents did by us, right? \"I just want you to be happier for your own sake.\" I exhaled, and wiped my eyes, and said I just thought I'd been hiding it better. I think at that point Hotter could tell what I was thinking, because he said that I did hide it pretty well from everybody but him, but he noticed and wished I wasn't depressed was all.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The funny thing is, a couple of days ago one of my more bitter co-workers grabbed me by the elbow and pulled me aside. \"How do you do it?\" she asked. \"Do what,\" I asked in return. \"How are you so happy and upbeat all the goddamn time?\" I said something about that being what people want from us in the hospitality industry. Later that same night, a guest at another server's table, a little old lady, called me over and asked me what my secret was. \"You're just so lively! My goodness, I've been watching you and you never stop! You remember everyone's orders without writing them down and you always have a smile on your face...you're just a delight!\" At the time I was actually pretty irritated, because the shift was kind of going to hell and I was trying to do eleventy-hundred things at once and didn't have time to talk to a little old lady who WASN'T EVEN MY FUCKING TABLE, but I smiled and said \"caffeine! Enough to give a pony a heart attack,\" and then scurried away to track down some Dijon mustard for somebody and heckle the kitchen about the ticket time on my large party and steal some soup spoons from Banquets.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I guess I probably do hide it pretty well, but I'm also pretty fucking depressed, and have been for a while now, and I have no idea what to do about that.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/11/18/244526773/gut-bacteria-might-guide-the-workings-of-our-minds", "http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/814672"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/06/oh-i-see-1.html", "title": "Oh.

This would be less of a big deal if not for the fact that my kids receive free breakfast and lunch at school, so two meals per day time three kids times five days plus boredom-snacking put a real dent in our pantry.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Now we're faced with Polar Vortex II: Still In Denial About Climate Change, Asshole? and school is already closed for tomorrow but I still have to white-knuckle it to work in my little Beater before the sun and the salt trucks are up. Plus my ex-husband decided to demand extra visitation time on short notice with one child only DURING A BLIZZARD and have a hissy-fit when I declined to drag us all to the neutral exchange location at least twice (but realistically more like three or four times, with the way things have been going at exchanges lately) in all of this. Faaaaabulous.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All of the above meant my feelings wanted candy, but it wasn't in the budget. HOWEVER! Having Alpha Hive drop dead means that not only did Bravo inherit a \"deep\" of capped honey, but there was also enough to harvest several frames, and I had honey to burn. Some Googling around led me to this recipe for honey-sweetened salted caramel, but didn't make heavy cream, brown sugar, gluten-free vanilla extract, waxed paper, and a candy thermometer magically appear in my kitchen. So I halved the recipe, made some substitutions, and winged it with a cup of cold water\u00a0and a greased Pyrex dish.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If you use slightly over half a cup of honey, half a cup of whole milk, a quarter cup of butter, a quarter cup of organic coconut palm sugar, and the innards from a 3/4-inch section of vanilla bean, cook it to the hard-ball stage more or less according to the instructions from the link, pour it into a coconut-oiled Pyrex, and grind Pink Himalayan Salt over the whole shebang, then cool it in the freezer because you have no patience, your caramels will be darker than the ones pictured with the instructions (sorry, no photos because OM NOM NOM SALTED CARAMEL) but acceptably delicious.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And maybe Simple Truth Organic canola oil in a spray-can isn't as good as Pam cooking spray, or fresh raw honey doesn't act like supermarket honey, or what-have-you, but I tried that \"spray the measuring cup and the honey will slide right out\" trick and wasn't impressed.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Oh well.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am still moping for the most part, but my feelings are DELICIOUS.

{"date": "January 31, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I have a co-worker who is very curious, a keen observer of others, and a tireless investigator of all the things. We'll call them Curious George. Curious George, in addition to being curious, has little sense of tact, an overly-inflated sense of personal importance, and a big mouth. Here are some of the questions that Curious George has asked me:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Do you have any siblings? What do you do besides work? Do you have any friends? Why did you divorce your first husband? Do you have any hobbies? Why are you so weird? How come you're sick so much? Did you have a fucked up childhood?\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If you don't answer Curious George's questions, George wants to know why you're hiding things, reminds you that they are an open book, and informs you that that is the very best way to be. I generally answer truthfully or else try to redirect or deflect. Here is how I have answered George on the above:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yes and no, some half-siblings, only one of whom I have even met. I spend time with my family and I have a garden and a lot of animals that keep me busy. Yes, don't you? Because we brought out the worst in each other and I thought his worst was worse than my worst. I like to cook and read. Why do you think I'm weird? I have asthma. That is a very odd question to ask--yes, actually it is, well, I suppose it depends on your definition of fucked-up.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0George answered my rebuttal question re: my weirdness by stating that I often look like I am listening to people around me who are not talking directly to me, and opined that perhaps I am trying to eavesdrop on George's very important personal conversations with others at work because I am nosy.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0OH YES.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0For some idiotic reason, on that day I felt the need to justify myself to George, and explained that I don't always hear well, because I have a Central Auditory Processing Defect, and therefore have to pay closer attention to my surroundings in order to figure out whether someone is talking to me at any given moment than the average bear. I meant to reassure George that I had no intention of eavesdropping.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Today Curious George apparently reached a verdict on me, and chose to render judgment in a manner I found highly offensive, enough so that I mentioned it to Management, who agreed that what George said was offensive and said that they would speak to George about it. George then took me aside and delivered one of those \"I'm sorry you chose to be offended by what I said, but...\" non-apologies that people sometimes give you when they're being right-fighters, and followed it up with \"and I guess I know how to handle YOU in the future.\" At that point I went to HR and was like \"look, I would like to drop this and move on, but I don't think George intends to do that.\" HR called George to join the conversation, and George proceeded to get extremely heated, lie about some irrelevant details, and \"explain\" to me how right they were.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And all the while, George spoke very slowly, over-enunciating in the way that some people like to do to indicate that they think the person they are speaking to is being deliberately obtuse.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Or, you know, if they know the other person has a hard time hearing and are mocking them, because they're an asshole.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I hate when people are assholes.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think I'm going to start answering all of Curious George's questions with \"HUH?

It's old, it's American, it has an automatic transmission, and I therefore love nothing about it except that it will (presumably) get me to work tomorrow.

{"date": "February  3, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0A few days ago, during the tail-end of the second Polar Vortex, Skeeter somehow slipped outside when Hotter or Big Child was walking a dog (I was at work). They estimate that he was outside for about two hours; the next time Big Child took Bumpus out, Bumpus tracked something under the porch that turned out to be a very cold hairless cat. On Saturday Skeeter started to sneeze, yesterday he began to cough and have the eye-boogies, and this morning Hotter and I took him to our new, non-Banfield vet to have them check him out (he has been eating and drinking and playing all along or I would've taken him to an emergency vet over the weekend, but fortunately he was able to wait).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I called to make the appointment, the receptionist asked what breed of cat Skeeter was. I said he was a Sphynx, and she said \"ooooooh!\" and couldn't find that in the computer. There also wasn't a way to tell the computer a cat was pink and grey, and she eventually put him in as a grey and white domestic shorthair and said she'd have someone add \"Sphynx\" and \"pink and grey\" to the computer.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0An hour later, when we arrived at the clinic and told them who we were, the receptionist shouted \"THEY'RE HERE!\" and the entire office staff came running. Apparently half of them had never seen a Sphynx cat in person and the other half just looooooved Sphynxes. We let Skeet out of the cat carrier, and he hopped up onto Hotter's shoulder and greeted everyone with a wagging tail (Skeet wags his tail when he's happy or excited; apparently it's a Sphynx thing--he also fetches, is friendly to strangers, and generally acts more like a dog than a cat). Eventually Skeeter had a coughing fit, reminding everyone that he hadn't come there just to be adored by the office cat-ladies, and we were ushered into an exam room. The official diagnosis was \"upper respiratory infection,\" and the vet said his lungs sounded nice and clear so we caught it before it turned into pneumonia or anything nasty like that and ten days of Clavamox should sort him out. I asked whether we should have Skeet on heartworm prevention, since there was a poster up advertising that for cats (I haven't had a cat in ages and heartworm prevention for cats wasn't really A Thing back then), and the vet said yes but that we should wait until he's better before giving him the first dose to make sure we know what he's reacting to if he takes a turn for the worse. \"It comes in chewables and topical, and I usually tell people to go with the topical for cats since they can be kind of finicky, but I don't know how well that would work without fur to soak it up...it might just dribble off without absorbing...I think maybe you should try the chewable with this guy,\" the vet said, laughing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Eighty-nine dollars and two free cat toys later, we collected a tiny bottle of antibiotic drops and took our seven-pound celebrity home to recover.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/02/celebrity.html", "title": "celebrity"},

A friend of nearly twenty years, someone I would absolutely Be There For Until The End, has let me know that the end is nigh, and seems to be dying rather suddenly of the same thing that killed Dead Friend 1.0, which is also a chronic condition of Hotter's (cue the feelings). And The XY has run amok, voiced his intention to thoroughly violate the custody order by taking a child out of school to go to an elective medical appointment for an issue The XY and I disagree on that is less a matter of anyone's wellbeing and more a cosmetic matter of personal preference, and stated that he will document my interference and relitigate custody if I interfere, which I absolutely plan to do. FUN!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All of that is to say that I hesitated on whether to share the following slice-of-my-life vignette, because hostile attorneys could be reading, but this used to be a funny blog, and funny things still happen, even in 2014, and I have a strong and loving marriage which, as those do, occasionally includes some sex with my spouse, and so here in no particular order are the top ten questions and comments Big Child called through the bedroom door as Hotter and I, overcome by my being both home and awake, attempted to have a quickie this morning:\r\n1. You said to pour Little Child some cereal, but Middly wants some too. What do I do?*\u00a0\r\n2. There aren't very many mini-wheats left.**\r\n3. We're out of regular milk. There's chocolate milk and almond milk. Which one should I use on my cereal?***\r\n4. I'd kind of like to try the almond milk. Is that okay?\r\n5. In a glass, not on my cereal. Is that still okay?\r\n6. Are the glasses in the dishwasher clean?\r\n7. What about the spoons?\r\n8. What's a briGANd?\u00a0\r\n9. Is that how it's pronounced? Well, what's a brigand?\r\n10. POPPY IS THROWING UP!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If The XY's attorneys ARE reading this, could you please ask your client to stop canceling his visitation? Because breakfast would go much more smoothly over here on snow days if I could properly fuck my husband for more than ten minutes at a go and while the children are NOT home. Thanks!\r\n\u00a0\r\n* Bless his cotton socks, Big Child is not very self-directing, even at nearly thirteen.\r\n** There were three other varieties of healthy breakfast cereal available, but Big Child is an informer by nature.\r\n*** Something about snow and ice make people crave milk, evidently, because there was no organic milk to be had except the chocolate kind.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/02/what-happens-in-an-ice-storm.html", "title": "what happens in an ice storm"},

My premium was due 6/1 and I went online on 5/31 to pay it and it showed my policy as canceled. But it was a weekend, so I called Anthem on Monday and was like \"hi please take my money\" and they were like \"sure but you still won't have health insurance. We want you to pay for two months at once and THEN you can pay up front for your first month of this shitty NEW plan we're force-migrating you to because the ACA, with which you won't be able to afford healthcare but you'll be good with the law!\" I was like \"okay how much will that cost? I can't afford three months' premiums at once! If I deposit my paycheck I can do two, but...\" And they were like \"dunno you have to call this other number and ask THEM. Go ahead and do that if you need to then call us back and give us all your money.\" So I called the other number and got the details, but they couldn't take my money until I paid the people at the OTHER number, who by that time were closed.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Today when I called back they were \"oh, nope! Yesterday was the last day you could do that. Now you're uninsured and you owe Urgent Care $600 because we're backdating the cancellation!\" The girl I talked to today was at least nice, and said she'd ask a manager if they could make an exception. But I didn't hear back from her so I'm guessing they said no, or else maybe Anthem realized they had an employee who wasn't evil to the fucking core and fired her.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0For all that I believe in the goodness of the ACA, from where I sit today it's hard not to hate it; before the ACA I had good, affordable coverage, and now the best that I as an individual can get is shitty, expensive coverage. The \"Gold\" ACA plans aren't even AVAILABLE where I live, FFS!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0So it looks like I'll be buying Pristiq out of pocket and holding out for my employer's plan, which I can get on after 60 days.

Here are some assorted updates!\n\n* The two older MFA Children made the honor roll again.\n\n* The XY tried to kidnap Little Child from school today and I had to leave work and call 911 and go to the school and say that no, he did NOT have my permission to do that! This was for an endocrinology appointment I learned about three days ago and told the XY we'd have to reschedule. He said \"no, Monday works for me so I'm taking him without you and you can't stop me!\" Except I did, and rescheduled the appointment for a day when I'll be off work and able to be there, and more importantly, Little Child won't miss a class party he was looking forward to. I just wish I could've managed it without leaving work for an hour and a half...\n\n* Speaking of work, and hours, I am now working in three different departments, none of which contain The Bastard. That part is GLORIOUS! The eighty-hour weeks, not so much. I miss my kids. Unfortunately, the XY seems determined to go back to court, and I have to raise a retainer. \"But MFA Mama,\" you say, \"wouldn't it be better for the boys to have you home more? Or if you spent that money on a family vacation?\" Yes, of course it would! But this is not about them, it's about The XY and his feeeeelings.\n\n* The new MFA Minivan is growing on me, mostly because van naps between doubles are a thing again.\n\n* One of the new departments I've been working in rhymes with \"chalet\" and involves things that go vroom. I mentioned to Hotter the other day that I'm the only non-dude in the department, and he said he wasn't surprised. I asked why that was and he said \"even if they DID know how to drive a stick, how many women do you know who haven't had a moving violation in the last thirty-six months?\" I took a breath to bawl him out and then realized none of my brick-and-mortar female friends would qualify. So I need better friends, or else a better husband, or possibly both.\n\n* Man, cars have just gotten RIDICULOUS. Why didn't y'all tell me they don't have keys anymore? Or Park, on the gear shift (it's a button on most new high-end vehicles now). Hell, the other day I went to retrieve someone's new BMW and sat there for a good thirty seconds trying to find a gear-shift of some kind. There wasn't a clutch, so I knew it was automatic, but how to shift gears? There was nothing sticking out of the steering column except the turn signal/wiper thingy. Finally I spotted a goddamn LED wheel on the dash with D, 1, 2, and R on it; it looked like it ought to belong to the stereo but was, in fact, what one used to switch gears. THE FUCK.

I need yoga in my life again, and have decided to set a goal of daily workouts until I am employed outside the home again. If I'm going to be unemployed, I might as well be unemployed and ripped like Jesus. Yoga really helps me manage my stress levels in a healthy way, and being in shape will be useful if I get a job that is physically demanding. Plus that gives me somewhere to go when I need people under this roof out of my face. The YMCA is made of win!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/updates-various.html", "title": "updates, various"},

There is one in particular called \"balanced half-moon\" that I positively suck at (at least in class). Yesterday after the gym I went blackberry-picking, and as I was leaning over a patch of thorns to pick a cluster of hard-to-reach berries with my back leg extended to counterbalance my upper body and my berry-bag held up and out of thorn-snagging range, I realized I was standing steady as a rock in balanced half-moon.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And that, kids, is called MOTIVATION!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/motivation.html", "title": "motivation"},
{"date": "June 28, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 This morning I set an early alarm and went to \"Restorative Yoga\" at the YMCA. Restorative Yoga (as taught in this location by this instructor anyway), it turns out, means \"lying around on the mat like a slug barely moving yoga.\" It was more mind than body, complete with inspirational readings, which meant I spent a great deal of the class mentally making the jerk-off motion while lying down and executing a series of gentle stretches. THUMBS-DOWN! The next class in the studio, it turned out, was hot Vinyasa yoga though. I've been wanting to try hot yoga, so I stuck around. Hot Vinyasa yoga kicked my ass and took my lunch money. It was great! And then a cute butchy Jewish gal complimented The Jew Tattoo, so all in all it was a good day at the gym.\r\n* \u00a0 I took Hotter and the boys downtown with me today in the MFA Beater to sign my offer letter and give HR my photo ID and Social Security card to copy. The boys have been to the building I will be working in before as part of a tour of downtown and were excited to show it to Hotter and see it again themselves (it's VERY impressive, as in floor-to-ceiling marble in the lobby, ornately-carved wooden accents, hand-painted murals, infinity fountains and the like).\r\n* \u00a0 Unfortunately Hotter was extremely bad company, the MFA Beater drove worse than usual (which is really saying something), and the boys were a nuisance in the car (by which I mean they were doing things like thumping around in the backseat while I was parallel parking and making me think I hit something, shrieking so that I couldn't hear what the engine was doing, which is key to knowing when to punch the gas in order to keep the Beater from stalling out, and generally reminding me why I only pack us all into the same vehicle every few months when the memory of how godawful it is has faded). It was kind of a toss-up whether Hotter or the children were the bigger buzzkill, honestly. Sigh.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter, it turns out, was in the process of taking ill with joint pain, a low-grade temperature, and lots of whimpering (literal, actual whimpering). He was initially saying he wanted to go to Urgent Care, but I gave him A Look and said \"here is the thing: Urgent Care will do one of two things. They will do some bloodwork and tell you it's a virus and drink lots of fluids, or freak out because of the transplant angle and send you to the ER at Local Teaching Hospital no matter what is or isn't wrong with you, and either way it will cost us a couple hundred dollars. So your options are to sack up, take some Tylenol, drink lots of water, and see how you feel in the morning, or if you're that miserable we can go straight to the ER and cut out the very expensive middleman.\" Hotter chose Option A, which I think was a good call.\r\n* \u00a0 Peanut butter and neufchatel cheese sandwiches with pink Himalayan salt and raisins are life-changingly delicious, by the way. Just throwing that out there. I think the textures of the ingredients help you not notice you're eating gluten-free bread if you swing that way.\r\n* \u00a0 All in all, today had its ups and downs, mostly downs, and I didn't get nearly as much work done for Temp Agency #2 as I would have liked to, but I have a job so it still beats most of the last two months hands-down. Also, I have Made A Friend via this humble blog who is now a co-worker at Temp Agency #2, and e-mailing back and forth with her throughout the day about the things we individually and mutually hate is surprisingly good for my morale. So not too bad of a Friday at all.\r\n* \u00a0 And how are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/the-good-and-bad-of-my-day-today.html", "title": "the good and bad of my day today"},
{"date": "June 26, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Male bees (more properly called drones) don't do much. In fact, if it weren't for the fact that they carry the hive's genetics out into the wild and, if they're lucky, find a virgin queen to mate with and pass them on, you could say they do nothing at all. Drones don't gather any pollen or nectar, they don't build any comb, heck they don't even chew their way out of the cells they pupate in. They just nip a little hole and stick their feelers out and flail them helplessly until some nurse bee takes pity and chews them the rest of the way out. Then they walk around on the comb begging for workers to feed them, and only when the girl-bees in the hive had Had Enough and chase them out (or sometimes drag them out--I've watched this and it's kind of hilarious--drones are about twice the size of workers, but the workers have outrage on their side and will drag the drones behind them by a leg or a wing in fits and starts, buzzing furiously, and throw them off the landing board as if to say \"GET A JOB, ASSHOLE!\") do they even go out looking for love.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Lately I have been seeing some parallels between the bees around here and the humans around here.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Temp Agency #2, you see, is work that one can do from home. All you need is a computer, basic literacy, and the critical reasoning skills most people have down pat by about the fifth grade. A couple of y'all have asked why Hotter doesn't work from home to augment our income in the past, and I've replied that actual work-from-home jobs that aren't scams are pretty hard to find, and that his disability checks at least mean he doesn't COST me anything (plus he saves me having to find and pay for childcare so that I can work). When a friend of mine got me hired at Temp Agency #2, I was therefore very excited and asked her to get Hotter on board with them as well, which she did.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then for three months there was the sound of crickets.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Well, if crickets sounded like \"hey, how come you haven't started doing work for Temp Agency #2?\" and \"Eh, it doesn't look like much fun,\" and occasionally \"well that is why they PAY you do it\" and then dead silence.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday was payday at Temp Agency #2, and while my paycheck from them was my best yet (the promotion I recently got helps), when I crunched the numbers I was disheartened to find that we still aren't going to be able to pay all of the bills. So I brought it up with Hotter again. At first he tried to ignore me, and then he snapped that he tries to save us money by encouraging me and the children to close the storm door and turn lights off more diligently but nooooo we just act like electricity grows on trees, so clearly nobody WANTS his help and flounced off. I ordered some things we needed online while he was off flouncing, and went back to working on some things for Temp Agency #2.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When Hotter was done flouncing, he asked if I was going to the grocery store today, because he had run out of an over-the-counter medication that he takes daily to alleviate some symptoms that are most likely a side effect of one of his transplant meds (we've discussed it with Transplant and with the Relevant Specialist, and reached a dead end in that the only thing besides taking the OTC remedy that is likely to help with the symptoms would be a change in transplant meds, and nobody wants to mess with those). I asked if he could make do until the package from drugstore.com, where I'd just ordered more of that in addition to some other household goods, arrived, and he got snappish with me. So I dropped it. I mean, I do without things that are prescribed by a doctor for issues no OTC medication will help with ALL THE TIME because of money, but Hotter doesn't see his doing the same as a valid option and I don't like to fight with him or be seen as miserly and cruel, so I dropped it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Cut to this morning. Lefty recently got out of jail, and is attempting to go to a vocational training school of sorts, for which he needs to take out a student loan, and because he is still under twenty-one he needs a copy of at least one parent's most recent tax return to do it. Hotter's ex-wife's new husband makes a good enough living that it would disqualify Lefty from receiving the loan, so Lefty needs a copy of OUR tax return. Hotter had asked me if we could overnight that to Lefty, and I had replied that while I wanted to help Lefty out with this, we just don't have the money to be overnighting things so regular first class mail was the best solution I could offer. As I was drinking my coffee and following up on a few things for Temp Agency #2 online, Hotter came bouncing up and cheerfully informed me that he'd decided to make some temporary lifestyle changes that would allow him to do without the OTC remedy we'd discussed last night, \"so instead I'd like you to overnight our tax return to Lefty with that money.\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0*record-scratching noise*\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0First of all, overnighting something costs about ten times what a small packet of the OTC medication in question does, so he was comparing apples and oranges (or clementines and pummeloes, maybe). Second of all, we don't really have the money for EITHER of those things. Giving up one doesn't make us magically able to afford the other. Third of all, and I want to make it very clear to y'all (as I did to Hotter) that while I am NOT criticizing Hotter's desire to help his son AT ALL, why was it unreasonable of me to suggest Hotter go without the OTC meds for a day or two while the new bottle shipped in order to help us save money and keep the household afloat, but a good and happy idea for him to go without them to help Lefty out? Again, I am NOT criticizing Hotter's willingness to subject himself to inconvenience and/or minor discomfort in order to help his son. But yeah, that made me really angry.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When reflecting on it for a few moments didn't help me feel any better about the situation, I decided that Hotter and I needed to have a talk. I asked him why he felt like it was okay for me to have two or even three jobs to help our family get by, but not for him to take on some work from Temp Agency #2. He said he never asked me to get a second or third job. I said no, it's just what I do if that is what it takes because we need the money. He then pointed out that in looking over our taxes, I didn't earn that much more than he did last year. I...well. Not to sound like a bitch, because Hotter definitely worked hard to put money into The System and I do feel that he is entitled to his disability checks, which absolutely help us, and don't doubt that he'd rather be healthy and able to work in his career field, but...it is not the same thing. Passively collecting a check each month and playing online RPGs all night when the kids are in bed is not the same as busting your ass and giving up sleep, spare time, and all forms of recreation to bring in a paycheck. If I earned enough that my paychecks combined with his disability checks would pay the bills, I wouldn't ask him to lift a finger, but that doesn't cover everything, so why is it all on ME to make up the difference? He said I willingly volunteered to work for Temp Agency #2, whereas I had my friend get him hired there without even asking him. I said yes, I willingly volunteered BECAUSE WE NEED THE MONEY, and while I had been guilty of ASSUMING he would be willing and eager to do the same, why wasn't he? He then pointed out that he trained as a chef. I in turn pointed out that I trained to write bestsellers, but since I don't appear to have a bestseller in me am willing to do other things to help our family and again, why wasn't he? He said \"yeah, or you just aren't willing to try!\" Which sure, okay, kick me in the nuts for suffering from writer's block when it comes to fiction and imply that if I'd just get over myself we'd be rich. That's SUPER-HELPFUL and not at all mean or hurtful!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'll spare you a blow-by-blow of the rest of the conversation, but the end result is that Hotter very resentfully said he'd start doing some work for Temp Agency #2, I bought the OTC medication anyway because it was on sale for much cheaper than it usually is and that couple of dollars isn't going to make that much of a difference (we're not going to be able to pay both the rent and the electric bill either way), and I am left feeling like a worker bee who is having to take a break from toiling to bring in pollen and nectar and chew some lazy asshole drone out of his pupation cell.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I wasn't originally going to write about this. Not because Hotter forbade me, but because there are those on the innernet who like to gloat over my poor lifechoices and will no doubt have a field day with this. They can go ahead and do that, I guess. Maybe I have it coming. I never realized that if an opportunity to help us out financially came along and it wasn't something that sounded like fun to him, Hotter would be the kind of person who would see digging his heels in and refusing to do it as an option. I'm pretty bummed about that. And kind of doubtful that he'll actually follow through without resenting the hell out of me over it, although I'd love to be surprised. But this is where I come to write about what's in my heart and my head, and I am really struggling with this. When I pointed out to Hotter this morning that I couldn't even blog about this because I didn't want to open him (and myself) up to public criticism, he looked me in the eye and told me he did not give a SHIT about public opinion and I could write about it if I wanted to. He also pointed out that \"you're always telling the blog and Twitter that you're the breadwinner!\" His tone kind of implied that that was a negative and deliberately insulting thing for me to say, or maybe that I was stretching the truth there, I guess because of his disability checks. Maybe it's a blow to his manhood? I don't know. But since he claims not to care whether I write about this or not, that is what is making me sad today: I didn't realize I had married a drone.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n* With apologies to Sue Monk Kidd, who wrote an excellent book by that title.**** Lest Stalky dampen her desk chair in excitement over my having DONE SOMETHING ILLEGALZ, you cannot copyright a title.

Her little cough that she'd had since we brought her home (and that she was on antibiotics for when we got her) turned nasty and wet, and I took her to the vet prepared to hear that she had LUNG CANCER or some such shit, not even realizing how much I'd worked myself up about it until I was SO RELIEVED when the vet was unconcerned and pronounced it all to be \"typical post-Pound crud.\" So Poppy is on antibiotics and steroids, and a medicated ointment for her yucky ears, and gained nine pounds in ten days per the vet's scale.

His most recent shenanigans involve 1) trying to move the site of our child-exchanges to the schoolbus stop by my house permanently (I agreed to it on a one-time basis due to my having to work Christmas Day and knew it would be problematic; you give that effer ONE INCH and the next thing you know he's peeing in your yard), 2) e-mailing me while we were waiting for him at the actual exchange location to say he'd be half an hour late, 3) parking in a handicapped spot at the exchange location and stating that he wasn't letting the kids out of his truck until I did the same (I pulled over next to the adjacent median and put my flashers on, because there wasn't much traffic, the boys would not be crossing any pavement to get from truck to Beater, and I didn't want to shut the car off and give the XY the opportunity to try and pick a fight), which led to a standoff, because a) No b) he doesn't get to tell me what to do and was only trying to be a controlling dick and pick a fight and c) NO. Finally I parked in a non-handicapped spot and he let the kids out. I have to do this every Wednesday and every other Friday for the next ten years. Oy!\r\n* \u00a0 One of Big Child's gifts this last year was this\u00a0DNA test kit for the Bumpus-hound:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We have duly swabbed the dog's cheeks and sent his DNA off for analysis, and should get a result of some sort within two to three weeks. My best guess is that we'll get a letter from the folks at Wisdom Panel inquiring as to how we got the possum and the Saluki to Do It and whether there are any littermates available for study.\r\n* \u00a0 Our lease is up in February, and I don't want to replace our defunct hens until that hurdle is past us. I don't THINK MFA Landlord will decline to renew the lease or anything crazy (despite Trashcan Neighbor's best efforts), but I know he'll raise the rent because he always does, and hopefully he doesn't get TOO greedy. I should be cleaning the house in preparation for a potential inspection RIGHT NOW, but instead I have The Plague, damn it all.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?# Hi.

Which means that when I separated the two \"deeps\" some larvae were exposed, and I had to scrape away the brood-comb that didn't belong with my hive tool.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In my Sustainable Beekeeping class, they did say that if you cut into any brood and release the larval alarm pheremone, your bees will get REALLY PISSED. Having now seen this in action, I think that statement ought to contain at least two more reallys. Because OH MY DAMN, THEY WERE SO VERY, VERY ANGRY! They covered me in an furious cloud and started stinging the everloving bejesus out of me. I totally panicked, which is the LAST thing to do in such a situation, but a sting waaaaaaay up high on my inner thigh was the last straw, and I did run for it. And guess what? THEY FOLLOWED ME.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I am sporting ten stings on my feet, legs, and neck (the neck one was from a bee that found its way INSIDE my veil; she landed right under my eye, prepared to sting, and I brushed her off, at which point she shrieked BABYKILLER! and sank her stinger into my neck instead), and the stings are really swollen and painful, and I just woke up to take more Benadryl and put some aloe on the stings (we do not own meat tenderizer; I may buy a small jar for such occasions).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think next time I'm going to have to use smoke, which I haven't needed to do since last summer, and wear much thicker clothes (the pants I wore today were apparently not thick enough to be of any help).

It took my finally sticking to a strict liquid diet for three days, and copious Miralax, but I finally had a completely pain-free day (at least GI-wise, the beestings were still hurting like hell) for the first time yesterday and quite frankly if this meal pushes my belly back over the brink it will have been worth it (I am the type of person who would rather suffer for a gourmet meal than be kicking myself for eating a box of macaroni or somesuch).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The beestings are much improved today; I was able to get a shoe on my foot and go outside and do some gardening, and the pain is gone. The itching is NOT, but I can deal with that better than itching that morphs into burning and throbbing plus grotesque swelling. The bees are still annoyed with me I think; usually I can squat next to the hive out of their flight-path and watch them for as long as I want to without them paying me any mind, but today one worker seemed to remember and not care for the look of me, and buzzed around my face until I decided to retreat.

She agreed that my back is Fucked Up and wants me to have an MRI, and meanwhile has given me steroids and Vicodin and three days off work (!!! damn it all). So I'm home for a bit, and the inactivity is killing me softly.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All in all, while this is extremely unpleasant, at this point my symptoms are well-treated and I'm feeling pretty thankful for the two extra shifts I'd picked up before my back shit the bed entirely, which ought to keep me from having a terribly grim next paycheck, and for good insurance.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Last night the steroids and I made an extremely delicious fall meal of\u00a0peeled and cubed apples, sweet potato, carrots, turnips, and golden beets, chopped about 1/4 head of cabbage to similiar-sized cubes, tossed it all in Arbequina olive oil, smoked salt, and fresh-ground pepper, then baked it spread out on a pizza pan while I cooked cubed-up pasture-raised bacon on the stovetop and rendered the excess grease. Strained and put up 8 oz of grease, then browned some onions in the pan and dumped the crispy bacon bits, brown onions, and remaining grease in with the veggies, added a dash of apple cider vinegar, a pinch of brown sugar, and some Shebangarang, and baked it all together until the outer layer carmelized.

In my defense (and apparently I need one because I did get a very kind, concerned scolding from the nurse practitioner who saw me) it had gotten almost completely better, then last week got dramatically worse again (but was overshadowed by my back). Actually, I kind of blame my back, in a way, because a) I went on steroids for that, which suppress the immune system, which in retrospect is right about when the coughing and wheezing went from \"irritating\" to \"oh shit if I don't address this I'm going to need the ER\" and b) I missed two days of work due to my back, and felt pressed to get back to work on my return date, which was actually the first day I probably SHOULD have called in sick.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0TL; DR: yesterday I ended up at Urgent Care for severe bronchitis and a nasty asthma exascerbation. BOO! I walked out of there with FIVE PRESCRIPTIONS, which made me feel like a loser, and cost a lot of money, and was over the \"three-rx threshold\" I hold myself to for \"self-pity chips*\" (score?). I don't even want to THINK about what this bullshit is going to do to my next paycheck, which will already be somewhat depleted by last week's lower-back shenanigans. The NP said she'd be willing to write me out of work for up to five days given how bad my lungs sounded and my total lack of a voice, but I told her I couldn't afford to miss that much time and have tomorrow off anyway, so one day would probably have to suffice.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As usual, once I actually WENT to the doctor I was glad I did. The monster dose of prednisone they put me on improved my breathing a LOT with a gratifying quickness, and I definitely think the antibiotics are warranted. Plus the monster \"breathing-is-important\" dose of steroids made my back and Paul feel FANTASTIC! If I could breathe well enough I'd be capering around like a total dumbass! And you know what this means? It means that PREDNISONE MOMMY will be cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

My theory is actually that whatever badness has recently ruined my lower left quadrant is THE BEGINNING OF THE END in the form of my body rejecting the positivity and rampant civility. To wit:\r\n* \u00a0 I did something easy and straightforward a few days ago, something that is absolutely part of my job and kind of why I get paid to do it, and came in the next morning to a hand-drawn thank-you card taped to my cubicle.\r\n* \u00a0 The artist behind said card has been extra-super-nice in training me, as has one key other person, and yesterday? Geez, y'all, it's like I don't even know who I am anymore. I can barely even say it: yesterday I took them both jars of homemade preserves and made hand-drawn labels featuring both rhyming AND an office-related pun. I texted a photo of the adorable little jars to Token Guy Friend, with the caption \"I don't see a bright light, so I guess hell is The South, cicadas, and a series of wardrobe malfunctions? Can't say I'm surprised.\"\r\n* \u00a0 I finally bit the bullet and hit Goodwill, after a particularly shameful incident involving grabbing the wrong pants, thinking I was bloated and wearing 12s, and finding out that in instead I had lost enough weight to close a pair of 8s and was the public face of cameltoe all day Tuesday. I should probably make the whole office an \"I'm sorry\" card about that...what rhymes with vulva? Anyway, so yeah I voluntarily went clothes-shopping yesterday and am somehow now the owner of someone's rich mom's wardrobe. Because I was mostly looking for a) businesswear, b) forgiving waistbands/shirts that can hide an early pregnancy or impending internal rupture, and c) nothing that would violate a) or show The Jew Tattoo (there is not an official tattoo policy at my new workplace, and in fact the lady in charge has a very girly, artsy tattoo that is visible most days, but as a temp who is hoping to end up sticking around I have decided to keep my not-so-girly, often-mistaken-for-offensive upper-arm ink under wraps, especially given that the average age in the office is AARP material). So yeah, HELLO LADY REPUBLICAN! The great thing about Goodwill is that when you live in an affluent area, you can spend less than seventy bucks and end up with five pairs of pants and seven shirts that are all Ann Taylor Loft, Polo by Ralph Lauren, Land's End, and the like. Plus a few pairs of shorts and a belt for various children and two Very Pretty Tops that totally show the Jew Tattoo in case you ever actually go anywhere other than work. So yeah...I am stylishly dressed in clothes that fit: third horse of the Apocalypse, pooping on the lawn.\r\n* \u00a0 Yesterday there was a celebratory free lunch at the office, and my incredibly nice co-workers went out of their way to make sure there were GF options for me. They were super-proud of themselves, and the food smelled delicious, so I strayed from the liquid diet I've been keeping to and OH MY GOD, YEP, DYING.

Because apparently part of me was looking forward to doing battle? Instead I had to content myself with going OFF on the XY via text message (he did deserve it, at least, but usually I refrain...still, I needed to feed SOMEone to my lions and thought the ex-husband was a better candidate than the current one).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So...yeah. Imma sit down and shut up until I've, uh, processed my current feelings (and stepped down on the steroids).\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 If any of y'all want to hate on me for this, keep in mind that a) possums kill chickens and bunnies and b) you're not going to change my mind. I fucking hate possums whether I'm on steroids or not. It's true. There is just NO EXCUSE FOR THEM. Did you know they have more teeth than any other land animal? THEY EVEN HAVE TEETH UNDER THEIR TONGUES. And this is not your cue to bombard me with photos of their babies, either, because THEY STILL HAVE THAT FUCKING TAIL AND THAT ASININE POINTY FACE and THEY GROW UP TO BE BIG POSSUMS. If you have pet-possum stories to share, then you are a sick person. Possums are not pet material. A possum tried to eat my pregnant dog when I was eleven and I had to bludgeon it to death with the stock of a jammed BB gun to get it to turn loose. NOT OKAY! The dog ended up being fine, and so did the possum, apparently, as when I went back outside to dispose of the body there was none. FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT POSSUMS ARE FUCKING EVIL.

I had finally, after a long and bumpy road and several years of therapy a while back, come to a place of being able to forgive The Narcissist's family for not saving me from her as a little kid, but I didn't even realize how many feelings I was still carrying around on the matter, and I certainly never expected to receive an apology from any of them.

The lowest price I have found for Pristiq is at Costco's pharmacy, which you don't need a membership to use. $178.92 is still a lot of money. If I thought generic Effexor would work as well, I'd switch in a New York minute, but I tried damn-near every drug on the market before settling on Pristiq and none of them worked even ALMOST as well for my depression, anxiety, and OCD tendencies. I am kind of attached to the ability to get out of bed, leave the house without fear, and turn pages in a book without turning them back and re-reading the last word three times (yeah, I know, it's dumb, but if I'm not medicated I HAVE TO). If I get the job I'm interviewing for tomorrow, I really want to put my best foot forward, and if I don't my mental state is already going to be in the crapper. The question is, is it worth possibly having my phone and/or electricity shut off to stay on Pristiq?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If I get the job, I'll just go ahead and get the Pristiq, whether that means getting short-term insurance coverage that will help with the cost or just paying out of pocket. I'm not going to get a job this good and then lose it because I can't stop crying or touching things the right number of times. That would just be dumb. If I don't get the job, that is where the decision gets harder, because it would mean there's no steady paycheck coming in on the horizon (I love Temp Agency #2, but it doesn't pay THAT well). However, it would also mean that things here are about to get super-ugly, and I don't want to do anything to compromise my mental health any further than it would be by things like talking about handing the kids over to my ex indefinitely, getting evicted, etc.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What do y'all think?

My current next-best idea is to beg and plead with my doctor's office to call in Effexor without seeing me first (Pristiq is a derivative of Effexor, which is available generically, and I'm hoping my doctor will take pity on me and be willing to make the change over the phone). I'm going to wait until after my second interview Monday, because I want to be my most fabulous self for that and also if I DO get the job I'll probably use the middle-of-the-month child support to get short-term individual coverage (which is less expensive than regular individual coverage) and my first paycheck to catch up the middle-of-the-month bills, and in that case I'd just be able to fill the Pristiq (if I could scrape together the co-payment, but I'm not going to borrow trouble by worrying about that just yet). Hotter looked nervous when I mentioned the possibility of a medication change and asked if Effexor would work as well. I said no, probably not, but it would hopefully at the very least keep me from having a withdrawal seizure, which if I don't get this job is kind of the best-case scenario: not having a seizure on the way to the homeless shelter.

They're going to run a criminal background check and talk to my references, and make a decision hopefully by the end of this week. A friend has shared that in her experience this usually means the job is yours unless you are a felon, and since I am not a felon I am cautiously optimistic.\r\n* \u00a0 I have not made a final decision re: Pristiq vs. Effexor yet. My online research has revealed that Pristiq has the same active ingredient as Effexor, but Effexor contains some other additional \"stuff\" (possibly inert ingredients?) that seems to heighten the incidence of side effects. Hotter spoke to his mother yesterday and apparently asked her to help us out with this, which I have...let's go with \"mixed feelings\"...about since I don't know that she can afford to do that. Either way I really don't want to pay as much out of pocket as Pristiq costs, particularly when we need that money so badly for other bills. I have reached out to Anthem to see what my options are for short-term individual coverage in the meantime; if their website is to be believed that may cost about the same as a one-month supply of Pristiq would out of pocket, in which case obviously acquiring health insurance would be the way to go with this and also take care of most of the cost of the prescription. If not then I'm back to making a tough call. Feel free to weigh on on Pristiq vs. Effexor in the interim if you have any experience with either drug and/or switching between the two.\r\n* \u00a0 Thank you for your kind words, both here and on the facespace/via e-mail, about The Narcissist's passing, and I'm sorry to hear that so many of you also have a narcissist in your family tree.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 As part of my duties for Temp Agency #2, I recently helped a client make restaurant reservations and came across this place's website in the process. The image of the roasted bird (it looks kind of small for a chicken; I'm thinking that if they're serving it this way it's most likely a Cornish game hen) on the front page has been haunting me ever since. WHY ARE THE FEET STILL ATTACHED? I don't see how this sight on their plate would enhance anyone's dining experience, and more importantly THEY SCRATCH IN POO WITH THOSE THINGS. Gahhh!\r\n* \u00a0 I am now within five pounds of my goal weight, which is exciting. I woke up yesterday to find my scale broken (nobody will fess up, naturally) and was seriously bummed as I am looking forward to seeing confirmation of having finally reached my goal, but it still works for weight, just not bodyfat and water percentages. That's fine with me; I don't use the other functions much anyway (I kind of doubt they're very accurate).\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU? I am super-busy working for Temp Agency #2 as much as I am able to in an effort to keep us afloat over here. I hope your Monday is going well.\r\nETA: Oh my gentle Jesus, y'all. If you think that I am a big lying scammer who lies on the innernet and scams people for bad fun and profit, please do us both a favor and do not e-mail me offering to help me in any way. Just...yeah. Please don't do that. I now have someone who I thought was a friend accusing me of of either being the unluckiest person alive or having a \"huge imagination,\" based largely on their assertion that pre-existing condition rules have changed and there is no longer a 60-day rule. I was basing my knowledge of pre-existing condition rules in the health insurance industry on information I got from Anthem the last time I shopped for individual coverage with them during The Great Health Insurance Clusterfuck of '11, referenced here and in numerous other posts from the same time period. Apparently (maybe? I don't know but I have already e-mailed Anthem to ask for some quotes and will definitely ask whoever I speak with when someone gets back to me on that) that rule is no longer in effect. I don't know. I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, so please don't base any health insurance decisions of your own on anything I've said on here or decide based on my ignorance of health insurance laws that I'm full of it. Or go ahead, if that's your thing, hell, I don't even know what to say. Also, please don't base your understanding of how Pristiq works on what I have shared here. I'm aware it's not supposed to even start to wear off within one day. I've said as much. Pristiq (apparently, according to one of the several scathing e-mails I have received over the past twenty-four hours from the same party) is not a treatment for OCD. I have never been diagnosed with OCD, which is why I used the phrase \"OCD tendencies.\" My treating physician has theorized that they may be a way that I manifest anxiety, and Pristiq does treat that, so maybe that is why it works for me? I don't know. Your mileage may vary. This message may self-destruct.\r\nETA (again): Well okay nevermind, I think the person I mentioned above is just afflicted with their very own dose of The Crazy. Because now they're going off on me for things like my non-belief in a higher power, which...I don't even know what to do with that. Oh, and also claiming that the standardized tests in my state have not been graded and there is no such award as the one I mentioned Big Child receiving. Which good grief, I didn't mention the name of the award because I AM PSEUDONYMOUS, FOR FUCK'S SAKE, and yes, actually those tests HAVE been graded (and I sent them a link to an article about the preliminary results). I'm not going to waste any more time that would better be spent working for Temp Agency #2 on this nut-job, and have set gmail to direct any further craziness from them straight to the trash without even showing it to me.

If I know you fairly well online and you reeeeally want some MFA honey, shoot me an e-mail and I'll let you know next time I harvest some (probably in a couple of weeks).\u00a0 \u00a0In the process of bottling the honey I ate...well, let's just go with A LOT. I mean, a REALLY unwise amount of honey. And then I felt gross and had to eat a pickle just to taste something that wasn't so damned sweet. BLEH! As a friend of mine on the Twitter recently noted, Winnie The Pooh really was a GREEDY little bastard!\u00a0 \u00a0I had originally planned to mail the honey out today, but after an incident involving a burnt finger, a partly-melted air-bag (of the sort for cushioning things in the mail), and ALL OF THE SWEAR WORDS, I decided to let the pasteurized jars cool some more before attempting to ship the lot (if you asked for yours raw, you're getting it raw, but not everyone wanted it raw) (if you asked for it pasteurized, please don't feel bad--I was going to pasteurize the honey we're keeping for household use and would probably have managed to burn my stupid finger anyway).\u00a0 \u00a0At any rate, the line of pint-jars full of dark, rich wildflower honey labeled with my friends' names that's sitting on my dining room table waiting to be packaged up makes me smile.\u00a0 \u00a0Let's see...what else. I don't know. OH! I finally finished applying for health insurance yesterday and apparently underwriting takes ten days, so I need to make a final decision on Effexor vs. Pristiq by tomorrow. It turned out that the short-term insurance wasn't such a good deal after all (they don't cover anything considered pre-existing, as in \"something that was wrong with you before you got that insurance, period\" and even if you have that kind of insurance and they cover something, if you re-up it they will not cover it during the second timeframe, which is bullshit), so I applied for the regular long-term super-expensive kind. Mostly because I need to make sure I don't stay uninsured long enough for my pre-existing shit to be an issue (unfortunately for me the crazy profane e-mail sender was wrong about pre-existing conditions no longer being an issue--that's not until January of 2014) (I know, shocking--a crazy person on the innernet was WRONG about something!). But it's 90 days instead of 60 days, so there's that (60 days, it turns out, is how long you can go without ANTHEM coverage without having to re-apply and go back through underwriting, so I guess that's why I had 60 days stuck in my head). I'll probably have to order a three-month fill of all prescriptions through their mail-order pharmacy and then cancel the policy again due to finances, but then I'll have another 90 days to figure something else out.\u00a0 \u00a0Still no word from the place I had the second interview. They said I'd hear something \"hopefully by the end of the week\" so I guess there's still hope. Meanwhile I'm busting my hump for Temp Agency #2, which continues to be a lot of fun. \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401901d91773f970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/in-which-i-have-a-pooh-bear-moment.html", "title": "in which I have a pooh-bear moment"},
{"date": "June 19, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So yesterday I thought I'd just take a quick peek and see if Alpha Hive had finished filling their super with honey. The answer was \"yes, and there are about 20,000 of them directly beneath the inner hive cover executing a celebratory dance.\" Bees came boiling up out of that sucker like WHOA, and I was not wearing my protective gear. I duly remained calm and began backing slowly away from the hive. Unfortunately, a bee fell down into one of my clogs; I felt the wings against my skin and jerked my foot out of the shoe, not wanting to crush her. In the process I kicked two of her sisters-in-arms, and both of them stung me, one on the instep and one BETWEEN MY MOTHERFUCKING TOES.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That is my new LEAST-favorite place to be stung.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I went inside and hit the Benadryl, then suited up to go back out and check on both hives while I was already stung and full of antihistamines. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Bravo Hive looks to be doing well, but I did not see evidence of any larva or new capped brood so I am concerned that they may be queenless. I took a frame of brood from Alpha Hive and gave it to them in hopes of resolving that, and if they still don't have a queen when I check them next I think I'm going to need to buy one (yes, you can mail-order queen bees). I'm of two minds about that, because on one hand I want my bees to have local genes, which is why I bought a NUC from a local beekeeper last year. If Bravo Hive raises their own queen she would have Alpha Hive's genes and mate with a local-to-me drone, which would be the most natural way to ensure I have bees that are adapted to my exact climate. If I order a queen, I could specify what traits I wanted but it would mean bringing in genes from elsewhere.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Alpha Hive...oh, Alpha Hive. They are doing GREAT! Tons of bees, lots of honey and brood, and they filled the first super already. I didn't see the queen, but I wouldn't really expect to see her this time of year when there are so many bees in the hive--they kind of swarm around her and conceal her. I put an empty super on them with the full one on top, and separated them with a Bee Escape in hopes of being able to remove the full super without bringing a bunch of bees with it. I'm kind of writing this post as a form of procrastination, actually, because I'm not looking forward to removing the super...it's really heavy and, of course, likely to be covered in angry bees. FUNTIMES!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All in all, I only got stung five times yesterday (ONLY GOT STUNG FIVE TIMES...lordy how did THAT become good news?!?), with two of the five stings being on my right foot.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What the HELL, bees? Why have half of the stings I've gotten from you this year been on my right foot? My right foot is starting to take this personally.\r\n********************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, I went ahead and took the super off. The Bee Escape proved worthless, so I won't bother with that next time. The good news is, it only cost me two bucks. If I'd paid any more than that I'd be really pissed! Only three of the frames from the super I pulled were completely filled with capped honey (capped honey is sterile and actually a mild antibacterial, but the uncapped stuff can carry all sorts of germs so if it's not capped it's not a good idea to eat it), so I replaced those with empty frames and stuck the original super back on Alpha for the bees to finish filling and sealing. Here are the three full frames waiting to be processed:\r\n\r\nFigure One: Three full frames of gorgeous capped honey! In my experience this will translate to about ten eight-oz jars of the stuff after I scrape and strain it.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, Hotter got stung for the first time during yesterday's hive incursions, and to my amusement was all \"WOE AND ALAS, I THINK THIS HURTS WAY MORE THAN IT SHOULD, MAYBE I AM ALLERGIC, WHAT SHOULD WE DOOOOO I THINK THOSE BEES ARE AFRICANIZED!\" I looked at his sting and it was much less swollen than any of mine so I told him I thought he was okay. He was skeptical, but has yet to keel over dead, so I think I'm right. He still insists that something is wrong and bee stings are WAY more painful for him than the average person. Personally I think they're just really painful, period. Here is how they progress when I get one:\r\nFigure One: This was taken within five minutes of the sting. The swollen spot is about the size of a dime, and you can see which direction I scraped the stinger out in by the little trail of swelling.\r\n\r\nFigure Two: This is about an hour after the first photo.\r\n\r\nFigure Three: This is about two hours after that. As you can see it's starting to swell at this point, and this is where it starts to really itch, too.\r\n\r\nFigure Four: This was taken about four hours after the last photo. The itching woke me up so I took a picture and some more Benadryl.\r\n\r\nFigure Five: This is after about twenty-four hours, when the swelling tends to reach its peak. It'll stay like this for another day or so then start gradually going back down. The pain will be gone after about three days, but the itching will be with me for at least a week.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, bees are kind of a mixed bag. Pollination and honey? GOOD. Stings? BAD.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I spared you the photos of my right foot, because I have my father's feet. What that means is that a) they are slightly deformed and b) I have the feet of an eighty-nine-year-old Jewish man.

When I started blogging as MFA Mama almost eight years ago, I had no idea what I was doing (although Typepad's support team helped me figure it out), and even less of an idea how much blogging would change my life for the better. Through this humble blog (and a couple of other short-lived ones, also through Typepad, before I said \"screw it\" and came back to blogging under my original pseudonym) I have met some of my best friends, connected with folks with similar issues and interests, had my bacon saved on several occasions through the incredible generosity of my readers, and found my own \"chosen family.\" And while it's also had its occasional downsides (such as Stalky, having my ex-husband pay a total of three lawyers to reach my archives in their entirety at various points, and the occasional random nut-job), the positives have far outweighed the negatives, and I can't imagine a life without this blog (and Typepad!).\u00a0 \u00a0Why do I heart Typepad so hard? Well, I think this post pretty much says it all. Not only are they a great service, but they're run by NICE PEOPLE who really go the extra mile to take care of their bloggers. The combination of great features, tireless support, and amazing customer service makes them one of my very favorite companies to deal with, and I hope we'll be together for a very long time.

{"date": "November 30, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So remember how there was a big innernet fuss over the summer about how a waitress comped someone's meal and wrote a nice note in support of a breastfeeding mother? Well, today a family of five came into the restaurant where I work. The kids were (I am guessing, except in the case of the baby, who I asked the dad about while mom was taking the older children to wash their hands) five years, three years, and just a few weeks of age, and incredibly cute and well-behaved. Dad was very hands-on, and especially tender with the baby. Mom looked tired and like she wasn't having the best day ever, and had just turned to her plate (after cutting up the older two children's food and getting them settled) when the littlest began to fuss and root around in Dad's arms. He apologetically passed the baby over for mom to nurse, and I thought \"meh, maybe I can brighten her day a little.\" So I went and got a free breakfast voucher and wrote a note on a piece of register tape that said \"Kids under five eat free here, and since you're doing all the work of feeding the littlest, this is for you. Good job getting baby off to a healthy start in life,\" and drew a little smiley face, and quietly set it on the table the next time I went over to clear some dishes.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Reader, she read the note and then looked at me like I'd just kicked the family dog. I spent the rest of my shift worrying that someone from management would pull me aside and tell me I was in trouble (for...I don't know what, exactly, but people are weird and maybe she was embarrassed because I had noticed she was nursing the baby? She looked and sounded to be from the same demographic group as I am so I don't think it's anything cultural), and won't breathe easy until a few days have gone by without my hearing anything negative about what I thought was me doing something nice for a guest.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fail.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://thestir.cafemom.com/baby/158373/waitress_writes_mustsee_note_to"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/11/fail.html", "title": "fail"},

Because when you're in excruciating pain and on the verge of passing out, spelling the name of your connective tissue disease for the third time after coaching someone who really doesn't want to be responsible for the information through the problem of not having a field on their screen in which to type such things (to which I say, in general, why the hell not because things like blood type and collagen defects may not be relevant to the PHONE CALL but can be crucial once you've reached the HOSPITAL, and in specific, GET A PENCIL AND A PIECE OF PAPER, PLEASE) just seems extra cruel.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm considering getting it all tattooed on the front of my torso.

Said mutual friend brought Dr. Anonymous into the thread as an appeal to authority, and Dr. Anonymous instead said something along the lines of \"oh holy shit I didn't even KNOW about Hotter and I am SO SORRY all of this is happening right now,\" and I replied with \"oder gor oder gornit.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The tattoo on my right arm is less specific than the one I'm considering with all of the medical information, but it's a lot more succinct.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0For those who have been asking, the most likely cause of my physical misery seems to be adhesions from previous surgeries, which isn't something emergent enough to fix on an uninsured patient so the hospital sent me home with strong narcotics and instructions to take them with Miralax, and I am no longer in acute agony but am still distinctly unwell.

When I left work yesterday I was feeling really lowly worm, emotionally and physically both, and all I could think about was how badly I wanted to go home to him, and feel his soft hands on my aching back, and spoon up next to him (Hotter can nap will, at any time and in any position, and most of the time I hate him for it a little bit but when I'm sick and need a big spoon it's great), and know that someone cared how I was feeling. This evening he made a very tasty, non-healthfood pasta with cream sauce, and it was perfect comfort food.

{"date": "May 13, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0The new job is good. It's really nice people working for a nonprofit dedicated to a GREAT cause, and they're busy enough currently to need an administrative temp. I don't think it has long-term potential, which is too bad, but it should last at least a couple of weeks, and that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick (which is a saying down here in The South, although I've actually been the recipient of such a poke and can say that just about anything up to and including a compound fracture is preferable, so I guess it's not really saying much--THE JOB IS NICE, THE END).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Typepad? Is GREAT. Those of you who follow me on the Twitter may already be aware, but yesterday I logged into WellsfuckingFargo's website to see if everything had cleared (yes, I still want to dump them--THEY SUCK and have HORRIBLE customer service, and they LIE right on their ATM machines where it says that cash deposits are credited instantly) and was horrified to see a $119 pending chunk out of my meagre balance. Of course I clicked to see what had unexpectedly eaten up 90% of my net worth, and it was my yearly Typepad subscription fee. Did I agree to that? Yes. Last year, however, they deducted it on May 20th, and so I had set a reminder for May 18th. This year apparently they deducted it a little earlier, which probably has something to do with leap years and business days and I DON'T KNOW, I'm sure it makes sense to SOMEone, but that someone is not writing this post.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I logged into Typepad and clicked around the back end of my account, thinking that maybe if I downgraded to month-to-month billing (the yearly rate is a better deal, although obviously not so much if it causes the next thing to hit your account to generate an overdraft fee) that would fix things. Obviously I was not the first person to panic and have that idea, however, because next to the option to do that was a disclaimer stating that doing so would not cause a refund to be issued, but rather a credit on the account that they would then deduct your monthly fee from until it ran out. CRAP! So I fired off a desperate support ticket explaining that I knew I'd agreed to this being automatically deducted, but thought I had another eight days, was unemployed, etc. and asking if there was ANY way to get the yearly fee refunded and go month-to-month until I was more financially secure again. Since I'd been live-tweeting my freakout, I let my followers know that I'd placed it in Typepad's hands and was just going to hope their customer service folks were as understaning as Amazon.com's are (yeah, Hotter signed up for a free trial of Amazon Prime and forgot to cancel it, and a very nice Amazon.com employee unknowingly SAVED HIS LIFE on Friday by refunding THAT). Best case scenario, I thought I'd maybe get a refund of $119 minus the cost of one month's Typepad Pro service, but realistically I was expecting an admonition to re-read the Terms of Service. I went to bed last night worried as hell, but resigned to waking up to bad news. Instead, while I slept, Typepad was ON IT!Figure One: Look how friendly!\u00a0 \u00a0 I checked my e-mail on my first fifteen-minute break at work, and found an INCREDIBLY nice note from Melanie, a Typepad Community Manager. She explained the date discrepancy in a way that made sense, and that yes, the TOS gave them permission to deduct the money when they did, but went on to say that she understood that life happens, and in light of my longstanding relationship with Typepad they wanted to try and help take the pressure off, so she refunded THE ENTIRE AMOUNT and APPLIED AN EQUAL CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT. I thanked them profusely, and they were very gracious:\r\n\r\nFigure Two: So. Very. Nice.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0You guys. I may have teared up a little in my cube. Of course what Typepad did helped me avoid (another) financial headache, and obviously I'm thrilled with the credit, especially since it's hard to justify paying that kind of money for something that is just for me and can't be eaten or worn to work, given our circumstances. But this was just...well. If you've never been really, really broke, you might not get how huge this was. You get used to hearing \"no.\" To EVERYTHING. Things like sobbing on the phone to your bank, and never picking up a number you don't recognize become part of your daily existence. You come to expect smug annoyance from everyone you do business with, if not outright hostility. It's a relief to even be able to deal with a company via e-mail just so you don't have to hear it out loud, because you already hear it out of your own mouth on a daily basis. No, I can't pay for your eye surgery so you can see better. No, you can't go on that field trip, it costs too much. No, no, NO!\u00a0The negativity can become overwhelming and start to color your entire outlook. When Typepad not only DIDN'T say no, but went the extra mile and did something nice that I hadn't even asked for, it meant a lot more to me than avoiding an overdraft fee or three and getting to blog for a year for free; it reminded me that there's more to say and hear than no, a lot more to life than relentless negativity. It lifted my entire mood, and helped me put my best foot forward today at the new job.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Am I going to stop bitching so much about my life? Probably not. It's not easy, and I'm only human. But I will never do it via any other blogging platform :)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340191021c1ecc970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340191021c4f5d970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/05/the-job-is-good-and-typepad-is-great.html", "title": "the job is good and Typepad is GREAT"},
{"date": "June 10, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Nothing like dragging your sick arse to the office on a Monday and finding out you're fired! I took a call from a Temp Agency #1 rep from the Front Desk of the jobsite and was told my assignment had ended and to leave the building immediately. I had kind of figured something was up, since another temp from Temp Agency #1 had shown up as well, but none of the ladies I was working with seemed to know that I was leaving and they were very upset. I played it off as \"well, this happens!\" but my former coworkers were angry on my behalf and said it shouldn't happen like THIS (and they're right). \u00a0I even got a hug on the way out...Temp Agency #1's rep was kind of strange on the phone when I called them back after leaving; I asked if this was because I'd been out last week and she said yes, that there were \"concerns\" and the client had requested a replacement.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is going to bug me. I just...if it's because my kid broke his collarbone and I was sick then that is beyond my control and I wouldn't have done anything differently because I couldn't have, but I feel like there's something they weren't telling me and if it's something I could change in the future then I think I ought to know. My imagination is running wild--is it because someone saw the bruises down my arms from failed IV placements in the ER a couple of weeks ago (those are STILL visible) and thought I was a junkie? I could maybe see someone noticing those and the drastic weight loss and drawing the wrong conclusions, but they could have asked me to take a drug test if that's what it was and I would have gladly complied. Maybe that's expecting too much from the client and/or the temp agency? I mean, the client wants a temp so that they don't HAVE to deal with HR stuff and the temp agency's job is to keep the client happy...Maybe the Temp Agency #1 rep just had a case of the Mondays and I'm reading too much into her tone, but I don't think I got the whole story and I don't want whatever this is to damage my relationship with Temp Agency #1. And okay FINE, part of me wonders whether Stalky is still reading avidly, figured out which Temp Agency I work for, and DID something, because when things go wrong in my life for reasons that are not readily apparent my mind tends to go down that road. It's doubtful, but who knows.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This sucks. I don't really have the luxury of dwelling on it anywhere but on my blog, however (OMG WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE BLOG? TEMP AGENCY #1, ARE YOU READING THIS? DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT YOUR STANCE ON THE BLOG?), and after I got home, took off my nice twinset and khakis, put my loser-pants (jammies) back on, and made a quick phone call for Temp Agency #2, I called and booked an interview at a place that called me back while I was working the temp job at Mixed Messages, Inc. (as they will now be known) for Wednesday morning. So there's that. ONWARD!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/well-that-sucked.html", "title": "well THAT sucked"},
{"date": "June  9, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I am still sick, and so is Hotter. This virus (I am fairly certain it IS a virus at least) does not fuck around! I still have no voice to speak of and my back is killing me...originally I thought I threw it out coughing (and it DOES hurt like hell to cough) but Hotter says his aches really badly too, so maybe this is an achy-virus? I'm hoping that with the boys being with my ex for the weekend they will have missed out on the incubation period, since Big Child doesn't need to be coughing with a broken collarbone!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On top of the sick we are the broke. It's not panic-level broke, in that Hotter has his prescriptions and I have gas in the car to get to and from work until payday, but it is \"less than ten bucks in the bank, when we run out of milk we're just going to be out for a bit\"-level broke, which is no fun. We have enough pantry to eat. It'll pass (although my next payday will be very sad with my having missed three days of work due to Big Child's injury and my illness and I only have another three weeks to get health insurance before I will have gone 60 days without and invoked the pre-existing conditions clause of doom that would make insurance pointless, so we're going to stay broke for a bit). It still sucks though.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Mentally at least I am not doing too badly. I think PMS Buddy failed me, or else all the weight loss and/or sickness has thrown my hormones off, because that whatever-it-was ten days ago was NOT normal and it did pass after a couple of days. I did gain a bunch of weight when it happened, which would support the hormone theory, but could also point toward it having been gluten-related.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What else? The bees are doing well, and I am pretty confident in saying that splitting the hive hasn't harmed Alpha Hive one bit. I think they were getting ready to swarm if I hadn't intervened, and I would hate to lose my marked and over-wintered 2012 queen. Bravo Hive is doing well too, with plenty of activity. I haven't really felt up to making any hive incursions this weekend, so I'm letting them be for now. The hens are laying well, although someone (I think \"Blacktop\") has taken to laying wee mini eggs. This can be age-related, and my girls are in their third year of laying for us, so they're probably perimenopausal. As long as we're getting at least two eggs a day from four birds I'm okay with letting them coast a bit. Any less than that and they'd not be earning their feed (the chickens forage some and eat our leftovers, so feed for them isn't much of an expense). The rabbits, SPEAKING OF NOT EARNING THEIR FEED, are being pains in the arse. Iden is tied up with the \"twins,\" and Pfeffer proved not to be pregnant last month after all and duly spent a day with Haas last week. Since she hasn't had kit-bearing to keep her busy she has focused her efforts on digging all of her bedding into a heap and getting so fat that her brisket laps over her tucked forepaws in the \"loaf\" position. Haas is full of beans; Hotter calls Haas his \"dog\" and pets him and carries on, and I have a feeling that if the old boy ever starts shooting blanks I'll have a hell of a time convincing Hotter he's not still earning his keep around here.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And finally, Isis remains utterly worthless except as comic relief. In that area, however, she excels. Here is a picture from this morning:\r\n\r\nFigure One: From foreground to background, here we have 1) MFA Mama, as portrayed by her right boob, 2) a thoroughly worthless dog, 3) said thoroughly worthless dog's outstretched legs,4) my husband, clinging to the edge of the bed, with the claw-ends of said thoroughly worthless dog's outstretched legs over his heart. I may have forgiven him, but Isis seems to be holding a grudge--she definitely senses when things aren't right with us and abuses Hotter accordingly, and I find it kind of hilarious.\r\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340192aaee3813970d-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/blahhhh.html", "title": "blahhhh"},

{"date": "June 10, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDear family of The Narcissist:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This certainly is awkward. I don't guess I get to be upset that you're reading, given that anyone with an innernet connection can read what I write here, AND YET.\u00a0 \u00a0Here is the deal. I think y'all are probably fundamentally decent people in your hearts of hearts, and that you mean well. I like to think that you just didn't KNOW what I lived with as a child, and that's why you never tried to save me from your sister. As an adult I can sort of see why you didn't. You had your own families and problems and lives, and I, due to lack of parenting, was an off-putting child. I forgive you. It's not an \"I want to get together next Thanksgiving\" kind of forgiveness, but rather an \"I don't actively hate your guts and am at peace\" kind of forgiveness. We have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON. That's okay. I like me the way I am, and y'all always seemed pretty content with your way of living, and since there's really no common ground there's no reason for us to have anything to do with each other.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The comment I received earlier this evening made me physically ill. The idea that The Narcissist (as I call your sister, because she does not deserve to be called a mother, much less mine) might also have been reading here made me seriously regret every word I have written on here about my children. They are good, sweet, pure-hearted kids, and the idea of that kind of evil even reading the sanitized-for-the-innernet anecdotes I share about them here is repugnant to me. I have gone to great lengths to protect my boys from everything your sister is, and make sure their childhood is nothing like mine. They've never seen their mother get high, or helped her cover up an extra-marital affair. I've never hit them, or gotten so drunk that I hit ON them and/or encouraged my friends to do so. The first and only time they ever heard the M-Fbomb from an adult was the first and LAST time I let The Narcissist anywhere near them, and they still talk about how scary it was when she suffered a psychotic break and tried to drive us all off a bridge when I was recovering from my hysterectomy.\u00a0 \u00a0I appreciate your thinking I would want to know about your sister's current condition (whatever that may actually be--I would urge you to take anything she tells you with a VERY LARGE grain of salt as manufactured medical emergencies are a favorite attention-getting tactic of hers). You were incorrect, but I can understand why you might think I would want to know. Here is where I ask, though, that if you genuinely do care about me in any capacity, however abstract, you NOT DO THAT. This blog and its' readers are my happy place, the extended family that I don't have \"in real life,\" and its' comments section is not the place to tell me your sister is \"very, VERY sick.\" You said you didn't know how else to reach me, and there is a reason for that. Even if we DID have anything at all in common, and I thought there was any way to salvage a mutually-enjoyable relationship of any kind based on blood or nostalgia, I wouldn't be interested. Because I won't knowingly do anything that would potentially lead to your sister having any insight into my family life, and I'd really prefer that she not be able to pick my boys out of a lineup. I'd cut off a limb to protect those kids. Cutting off an extended biological family of people who don't even like me was an easy choice. So thanks for thinking of me, but mental illness killed my mother thirty years ago, and I've already had all the feelings I'm going to have over it. I wish you well (from a distance). Sincerely, me\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 That title is not entirely accurate, as technically Only Living Relative (as I call him on here) shares my DNA and lives outside my house by a hemisphere or so.

Also I really like my boss and the vast majority of the customers).\r\n* \u00a0Last night we thought Clementine was dead, or rather, Hotter did. He said he prodded her with a finger and she didn't react, and her body moved as if dead. We were devastated, because Little Child was at The XY's, and it would've been like \"welcome home, bubs, and happy birthday. By the way, your lizard is dead.\" And okay fiiine because we like her. Then this morning Hotter approached the tank to bag up the corpse (thinking to let Clem lie in state in the dog meat drawer of the refrigerator until the next of kin was home to plan a funeral), and Clem was up on the basking tree staring at her heat lamp and apparently wondering why there was no heat coming from it. So Clementine lives but Hotter is blind. Oh, Hotter.\r\n* \u00a0 His eyes are getting really terrible. I kept losing him in the grocery store because he couldn't tell which blob was me or which aisle I'd gone down. I really hope the cataract surgery helps.\r\n* \u00a0 It turns out my out-of-pocket on an EpiPen is nearly $200, so I did not fill that YET. We'll see how the new employer-subsidized insurance does with it in November (if anyone around had ever had an anaphylactic reaction to a beesting I'd eat the $200, but seeing as it's just a precaution...no). Yes, November. I signed my offer letter from The Ritz on 6/29 but did not attend orientation until 7/2, and you don't start receiving benefits until the first first of the month after your 90-day anniversary. SIGH. Stupid arsehole calendar.\r\n* \u00a0 I made a pumpkin pie with a GF crust, and the filling was sweetened entirely with honey and thickened with Squatter Workshop eggs. The crust...well. It overbrowned, and according to Hotter is \"gritty.\" He blames the brown rice flour (I used a cup each of brown rice flour and coconut flour, both chilled, with a teaspoon of pink Himalayan salt, then cut three tablespoons butter and 2/3 cup of coconut oil into the mix, then wet it with four ounces of heavy whipping cream. I could tell it wouldn't have rolled worth a shit, so I pressed it into shape in a large Pyrex pie-pan by hand). I pointed out to Hotter that he didn't have any trouble choking the pie down a la mode, and was like \"well, PIE.\" All ribbing aside, there's a reason I started the test-baking for Thanksgiving in September (you do not fuck, dear reader, with Thanksgiving in this house).\r\n* \u00a0 I'm wavering on when to pull the honey super off Alpha Hive and turn their entrance reducer. Bravo Hive will be wintering in a single \"deep,\" which is less than ideal, but my beekeeping mentor has successfully overwintered bees in NUCs so I figure they can manage it.\r\n* Has anyone else noticed that those \"box of the month\" subscriptions are The Latest Thing? They have them for girly beauty products (which...yeah, no), food (too fraught with gluten), and even dog treats (my dog, however, is grain-free and couldn't enjoy much of what's in those boxes). Friend of the MFAmily Natural Mom Reviews just highlighted a company on her site that does gluten-free boxes! SOLD! Especially since you can get two months free if you sign up through the link on Natural Mom Reviews. Apparently I missed the cutoff for September shipping, so my first box won't ship until mid-October, by which time I will probably have forgotten all about signing up for the thing, so when it gets here I'll be all \"OMG A PRESENT!\" This is made of win.\r\n* \u00a0 So is picking up extra shifts at work that allow me to cross-train in other departments. Which is part of why I'm so tired that I'm not blogging much. Also, I finally succumbed to Big Child and Hotter's cold, and so has Middle Child. Little Child, I can only assume, is next.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.naturalmomreviews.com/2013/09/taste-guru-a-gluten-free-subscription-box-company-.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/09/items.html", "title": "items"},
{"date": "September 17, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Today I took Isis in for a re-check of her ears, to make sure they were yeast-free. Except they weren't. For a few days I would have sworn she'd be just fine, but then the day before yesterday I looked INSIDE one of her ears, and there were still these bright-red, wet-looking spots that looked like they'd burn like a popped blister if you touched them. So I was expecting to hear that we needed to do something else, but wasn't expecting to only be able to get a three o'clock appointment, meaning that Hotter would have to stay home since Big Child's bus gets in a few minutes after three. I wasn't entirely sure my back was up for taking Isis to the vet \"lone wolf,\" as k would say, but knew I needed to get 'er done on an off-day, and today was the last one of those I'll have this week.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then I remembered that we'd gotten some good-dog pills from the vet last time to pre-game for future well-ish visits, and doped up a gob of peanut-butter with those and gave it to Isis. THOSE PILLS ARE AMAZING! By keeping a large prescription bottle of beef liver treats handy, I was able to let Isis off her leash once we were in a room and she behaved beautifully.\r\n\r\nFigure One: At the vet's, being so good that the cute pet nurse with the nose ring was able to peer into her ears without sustaining a concussion or even getting knocked to the ground and love-mauled.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Once the vet got a look inside Isis's ears, it was decided that they would repeat the swab-test to make sure of what was growing in there.\r\n\r\nFigure Two: She came back from having her ears swabbed looking like this. Note the third eyelids creeping out because DRUGS.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It's still yeast in her ears, so we're having to move up to a more potent topical medication that has to be stored in the fridge. Fortunately Isis is super-good about letting me dribble stuff into her ears and rub them (I think it must feel good to her, honestly), because if it was Bumpus this would be the point where I'd be all \"vet says he's gonna die.\" The vet also wants us to try Isis on antihistamines for a week in case allergies are contributing to the issue; if nothing else that ought to help mitigate the itching somewhat for the poor dog.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Rarely am I so grateful for my wonderful job as I am when one of the animals needs something, and today was no exception. It cost me a hundred and fifty unplanned dollars to get our Pit Princess sorted out at the vet today, plus we bought more freeze-dried beef liver and a bag of crickets for Zombie-Clementine. It's nice to be able to afford veterinary care AND treats!\r\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twoadultsonebrownbaby.blogspot.com/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834019aff757c0b970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834019aff7581b4970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/09/high-maintenance.html", "title": "high-maintenance"},
{"date": "June 12, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Having found out more on The Narcissist's condition, I think it's safe to say she won't be reading anything I write on here from this point forward, so I can go ahead and tell y'all that yesterday my Big Child won THREE academic awards (one for being in the top 10% in the district in FOUR different subjects, one where he was one of only two students in his grade to receive the school's \"Thinker\" award, and one for straight As for the entire academic year), and was ALSO recognized for achieving a perfect score on the math portion of our state's standardized tests (so clearly the hospital switched babies on me, but I'm not giving him back).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0He asked if we could go out to dinner to celebrate, and I had to say that no, we couldn't afford it. But Hotter and I talked about it and decided that I would use the P.F. Chang's gift card I'd been saving for his birthday to take Big Child out to dinner instead, just him and me, so that is what I did. Big Child had never been to P.F. Chang's, and it'd been a long time since I took him out anywhere (in fact, the last time we all went out to dinner was his birthday last year I think), and he was SO APPRECIATIVE. We talked about the menu, asked our server to answer questions I couldn't (yes, I left the poor guy a good tip--he was a good sport about it and did a great job), and played the \"would you rather\" game.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Big Child would rather:\r\n* \u00a0 Go deaf than blind* \u00a0 Eat a single live worm than an entire plate of mushrooms* \u00a0 Grow hair on his entire face, including nose and eyelids, than grow boobs* \u00a0 Win the lottery than be able to fly\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0He's asked me why I'd been upset earlier in the day (I thought I'd hidden it pretty well but he pointed out that I don't attack the yard like that unless I'm upset about something), so I told him about the situation with The Narcissist. \"Is it okay if I'm not sad,\" he asked, \"because I really didn't like her when she came to visit. She was mean to us while you were in the hospital and you could just tell she hates taking care of kids.\" I told him feelings aren't right or wrong, they just are what they are, and that I wasn't sad either. \"Because she wasn't a good mom to you. I'm really sorry you had her for a mom. I'm glad you're not like her.\" Oh, y'all, my heart. My number one goal as a parent is to not be like The Narcissist.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the drive home, Big Child asked me if The Narcissist being bipolar mean I might \"get it,\" and whether his father being bipolar meant that he might. I told him that being bipolar is like having ADHD (which Big Child has) in that it may make some things, like being a nice person, or studying, more difficult for someone with the disorder than the average person. \"But we all have a choice. Granny is bipolar AND she's not a nice person. They don't automatically go together. I think some people use things like that as an excuse. But just like you choose to work harder than someone without ADHD so that you can still do great things like win all these awards, someone who is bipolar can choose to still be nice to other people even if it's hard for them. I'm past the age where people usually show signs if they're going to be bipolar, and my doctors tell me I don't have it, but if I did I'd just try harder to still be a good mom anyway. If you end up having it, I already know you'll try harder too, just like with the ADHD, and you have a good heart. I'm your mom, so it's my job to worry about everything to do with you, but I'm not worried that you'll be like Granny or Daddy.\" He seemed satisfied with that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am so proud of Big Child, and I'm glad he thinks I'm such a good mom, but it makes me feel like that much more of a loser for not having the money to take him to the doctor when he needs it. That kid deserves the sun, the moon, and the stars. And doctor visits when he needs them.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I really, really, really need a job.\r\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/06/big-childs-big-achievement.html", "title": "Big Child's big achievement"},

The only thing that's helped was the night before last, when I couldn't take it any more and took a dose of store-brand Excedrin. I don't like to do that, though, as I'm a bleeder and the stuff contains aspirin (but oh man, it works SO WELL). And because many of you are medically-inclined and will ask, yes, I took my blood pressure with Hotter's home monitor. It's a little high for ME at 121/68, but I don't think that's anywhere near high enough to blame for the headache.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I suppose it's within the realm of possibility that this is stress-related. Currently I have less than $5 to my name, the gas tank on the car is empty, the price of generic Mirapex went up to the point that it is no longer feasible to fill that without insurance, and all of this mishegas with The Narcissist probably hasn't helped my mental state any. I really, really, really need to find another job or I don't know how I'm going to keep us going over here. I need to get health insurance by the 28th or everything wrong with me will be considered \"pre-existing\" and not covered. I need to get my youngest a bigger bed (yes, he's still in a toddler bed, and won't be able to stretch out fully in it if he grows another half-inch).

I sniffed this guy:\r\n\r\nFigure One: KITTEH!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I also met, and sniffed, his sister and their mama and their cousin and her sister and some other extended family members, all of whom were VERY friendly and sweet. At one point I was COVERED in cats! And didn't sneeze or sniffle once! Then the little guy took my nose between his two paws and licked it and I whipped out my checkbook so fast I nearly sprained my wrist! He doesn't have a name yet (we're currently fond of either Ramses or Skeeter), but he comes home mid-October.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Other than that, things here are comfortable and good. We're giving the house an enema in preparation for The Kittening (no clutter! No piles! Nothing that could injure a little bald kitty or make him think it's a litterbox!). The deposit for the kitten cleaned out the bank account temporarily so we're coasting on cash tips and pantry-sweepings for a few days, which I now find amusingly nostalgic (given that the cash tips put gas in the tank and we swept a bunch of frozen steaks out of the \"pantry\" for dinner tonight). Little Child has a new bedspread to go with his newish bed that is \"Minecraft-inspired\" (by way of eBay and someone very, very crafty) and I have a new purse made by the same crafter (it looks like an owlface, I love it).

And you know what? PEOPLE HAVE LOTS OF STRONG FEELINGS AND OPINIONS REGARDING CAT-OWNERSHIP, OH MY GOODNESS. I thought Horse People were crazy, but Cat People may have wrested the title of \"most fanatical/judgmental group of animal fanciers\" from their clutches. I have been subjected to more well-meaning drive-bys on the subject of Proper Cat Care And Feeding in the past week than I can shake a catnip mouse at!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So that you may more easily judge and/or approve of me, here is what we plan to do:\r\nIndoor/Outdoor: INDOOR ONLY. Sphynx-kitties can't have the FLV vaccine, so we aren't taking any chances, plus BALD.Wet/Dry Food: Dry only. Seems to be better for Sphynxs' digestion (there is a lot of breed-specific stuff to learn with these buggers, I'm finding). We're going with this stuff, mainly because it has meat ingredients in the first three listed and is grain- and gluten-free. I also like that it lists freeze-dried raw ingredients; ideally I'd feed a cat the BARF diet, but with their higher nutritional needs (to maintain body temperature sans-fur) Sphynxes need to graze all day and so kibbles seem like a more hygienic choice.\r\n\r\nClaws/no claws: No-name will keep his claws. We'll trim them, and possibly try those little slip-on claw covers, but cutting off the ends of toes goes against our household policy of promoting the mental wellbeing of our animals.Neuter/no neuter: We'll have him neutered. This cat has a fancy pedigree, but we just want a general sofa ornament, lap-warmer, and mouser-in-chief, and we do NOT want him to spray the house!\r\n\u00a0\r\nRegarding comments: I still have no clue what is going on, but have submitted a help ticket to Typepad, and they are usually VERY responsive so I'm sure we'll have an answer by tomorrow.

Because for all that work is immensely stressful lately, that is the fault of an individual, not the company, and I still very much like and believe in The Ritz as a company.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That said, here is an actual quote from a meeting I had with my manager yesterday, uttered by me through bewildered tears: \"Until working with The Bastard here I didn't even know anti-Semitism was a THING anymore, I mean, who DOES that?!?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So that's...yeah.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But hey, I can still bitch about OTHER things, like how yesterday I woke up with a sore left knee! It felt like I'd just slept funny or something, and once I got moving at work it didn't bother me. Last night after I laid down I noticed that it was pretty sore when I got up to go to the bathroom, and this morning it hurt pretty badly. Eleven hours of work later? It's twice the size it should be and hurts like a motherfucker. I'm not taking it to a doctor because y'all know my policy on pain without trauma, I already have pain pills available due to my back, and unless it gets so bad that it can't work I am not interested in imaging to tell exactly what's wrong with it because I'm just going to RICE it and hope for the best regardless.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What else. OH! Hotter and I are going on a field trip on Tuesday! We're going to drive over a mountain and through some woods to meet a litter of Sphynx kittens and their mama, FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Hotter continues to mourn the lack of a cat in our life, and I continue to be violently allergic to same, although I'm not sure if it's the dander, the saliva, or the fur that I react to. I think it's the fur, because rabbits and really anything fluffy, even mice, also set me off. At any rate, we're going to go and see some hairless kitties, and I'm going to pet them and sniff them and see what happens. If I don't react, an extremely funny-looking kitten might be in our future (actually I think hairless cats' bat-ears are adorable).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Other than that, not much is going on here except that I tried my hand at waxing again and succesfully did my armpits and lower legs without any bruising, so I feel like a total badass.

They're awesome, they keep track of your steps like a 3DS!\" Middly jumped in and agreed, and Big Child was a little sad because the pedometers are a new thing since he was at elementary school.

Whoops!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It's kind of a sad day here; when Stripper-name and The Bus Stop Boys moved a few months ago they left their cat behind, and it was pretty feral but had been slowly growing less afraid of us since we started leaving food out for it a couple of weeks ago. I'd had it in mind to capture the thing with a humane trap tomorrow and take it to have some vaccines, since it seemed like feline our future kitty was most likely to accidentally come into contact with if he gets out of the house and Sphynxes can't have the FeLV vaccine, but today the littles came home and said the cat was sleeping in the ditch in front of Trashcan Neighbor's house.

{"date": "October 19, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Work: some extremely minor bullshit, and people (as a whole) continue to suck on an \"irritating for ten minutes\" level, but all in all I enjoy it. Lately I've been trying to pick up one shift per week in another department (there are two outside of my own where I've been permitted to moonlight) because we have been hemorrhaging money (car insurance! Kitten! Hotter's eyes! My mouthguard!).\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Animals: I think both female rabbits have recently done that \"get pregnant but re-absorb the fetuses\" thing that some animals can do, which: GROSS. The chickens are still not laying (BOO!). The dog continues to adoptively breastfeed the cat, which continues to amuse the resident bipeds. The bird and the lizard continue to mind their own fucking business (they are my favorites).\r\n* \u00a0 My body is a wonderland: Yeahhhh I have definitely reinjured my back. Hello disc pain, you whore. My knee went out again last week as well, and today I got my clog stuck in the door of a service elevator and tripped in such a way as to twist the be-bunioned part of my foot rather sickeningly. I AM OLD AND IT SUCKS.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Children: All the under-eighteens succeeding at school, devastatingly handsome, and all-around good kids (if all-around good kid means \"prone to occasionally leaving the gate open so that the dog can ingest enough clumping litter to crap a cinderblock foundation\"). The over-eighteen stepkid is getting out of prison sometime in the next few weeks (we think?), and I anticipate him getting shot, ODing, and/or crashing my MIL's car (AGAIN) within a week. HAPPY THANKSGIVING! MERRRRRY CHRISTMAS! Ho, ho, ho.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter: Much less prone to fits of dickheadedness of late than he was for a while there! I think part of this is due to our having the money for creature comforts like good coffee, part of it is due to his looking forward to the impending cataract surgery and improved vision, and part of it is due to my working so much that he's just happy to see me when he gets the chance. Also, that one issue that had been festering for years is fully resolved and he did, in fact, stop beating the dead horse. Phew.\r\n* \u00a0 MFA Mama: Feeling kind of tired and bewildered in general. Sick of being in constant pain. Both grateful for where we \u00a0are right now financially and terrified that something will come along and eff it up. Really bummed my back won't permit me to start a winter garden this year. And damn-near homicidal over the mouthguard--I found a shard of mutilated plastic that looks like it may potentially have at one point been a $500 custom nightguard and ALL of the animals (except the bird and the lizard) are on my shitlist.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/10/the-state-of-various-things.html", "title": "the state of various things"},

{"date": "September 11, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 The Bastard was a monumental bastard today. It was...bad. REALLY bad. I have, again, been asked to trust The Process. I'm not sure I do, but seeing as I don't have a ton of options, I am trusting The Process by default.\r\n* \u00a0 Today I had the opportunity to see, taste, and sell a really amazing daily special. It made for a beautiful plate, was gluten-free (yes, The Ritz prides itself on offering options to hungry gluten-free people, but the chef specifically brought that to my attention also, which was sweet of him), and impressed the heck out of the customers. That's fun, and reminds me why I enjoy working in the industry that I work in (not that I ever blamed the industry for The Bastard, but bastards have a way of coloring all that they touch and it was nice to be reminded that I generally love what I do on a day like today).\r\n* \u00a0 Someone in another department at The Ritz who I work closely with on occasion is of the male persuasion and is also the exact height Little Child's doctors predict that he will be after he finishes growing. Today we had the opportunity to spend some quantity time together working a function that proved quite stressful, and he ended up struggling to perform his job duties because he was under-trained for the position. That position was one that I have worked in other jobs, and I therefore possessed the expertise needed to be of assistance to him, to the point that he said if I ever needed anything to let him know. I said well, as a matter of fact I would very much like to pick your brain about something but it involves asking you some personal questions, and he said go ahead. So I asked him how tall he was, and he told me, and I asked if I could ask him something even more personal and he said sure and volunteered that if I had a midget fetish he'd be Down With That. I said yeah, no, thanks, but if you could go back in time and have growth hormone shots and be taller would you do it? He said no, actually, he would not, because then he wouldn't be who he is today. I asked him if that was the \"making lemonade out of lemons\" answer or the truth, and he said no really, it was true. I then showed him a picture of Little Child on my phone and told him about the ongoing growth hormone debate I have with The XY, and what Little Child said when I asked him about it (namely that he does not want the shots, and if he's going to be super-short then he will be one of the guys who rides racehorses and buy and sell us all), and asked him what he thought about The XY's assertion that we ought to force Little Child to take the shots for his own good. My co-worker said that if there was anything he could change, it would be that he would want his mom to have been more willing to talk to him about issues he had with peers in school, but that his dad had died when he was really young and his mom had taken the standpoint of \"you are perfect as you are, so shush.\" He said that in his opinion it was normal to want to blame something beyond your control for your troubles as an adolescent and really in general, but that looking back he didn't think any problems he'd had in his life were due to his height and he was happy with who he was, height and all. So there's that.\r\n* \u00a0 After work I went and had a physical, and in general my doctor pronounced me to be healthy. WHOO TITS! Except oh, speaking of which, due to The Narcissist having had breast cancer (allegedly? She always CLAIMED to have had breast cancer but then there were tumors in her lungs and brain and blah blah whatever--I told my doctor what I knew of the situation, warned her that my knowledge of it was via third party and sketchy at best given The Narcissist's mental illness, and asked her to give me her best guess as to what that meant in terms of my own medical history and care) I get to have a mammogram. I was kind of expecting that, though, and there was nothing about the breast exam my doctor did that alarmed her, so it's just a precaution. Also Paul was pronounced to be an official bunion, but that is also old news since Dr. Google called it weeks ago. As for my back, my doctor agreed with the diagnosis from Urgent Care; I asked her for her advice on what to do for pain management given that I am not supposed to take NSAIDs and am almost out of the pain pills I got at Urgent Care but not quite at the point of no longer needing something for pain in order to be able to sleep at night. She gave me my choice between an extended course of steroids and a synthetic opioid with the option of reverting to the extended course of steroids if I run out of the synthetic opioid and am still in pain, and I said I'd prefer to go with the synthetic opioid since steroids suppress the immune system and I pick up snotty napkins for a living. She was fine with that. Also, since a number of people have opined that reactions to beestings are cumulative and can worsen to the point of anaphylaxis AT ANY TIME I showed her the pictures I took of the reaction I get to beestings and asked her whether I ought to be concerned and/or have an Epi-Pen handy. She said that it certainly looked painful, but that there was no point in sending me to an allergist because an actual beesting was the best test of how allergic you are to such things, and if I hadn't had anaphylaxis from a beesting yet I wasn't at any greater risk than anyone else. BUT, she said, such things are pretty unpredictable and the process is not fully understood, and you could get stung one day and be fine and get stung the next and drop dead, and with that in mind she actually did think it was a good idea for me to have an Epi-Pen on-hand in case I or anyone else gets stung and has a bad reaction given that I have beehives in my backyard. I think that is an overly-cautious, ass-covering answer, but will see what my insurance company will chip in as far as covering the cost of an Epi-Pen and if it's affordable I'll go ahead and fill the prescription, because better safe than sorry.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/09/my-day-in-bullets.html", "title": "my day in bullets"},
{"date": "May  6, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0When I first started temping, I was involved with more than one agency. More recently, it's been down to just one, which I have referred to since Winter 2011 as \"Temp Agency #1.\" I heart them. They're positive, upbeat, and they don't care about my stupid blog. I still work for them. I did a job for them on Saturday. LOVE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But now...well. I'm kind of cheating on them. With a new job that, to keep it simple, we'll just start calling Temp Agency #2. An innernet friend and reader turned friend of the MFAmily referred me to Temp Agency #2 about a month ago, and I signed up but didn't actually take on any jobs, because at the time I was busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest with my full-time job. But...we all know how THAT ended up going. Temp Agency #2 is a 24-hour operation wherein employees work from home. It pretty much monetizes that thing I do when I'm panicking about money and aimlessly search the innernet at all hours. And so late Saturday night I started accepting jobs from Temp Agency #2, and I can't say enough good things about them, y'all. They're FUNNY. An employer with a sense of HUMOR? BRB, just gotta decide where on my body to tattoo the logo.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All day Sunday I worked little jobs from Temp Agency #2 in between filling out job applications (I hate to quote Dr. Phil, but I am of the belief that if you do not have a job, your full-time job UNTIL you have a job is to FIND a job, and since I am accustomed to working weekends I have been plugging away steadily), and I am hooked. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Temp Agency #2's user interface is so slick and easy to use!

I got some disheartening news yesterday from Unemployment; my erstwhile employer seems to have a strong desire to go scorched-earth with this enire situation, which...well. While I can't say it was unexpected, it WAS unwelcome. And depressing. In a \"if I can't find a job in the next couple of weeks things are going to get REALLY ugly around here\" kind of way. I mean, there's a phone hearing scheduled where everybody gets to say their piece, and people are urging me to try to claim \"whistleblower protection\" (umyeah, I noticed several federal labor law violations and brought them up to management through the \"open-door policy\" right before they suddenly, after two merit-based increases in a row and a glowing review less than a month ago, decided I sucked at life in general and my job in particular) (and that's not EVEN the part I can't tell you due to pending investigations) and there's a CHANCE I could still prevail, but I'm really hoping to find another job before the hearing date.

I still need Synthroid. I've been back on it now for about a week and am kind of coming to and going \"gee I'm fat and depressed and have a shitty memory.\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Oops.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not the only one who's recently learned a lesson, though! My lovely friend k sends me hilarious cards from time to time, because she's amazing like that. They always make me cackle, and I look forward to her adorable yearly holiday photo of her ridiculously gorgeous children, and I don't know how I got so lucky as to have such a giving friend (really--I always feel so cared-about when I get mail from her!). Her Halloween card this year, however, was A DOOZY! It featured a scantily-dressed woman being called a tramp by an anthropomorphic hoe, and calling the hoe, well, a HOE in return. Since there was no \"warning! Teachable moment enclosed!\" note on the outside of the envelope I opened it in front of Big Child, who glanced at the outside of the card and snickered, then blushed and asked me what \"that other word\" meant. Thinking he meant \"hoe,\" I explained the colloquial shortening of the word \"whore,\" i.e. prostitute, i.e. someone-who-has-sex-in-exchange-for-money. \"Whoa. I knew 'hoe' was a not-very-nice name to call a woman or girl, but I didn't know it meant THAT! What's a trame-p,\" he clarified. Oh. \"A tramp is like a hoe except instead of charging money she just gives the sex away, either because she enjoys it or because she suffers from low self-esteem and/or mental health problems.\" Big Child thought about that for a moment. \"So it doesn't matter if she charges for it or just gives it away, either way other women are going to judge her for having sex?\" YES, child, YES! A couple of moments later the penny dropped for real and Big Child was all \"So sex makes babies, but everybody judges women for it, and it's pretty much like we blame women for creating life??? That's kind of...messed up.\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then I died.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So now the resolution: I am going to get back in shape, and my back and knee can be damned. If I keep getting fatter and sicker it's not going to matter that I went easy on my stupid back and my stupid knee. I will do this HOPEFULLY before I have to go out and buy some size-10 workpants, and my upcoming thirty-fifth year will be known as The Year I Got Super-Fit.

I told them they should try Daddy first and not bother you unless they had to, but he didn't send back his copy of the office papers,\" he stammered. \"It's okay,\" I told him, \"this is the kind of thing they need to bother me for.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I had already spoken to my ex on the way to the school, asking him to text me his insurance information so I could go straight to Big Child instead of stopping at home first. Obviously, he refused, because priorities, although once I texted him that I'd managed to get Big Child checked out anyway and his collarbone was broken, the XY was all about jumping my case and second-guessing my handling of the situation. Had I made the right call in taking him to the ortho clinic rather than the ER? I told him it hadn't been my call but the pediatrician's. Were they sure he didn't have a concussion? As sure as they could be, which was not very, and I had a list of signs and symptoms to look out for but thought he'd be fine. How did he have a possible concussion when the school said he hadn't hit his head? I said the \"mechanism of injury\" made the ortho concerned, plus I was pretty sure Big Child had hit his head based on some bruising around his eye.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At that point my ex-husband accused me of making up the part about the concussion and possibly the whole thing to screw with HIS head and I thanked him for reminding me why I never spoke to him over the phone except during an emergency, \"and I think the crisis has passed. I'll text you a photo of Big Child's face and you can make your own inferences on the matter of whether he hit his head, goodbye.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Since then I've been wretchedly ill my own self, and busy hovering over Big Child, who is handling his injury pretty well, I think. The middle school told him that if he just wanted to sit out the rest of the year and focus on recovering they'd leave his grades exactly where they were. I think he's going to go for it, but he wants to verify that one last grade is an A according to the scale the teacher uses before kissing the possibility of extra credit goodbye (he's determined to finish out the year with straight As). It kind of broke my heart that my kid sat there with a broken bone and worried about interrupting my day. He's asked me since then whether I'll be in trouble with my job for taking time off to take care of him (it took him a while to notice I'm sick too, but he's a kid and on narcotics besides so he gets a pass) and I told him the truth: that I can find another job if I need to but I only have one of him so it wouldn't matter if I did.

He was actually kind of a jerk about it, and made me feel like a bad mom, and I spent my lone break of the day calming him down via text and assuring him that the kids wouldn't need EVERY damn supply on the first day and I'd try to get everything and it would be FINE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Soulless Corporate Megalith supercenters' school supply aisles on the Labor Day before school starts are the eighth circle of hell.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then I got home, back-achey and ready to be DONE with my day, and noticed that Clementine's heat lamp was out. The bulb had died, and initially I was going to say \"screw it, one night without a heat lamp won't kill her,\" but that poor lizard was perched under the dark lamp staring up at it all \"whyyyyy have you forsaken meeeeee?\" She really did look pitiful, and confused, and kind of distraught about the whole thing. So Hotter and I went back out and bought her a two-pack of replacement bulbs and some crickets, and stopped at Target for a few school supplies I hadn't found at Soulless Corporate Megalith, and brought it all home. I screwed the new bulb into place and turned the lamp on, and Clementine came scuttling from the other side of the tank and spread her body out like a pancake under the light for maximum exposure all \"ahhhh!\" like life was good again.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then I tripped over a box from Staples with all of the missing supplies, because Hotter is blind AND a jerk. OMG, HOTTER! But I kind of just have to laugh because fuck it, it was a huge pain in the arse but at least I had the money to buy the damn school supplies (twice). I think I'll box up the extras and take them to the elementary school office and tell them to distribute them as needed to some students who don't have what they need this year, since we've been That Family plenty of times in the past (as evidenced by the boys' palpable relief when their father brought them home from the weekend and they found their backpacks stuffed and ready with everything).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And at least the lizard appreciates me.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. Hotter's wrist feels much better. About which I have no comment except to say that I'm glad he's no longer hurting.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/09/supplied.html", "title": "supplied"},

Come, I will enroll you in my study!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0First you're going to need to put these knee-socks on, and tuck your pajama-pants INTO them (if you're not wearing pajama pants, you're not depressed enough to qualify for my study: go home). Next, take these baggy jeans of Hotter's that Lefty blew the cuffs out of skateboarding and put those on over the sock-tucked pajamas. Now arms up, and I'm going to put this white jacket with a built-in veil overtop of the whole thing and tape the hem around your hips. Shh, no, this is not the time for questions. Put your arms inside these shoulder-high gauntlets and hold them out so I can tape the tops to your jacket. Step inside these plastic shopping bags and I'll tape them over your feet. Can you still breathe okay? Good. Take this mixing bowl and my hive tool and go out to Alpha hive and pull the outer cover off. REMAIN CALM, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS. Use the hive tool to separate the inner cover from the super, then take a frame out and scrape the capped honey into the mixing bowl. Got it? Good. Put the hive back together. Yeah, I don't know how they're still stinging you either. Bring me the mixing bowl, and if you're still depressed come scrub to the elbow and spend an hour smooshing the honey through funnels and strainers into sterile Mason jars. Here's some Benadryl. Try not to drip so much honey onto the floor; that'll be a bitch to clean up later. Put the jars to process in a hot water bath. Still depressed? Because I could use some help cleaning the kitchen and--HEY GREAT, CONGRATULATIONS! Bye now.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Apparently MY depression is a refractory case, because the apitherapy failed to cure me. The good news is, we have plenty of honey and I am single-handedly keeping the makers of generic diphenhydramine in business. And Little Child, who did not previously like honey, seems to feel a sense of mastery over the bees in being able to eat it on toast, and Little Child is adorable when he eats toast with honey.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So there's that. If anyone needs me to cure them of their depression, I'll be recruiting for my research study in a couple of weeks when Alpha Hive has replaced the frames I removed to create Bravo.

Because the XY spent multiple thousands of everyone's dollars at one point to ensure his right to keep the MFA Children overnight on \"his\" Sundays and has subsequently refused to do so on many occasions when it would benefit everyone, we had to take the younger two (Big Child's bus leaves earlier) with us to the Eye Hospital to check Hotter in, and then I doubled back with them, dropped them at school, came back home to take Isis out and put some makeup on* and then doubled BACK again.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the way to the eye hospital the first time we were all kind of grumbling and half-awake, so I turned on the radio. The first two notes of \"Blurred Lines\" came on and I promptly turned it right back off again. \"What was THAT about,\" Hotter wanted to know, and I said I'd tell him later. Instead, we listened to What Does The Fox Say on The Precious (which: FREAKING EXECRABLE, GOOD LORD). Because at aw-crap-hundred, as I later told Hotter, I was NOT up to having the kind of conversation Mr. Thicke's vocal stylings would necessitate with my eight- and nine-year-old sons (something along the lines of \"yes it has a catchy beat but women who are too impaired to give informed consent to sexual relations are not fair game unless you're the kind of shitheel I would have to regret not rolling over on as a newborn, so CANWENOTKTHXBOYSGOODTALK\").\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for Hotter's eye, the procedure was difficult from a technical standpoint due to everything else wrong with Hotter's eyes but went well, and the surgeon is cautiously optimistic in that the cataract was plenty bad enough to impair the vision of even an otherwise-perfect eye. We'll (hopefully) see.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* Yeah so I momentarily freaked out because not knowing what to expect from this surgery but knowing that whatever it was would be in effect as soon as it was done, I realized that \"sick as a dog and fresh off two back-to-back days of double shifts\" is not a good look on anyone and probably I ought to try and look cute just in case. So I did some TOTALLY UNFREAKINGNECESSARYASITTURNSOUT damage control just in case, but the shield has to stay on the eye until tomorrow's follow-up appointment with the surgeon.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/10/unblurred.html", "title": "unblurred"},

She's eating and going to the bathroom normally and doesn't appear to be in any physical discomfort. She's just...kind of an asshole.

{"date": "August 17, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Man, whatever it was that was wrong with me on Friday (Initially I thought food poisoning, but I did end up spiking a little temp and bloating up the way I do when I'm fighting an infection of any kind so maybe contagion?) really kicked my arse for a minute. I was miserable into the wee hours this morning, but am now feeling like a solid 80%, which is good since today was my only day off for the next week! It was a somewhat crappy way to spend said day off, but I still feel pretty damn lucky. Being unwell and financially stable is quite cushy! \u00a0I was able to\u00a0contemplate medical attention from a \"do I need it\" standpoint rather than a \"how can I come up with the money and is it even worth going given that a copayment won't leave enough to fill a prescription\" standpoint, take the day off from Temp Agency #2 (I usually freelance for them when I'm off from The Ritz, but today I did that for less than an hour),\u00a0go to the grocery store and purchase things to make me feel better (crystallized ginger, organic free-range chicken broth, HFCS-free gingerale, Angostura Bitters, GF crackers), and\u00a0download trashy novels from Amazon to amuse myself between naps. Even with feeling like utter shite, I had a nicer day yesterday and today than I typically did even feeling perfectly healthy during the worst of our financial woes, because we had everything we needed, I was able to rest without a mounting sense of panic over what it was costing, and the little creature comforts one gets used to going without when poor really do help!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of which, I got a lot of questions on the facespace about the Angostura Bitters when I mentioned them, so here you go. BEHOLD:\r\n\r\nFigure One: This is an affiliate link, which means that if you buy the product through my link, I get a nickel or something. You should totally do it, because having a bottle of this stuff around next time you have an upset stomach will change your life, and also I like nickels.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I turned up at work yesterday green in the face, my very kind boss asked me if I wanted some bitters. I was all \"huh?\" I'd heard bartenders at various places where I've worked talk about them being good for hangovers but I wasn't hung over. \"I don't know if they're gluten-free or not,\" said my boss, \"but if they are you should try some mixed with gingerale. It really does help if you have a queasy stomach.\" So I Googled it quickly on The Precious and found that the brand above (which is what The Ritz stocks in their bar) is, in fact, gluten-free and PEOPLE. Not only did it help my stomach a LOT, but I also happen to think this stuff in gingerale is DELICIOUS (YMMV--it's an herbal kind of flavor reminiscent of Bach's Rescue Remedy). After I went home sick I stopped at the shopping center by Casa MFA, which has a state alcohol store (I figured that due to the alcohol content I'd have to buy the bitters there--it's 80-90 proof, although you only use about a teaspoon in a glass of gingerale so no, I was not DRINKING AT WORK OMG). They had a much cheaper variety that I did buy but was leery of because I wasn't sure about gluten content or if it'd work as well, then when I went to Kroger for chicken broth and whatnot I found that they do sell the kind The Ritz uses, that I knew to be effective and GF (I guess since it's more of a flavoring than something you'd drink to intoxication it's okay by the liquor laws), so I bought some there as well. TRY IT!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That's about all that's going on in my little world, other than that I won a \"lot\" of ten Jo Malone Orange Blossom samples, some travel-sized hand creme, and a small bottle of bath oil in the same scent on eBay for way below the retail price for similar quantities of same, and am going to be the best-smelling waitress EVAR! \u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/mending.html", "title": "mending"},

I'll refer to him therefore as Mr. Jackson (not his real name).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I want to know what Mr. Jackson's deal is! He's a young guy, not terribly good-looking but not ugly either, pleasant but not chatty the way some guests are, and he seems well-off but utterly lacking in pretention. If it weren't for the fact that he is such an outstandingly good tipper I probably wouldn't pay him much notice one way or the other, but as it is I'm all atwitter with curiousity. Why such a great tipper? I mean obviously he can afford it, but the vast majority of the folks we see at The Ritz are in the \"1%\" or they wouldn't be staying there, and most of them tip in the standard 15-20% range for good service. Once in a while when it's a special occasion or they are marking the end of a long stay someone will tip like Mr. Jackson, but he does it EVERY SINGLE DAY and it is always a brand-new, pristine twenty-dollar bill (I've been fortunate enough to have him in my section for several days in a row). One day I was up by the exit returning some menus to the hostess as he was going to leave, and I saw him heading for the door and said \"have a great day, Mr. Jackson!\" and he looked up and said \"OH! I almost forgot!\" and ran back to his table to leave the twenty on it.

But...WHY?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If Mr. Jackson's goal is to make sure that I remember him and what he is going to ask for, he's certainly accomplished it (although it's honestly no more than I do for any regular customer), but it's not as if he asks for something really unusual or hard to provide. Does he do this every time he comes into contact with a service professional? Is it part of a \"kindness project\" of some sort, where he just wants to uplift our weary spirits? Is he the smalltown-boy-made-good son of a waitress who therefore has a soft spot for servers? WHAT MAKES THIS GUY TICK?

{"date": "September  3, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 This morning after putting the littles on the bus, Hotter and I loaded both dogs into the MFA Beater and took them to the vet for checkups and vaccines, and to have Isis's ears looked at since she's been scratching them with increasing alacrity. Both dogs were pronounced healthy; Isis remains mange-free and Bumpus is finally at a good weight (which we achieved by ditching first the BARF diet and then the expensive prescription kibble and just providing him with free-choice access to shitty grocery-store dogfood all day every day--apparently as a descendent of redneck huntin' dawgs that is what his system does best with!). Isis does, however, have yeast in her stupid ears AGAIN (she gets this a couple of times per year--always has). So we had to buy a bottle of speshul perscripshun earwash for her, and some medicated drops to use twice a day. And by the time she'd galloped and loved her way through the waiting room and the clinic staff everyone agreed that it was for the best that we also acquire a bottle of sedatives to pre-game for her next appointment (in two weeks, to make sure her ears are all better) (it's not that she's vicious or uncooperative at ALL, she's just so violently HAPPY TO SEE EVERYONE OMG HIIIIII that it's a little hard on her, us, and anyone within range, because sixty pounds of crazed, joy-yodeling licky love is more than some people want in their lives if they're just trying to buy some parakeet vitamins unmolested at the PetSmart and GTFO). So that was a less-than-fun way to spend a hundred bucks, but it was a great feeling to be able to have Isis's ears addressed when we noticed them getting bad rather than having to wait until a check came in.\r\n* \u00a0 An eBay seller of Jo Malone fragrances and body products sent me the wrong item; instead of two samples of body creme in Orange Blossom they sent me two 9-ml bottles of cologne in Wild Bluebell, and now I love that scent too! I actually already loved it but didn't know--as soon as I smelled the stuff I recognized it as the signature scent of a waitress I knew at the Hotel California who always smelled amazing. I wonder if all Jo Malone fragrances are this wonderful? I kind of don't even want to smell any more of them, because one scent was a luxurious indulgence, and the second was a happy accident, but having three (or more!) scents to collect products from could be financially ruinous! That didn't stop me from ordering a set of ten samples, though.\r\n* \u00a0 Sometime in the next week-ish, I'll attend an in-house seminar at The Ritz to learn about the various (seriously, there are like, five or six different options!) insurance plans in which I can choose to enroll after my 90-day anniversary (the end of September). I am feeling kind of daunted by the whole process, because I want to make sure I choose the best coverage! Ideally I'd like something that costs the same as or less than Anthem (my current coverage), covers prescription medications for fixed co-pay amounts (rather than as a percentage of the final cost--currently I pay 40% for drugs that cost above a certain threshold, which means that Pristiq is $74/month and the last time I needed an antibiotic the doctor went with prescribing his second choice \"because the one I'd LIKE to give you will cost you an arm and a leg\"), and has a low (or nonexistent) out-of-pocket deductible for stuff like labs, xrays, and surgeries. Because someday when I have enough PTO saved up I might just get crazy and have a couple of elective surgeries for things that I currently live with but could get worse at any time, little currently-minor issues that are better to address while I'm younger and less of an anesthesia risk than when I'm older and they're emergencies.\r\n* \u00a0 I've gained back a few pounds since I've been \"benched\" from the gym (I didn't go for a couple of days before finally going to see a doctor for my back due to the pain caused by anything more strenuous than lying on a heating pad, and haven't gone since because I wanted to taper off the steroids first--I don't want to overdo it while masking the effects of potential overexertion). This in and of itself is a very first-world phenomenon--\"whomp whomp, I can't stop eating delicious foods while I wait to complete the treatment I went and got for my medical problem before going back to the gym, POOR ME.\" I took my last Prednisone this morning and will be reacquainting myself with the elliptical machine TOMORROW.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?

There are stories to tell though, oh yes there are.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I have filed for Unemployment, but am hoping to have another job in place before I'd receive anything through that (there's a brief waiting period). I have one more paycheck coming, and a couple of bucks on the one after that (but nothing to write home about), and I've picked up work for this Saturday and next Saturday via Temp Agency #1. We're okay for the rent, the electricity, groceries for the next week, and the next bottle of Prograf. After that, I don't know. Hotter's eye surgery, sadly, is canceled, and I have NO idea how I'll afford my Pristiq (Synthroid and Symbicort are cheap and I can go without Mirapex and Nexium, although I'd prefer not to obviously).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0To add to my enjoyment of the above, the MFA Beater has been suffering grave mechanical issues, and was briefly unfuckingdriveable. I almost called out on my last day of work because of it, but managed to flog it downtown. Immediately after the shit hit the fan, I picked up a couple of applications within walking distance of the Hotel California (as we will start calling my now-previous employer), since I was already downtown, then barely got the fucking thing home. In a way this was good, as the workout I got (equivalent to a Stairmaster on low--think LOTS of revving the gas and stomping the clutch) kept me from getting emotional in any way until I was home. Today Hotter took a ratchet set and his feelings outside and rendered the Beater functional again by the skin of its teeth, so that's good.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What else? Bumpus ran away. He slipped past Big Child, ran outside as if to greet the XY, who was here picking the kids up for dinner visitation, and just kept going. He was MIA for two hours. MICROCHIP YOUR PETS, Y'ALL. Now he's back, mysteriously damp and in need of a bath, and I have fond memories of being screamed at by my ex-husband on my front lawn to mull over when I wake up from tonight's round of nightmares in a cold sweat (yeah, HIIIII ANXIETY DREAMS).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm trying to look on the bright side here. While the circumstances suck, I'm reconnecting with my kids in ways I haven't been able to in months and months due to work obligations. We're eating meals together as a family again, and thanks to the garden and beasts of Squatter Workshop, so far everyone/thing in the household has had enough to eat. If I were capable of timetravel I'd go back and kiss myself, with TONGUE, for getting rabbits. One fluffy-fryer only yields as much human-grade meat as a large commercial chicken breast, but its' giblets and trimmed skeleton yield three days' worth of meat for Isis, who would otherwise be subsisting on supermarket eggs about now (our four geriatric hens only produce enough backyard eggs for human consumption--we keep \"dog eggs\" in the fridge and crack one into each bowl of kibble we serve Bumpus to encourage him to eat more and help keep weight on him) given that she's a speshul preshus snowflake who's allergic to grains (including rice--WTF, ISIS?). So that's good. And finally, while I will miss those amazing benefits forever, working for the Hotel California was starting to take a toll on my mental health, and had been for a while. I won't go so far as to say I'm glad their underhandedness and illegal machinations forced a parting of the ways, but I'll admit to a certain amount of relief that it's OVER.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Also, while life is sucking a fat one currently, I have some truly amazing friends, who have plied me with funny animal pictures and ratchet extensions, YA lit for my Kindle via Amazon and grocery money via PayPal (ain't technology grand?), sound advice and commiseration. Thanks for being awesome, everyone. Y'all know who you are.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This too shall pass, like a kidney stone, slow and painful. ONWARD!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And how are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/05/back.html", "title": "back"},
{"date": "August 23, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Today was my last day working with The Group That Almost Broke Me. I dealt with them for eleven hours straight, and by the end of that time was ready to set my work uniform on fire. WHILE WEARING IT.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That said, the nasty customer I mentioned in my last post actually sought me out today and apologized: \"I thought about it, and I feel badly about how I treated you, so I want to apologize. You did a good job, and I was a jerk.\" !!!!!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the spirit of apologizing for things said in the heat of the moment, I owe liquid bandages an apology. Yes, they feel like pouring napalm into a fresh wound, but I tried Jay's suggestion of reapplying more frequently and not only avoided the OH FUCK PAIN but also got better coverage.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I think as an apology for scheduling me for the past six days straight, or perhaps in apprectiation of my voluntarily working a double the other day with The Group From Hell, my boss gave me THE ENTIRE WEEKEND OFF. That is a very rare thing in the hospitality industry, and I appreciate both that and the positive write-up I received (yes, at The Ritz there is such a thing as a POSITIVE write-up, wherein management can recognize employees for superior performance, and there is ALSO one that employees can fill out for each OTHER for excellent \"internal customer service,\" helping outside their area, or whatever...positive reinforcement, y'all!). \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think I will probably sleep for at least half of that time.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\nPee Ess: Today is payday, and I think the paycheck I got today is probably the biggest one I've ever had for a two-week period. In fact, it's right up there with the ones I would get three times per SEMESTER while teaching. I am so very tickled by that--I think we'll be able to get Hotter's eyes fixed without any tightening of belts grocery-wise, which makes me feel so incredibly fortunate I hardly know what to do with myself. I'm not telling y'all this to brag, but rather because some of you have said how happy it makes you to know that things here are finally okay (in fact, BETTER than okay!) and things right now? Are VERY OKAY.\u00a0\r\nPee Pee Ess: With the exception of my back and Paul, but what are you gonna do? It's always something, and pain I can handle, especially if it means that when Big Child comes to me to ask if I can stop at the library and get a book for his summer reading list, I can say \"it's probably in great demand since it's on the list, how about I just order it for you from Amazon so we know you'll have time to read it before school starts?\" He was stunned and very grateful, and so was I.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/amends.html", "title": "amends"},
{"date": "May  3, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0In an effort to be less depressing up in this piece, I'm going to start trying to focus on the positive things in life on a daily basis, or some such shit. So here are some good things from today:\r\n1.\u00a0This cake. I didn't actually get to eat any of it, because GLUTEN, but Big Child was just SO very happy and appreciative, and I love that I have the skills to make or make up any kind of cake my kids want for their birthdays. I also made deep-dish pizza from scratch at Big Child's request, for his \"special birthday dinner,\" and the MFA Children pronounced it to be \"better than Domino's, which means it's REALLY good because Domino's is good!\"\r\n2. The MFA Honeybees. I keep writing posts about them in my head and then not actually writing them, because I caught some heat for getting the bees due to our being poor. But you know what? The bees are amazing, and are contributing to our household in the form of honey, wax, and pollination of the garden. So Stalky, et al can suck it. They also contribute entertainment (the bees, not Stalky and friends). To wit: the other day it started raining while I was down at Squatter Workshop. I poked my head out the door to see what the bees were doing, and saw a surprising number of them still coming and going. \"HUH!\" thought I, \"maybe they still work in the rain?\" Then I looked a little closer and saw that they were actually piling out of the hive, taking wee tiny bee-poops in midair over the baby pool in the apiary garden, and doubling back. I laughed for a solid five minutes--they are actually smart enough to be all \"OMG IT'S STARTING TO RAIN, LET'S GO DROP THE DUNG-BEETLE LARVA OFF AT THE POOL IN CASE WE'RE TRAPPED INSIDE FOR A WHILE!\" (bees will not poop inside the hive, and can actually get sick from prolonged freezes where it's too cold for them to nip out for a quick poo) Then today I took this photo of the hive entrance:\r\n\r\nFigure One: How great is it that you can see where they're tracking pollen all over the entryway? The Queen probably doesn't think so. She's probably all \"AND WIPE ALL SIX OF YOUR DAMN FEET ON THE WAY IN, I DIDN'T HAVE FIFTY WORKERS SCOUR THAT LANDING BOARD WITH THEIR MOUTHPARTS THIS MORNING FOR NOTHING!\"\r\n3. This morning I totally went back to bed with Hotter and Isis after the kids went to school and wallowed in bed with them until almost noon, and I'm not even sorry. Today's round of online job applications still got done when I got up (the Beater is still mostly out of comission; we're taking it for an oil-change and a repair estimate tomorrow and once it's back up and running I'll be pounding the actual pavement more), and with any luck I won't have that kind of snuggle-opportunity too many more times before I'm working full-time again (I am still working part-time for Temp Agency #1; I never stopped and they are searching for a fulltime temp-to-hire gig for me so I'm doubly glad I maintained the connection with them). Hotter is an excellent snuggler, and since we're both bi we take turns being the big spoon.* Isis then jumps in and littler-spoons whoever the little spoon is, and it's like a cuddle conga-line. It's pretty fabulous, actually :)\r\n\u00a0ETA: 4. Today I had the distinct pleasure of watching this episode of Last Call Brittany live, and participating via the live chat (I'm probably fucking the terminology ALL up--can you tell I only joined Google + in order to see my very favorite author and Twitter-friend, Tiffany Reisz, on this show?). I'm already Twitter-friends with several of the ladies who were on the panel, and thought \"man, I wish I was public so I could @ a couple of the others,\" and then thought HEEEEEEY why not? So I made my Twitter account public again, because Temp Agency #1 doesn't care about my social media proclivities, my ex and I have reached a blessed accord of sorts wherein he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what I do unless I'm in front of him and vice versa, and Stalky, as always, can eat an ENTIRE bag of dicks and choke on the balls. There's very little she or anyone else could do right now to make my life any worse, and while that has its obvious drawbacks it's also kind of liberating.\r\n* That was a joke, people. One's sexual orientation has nothing to do with whether one is the big spoon or the little spoon. I have no idea why I feel the need to add in this disclaimer, but do not need a lecture on perpetuating stereotypes. If you're getting het up over an innernet-stranger's perception of sexuality in re: spooning within the confines of their own damn marriage then you probably need a hobby and/or psych meds, but this IS the innernet.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834017eeac80ef6970d-pi", "http://brittanyherself.com/aside/last-call-brittany-fisting-and-dungeons-and-bondage-oh-my/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/05/positive-things-from-today.html", "title": "positive things from today ETA"},

{"date": "May  3, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I realize I mostly post super-healthy recipes on here. This is not one of those. Big Child just turned twelve and asked me for a \"coconut overload cake, like last year!\" Unfortunately, last year we were so broke that I was totally improvising, and I don't even remember what the hell I did except that it involved lots and lots of coconut. So I Googled around for ideas, decided to go for a pudding cake since Big Child likes really rich baked goods, and saw one otherwise-gross recipe that included flaked coconut in both the cake AND the frosting. \u00a0BRILLIANT! While I couldn't actually taste the cake (STUPID WHEAT WITH ITS STUPID FUCKING PROTEIN!), I liked the idea of adding to the (god this is a douchey word, but bear with me) mouthfeel with something to give it a little texture.\r\nBig Child's Twelfth Birthday Triple-Coconut Cake\r\nThe Cake:\r\n1 box yellow cake mix1 3.5-oz packet of coconut-flavored cook & serve pudding1 and 1/3 cups water3 eggs1/4 cup coconut oil2 cups unsweetened flaked coconut - you can use sweetened if you MUST, but remember you've already added sugar via the pudding and I think sweetened would be cloyingBeat eggs and oil together, add pudding powder, then add cake mix and water in alternating halves and once mixed, beat on highest setting or, if you prefer, WITH FEELING, for three minutes. Stir in coconut flakes and bake in two 8- or 9-inch pans for 35 minutes at 350 (if you use 9-inch pans, check at 33 minutes or it may get a little darker than you want it to due to the pudding mix adding sugar). Cool in pans for 15 mins and then on racks or plates until cool enough to frost.\r\nThe Frosting:4 oz neufchatel cheese2 oz coconut oil1 tsp vanilla extract1-2 tbsp heavy whipping cream2-3 cups confectioner's sugar2 cups unweetened flaked coconutToast the coconut flakes in a dry pan over low heat until golden. Set aside to cool. Beat the neufchatel cheese and coconut oil together, then add 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream and vanilla extract. Add confectioner's sugar one cup at a time, correcting with the other tbsp of heavy whipping cream as needed until you have the right consistency--you want shiny but not loose, forming nice peaks and ripples. Beat in half the toasted coconut, saving the other half to coat the frosted cake.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Frost the tops of both layers, stack them, then frost the sides and coat with toasted coconut. If you can do this and have it come out looking neat and pretty you're a better woman than I am, but according to the MFAmily Gluttens it will be so delicious you won't care (I tasted the frosting and it was gooooood). Write \"Happy Birthday\" in gloopy cursive with one of those super-nasty HFCS gel frostings, top with re-lighting candles if you're a wise-ass like we all are here, and sing the birthday song.

To wit: the group we currently have in-house tips about 40% what the average customer does (due to a combination of factors, chiefly age), and today I still made about three times what I usually do on a busy day. The Ritz has neither the staff nor the seating to accommodate a group of this size, sheer voracity (seriously, they eat and eat and EAT, and then they have coffee and dessert and EAT SOME MORE), and stark emotional neediness (they're a lonely and loquacious bunch, whose desire for instantaneous service is outstripped only just BARELY by their desire to TALK YOUR EAR OFF).

I, however, had a low-cut top on and managed to get out of the guy at the register that there's a fairly easy and straightforward way to test whether one's plug-wires are bad (that is what we suspect the issue may be) without paying $99 to find out.

I'm hoping that by resting all day and self-medicating with Amazon.com Whispernet and Earl Grey I'll be okay at work tomorrow.\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of work, we're getting a new co-worker, and it's a girl!

Aww, bless! Glad I'm not trying to screw with THEM today. While I was outside I checked on Bravo Hive and they are plugging away, bringing in plenty of pollen so I know they're raising brood in there.

I am still hurting pretty badly, but was immensely gratified by the reduction in my pain level at work thanks to 60 mg of Prednisone first thing in the morning. It took it down from a constant 7-8 on the infamous 1-10 scale to a nagging 4, and that? Is a beautiful thing. As an added bonus, apparently high-dose steroids are the first-line treatment of choice in people who can't take NSAIDs and have a burgeoning bunion (no, I didn't bring Paul up at Urgent Care yesterday--he still hurts a bit now and then but is far from my biggest problem and can wait until my appointment with my GP on the 11th to be looked at), so I may be killing two birds with one stone. By the end of my shift the pain was back up to about a 6, but I took a Flexeril and some Hydrocodone when I got home and am parked on the heating pad, so I hope to feel much better shortly.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am so, so, SO grateful to have the medical insurance and pocket money that allowed me to go and get checked out and obtain some effective pain relief yesterday, y'all.

Like, it's the same scent, but maybe the alcohol in the perfume gives it more of a bite, or the chlorine (or minerals) in the bathwater gives the bath oil less sweetness...after verifying that Orange Blossom was, indeed, the scent in the Jo Malone line I'd smelled on a British lady customer and been so taken with, I proceeded to buy the cologne, a pot of body creme, a small bottle of bath oil, and a pump-bottle of hand and body lotion as I found good deals on eBay. A couple of days ago II used the lotion for the first time and THAT was the smell, exactly! I stood in my bathroom for several minutes sniffing my forearm, transported, and then it came to me: the north-facing side of the tiny house where I grew up had a stunty Mock Orange tree surrounded by Lily of the Valley, and in the springtime the two scents combined to make it smell like heaven. THAT is exactly what Jo Malone Orange Blossom lotion smells like, and apparently why the fragrance called to me on such a visceral level.* Hiding in the cool shade between the hedge and that Mock Orange Tree, crouched among the Lily of the Valley...that was one of the places I felt the safest as a small child. At first it bothered me, as it does when I laugh and hear The Narcissist in the back of my throat, but then I decided that the past only wins if I abandon all of the scarce positives along with the negatives, and it's a very nice smell.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Sniff.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 And yes, it's probably the reason for all of the weird dreams I've been having, since I moisturize before bed.

I was told, after Tuesday's debacle and Wednesday's exhaustive interview with HR, that someone would call me yesterday to let me know What Was Going On or, if no information was available yesterday, that someone would definitely update me today. Neither of those scenarios panned out, but The Offender has not been at work since Tuesday, so I am hopeful that HR has, in fact, Handled Their Shit and I have nothing more to worry about regarding Matters, Comma, Confidential.\r\n* \u00a0 I haven't made any inquiries because if things remain as they were today (no Offending Party, and The Bastard in check) (oh yes, this is a separate issue from The Bastard) then I will be quite satisfied. I am extremely fortunate in that a friend of mine who I met through this humble little website is a Professional Handler Of This Sort of Shit, and has volunteered to step in and play the heavy on my behalf in need be. I hope I don't need her help at all, but it's very reassuring to know that if The Process turns out to be untrustworthy I have an option besides quitting my job or resigning myself to a hostile work environment on an ongoing basis.\r\n* \u00a0 Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Isis DESPERATELY wants to be friends with the kitten. The kitten isn't against this, per se, but the dog comes on a little strong and ruins it for herself. Skeeter is fine with existing in close proximity, both being on the bed with us, and playing as long as it doesn't go any further than licks and nuzzles and no-contact running around. The dog, unfortunately, wants to play full-contact rugby, and has earned herself many swipes to the nose through rough wooing of the kitten, who can outmanuever her easily and fit into hiding places (under the couch, on the other side of the gates, etc.) that the dog can't access. This mean that the dog spends much of the day whimpering plaintively. I cannot WAIT until they work this all out! And no, of course we are not leaving them alone together unsupervised.\r\n* \u00a0 The children are nearly as fond of Skeeter as Isis is, and are almost as unsuccessful in getting him to be friendly with them, largely because they are very loud and jumpy and high-energy. Skeeter mostly wants a warm, STILL lap to sit on. The children keep exclaiming enviously over how much better the kitten seems to like Hotter and me, but I think that's mostly because we're willing to sit still and ignore him while he purrs and kneads blissfully on us with his little bald paws.\r\n* \u00a0 I picked up a part-time gig working for another department at The Ritz, and my first day there is tomorrow (which is my day off from my main gig there).

{"date": "October  3, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Tuesday my workday went pear-shaped in ways I don't think I could legally go into even if I wanted to. Suffice it to say that while *I* am not in any trouble, and my employer's Head Honcho of HR is SUPER-nice, it sucked a lot and I was a hot mess with a crying-induced headache by the time I clocked out. As I walked to my car, I went over options for how to handle this in my head. The elliptical is still out due to various injuries (although my knee and back are both MUCH better of late). My initial impulse was to just get stinking drunk, but I've still been dipping into the NSAIDs here and there, and alcohol is a blood thinner, and hangovers are not conducive to waking up at oh-god-hundred for work the next day, so I decided that was probably a bad idea. Then it occurred to me that MFA Kitty was already ready for pickup, and it had been MY decision to wait until Wednesday. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0A quick phone call and a stop at the bank later and I was on my way; the hour and a half drive without Hotter asking questions about The Day From Hell or children shoving worksheets needing to be signed up my butt was just the thing to calm my racing mind, and by the time I got to the breeder's house I was much more serene. When the breeder placed our kitten in my arms and I felt his tiny body vibrating with purrs and life, I knew I'd done the right thing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I still questioned myself a little on the drive home (I forgot how much cats hate being in the car, OMG), but the moment we walked in the door, the kitten hopped onto Little Child's shoulder and purred. AWWW!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Work yesterday was much better, although I still had to spend some time in HR's office recounting various incidents, which was Not My Favorite. I mean, FFS, I am a WAITRESS. All I want to do is go and pour people's coffee and be nice to them and chat about their day, and have them give me a few bucks that I can use to pay my bills. I do NOT want to Talk About Incidents and describe How They Make Me Feel to people who write down everything I say and have me sign it afterward. I'm actually starting to question whether The Ritz is a good place for me to work or not (especially if they don't follow through on their promise to Handle This this time). It's screwing with my mental health, and even my marriage, because when I said I was DONE if The Ritz's process didn't Fix This PDQ Hotter said \"THE HELL YOU ARE\" and, when I said I didn't want to continue to work in a hostile environment, informed me that if it paid this well I needed to suck it up and find a way to deal. Which...WOW. Yes, it's good money. No, it's not worth being afraid (at least not to me). Fffffffuuuuuuudge.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But hey, look, KITTY:\r\n\r\nFigure One: Innernet, meet Skeeter.\u00a0Awww.\r\n\r\nFigure Two: He looks decent-sized...\r\n\r\nFigure Three: ...until you add my hand for a sense of scale.\r\n\r\nFigure Four: Just what the doctor ordered.

{"date": "August 28, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0My back was horrendous all weekend, to the point that all I did with a beautiful weekend off was lie on a heating pad and whimper. A friend of mine with Many Awful Back Problems (as in girlfriend has a bionic implant that zaps her spine like an internal TENS machine) was pestering me to go to Urgent Care, but I was reluctant to do that for fear of being seen as a drug-seeker (usually when my back is acting up my x-rays will look perfectly fine, and I was in so much pain that a doctor who didn't know me being skeptical and unsympathetic would have made me cry). \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Monday was slow at work, and I wasn't in TOO much pain with two naproxen on board.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday morning I had a stern talk with myself about my covert NSAID consumption after a papercut I didn't even really notice turned into a trail of blood across the floor that had me wondering who was hurt until I raised my hand to push my glasses up and saw it was covered. Whoops! So I just took one naproxen before work instead of two, but we ended up being really busy and after work my back hurt so badly that all I could do was go to sleep on the heating pad. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Today I took two naproxen again (I know, BAD MFA MAMA!), but was in pain all day anyway despite it being slow. Midway through my shift my left leg started to buckle periodically and sort of lag; it would do what I wanted it to do but there was a slight delay, and both legs felt like I'd just worked out to exhaustion. NOT GOOD! At that point I knew I needed to see a doctor, and since my GP doesn't have an x-ray machine at her office I went to Urgent Care after work. I was still pretty sure nothing would show up and concerned I wouldn't be taken seriously, but I know better than to ignore neurological symptoms.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It turns out I'm an idiot on a couple of counts. First of all, the doctor I saw at Urgent Care (after a brief kerfuffle with the triage nurse, who freaked out because my BP was 87/54) probably knows me better than my own GP (he greeted me with \"hey there, MFA Mama. Bad Ear acting up again? No? Lungs, then?\"), and took me very seriously when I described what was going on. And second, something DID show up on the x-rays: I have a bulging disc at L-5. D'OH! I left with prescriptions for high-dose steroids, muscle relaxers, and narcotics, a sheet of exercises to do, and a prescription for physical therapy should I go back to being in an unacceptable amount of pain when I stop taking the steroids. The doctor also offered to write me a work excuse if I didn't think I could work in this much pain, but I told him I couldn't afford to miss any shifts and he said it was up to me and to let him know if I changed my mind.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So the good news is that a) I'm not just a wuss (I seriously thought this would turn out to be nothing and I'd feel dumb for wasting a co-payment) and b) I now have pain relief that I can take without thinning my blood any further and that ought to work a lot better. Well, and also c) I had medical insurance and the money to actually go see a doctor.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And how are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/bulging.html", "title": "bulging"},

{"date": "December 10, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 My back is not any better. In fact, it may even be worse. Curling up like a shrimp no longer feels good. There is no comfortable position for sleeping. No amount of medication renders me comfortable anymore, only slightly less desperate.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 My marriage is not any better either. Hotter keeps wanting to talk, like just socialize and interact, and I am so \u00a0unhappy that it feels fucked up and surreal and dumb to be talking about the pets or the weather or what is going on at work. At the same time, life has not stopped happening and my closest offline friend is having a crisis pregnancy, and there have been workplace dramatics involving one of my favorite co-workers quitting abruptly, and crazy-making e-mail exchanges with the XY (who is being perfectly pleasant face-to-face and has even provided me with the childrens' insurance information but has nevertheless clearly lost all touch with reality based on some of his assertions of late). A guest at work said I made their evening (all I did was provide my usual excellent service and help them figure out their smartphone well enough to send a picture of a special event to their spouse) and was moved to both take a manager aside and sing my praises and write a kind note on their receipt, and I was recognized for going the extra mile. It feels weird that Hotter doesn't know much about any of these things. It feels weirder still to try and tell him. I don't feel like he and I are friends at the moment, and now that he has wounded me he seems to want to be friendly and loving toward me, and I am confused. I'll catch myself talking to him and then remember that this is someone who wants me to shut the fuck up with my unintelligent yammering if I have taken anything for my back, and generally if I am \u00a0off the clock I have. I suppose I could solve this by foregoing all non-OTC pain relief, except why would I want to accept any more physical agony into my life to placate someone who begrudges me pain relief because it makes me less of a sparkling conversationalist? I certainly don't want to choose OMGDRUGS over my spouse, but if the OMGDRUGS are warranted and my spouse has brain damage that makes them spacey and absentminded and occasionally hurtful ALL THE TIME and then has the balls to be pissed off because the OMGDRUGS make me SOMETIMES act kind of like they do ALL THE TIME then shouldn't I maybe just burn them in the bed (or couch, as the case may be) while they sleep and have it over with?\r\n* \u00a0 The XY is just off the chain. He has moved from \"obnoxious, unreliable, rude, and domineering\" to \"just plain delusional and narcissistic to the point that he thinks his saying something makes it true even when presented with evidence someone else has amassed to indicate that he's lying.\" This scares the hell out of me. It's also a huge pain in the ass. I don't WANT to call and ask the court clerk's office where my damn summons is, or print out a recent-ish photo of the XY for the security team at work. I don't even want to THINK about that motherfucker.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 2013 can fuck right on off and die in a tire-fire. I thought maybe it was a good year because I got a great job, but it seems like that was a fluke. I'm ready to be done with the holidays and this entire year in general, except that I don't really foresee 2014 being any better at this point, just different in a \"now you need regular mammograms because you're old\" kind of way.

{"date": "August 30, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHotter, via text message, to MFA Mama, who is at work: If my wrist hurts any worse I am considering Urgent Care.MFA Mama, via text message, after leaving work early due to business being slow: What's wrong with your wrist? Did you fall? Is it swollen?Hotter: I didn't hurt it or anything, it just hurts like a motherfucker.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I got home I looked at Hotter's wrist, which is not swollen, visibly deformed, or discolored at all, and asked him what was going on. He said it hurt in one very specific spot (the middle of the back of his hand, to be precise), more so if he pressed on said spot, and that heat helped it but it was really bothering him. At that point I gave him my honest opinion: that if it was me I wouldn't go to Urgent Care since there hadn't been any trauma, but rather apply heat since that helped, take something for the pain if needed (we have pain medications in the house, and I don't even mean just the ones for my back but rather some that Hotter has been prescribed in the past that we know are safe with his transplants), take it easy, and if it is no better on Monday and still getting in the way of normal activities try to get in to see a relevant specialist, since it's most likely some kind of inflammatory process (i.e. arthritis, carpal tunnel, etc.) that would require a complex diagnostic workup and long-term intervention (steroid shots, anti-inflammatories that would need to be run by Transplant, surgery, etc.) rather than something orthopedic (i.e. a broken bone) that would need emergent intervention (immobilization, stabilization surgery, etc.).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter's response was that it OMG HURT, which should have cued me in that he was not going to be up for a rational discussion of risk management and financially-savvy healthcare spending. I tend to forget that men plus pain equals INSTANT ASSHOLERY, because I have only experienced my own pain, which I can set aside to the point of working in a service industry where one must always be cheerful, helpful, kind and unfailingly polite even if I am at an 8 on the pain scale because I HAVE TO. I therefore tend to expect that others can at least be decent to those who are closest to them, but this only sets me up for disappointment. I explained to Hotter that I didn't want to seem callous, but given that the outcome of Urgent Care would be some low-resolution x-rays that wouldn't likely produce a useful result and perhaps some narcotic pain relief that we already had in our possession and a wrist brace, I felt that we should probably skip the cost of going to Urgent Care today, have him apply heat and take something for pain, and maybe buy him a wrist brace at the drug store, saving our medical spending dollars for an appointment with a hand specialist who could contribute in a meaningful way to the diagnosis and management of what would appear to be a longterm problem IF this continues.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Assholery, of course, ensued. Hotter said it was FINE, don't WORRY about him and his suffering, especially if it would cost us MONEY. Which oh for fuck's sake, was not the POINT. Of course it's not about the money, but just that spending money at Urgent Care today wasn't going to get him any kind of relief greater than what staying home and taking some pills and calling a specialist on Monday would, so I felt like we should skip that step UNLESS something changes (like the appearance of signs of a nerve injury, swelling, discoloration, THAT sort of thing--something that would indicate an acute problem). My own approach to pain without trauma is generally to wait until it either goes away or declares itself emergent, as in the case of my back, which was hurting for a month\u00a0in a general, no-good-reason kind of way before showing signs of nerve-impingement, which is when I cried uncle and had it x-rayed. If I'd gone for x-rays as soon as it started hurting they probably wouldn't have shown anything one way or the other. It would have been a waste of time, and while I might have received some pain medication, all that would've done was mask things temporarily. I just walked my talk here, in other words, so I didn't feel like I was being unfair or hypocritical in opining that Hotter ought to give this situation a hot minute to evolve given the facts.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At that point Hotter said he was concerned that maybe it WAS an emergency, because things don't just start to hurt for no good reason, and maybe it SHOULD be urgently evaluated by a medical professional. I said okay, then let's go to the ER where they can bring in a specialist if need be, and Hotter LOST HIS SHIT and yelled at me that he was NOT going to the fucking ER EVER AGAIN, and what the fuck was WRONG with me, and he'd be there for HOURS and be HUNGRY because it would be DINNER TIME and...yeah. I was starting to think that by the end of the day we might need a hand surgeon AND a proctologist, one to diagnose Hotter's hand and one to pull my foot out of his arse. I said either this is an emergency, in which case you need an actual hospital not a doc-in-the-box because you are a speshul preshus snowflake with donor organs, or it's not. He said it was not. I said okay then we're back to giving it some time, unless you just really WANT to go to Urgent Care and are going to be angry if we don't, and in that case fuck it, I'd rather spend the money whether it gets us anywhere or not than have you be angry all weekend.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter then said NEVERMIND, I don't WANT to go to Urgent Care, I just want you to DROP IT, and proceeded to sit at his desk and use the computer with his hand and not apply heat or take any pills. I mentally added a coroner to the running count of specialists he might need by the end of the day and finally went and got the bottle of Tylenol #3 and brandished it at him. \"Or would you rather sit there in pain and fan the flames of your pointless fury until the house burns down?\" He cracked a smile and allowed me to give him a pill, and within fifteen minutes he was perfectly pleasant and acknowledged that since this was the hand with the finger that occasionally hurts for no reason and the other bit that sometimes does the same, and his mother has terrible arthritis in her hands and fingers maybe, just MAYBE, I had a point about this not being an acute medical emergency, and then he went and made lunch and said there was no reason for us to cancel our plans to go to Trader Joe's or anything.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So the moral of this story is, next time shut my damn mouth and open the pill bottle and THEN decide where to go from there, because men are dicks when they're in pain.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/a-hand-surgeon-a-proctologist-and-a-coroner-walk-into-casa-mfa.html", "title": "a hand surgeon, a proctologist, and a coroner walk into Casa MFA"},

Fortunately, I'd been honest during my interview for The Ritz and said that my leaving my last job was kind of a mutual thing as a result of said shoddy treatment, and when I told my boss that That Guy was in the restaurant and I couldn't wait on him he was cool about it, and made the other server take the table. It would not have been good service for me to wait on that table. If I was the douche-lord with the bad hairplugs who was a guest of the GM of The Ritz and got me as a server I would've spent the whole meal looking for the loogie on my plate.

Since her white blood count wasn't indicative of infection, they recommended that I let them aspirate all of the lymphnodes and send the fluid for testing, and that will tell us definitively whether this is cancer or not. SOMETIME NEXT WEEK.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The vet said her only other theory was mayyyybe some kind of tick-borne illness, either ehrlichia, Lyme disease, or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. It's kind of longshot since it's been longer than the incubation period on those things typically is since Isis had a tick on her and she had the Lyme vaccine. The \"tick panel\" of bloodwork is $200, but since the antibiotic they use for All Things Tick was $60 and they wanted to put her on an antibiotic \"just in case\" anyway (the vet is concerned that if the lymphnodes on her neck get any bigger while we're waiting on the lab Isis won't be able to swallow), we agreed to just go ahead and treat her as if she had a tick-borne illness. I know that I for one would be perfectly okay with it if the lymphoma test came back negative, the antibiotics worked, and we never knew for sure what had been wrong.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the meantime, we're spoiling Isis ROTTEN. I don't think she's even been in her crate except to eat (Skeeter WILL NOT stay out of her bowl if there's food in it and while she's never snapped at him, she HAS--understandably--growled at him for this, so we put her in \"protective custody\" when she's eating to keep him safe) since I took her to the vet (I went back to work afterward, and Hotter is an even bigger sucker for that dog than I am). I worked a banquet tonight where we carved two Steamship Rounds, and brought the bones from both of them home for her. She's taking her antibiotics in more peanut-butter than is strictly necessary. And she can hog the bed all she wants for now.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Obviously I'll let y'all know when we know anything...man I hope this turns out okay.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/12/im-not-paranoid-the-universe-is-just-out-to-get-me.html", "title": "I'm not paranoid, the universe is just out to get me"},

Middle Child, for example, got a Kindle Fire HD (the smaller one), which was an extra-generous gift to celebrate his making the straight-A honor roll and winning an award for being an accelerated reader. GO MIDDLY! I loaded it up with kid-friendly content, made The Hunger Games Trilogy available to him (I let him use it in Freetime Mode only, to prevent his getting into Mommy's Kindle Porn or buying Amazon's entire kids' book selection; it also lets me set limits on his use and what he can do with the thing), and he...promptly downloaded and become engrossed in Moby Dick. Haha! Oh and I managed to salvage the Big Child/hundred-dollar bill situation by writing him a check for $100 and promising to take him to the bank to open his own savings account. He's stoked about that, and I'm relieved it worked!\r\n* \u00a0 Work continues to be mostly-awesome, which six months in leads me to believe that I might be working for The Ritz for A Very Long Time. If I don't hate my job yet, I don't think I'm going to. It's super-slow right now due to the holidays, but should pick back up after next week.

She's clumsy as hell and loves to have her belly rubbed.\r\n* \u00a0 Let's see, what else. Oh. The XY continues to be Not Right In The Head, and a shitty co-parent. He didn't take the holiday time he is entitled to with the children, citing work obligations, and declined to even take an extra weekend.

Without his former position being filled there is more work, but things still seem to go a lot more smoothly and morale is higher. Also, I had rather lost my faith in the goodness of The Ritz as a company based on their seeming failure to handle the situation for a bit there, but it turns out that was a lack of Middle Management passing things up the chain and not indifference on the part of the company itself. Following their swift and effective handling of The Situation after I took it up the chain my own self last week I am back to loving the hell out of not just my job and paychecks but also the company itself. MFA Mama + The Ritz = TRUE <3\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of pink puffy hearts, the kitten has settled in nicely. By which I mean he does as he damnwellpleases and has made excellent progress in training his human subjects. His new routine is to spend the hours between the children getting home from school and their bedtime napping in my closet (I kind of envy him that sometimes, haha), then emerge and alternate between pettings from Hotter and me and crazed ricocheting through the house. Before bed we've fallen into a nightly ritual wherein he perches on my shoulder while I fill a glass with water and take my pills, then dump it out and refill it for him to have a \"fresh\" drink out of.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Mint.com amused me greatly this morning by sending me a LOW CHECKING BALANCE ALERT OMG e-mail. Said low balance? Was over $200. Oh, Mint.com, how soon you forget just HOW DAMN POOR we were a few short months ago!

The jury is still out on whether I have gone soft...probably whether Isis runs out of meat before I get paid next will have a large part in determining the hens' fate.\r\n* \u00a0 Life continues to be full of the small daily aggravations, like the nail in the (NEW--couldn't be in one of the two OLD ones, ohHO no!) tire in the spot that can't be plugged (it's currently holding steady but does in fact go all the way through, as I learned when I gave it a tentative tug and heard the hiss of air escaping), and the hair (mine) that needs cutting (when it's long enough to be in my arse-crack after a shower I consider it TOO LONG), but they are aggravations and not Last Straws.

And because I go to work before the pharmacy OPENS, I didn't take it today.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It turns out missing a dose of Synthroid when you're grieving is a bad fucking idea, almost on par with \"getting married in Vegas\" (yes, I've done that, and what happens in Vegas DOES NOT STAY IN VEGAS, as it turns out, no, it follows you home, knocks you up repeatedly, and ruins your credit rating).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I just keep thinking about how she went and greeted every single person who came into the room to help euthanize her with love, from the vet tech who is violently allergic to pitbulls (and got down and let Isis lick her face anyway, even though we all knew it would give her hives), to the vet, to the new vet tech she'd never met (who had huge muscles and, I'm guessing, got saddled with the task of moving her afterward). Even drugged to the gills on doggy morphine and acepromazine, she lurched from person to person, tail wagging, ears back, so happy to see them all. That's the kind of dog she was. She never met a stranger, never once showed any aggression toward anyone. When you put a dog to sleep in this state, you have to sign an affidavit stating that \"to the best of my knowledge, my dog has not bitten anyone in the past fifteen days.\" I wanted to write in \"has never bitten anyone, EVER, is a big ball of love.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It may sound strange coming from someone who butchers chickens and rabbits, but I am terrified of dead bodies. I refuse to go to open-casket funerals. I've been known to run screaming from a dead wormsnake, a dead mouse, MANY DEAD HUMAN BEINGS...Isis though? I held her face while the vet gave her the shot and told her what a good girl she was, and she sank down onto the blanket beneath her, and the vet reached under her with the stethoscope and listened, and said \"she's gone,\" and I didn't let go. It was still Isis. I kept petting her, and holding her, and the vet said she'd take care of her, and then when I didn't move to go anywhere said to take as long as we needed and turn the light off when we were done. That damn dog was my fourth child, and I didn't want to leave her there. I even convinced myself that maybe the vet had made a mistake, and she wasn't quite dead, and told Hotter I didn't want to leave her alone just in case. Finally when her ears started to get cold even I had to admit she was gone. So I wrapped her up, and positioned her so that she looked comfortable, and closed her eyes, and turned the light off on my way out.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think if Hotter hadn't made me leave I'd still be sitting there with her head in my lap.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the way out, with the empty harness and leash in my hand, I heard the receptionist, who was the happy recipient of many loving maulings from Isis, gasp and say \"oh no, Isis!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Indeed.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/12/grief-and-synthroid.html", "title": "grief and Synthroid"},

It'll all eventually be alright, provided I get as healthy of a paycheck as I am thinking I should next Friday and nothing else goes Majorly Wrong. The worst financial fallout from early December of what Hotter has started calling \"The Winter of Our Discontent\" is that Big Child won't get the hundred-dollar bill he is expecting on Xmas Morning (I owe him fifty and told him I'd gift him fifty toward his \"system upgrade fund\"). Other than that, Santa got his shopping done before the car and the dog held hands and jumped, and I am even MOSTLY done with the wrapping of the gifts.

But no, you have to call them and TELL them that...anyway they informed me that I could close out the account by making a payment of $XXX.XX, to cover services rendered under the assumption she'd finish out her contract year with Banfield and I LOST MY SHIT. I was like \"seriously, you're telling me I owe you MONEY because my dog DIED and can't finish out her contract year?\" and eventually the rep I spoke with felt bad enough that she found a way to waive all of the fees and just close the damn account but REALLY?

And when I realized what had happened and that I didn't know \u00a0how to change it back, I thought \"OMG ISIS IS GOING TO DIE.\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think I can best equate this to the way I know when Hotter is about to have a seizure. It just...is.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When we got the confirmation I had another of my \"feelings,\" that after we had Isis put down we should go directly to the pound because clearly some dog was out there that needed us. I told Hotter about it the night before Isis's last appointment, and he said he was cool with that as long as we didn't do anything hasty. I said well yeah, there'd have to be rules: nothing under twenty pounds, over sixty pounds, over three months of age because we'd want it to be malleable and grow up with the cat, and nothing chronically ill, at least half pit but not purebred because I want something strong and healthy, and we DO NOT BEND on any of that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We had Isis put down, and it was beautiful and awful. She greeted every single person who came into the room to help euthanize her with love, and they took turns petting her and thanking her, and then the veterinary staff discreetly maneuvered her onto a thick towel for ease of transport after, and I held her face and told her she was a good dog while the plunger went down, and she was gone in the blink of an eye. Afterward, I didn't want to leave. I was afraid they had messed up, and she wasn't dead yet, and I'd be leaving her alone. When her ears started to get cold Hotter said he had to get out of there, and I wrapped her in the towel and positioned her so that she looked comfy and turned off the light on the way out of the room.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to go home and get drunk afterward, but Hotter reminded me that I'd had one of my stupid feelings about going to the pound and said we were going. It was a long drive, and I was crying, and we ended up lost in the huge government center complex where the local Animal Control headquarters is, between the Magistrate's office and the department of Public Utilities. \"This is bullshit,\" I wailed. \"This place should be easy to find!\" Hotter snorted and said that after the day we'd already had it should be easy to find AND they should be handing out free puppies.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Finally we found our way into a waiting room that reeked of cigarette smoke, with a chatty receptionist who was saying how it'd be a while because they were short a worker. I told her the rules and she said \"hmm...I do have a mostly-pitbull puppy you might really like...she's very chubby and silly. I could just go and get her and you could play with her while you wait...?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Seeing that Hotter was the sucker in the relationship, the receptionist dropped a fat brown-cowpatched blob of oversized paws, ridiculous ears, and a wagging white-tipped tail into his lap and backed away to fill my ear with how the puppy was ten weeks old, had just gotten healthy enough to have been spayed, which \"starts the countdown,\" and...by the time the worker finally appeared to show us the dogs, Hotter declared that we were \"done here.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"In that case, happy holidays: [redacted name of local fighting dog rescue organization] has actually sponsored this dog's care here and adoption fee to leave.

Feh on that!\u00a0 \u00a0On the bright side, I just got a payment notification from the good people over at Lijit. If you don't care about the nuts and bolts of blog-advertising then skip this whole paragraph, but many bloggers shy away from talking about the money they earn from their blogs and I always wonder about that kind of thing myself, so I'm about to break my blog-advertising experience with Lijit down for the curious. They don't pay publishers until you reach a $25 minimum threshold, and given that I am a very small-potatoes publisher, that's taken me (counts on fingers, checks archives)...fifteen months? Yes. But hey, $26.07 is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick! And really, out of all the advertisers I've worked with, Lijit's customer service team remains the most responsive, and their terms the least restrictive. They haven't refused to let me create new ad zones due to my modest readership or assaulted my sensibilities with unauthorized noise-making ads a la Adbrite, or suspended me for talking about chickens a la Google. So two thumbs up to Lijit!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lijit.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/12/sickness-and-lijit-unrelated.html", "title": "sickness and Lijit (unrelated)"},

Let's call it...The Ritz (it's not, of course, although it could give that place a run for its money in terms of service and overall luxurious expensiveness). The Ritz rocks, y'all! I'm getting to know some of the \"regulars,\" and there are customers who ask for me when they come in. It's nice to be able to make people happy and have little daily inside jokes at work. And the money doesn't hurt, either (on good days I make in excess of $20/hour, and even on my worst day to date I made more than my hourly rate at The Hotel California).\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of money, look at this:\r\n\r\nFigure One: This is a beautiful thing! I realize some of you would be very depressed if your bank balance looked like this, but you know what? All of the bills are paid, everything has cleared, and this number?

One of my two favorite yoga instructors and I have a CRAZY amount of life-trivia in common, as we discovered when she remarked on The Jew Tattoo (that thing is a great conversation-starter, it turns out). She's super-cool and I love her classes and she wants to buy some honey from me and I may have just a wee tiny crush.\r\n* \u00a0 Having working AC in the MFA Beater during the current hellacious heatwave?

I think I'm going to go ahead and chalk it up to \"yet another stupid thing my body does in response to infection\" and forget about it for now, although I will mention it to my doctor when I see her (hopefully next week on my one day off--the Ritz is very busy for the next couple of weeks). And I now realize that I was feeling pretty shitty while working out while all of that was going on depite my protestations to the contrary, because now? I feel AMAZING when working out. Endorphins, yo. They're pretty great!\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I am making spicy cilantro-sesame slaw to have for dinner with gluten-free chicken tenders and macaroni 'n cheese. THIS. IS.

I also treated myself to an Amazing Milkshake Of Locally-Identifying Name (consisting of three shots espresso, three scoops vanilla ice cream, three pumps coffee syrup, and three ounces whole milk--WHO WANTS TO GO AND LIFT SOME CARS?) while there, and stopped on the way home and got milk and yogurt and grapes and sammich fixins for the boys, all with just today's cash tips!

The issue of this particular bout of procrastination on Hotter's part has become a major one in the MFA Marriage, and it's stupid as all hell. Hotter is 100% in the wrong on this one but has somehow decided that my voicing any hint of displeasure about the three to four errands per month this issue has caused me to have to run for the past three years is verboten and worthy of instant ire on his part. After this month the whole thing should be over and done with and no longer an issue, but Hotter's response to any real or imagined criticism from me is to trot out the same past issues, and I have already done absolutely everything possible to accommodate his preferences there.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I've speculated before that my second marriage is a tool that the universe is using to help me better understand the issues in my first one (aside from the things the XY did that were outside the bounds of common decency--yes, he did some stuff that was beyond the pale and made the divorce absolutely mandatory, but in addition to that there were still the typical interpersonal squabbles and grudges of any decade-long relationship). I certainly was guilty of holding past issues against my first husband and trotting them out any time we quarrelled, and now I can see where he was coming from with the \"what more do you want\" because yeah, it sucks to be on the other end of that one. In the case of my first marriage I just shouldn't have taken the XY back after he cheated, because I should have been self-aware enough to realize that his cheating on me while I was living in the hospital with a critically-ill newborn wasn't something I would ever be able to let go of. Live and learn. The issue Hotter has a problem with is a MUCH lesser offense (no infidelity involved, but rather something that is a matter of personal opinion), but maybe it is nevertheless one he's never going to be able to move past? In any case there was absolutely no reason for today to become A Bad Day, but it has, and now we are going to have to Have A Talk.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Wish me luck.\r\n\u00a0\r\nETA: We talked, and Hotter says he's going to Drop It. In my heart of hearts I am skeptical that I've heard the last of the issue, but if I continue to belabor it then I'm the asshole at this point. Hotter had a valid question when he asked me what more I wanted besides his assurance that he will, in fact, let it go. Realistically there's nothing he can do short of going back in time and dropping it sooner or speeding time up and demonstrating his ability to let this one die. GET ON THAT WHOLE TIME-TRAVEL THING, HOTTER, GAWWWWD :)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/tetchy-tuesday.html", "title": "tetchy Tuesday [ETA]"},

It's not The Ritz's fault, or mine, it's a co-worker who is...having some personal struggles. One of the many things I love about The Ritz is that they employ a diverse workforce and don't shy away from hiring the disabled. Unfortunately today a co-worker with an intellectual disability who also happens to be HUGE and male had a meltdown at work (yes, for those of you who are facespace friends, the same thing happened yesterday, and yes, same co-worker), and reader, I do not DO well with angry men losing their minds regardless of who they are or what their deal is.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So that sucked.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What does not suck is that I made excellent money today, someone came in and specifically requested to sit in my section, someone else was so happy with my service that they announced their intention to write a letter singing my praises to the General Manager, and I have the next two days in a row OFF. I picked up a bottle of Pristiq from the drugstore today, having finished the last of the Effexor, and it was $74, but while that was an annoying amount given that I have insurance, I had it. And because I am craving some pasta I went to the store and bought some artichoke hearts and good cheese and zucchini and grape tomatoes and white wine and gluten-free grilled chicken strips (yep, LAZY) and am going to go and make myself an extravagant dinner.

I'd read online that that can be a sign of pain in dogs with lymphoma, and noted that at least four additional swollen lymphnodes had popped up since yesterday. She was also unusually thirsty, which can apparently indicate a calcium imbalance in end-stage lymphoma in dogs. I'd promised the boys that we'd do \"breakfast with Santa\" today at The Ritz, and Hotter and I agreed that we didn't want Isis to be alone so I flew solo at the event and called the vet from the road to tell her what was going on and let her know that Isis looked like she was in pain and would need some medication to make her more comfortable until we knew what was what. Honestly, I was kind of worried that she'd hit a point where it didn't feel ethical to let her keep suffering before we got the test results from the lymphnode aspirates back.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0There was a work meeting scheduled for today that I was supposed to attend even though it was my day off, and I found my boss's boss while the MFA Children were occupied with Santa and told him it kind of looked like the family dog might be dying and asked if it would be okay if I skipped the monthly staff meeting just this once (I have yet to miss one, and there are some employees who have been there longer than I have who have yet to ATTEND one). He was kind of wishy-washy about that, and said if I was worried about the boys they were welcome to hang out in the bar and watch TV during the meeting (umm, NO). So I hauled ass back home to drop the boys off and then doubled back to work.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Five minutes before I arrived at work the vet called me back. \"I'm really sorry,\" she said, \"but the lab called to let us know they didn't even need to complete the testing process. Isis has lymphoma, and it's pretty advanced.\" She went on to let me know that chemotherapy was an option, but that it would cost more than SHE could afford and the prognosis was pretty grim based on how Isis was doing. I told her we'd probably go the comfort care route and walked into the work meeting bawling and was kind of a dick about everyone's holiday goodwill.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter texted me while I was at work to let me know that Isis was absolutely miserable. I called the vet back and let her know and she said she'd prescribe some steroids and heavy-duty pain medication to give us time to say goodbye. I came home with pain meds in-hand for Isis, who came lurching to greet me leaving a trail of dropping fur behind her and covered in huge tumors and a painful-looking rash, panting and febrile with a distended abdomen (but still wagging her damn tail).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is fucking monstrous. Three days ago she was FINE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Telling the boys was...rough.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We're going to medicate her heavily, love on her overnight, and have her put down tomorrow at noon EST.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fuck cancer.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/12/isis.html", "title": "Isis"},

{"date": "August  8, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Today I decided I couldn't take it anymore; my feet were KILLING me after work and I actually had a pretty short shift. So I went to a specialty shoe store that caters to people with foot issues and threw myself on the mercy of a salesperson there. She measured my feet not only with the slide-y thing but also with a computer-assisted pad doo-dad that made a pressure map of my feet and charted my center of gravity, and HOLY SHIT THEY ARE AN ENTIRE SIZE BIGGER THAN THE LAST TIME I HAD THEM MEASURED. That was maybe three years ago? A hideous, horrible miracle has occurred, and the reason my shoes were effing my feet up is that they were too small.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I bought Paul a pair of Dansko nonslip \"professional\" clogs at RETAIL price in a brick-and-mortar store, my least favorite way to shop, because DESPERATION, and they cost so much I kind of feel like they ought to not only eliminate my foot pain but also give me a happy ending. After that my nerves were so shot* and I was so befuddled by the mall that I blew $20 at Teavana. Because apparently today I am yuppie scum. And Earl Grey Creme tea is delicious.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 In fairness to Paul...eh, fuck him, let's go with IN ADDITION TO PAUL...The Bastard was a real bastard today.

Then, because I'm a genius, I did the same thing on the way HOME from work.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 The account is overdrawn, and it is ALL my fault. I guess it's nice that it's not poverty-related this time but rather idiocy-related, but overdrafts suck either way. At least Hotter was nice about it (depending on various factors he'll either be really cool about me screwing up or make me feel like the world's biggest fucking idiot).\r\n* \u00a0 Home waxing kits. Let's talk about those for a minute! Since I was so pleased with my first experience with wax as a hair-removal method, I decided to try a home kit, thinking that maybe I could save myself some money in the future given that I think I'll be waxing my ladygarden for the forseeable future (MUCH less chafing during cardio than with shaving, and no blades involved--WIN!). Here I demonstrated at least SOME intelligence in that I elected to test the stuff on my legs and underarms rather than The Center Of The Universe. What I failed to take into account is that a) I have abnormally elastic skin due to connective tissue disease, b) I have abnormally thin blood because bleeding disorder + NSAIDs due to Paul and my back, and c) to prevent bruising, you need to hold skin taut prior to yanking off wax, and if you already have one arm in the air because you're waxing under it, that only leaves you one hand with which to remove the wax. I don't think I'll stop letting a professional wax Ms. Virginia any time soon!\r\n\r\nFigure One: But at least my armpits are smoother than a baby's behind! Speaking of my brightest moments, who remembers the tree incident of 2010? Left a helluva scar. Good thing I'm not an armpit model!\r\n* \u00a0 A guest at work smelled so fantastic that I was moved to ask her what she was wearing. She replied with something frenchy-sounding that my brain wants to turn into \"Joe Malone.\" Does anyone know what floral, vaguely lilies-of-the-valley-smelling women's perfume might sound like \"Joe Malone?\" I would very much like to buy a bottle of it if it's not outrageously expensive, and I hate that I felt so awkward about asking that I didn't get clarification, but apparently I am made of fail lately.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834019104c0b379970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/fails-assorted.html", "title": "fails, assorted"},
{"date": "August 10, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 The Bastard at work is really getting me down. Without going into specifics, this person has crossed the line of interpersonal decency and What Is Okay Per Society in big ways twice, in addition to doing little things that damage my income and serenity on a daily basis for WEEKS now. The income bit I can't get but so upset about, given that I am STILL earning twice as much at The Ritz as I ever did at The Hotel California, although don't get me wrong it IS galling. The other...well. If this was a case of \"The Bastard's and MFA Mama's personalities clash\" then I'd have some work to do to fine-tune things on my end and it would be frustrating, but manageable. This, however, is less a personality conflict and more a \"MFA Mama has a very common Israeli last name and The Bastard is of a nationality that has been oppressing The Tribe for thousands of years, and started treating MFA Mama like crap only after finding out her last name\" type of scenario. Which, well, there's nothing I can do about that (I suppose I could attempt to convince The Bastard I just married into that last name, but the fact of the matter is that I am actually of Jewish descent either way, and am not going to argue semantics with an anti-Semite). The Ritz's HR department is aware of the situation, and The Bastard has ongoing interpersonal disputes with just about everyone who works with him, not just me, which helps my case. I am told I have to \"trust the process.\" So I am, because The Ritz is a great company full of caring and competent higher-ups, and I do believe that they are doing what they can, it just really sucks to have to work with The Bastard in the meantime because nobody likes to be the target of seething, senseless ancestral hatred.\r\n* \u00a0 With that in mind, and knowing that I would have today off, yesterday after work I purchased a bottle of organic tequila, a lime, and some Sriracha chips and Had A Moment after putting the kids to bed. I am pleased to report that following my moment I slept for nearly twelve hours, which I really needed. Yay, sleep!\r\n* \u00a0 We had big plans for a family picnic today at our favorite park, but it doesn't look like the weather is going to cooperate. We're going to have an indoor picnic instead and see if we can all agree on a movie to watch (I keep hearing about Despicable Me? The boys have seen it with their father but don't mind re-watching movies).\r\n* \u00a0 My back has been doing rather better (knock wood), perhaps as a result of the better shoes? The Danskos do NOT hurt Paul, although I'm a little \"meh\" on them as a result of how unforgiving they seem and the way they MOVE on your feet (which the salesperson assured me is What They Are Supposed To Do). I'm withholding judgment until I've broken them in and gotten used to walking in them--the store where I got them has a 30-day satisfaction guarantee wherein you can return shoes for store credit, so if I decide to hate them I haven't just thrown away More Than I Have Ever Spent On Shoes, which is nice.\r\n* \u00a0 I've been lurking on eBay for a bit in search of smaller workout clothes (if you don't mind pre-owned, you can get the fancy moisture-wicking, non-chafing, brand-name workout clothing on eBay for what you'd pay for new, lower-quality stuff at a big box store, and I've found that chafing is an issue for me with the cheaper, low-tech gear with the amount of time I spend on the elliptical daily) (currently about 90 minutes--don't judge me, it's my way of coping with stress), and ran across something that has boggled my mind. Did you know that there are workout shorts for lady-persons with something called \"inseam compression\" built in? I find this worrisome and am hesitant to Google, but at the same time I'm pretty curious as to the \"why\" of it all (a Twitter friend suggested masochism as a reason for this feature). I don't have the slightest desire to compress my inseam. Do any of you know what the deal is with this?\r\n* \u00a0 Isis is deliriously happy to have gotten to spend so much time wallowing in bed with me.

I added a pair of gel insoles to them this morning, which cause my right foot to occasionally make the type of moistly squelchy\u00a0sound you'd expect to hear on a blooper roll from a porn film. I am not a fan of that sound, although the inserts themselves are pretty comfortable.\r\n* \u00a0 The contrast between my mood today (The Bastard is off, and it was just me and the person who trained me working today; we make a good team and The Trainer's lack of Bastardry is delightful) after work and yesterday prompted Hotter to inform me that I need to not let The Bastard get to me. \"Because then you bring your bad mood home with you. LEAVE WORK AT WORK.\" I sarcastically said I supposed he'd been GREAT at that (Hotter is a complainer by nature and used to have quite a temper so I was banking on him having sucked at it). He said he had, actually, mostly because he would drink heavily each night after work (Hotter used to be a totally different person before his transplants and stroke, and not necessarily one I would have liked). So I'm still open to input on how better to relax (besides keep upping my workouts--I'm already over the fifty-mile mark per week and don't think I can go up any further without it being ridiculous how long I spend at the gym each day and/or making my clothes fit funny--as it is I could wear a 6 in the waist but am sticking with an 8 because of my thighs) (I also do yoga two to four times per week, just throwing that out there as something I'm already doing).\r\n* \u00a0 GROCERIES! Man oh man, y'all, I used to HATE the grocery store, because I was constantly counting in my head, weighing whether to get this or this, if I buy that x will be happy but y won't eat it and then what, etc. Now I can get something everyone will eat, and buy things just because they look good and I think we might like to try them. Few things make me happier than bringing home a new kind of fruit or cheese for the boys to try. There is nothing like cutting open a perfect ripe apricot, pulling the pit out of it, and placing one half in each of Little Child's wee dimpled paws and seeing his face light up when he tastes it. We've discovered that everyone likes apricots, honeyloupes, and plums. Little Child and Big Child like feta, but only the plain kind; Big Child enjoys the herb-and-oil kind from the olive bar as much as I do but Little Child won't touch the stuff. Middle Child shares my love of all things spicy (Little Child won't touch spicy and Big Child will, but only up to a point). Hotter remains a slut for fancy coffee. Life is good.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/08/ouch-and-grr-and-groceries.html", "title": "ouch and grr and GROCERIES"},

The Bastard aside, it really is just SUCH a great place to work!\r\n* \u00a0 Tomorrow is another day. I left my feelings on the elliptical (well, more like \"I courteously wiped my feelings OFF the elliptical before leaving the YMCA\") and am not going to let The Bastard get me down. I am kind of turning into a workout-junkie, y'all. Endorphins: they're pretty great.\r\n* \u00a0 Not only is tomorrow Another Day, it's PAYDAY! Since I am all about spoiling myself, in addition to getting The MFA Beater inspected and the extraneous hairs ripped from my body, I think I'll switch back to Pristiq. Effexor is good at keeping me from being panicky and tearful, but I'm having some issues with having to turn pages in books three times instead of just once and touch cans a certain number of times before choosing one off a shelf and check my alarm eleventy-seven times before bed. And also I've found that it's kind of...hard to, er...find my own private Idaho lately, if you know what I mean. A dose increase might solve the former, but it would probably make the latter worse, and while neither of these things are insurmountable issues (I mean, I can still do my job and, ah, arrive at my final destination),\u00a0now that I am making a decent living and won't have to deprive anyone in the house of any necessities in order to get The Good Stuff, I think I'll go ahead and treat myself to the drug that works better for me with fewer side effects in a few days when my current bottle of Effexor runs out.\r\n* \u00a0 Lefty is back in jail, apparently.

Big Child, Middly, and I had the turkey salad for lunch; it was the first time Middly has ever willingly eaten anything of the sort (nobody tell him about the emm-aye-why-oh). Yay! There's nothing left on that poor bird but the wings and enough scraps for soup, and I'm already fantasizing about eating the wings later (I'm the only person in the house who enjoys parts of the turkey other than the breast, and have been feasting as a result).\u00a0Man, I love Thanksgiving turkey!\r\n* \u00a0 Know who else loves Thanksgiving leftovers? Skeeter. Hotter heated up slices of ham in some chicken broth for last night's dinner, and Skeeter found the pan and drank the broth. He then helped himself to both pumpkin and pecan pie all sneaky-like, and was shockingly bloated for the rest of the evening:\r\nFigure One:\u00a0I felt so bad for him! He was utterly unrepentant, and still tried to mug me for my bowl of Corn Chex shortly after this photo was taken.\r\n* \u00a0 Tomorrow I get to meet a friend and co-worker at Temp Agency #2, whose acquaintance I made through this humble blog. Since the whole Stalky debacle I've been leery of meeting any further innernet people (well, with the exception of Hotter I guess, HA!), but C is A Good Egg and I'm looking forward to visiting with her. Yay!\r\n* \u00a0 Because it can't ALL be good food, good friends, and funnies at the expense of the stupid gluttonous cat, I'm 90% certain the XY has lost his job. E-mails to his work address bounce, his work cell and landline are no longer his, and this would certainly explain his recent downward spiral in mental health and threats to stop paying the child support \"because you are unreasonable about visitation\" (meaning I've asked him to start returning the children on time and stop peeing in my yard). Oh, and the call I got from MFA Dentist's office asking if I knew why their claims for the boys' most recent cleanings and checkups had been rejected. Oyyy. The children were telling me their father spent $2,000 on electronics during visitation on Black Friday (they volunteered the information in the context of telling me what great deals he had told them he'd gotten--I do not ask them questions about their time with their father because that's not fair to them), so I'm guessing the insurance checks from his \"Jewish lightning\" housefire have come in? \u00a0Hopefully he saves a little something back to pay child support...that's due today and I'm really nervous. If he makes good on his threat to stop paying it'll be a grim holiday season here, and, well, a grim forseeable future. Because to even complain to a judge about lack of child support you have to hire a lawyer, and if I'm trying to feed everyone and make rent without child support I'm not going to be able to afford one. HO HO HO! MERRRRY FUCK-YOU!\r\n* \u00a0 On the bright side I didn't hear any negative feedback at work from my failed good deed of yesterday.

The bills are paid, the MFA Beater is inspected (IT PASSED!) and has a full tank of gas, and I walked into the grocery store after work like fucking ROYALTY and bought absolutely EVERYTHING we needed without running a tally as I went for the first time in MANY, MANY MOONS (and I still had enough left over to send a friend who is unemployed and struggling $25 without it causing us any undue hardship, because I have had people do that for me and I know how great a little unexpected windfall can be when you haz The Poor).

I'd say it's hell getting old but I've been that way since I was a teenager. This morning I went to morning yoga anyway, because I read that you're not supposed to hit the gym for at least twelve hours after getting a Brazilian, and it was one of those practices where I stood, laid, sat, and twisted on my mat hating every damn second of it (yep, that happens, albeit rarely). But as the instructor pointed out to someone who was new to the class, \"yoga is not just exercise, we come here to figure things out, and while pain means stop what you're doing, discomfort is an opportunity to practice the ways in which you handle stress.\"\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I then took Little Child to pick out a mattress. It's hilarious how different my children are. It once infamously took Big Child an hour and a half and a fit of tears to pick out a t-shirt for his birthday. Little Child walked into the mattress factory, glanced dispassionately through the showroom windows into the factory itself, and asked the salesman to show him the different floor models and whether he'd need to remove his shoes before trying them. He laid on each one for about 1.5 seconds, pointed to the most expensive model there, and said \"I'd like that one, please, it's the most comfortable one.\" He then requested that I take him to Subway and get him a turkey and veggie sub on whole wheat to eat while we waited for his father (see below). Bless his cotton socks! He's really not a brat, but just very aware of what he wants in the manner of a wee little opinionated geezer and I think it's adorable. Plus I STILL have not gotten tired of watching that boy eat (if you're new to these parts, Little Child spent the first five years of his life being fed via g-tube and had to learn to eat with his mouth).\r\n* \u00a0 The XY was kind enough to transport the mattress set for me with his truck.

The lone voice of reason was k, who said that on a scale of 0-OMG DON'T DO IT the pain was a 1.5. I'd mayyybe go as far as to rate it a 3 during the actual ripping itself, but that takes all of a second or so per strip. I'll definitely be doing that again, finances permitting, especially if it results in less chafing during my daily cardio!\r\n* \u00a0 Number of times I've slapped Hotter's hands since getting home an hour ago: 3 (you have to wait to do THAT until the follicles have closed, at least ten hours apparently, or you risk a skin infection)\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of risk, Lefty...oy.

I think he'll ultimately be convicted of a handful of felonies (possibly including attempted murder if the judge is unamused with him per a lawyer-friend of mine) and go away for A Long Time.

It may be connected to Lefty's recent shenanigans and Hotter's having talked to his mother recently (typically when he lashes out at me with some kind of pointless nonsensical nastiness it's after speaking to his family, which he doesn't do very often but did a couple of days ago, and/or after something major goes down with Lefty), but I'm not sure. Possibly it's something to do with our being broke for a couple of days until the first of the month (not, I should clarify, \"OMG BROKE\" or anything, but rather an easy, pantry- and gas-tank full, no immediate needs kind of \"just no great amount sitting in the bank account currently\" broke that maybe just reminds me of worse kinds of broke we've been in the not-too-distant past?). I don't THINK I've been glutenated, although the combination of my current unusual achiness (my lower back is VERY unhappy) and the persistent bad mood makes me wonder. It may even have to do with my having recently been on steroids, or the fact that Effexor doesn't work quite as well as Pristiq.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Whatever this is, my back hurts and I'm cranky and both of those things need to stop ASAP because life is pretty damned good over here for the most part and I'd prefer to go back to reveling in that.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/07/foreboding.html", "title": "foreboding"},

No? Just me?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Aaaaanyway, my back is feeling much better, or maybe it just SEEMS that way because my foot is really sore and suddenly deformed.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFigure One: Yes, I photo-edited my foot. I've never photo-edited my FACE, but then I don't have my father's face and I have his feet EXACTLY. I originally posted this photo on the Facespace, unedited, from The Precious, and then one of my friends pointed out how unfortunate-looking my feet are, because my friends are dicks. Dicks who all seem to think I have gout. Then I opened up the photo from my laptop and wanted to die.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I seriously doubt it's gout (heh). Because I eat almost none of the things on the \"stuff to avoid\" list for gout, and the ones I do eat I eat rarely and in small amounts. Also, I get plenty of Vitamin C (I take it daily as studies have shown that doing so may help prevent degenerative changes in my type of connective tissue disease). But I suppose it's possible, as I'm a lifelong outlier. If it's not gout I think it's most likely a bunion, which wouldn't make a ton of sense either (I don't wear heels and while I have loose joints and a job that requires me to be constantly on my feet, that's not a new thing), but who the hell knows.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In other news, my new work pants arrived today (arrived because I buy all of my clothes second-hand from eBay). I've been wearing the last pair of Dickies I bought for work at the Hotel California all this time, even though they were already too big when I got the job at The Ritz, because money. They were size 12s, and I remember being super-happy when I bought them, because that was a size down. My new pair are 8s. They're too big. The good news is, they're only a size or two too big, so I'll still look way less ridiculous than I have in recent weeks (it actually wasn't THAT bad, since I wear a bistro-length apron as part of my work uniform--I gathered the \"pleats\" at the front, secured them with a belt, and tied my apron over the whole shebang--STEALTHY). So I'm looking forward to being considerably less lumpy about the waist tomorrow at work.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And finally: you know you've worked too many days straight when you get to your car after a shift and go to unlock it by swiping your Micros card down the crack of the door (I didn't actually stick it in--I said stick it in--but I did go so far as to hold it out toward the Beater and stare blankly, and that's bad enough).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That's all the news from here.

He was two hours late and brought the children back half an hour early, meaning that he only took ninety minutes of the time he has gotten with the MFA Children for the past two weeks. Between being upset about Not Following The Routine, eating dinner late, and being returned early like three hot potatoes, the boys were not their most fabulous selves when they got home. I hustled the younger two MFA Children into the tub while Big Child worked on his homework, which he kept not doing, electing instead to yell the odd contribution to the conversation I was trying to have with the younger ones or ask at a bellow for us to repeat ourselves. \u00a0\u00a0 Big Child not only has both his parents' ADD, but is also the nosiest child alive and a world-class buttinski who can't help but interject his two cents, by force if necessary, whether they are wanted or not. Because I was refereeing a bathtub turf-war and, as usual, lecturing people about what not to do with their penises, the best I could do was bellow back dire threats as to what I would do if Big Child didn't get his danged homework done by the time I was done in the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0 When I brought the (scrubbed, clothed) younger two boys out into the family room, Hotter had found my mouthguard (which costs as much as a month and half of my health insurance, is not covered under same, and had been missing for a couple of weeks to my detriment), and I thanked him profusely. \u00a0\u00a0 \"WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THANK YOU TO HOTTER FOR AND WHAT WAS IN THE FRUIT BOWL?

I really needed to catch up on sleep, and nine and a half months in it is STILL a treat having a second adult in the house who is able and willing to wrangle small boys while Mama is lazy!\u00a0\u00a0 What was considerably LESS awesome was realizing that I'd gotten up twelve minutes before the end of pickup hour at our local Angel Food Ministries distribution site and thinking I'd just blown over eighty dollars in grocery money. If be \"less awesome\" you mean \"totally took ten years off my life.\" Fortunately I can get there in six minutes, and while the volunteers may have been traumatized by seeing me greasy-faced and braless, they graciously held the order (Hotter called ahead) and even asked me if I'd like a few extra items that hadn't been claimed (does the Pope eat kittens?). So I came home with this:\r\n Figure One: The bean burritos will come in handy if the boys act up; lately I actually threatened to fart on some heads. Yeah.and this:\r\n Figure Two: These look much nicer than what is pictured; they're restaurant-style chicken tenders, like you would expect to get as an appetizer at Applebee's or T.G.I. Friday's, the kind of varying widths and thicknesses with the thick breading. Mmm...and this:\r\n  Figure Three: We ended up getting the second combination pictured.\u00a0\u00a0 I actually lucked out, in that since a couple of people did NOT make it in time, the volunteers asked if anyone there wanted some extra items that wouldn't fit in the church freezer. So I also got a frozen Tombstone-sized supreme pizza, a two-pound packet of frozen smoked sausages, a one-pound bag of frozen corn, and a whole frozen chicken for free!\u00a0\u00a0 I can't say enough good things about Angel Food Ministries, y'all, I really can't. Money is very tight here right now what with the dog's mange-related vet bills on top of Hotter's immunosuppressant meds (yes, he has Medicare, which is awesome, but we pay twenty percent of the cost of transplant-related prescription drugs out of pocket and that's still a lot) and our usual household expenses, and I haven't gotten paid yet for the contract writing-type work I'm doing (the check's not late or anything, but the client pays portions of the contract amount as I complete the work and I just finished a big chunk of stuff). \u00a0\u00a0 This is pretty much our groceries for the month, aside from stuff like milk, bread, sammich components, condiments, and school snack items, and as I've mentioned before it's better-quality stuff than you generally get by doing The Grocery Game, The Home Version (yes, I have done a free trial of The Grocery Game proper, and it's a really cool service but I can do just as well without it--if you're new to poverty or not actually poor but just trying to save money I'd recommend it, bargain-hunting is just second nature to me since I grew up poor and did the single mother with deadbeat ex-husband thing for a while). I did run into my first taste of evangelism this month at the AFM host site, but they weren't tacky about it, just said something casually as I was standing there waiting on the volunteers to get my order together, and dropped it gracefully when I said we were non-practicing Jews (and in fact when they offered me the extra items the lady took that into account and gave me a couple of options, pointing out that the pizza toppings contained some pork, and that was thoughtful of her). I don't mind that kind of thing, as I realize that evangelism is part of some faiths; it's the kind who are pushy and/or ad hominem about other belief systems (or my lack thereof) who make me twitchy.

That's okay though, I got out the clippers and was all \"HAPPY ARBOR DAY, MOTHERFUCKER!\" So the tree paid too.*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I also sorely tested our marriage assembled a 7x12-foot chain link enclosure together for the chickens. This thing was a bad project for two people who \"don't work well with others\" to tackle together designed by morons. \r\n\r\n Figure Three: This started out as a big box containing a bunch of poles, a roll of chain-link \"fabric\" and a couple of bags of mounting hardware. Divorce attorneys not included.The too-effing-small tarp for the top and bag of flimsy zipties for that came separately as well. Also you can't really tell from the picture, but there is chain link above where the roof of the coop meets up with the open doorway so the chickens can't get out and nothing else can get in. *\u00a0\u00a0 All sniping and pot-shots aside, I really felt bad for Hotter. He knows a lot more about putting things together and using tools than I do, but since he had a stroke shortly after his transplants I am the physically stronger and more mechanically-inclined one of us. This probably makes it painful for him to try and assist me and my ADD in assembling things because I go off half-cocked and proceed to kill myself doing things wrong and he knows exactly where I'm screwing up but can't take over. Plus apparently I don't take feedback well in the heat of the moment. Things were said by both of us, there was a lot of \"your mom\" smack-talk, and we can't even have make-up sex on the dining room table because the XY canceled his visitation on short notice AGAIN (third time in a row, not that I'm counting, oh, wait...). Boo.*\u00a0\u00a0 At least the chickens seem a lot happier:\r\n  Figure Four: They're so thrilled with the extra room that maybe they'll even lay some damn eggs!*\u00a0\u00a0 The dog is getting huge. Hotter still picks her up in his arms sometimes but now she looks like a freaking goat that he's carrying around. Or possibly a calf?\r\n Figure Five: Hey man, nice goat.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f477203a970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013487972ee7970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f4772c29970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401348797457a970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f47743a3970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/what-were-up-to-here-with-pictures.html", "title": "what we're up to here (with pictures)"},

Maybe y'all don't do this. Good for you! I do, because I have ceased to care what the cashiers there think of me (although when we had WIC and food stamps I always made a point of dressing up and doing my hair because...well I guess I wanted to avoid snap judgments? Now that I'm working and paying my own way, however, it's somehow more okay with me to look like a walking Southern stereotype) (that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but welcome to my brain when I have a fever and am mixing over-the-counter uppers and downers).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ANNNNNYWAY.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I should've known better than to tape a metaphorical \"kick-me\" sign to my back like that, because naturally after I bought a loaf of bread (yes, I'm THAT SICK--we haven't eaten store-bought bread in ages and the MFA Children are making no attempts to hide their disdain) the MFA Minivan wouldn't effing start. I turned the key a second and a third time, all hopeful-like, but got nothing except the impotent clicking of the starter. Eff.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Fortunately I carry an extra-long set of jumper cables at all times, because yes, I have AAA but that's just a dumb use of one of the service calls from the account and I drive a teenaged vehicle with a battery older than at least one of my children. I had no trouble finding a nice young clerk to come out and give me a jump, which worked beautifully on the first try, so it's just the battery, which is good news (beats the starter or the alternator) but not GREAT news in that I think it's been fading lately and probably I need a new one and the MFA Minivan alREADY needs a new headlight and probably won't get it until Febuary or so (I just don't drive the thing at night).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I see how it is, Universe. Hate to burst your bubble, but I'm already hating life and cursing the holidays, so you didn't really bring me down much (not that I'm suggesting you get smite-happy, just saying you'd be wasting more of both our time if you did).

A trainer took Hotter aside when he took Isis out for a post-Banfield pee-trot while I settled up with the desk and pointed out that she could damage her trachea, so I consulted my go-to dog expert, who suggested a new type of collar, which turned Isis into a Whole New Dog.

Also, he only lets me snuggle him when he's sick, and while I'd rather he was healthy it's nice to get some cuddles in.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child and Little Child were fine, so Hotter got their breakfast and picked their clothes out while I rubbed Middle Child's back until he stopped heaving (this took a while--the poor kid is almost never sick but when he is it's brutal), and got their shoes on while I gave Midde Child a dose of Zofran (which we always have plenty of in this house due to two people with gastroparesis) and some Tylenol and installed him in a blanket-nest in the recliner. When a child here is truly sick (as in, too sick to want to play games or watch a movie) I drape their bedspread over their resting-spot of choice and make a nice \"nest,\" which I think makes them feel cared-for and comfy but ALSO protects my leather furniture (win!), and Middle Child has been asleep since I tucked him in almost three hours ago. I've found that it's usually best to let Middle Child sleep things off, because he's pretty much immune to Zofran (yes, I gave him some anyway, because I suppose it could always be worse if I didn't, but he's the only one here who doesn't stop barfing after a dose of that stuff) and he's got some time before we need to worry about dehydration. I think Little Child has made me a much more relaxed parent to sick children; not only can I calculate the fluid volume a child needs by weight to avoid an IV (less than you might think), but I can also judge when a kid is nowhere near needing an IV and it's okay to leave them the eff alone and Middle Child is currently safe to leave the eff alone.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 But now I have a headache, and Hotter (who went back to bed after the school-bound boys left) is rather warm.

So I sent Hotter inside to take a pie out of the oven for me, and while he was doing that I heard a loud exhalation that sounded equine in nature, looked up, and there was the Old Spice man.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, so it wasn't actually him but it was a good-looking black dude on a horse and instead of saying \"I'm on a horse\" he asked me what kind of chickens those were (the MFA Flock was out foraging). Apparently dude's grandma lives at the end of the dirt road off our street, and the local fire station lets him park his trailer and ride from there, and I was so excited to see a horse (I miss my horses, y'all) that I asked if I could run in and get my kids.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The children were impressed with the horse, and the guy rode into our driveway and unclipped the bit from his trail bridle so we could give the horse some apples and carrots (except for Middle Child, who after getting bitten by a horse over at the XY's is afraid to feed them), and the horse immediately took an ENORMOUS crap in my driveway.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I think that's probably the only time the guy who owned the horse has ever seen someone be tickled to death that his horse crapped on their property. I mean yeah, I wanted some manure for the compost pile, but pretty much the last words out of my mouth had been to wish for horse manure. Wow.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So yeah, I'm going to have great compost next year, but it's too bad I didn't wish for a new minivan.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/if-wishes-were-horses-then-that-would-explain-a-lot-about-yesterday.html", "title": "if wishes were horses then that would explain a lot about yesterday"},

Paul the rooster had arrived on the early truck. Apparently there was ice on the wings in Oakland (Paul is a West Coast bird, which explains why my hens are all out there throwing gang signs) and the USPS won't fly live animals if it's that cold (which makes sense) so he was delayed. The West Coast ground crew reports that the Post Office here called them at 4:45 Pacific Time to report that Paul had arrived and they were getting ready to deliver him, which is at least half a damn lie, because Hotter and I had to go and pick him up, but oh well. We didn't want the poor bird sitting around the Post Office all day waiting for the mailman to bring him!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 When we got to the Post Office everything was all nice and normal for about two minutes, then--\r\nCOCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Excellent! Mr. Aeropostale, who had been so mortified when my Barred Rock chicks came in last year, came out to the counter and I greeted him with \"You finally found my cock!\" He blushed deepest magenta, but admitted that \"we've been making those jokes all morning!\" While I signed for the package, Paul continued crowing his head off, and it echoed around the Post Office impressively. All of the employees seemed pretty tickled and said that Paul was very pretty and seemed friendly.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This is the only picture you get until he's in better shape, because poor Paul has had a rough go of it--he started out as one of a few very pampered chicks in an upscale neighborhood, but was then confiscated by the local SPCA for being a rooster in the suburbs and got most of his wacky head feathers plucked by aggressive birds at the pound. Then he went from there to this box where he was stuck for two days:\r\n Figure One: This is the rather dark and blurry picture I snapped with my Blackberry the moment we had Paul in our possession and shared on the Facespace, so that the West Coast crew could stop worrying. Paul is a Polish Chicken, and kind of reminds me of Albert Einstein.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I wasn't really looking\u00a0for a rooster, per se,\u00a0but Hotter and I had tossed the idea around some (hens are supposed to lay better with a rooster about). The main drawback, in our minds, is that a lot of roosters are ornery sons-of-bitches that'll attack kids, dogs, etc. and we didn't want an aggressive bird that the boys couldn't be around. Apparently Paul was very good friends with the small son of his previous owners, though, and several people vouched for his personality to me on the Facespace, so we decided to take him in. So far he seems very tame, although we'll see how he is when he's recovered from his USPS ordeal (he was a bit wobbly when he first came out of the box, and crowing like mad, but soon found the feed and water and settled down). And EVERY SINGLE HEN laid today--something that doesn't happen very often.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I love a happy ending!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834014e601602ca970c-pi", "http://www.mypetchicken.com/chicken-breeds/Polish-B91.aspx"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/03/the-one-where-my-mailman-finds-my-cock.html", "title": "the one where my mailman finds my cock"},

I mucked out the henhutch and chickenyard, spread crushed oyster shell in the mucky spots of the chickenyard, scattered fresh straw and re-bedded the henhutch, added fresh cedar trimmings and mint sprigs to the bedding in the henhutch to discourage pests, layered in a new compost heap with the happy straw from the henhutch and chickenyard, mowed the sideyard and far back with the mulching bag on and added fresh greens to the compost, then went inside and canned for a while.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I put up a crockpot full of local MFApplesauce, several jars of organic refrigerator dills (spears and chips), a jar of spicy pickled carrots just for the heck of it, and made a local, organic apple pie from scratch with a woven crust. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I would've made bread today but the danged hens only gave us three eggs today (they've spoiled us for a while with four and I expected at least one more) and Hotter used two in meatloaf and I've got some organic bananas and lemons so I'm doing banana nut bread with the third. Tomorrow we'll pick up that stupid light setup and hopefully they'll start producing more, and after we get home with that there'll be at least enough eggs for baking.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 George and the Araucanas are starting to acclimate, although they still hide a lot and get dominated. I go out a couple of times a day and feed them by hand to ensure that they're getting enough. They've finally realized that walnuts and flaxseed-oil hen mash are good eating, and scratch in the straw for apple and carrot peelings like the Barred Rocks. The chickens have eaten the tops of my winter spuds twice now despite my mulching them thickly with straw and are grounded unless I have an eye on them, the mothercluckers. All of them will cut you for a strawberry.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I obviously didn't go vegan just yet. I'm still working on figuring out carbs and protein and have an e-mail in to my endocrinologist, because I don't want to do anything that'll upset my blood sugar levels but also don't want to go \"Atkins\"/South Beach-esque because that actually sets you up to be MORE insulin resistant (after your body comes out of ketosis, which is what damages the organs most in diabetes, and how Hotter ended up with aftermarket parts).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The dog is doing well. Today I gave her a thorough scrubbing with homemade sea-salt, coconut oil, organic lemon juice, mashed mint from the garden, minced garlic, and lavendar oil (just a tad). I really worked it into her skin and she sat down and thumped her foot in the water a little. After a thorough rinse and towel-drying, I got a LOT of dead fur out with the Furminator and she looks much better. Her coat is coming back nicely and I'll try to get pictures tomorrow if the sun cooperates.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 My face is on the mend! I remembered what our favorite pediatrician once told me about Mupirocin (that it penetrates 1/4-inch below the skin if you LEAVE IT ON and keep it covered, and kills most MRSA) and this morning scrubbed my face with Dead Sea salt-scrub, dried it with a rough towel, and really debrided the wound. All of the top layer of skin was dead and sloughed off, leaving an area the size of a dime that is raw and bloody, but clean. I applied pressure with a sterile bar towel, then slathered it with Mupirocin again and left it alone all day. Now it's healthy and pink, and if I let it dry it would crack and bleed, but as long as I keep it slathered with Mupirocin it doesn't even sting. I think I've avoided the need for medical attention, which is good, because we're still broke.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of YOU?

BBQ Sauce\r\n1 c. ketchup (I buy store-brand when it's on sale if we're poor, Heinz Organic at the local big-box store if we're less-poor, depending)1/2 large sweet onion, diced up small2 tbsp red wine vinegar2 cloves garlic, finely minced1 small banana pepper (like, thumb-sized, or you can use a jalapeno if you want to make it really hot), deseeded and also finely minced\u00a01 tbsp extra virgin olive oil1 tbsp Shebangarang!2 tsp honey\u00a01/4 tsp black pepper3 drops \"liquid smoke\" flavoring\u00a0\r\nPut the EVOO and onions in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to clarify. Add the garlic and banana pepper and keep stirring until the garlic begins to brown (don't overdo it or it'll be bitter). As soon as you see the first hint of brown on the garlic, add the rest of the ingredients and simmer until it coats the back of a spoon nicely. This was makes enough to coat an entire picked chicken's worth of meat (if it's a backyard-raised chicken, so probably only the breastmeat of a store-bought roaster), which is dinner and leftovers at my house.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/08/shebangarang-bbq-sauce.html", "title": "Shebangarang!

I say apparently because I honestly didn't notice at the time; I was driving to work, and thought the MFA Minivan had shit the bed on me. When I heard that it had been an earthquake, I was relieved. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Hotter felt the 'quake and thought he was having a seizure until Little Child asked if he'd felt it. So he was relieved, too. We're strange people here.\r\n* \u00a0 Insurancegate is over! Or will be tomorrow (or Friday at the latest) when a PayPal transfer hits my bank account and I call Anthem. I...well, there's a reason more than one person in my life has threatened to make me wear a neck sign like Sandra Bullock in 28 Days (her character was in rehab and a therapist made her wear a sign around her neck reading \"Confront me if I don't ask for help\"). A reader of this humble site did just that a while back when we were really struggling, and offered me a generous loan. At the time I wasn't sure whether the XY was going to pay the restitution funds he owed me or not, and wasn't sure when or if I'd be able to pay back that kind of money, and said thanks but no thanks. Currently I know I'll have the funds as of the first of the month, and so I asked her if she was still willing to make me a (slightly smaller) loan, to be repaid in eight days, and just like that the nightmare was over. Thank you, friend-who-I-haven't-asked-if-I-can-name. Not worrying about losing my health insurance (and the dental benefits!) is an unbelievable relief and a wonderful feeling, but having someone I could call on like that is an even better one. I've said it before and I'll say it again: you people are like the extended family I lack offline (yes, even YOU Stalky--my family of origin had some loons in it that put you to shame!).\r\n* \u00a0 I have spent the past two days working. It was a very temporary temp-gig, just yesterday and today, wherein I helped a designer and their assistant furnish and decorate a model home for an upscale neighborhood. SO. FREAKING. COOL. We walked into an empty house with nothing but paint on the walls and two days later it looked like a very tidy, affluent family with impeccable taste was going to get home any minute. Also, how many people can honestly say they were paid handsomely by the hour to set up a Monopoly game and hot-glue all of the pieces in place (apparently people will knock over or pocket the pieces otherwise)? I wish I could show you pictures of some of the beautiful rooms (or heck, even the pretty piece of wall-art the designer gifted me when they couldn't find a good spot for it in the model), but I wouldn't want to potentially \"out\" myself to the client, who was so pleased with my work that they said they'd specifically request me the next time they're in town.\r\n* \u00a0 You know how I always talk about how \"chickens are not nice?\" Well, guess what? NEITHER ARE TURKEYS. Yesterday Hotter and I were outside looking at the mid-sized turkey, which is the nicest of the three (the little one is a menace to society, and y'all know how Loud and Crazy is). The turkey was looking at us from behind the chain-link (they really do look gentle and even intelligent when they look you in the eye, which is totally deceptive) and I was saying \"Awww look at the mid-sized turkey. I dunno if I can kill that one, look at the way she's looking at us!\" and Hotter was like \"what, all doe-eyed?\" and reached his finger into the fence. \"Yeah, she's ni--\" BLAM! The mid-sized turkey bit the everloving HELL out of Hotter's finger! \"HOLY SHIT THAT HURTS!\" he bellowed. Turkeys are REALLY not nice, y'all. It's a good thing they're delicious.\r\n* \u00a0 Hurricane coming. Ugh. Thanks to the loan from that reader, I was able to use a little of the money currently in our bank account to purchase several three-gallon containers of spring water (our water comes from a well, which means that if the power goes out we have no water), and I plan to fill the tub before the storm hits for flushing the toilet with, but that'll only get us and the MFA Menagerie through one day. The last time a hurricane kicked our arses in this area the way Irene is threatening to some folks didn't have power for over a week! I'm hoping it misses us, for all of the above reasons and also because closer to the date of the storm if the news tells us we're going to get thoroughly thrashed Hotter and I are going to have to drag one of the 8x12 chain-link pens we keep the poultry in into the garage. Because I don't think the chickens, ducks, and turkeys ought to be out in it if there are 100 mph winds. And I would rather NOT have to clean up after THAT.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1075547648/tt0191754"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/08/aaaand-im-back.html", "title": "aaaand I'm back"},

Unfortunately the health insurance thing was waiting for me afterward, and it's still not good, and I'd say there's maaaaybe a 25% chance I can fix it (my original estimates right up until squinting at the bank account a few minutes ago were much more optimistic, but I have to buy some gas to get to work today and tomorrow). But literally at the last minute (the 31st--IF Temp Agency #1 pays me on Tuesday or Wednesday for the work I'm doing for them today and tomorrow, which they generally--USUALLY--do, although technically they have until Friday to do so). So I'm a big ball of stress.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Also apparently there's a hurricane coming. Which doesn't particularly scare me, as I've weathered plenty of those before, but if we lose our fridge we're fucked. Completely and utterly FUCKED. And as with everything else there's not a damned thing I can do except worry. So...yeah.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If I lose the insurance I can replace it before I would have been uninsured for 60 days, but what I couldn't replace would be the dental policy, which took eighteen months of continuous coverage to kick in, and that would put fixing That Tooth completely out of my reach as opposed to just MOSTLY, and I won't lie, I'd be really, really bitter about that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It might be for the best if I take a little break from here until this is settled one way or the other, because I'm probably not going to have anything very entertaining to say.

{"date": "August 26, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 This morning I woke from a bad dream where I was trying to leave the XY all over again (Little Child was a baby on my hip again, and very sick again, and his g-tube, which in the dream was the original pull-PEG, was venting copiously, which it hasn't in ages...also the XY was telling me that I couldn't leave him because I was too stupid to get through life on my own, for example today I had traffic court but would I know that without him to tell me? Nooooo) at dawn and ran to pull up the local court's website. Sure enough, I DID have traffic court this morning and had forgotten all about it! I was awake in plenty of time to get ready though, and got the last of the tickets from the expired registration dismissed. Perhaps my ex-husband is my new spirit animal? Oy.\r\n* \u00a0 I saw my divorce attorney at court and we exchanged pleasantries. That was kind of weird.\r\n* \u00a0 My kids are so excited about the hurricane that last night I finally gave them a Mason jar full of heavy whipping cream with a couple of marbles in and set them to making butter by taking turns shaking the jar just to wear their energy out a little. They crapped out when it was still just whipped cream and I had to take over, the little slackers, but seriously this creates the best damn butter you will ever taste and I highly recommend it.\r\n* \u00a0 Last night I ate too much at dinner but it was soooo good. Hotter made his famous potroast, which is unbelievably delicious, and I made fresh bread rolls that came out of the oven right as we were sitting down, plus we had the fresh butter (which is delightfully spreadable) to put on the rolls and for dessert, homemade strawberry ice cream.\r\n* \u00a0 Temp Agency #1 called today; they gave me a job on Monday that should take one hour or less, but I get paid for four hours because the contract is a four-hour minimum, plus the job pays 40% more per hour than I usually make. I'm basically going to be someone's stand-in at an important business meeting, like when royalty used to marry from a distance and they'd send a proxy to ceremonially \"consummate\" the deal by touching thighs with the person they were marrying. This tickles me to no end.\r\n* \u00a0 At this point, I think the MFA Children are going to be devastated if we don't get to eat shelf-stable foods warmed over Sterno cans for at least one meal. If you're reading this from anywhere along the Eastern seaboard, are YOU prepared for the hurricane? Don't forget a manual can-opener and a lighter for the Sterno cans in your hurricane kit! Honestly I think half the reason the boys are so excited is that we don't generally eat most of the canned and processed foods I bought in order to be prepared for Irene (Chef Boyardee ravioli, Handi Snacks, boxes of shelf-stable chocolate milk, etc.) because I consider them to be junkfood. Someone who shall remain nameless spent a good portion of yesterday evening dancing around the house chanting \"CHILI-MAC! CHILI-MAC!\"\r\n* \u00a0 This slays me:\r\n Figure One: Yes, I know, some folks have cracks in their foundations and are NOT AMUSED, and the Washington Monument is damaged, etc. but I don't think Japan and Christchurch feel overly sorry for us right now, is all I'm sayin'.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://babblin-brooke.com/2011/07/19/homemade-butter/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834015434d9d5de970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/08/pre-hurricane-miscellaney.html", "title": "pre-hurricane miscellaney"},
{"date": "March 25, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I keep trying not to write about this, because nobody likes a whiner, but it's not going away. It being the question of what the hell we're going to do about the month of April.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I sort of mentioned this a little while ago; the orginal three Bad Things. One I already told y'all about. The second I wrote about on Hopeful Parents. The third has to do with Hotter's side of the ledger and isn't mine to talk about, but it reduced our income by somewhere between things the first and second and, well, crap. I mean, any ONE of these things would have been bad, but we could have tightened our belts and been okay. Any two of them would have been pretty effing alarming but ultimately surmountable. All three though, not so much, and then...well, then came thing the fourth. Which I don't mind telling you has to do with my bastardous exhusband (who owes me a LOT of money, like we're talking the upper four figures, from marital assets he seized and liquidated in the early days of our separation and then got an extension on paying off in the finalization of our divorce) declaring bankruptcy. Domestic obligations (which this debt evidently falls under) are \"protected debt,\" and when I spoke to the XY's bankruptcy attorney she told me I'd still get the money, just not on the schedule in the court order. The XY has since informed me that he just refuses to pay it on the schedule his attorney promised, and yes, this is enforceable BUT ONLY IF I take him to court, which I can't afford (the way our case is set up, I have to have an attorney file things for me; I can't just go as a citizen and file a damned thing on my own). So uh...yeah. Kiss THAT goodbye.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I am at a loss here. Hotter's disability and the child support will cover rent, electricity, and either my health insurance, my prescription drugs, OR groceries, but not more than one of those three things. If I don't have the prescriptions, my health will go downhill rapidly. If I don't have the insurance, I can't afford the prescriptions. And food...well, obviously that's non-negotiable as well. I've been working odd jobs, and am scheduled to work for twelve hours tomorrow, which is awesome. The second place I'll be getting odd jobs from doesn't have anything until April fifteenth,\u00a0which isn't going to help us survive the first part of the month. The freelance-y thing petered out, although I've put out more feelers. And finally, while I've applied to every single job I am even REMOTELY qualified for in the local \"help wanteds\" and online via various jobsearch sites, I keep either getting form rejections right off the bat or interviews that end in my being told I'm overqualified based on my education.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 That is really demoralizing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Morale aside, though, we've passed the point where if I got a job RIGHTNOW the first paycheck would come in time to save our arses in the first part of April. We've downsized everywhere we can, saved money every way we can think of (ordering from Angel Food Ministries, etc.)...hell, the last time Hotter and I ate out it was because I won a Burger King gift card from this blog-giveaway thingy. We don't see movies in the theater, we don't have cable, my kids don't participate in any extra-curricular activities...this is all fine with me, it just peeves me that it's not enough to be REALLY REALLY frugal and apply for every job in the classifieds.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I don't mind living very simply, but I do mind what this situation is turning me into. I hate that I cringe when my kids come home excited about a new field trip their class is going on and am jealous of people who are eligible for unemployment.\u00a0I'm becoming a bitter freaking downer; a friend posted something about this family who were living on unemployment and fighting to keep their home on Facebook and mentioned that she'd gotten their mailing information if anyone else wanted to help out a couple of weeks ago, and I said something bitter about not being particularly moved because these people were better off than my family, then erased it because nobody wants to see that, but at the same time, in the past month I have had my car insurance canceled, my innernet shut off (which made me late in getting a sponsored post up and threw me into an utter panic because for most of the jobs I've applied for I put e-mail as my preferred method of contact), I'm driving around in a car with one headlight, and I'm typing this on a laptop that'll die if the cord comes unplugged because the battery is dead. Currently we're making do without a working vacuum cleaner because SOMEthing happened to the power cord and I can't afford a roll of electric tape and a utility knife. It's hard not to talk about something that colors your life to this extent. Today my kids had a \"Jammies for Japan\" event at their school where they got to wear pajamas if they brought in at least a dollar for the Red Cross. I sent them each in with a dollar, and I am proud to say that they all emptied their piggy banks as well; I'm not proud to say that I begrudged the victims of the Japan disaster that three dollars out of my wallet (which represented thirty percent of what we have to get to the end of the month) and inwardly cursed because I'd been planning to raid those piggy-banks for milk money next week.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not telling y'all this for any reason other than I am tired of dancing around it. Please don't feel like I'm asking you to get involved in any way, because I'm not. It's just what's on my mind right now. I'm going to go on down to the local Social Services office on Monday and see if there's anything they can do, and hopefully they can help because my kids are starting to worry and I'm out of other ideas. If y'all have any ideas for ways to get work that I might not have thought of already, I'm all ears. I know that this too shall pass (slow and painful, like a kidney stone); I should have a lot more work starting next month as wedding and graduation celebrations ramp up and our garden will start to yield some produce. I'm just not sure how we'll get from here to there.\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. I'm sticking comments back on moderation for a bit (yeah, I took them off again earlier today before I decided to write this post) because if Stalky wants to carry on about how this is all my fault and richly deserved, she has Twitter for that.

Last night we carried all twenty-two squawking chickens and the three turkeys across the yard and put them inside (we put a small portable enclosure inside the shed to keep the turkeys separate). Today they all seem to be eating and drinking well, and even laying (I brought half a dozen eggs inside just now!). Neither of the windows in the shed are facing into the storm, so I think they'll be nice and safe (and it's good that they have enough light to see the food and water by).\r\n* \u00a0 Up until a few minutes ago I could honestly say that Big Child's comforter was our worst hurricane damage (the stir-crazy dogs went bananas and de-stuffed it), but just now a huge limb fell in the front yard. It didn't hit anything, so that's good.\r\n* \u00a0 The XY e-mailed me asking me to have the MFA Children call him. I e-mailed him back that authorities had asked everyone to forgo using phone lines unless it was an emergency, and could it wait? He said no, and since a close relative of his has been in poor health I went ahead and had the boys call him. But there was no emergency, he just wanted to alarm them with his panic-stricken shrilling of \"DON'T WORRY! YOU'RE PROBABLY SAFE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE WITH MOMMY! I'LL COME GET YOU IF IT GETS BAD!\" So now the children are freaking out that he'll show up and try to take them out in the storm. THANKS, ASSHOLE! I assured them that that isn't going to happen (and it won't, because if the jackass shows up I won't open the damn door). Seriously, dude, WHY?

I calmly and quickly grabbed a spare and a syringe full of water, deflated the old button the rest of the way, and replaced it with a new one. Believe it or not this is only the second time in over five years of Little Child's having a g-tube that something like this has happened (the other time it was a faulty balloon that emptied all the way spontaneously, causing the button to just FALL OUT). Hotter was dancing around in the background as I worked, holding a spare one of everything I was using and chanting \"I'mSOgladyou'rehomeI'mSOgladyou'rehome!\" Heh. Poor Little Child was so traumatized by the whole thing (it was probably pretty ouchy, but I think it mostly just freaked him the eff out, y'know?) that I came up with a new ritual on the spot: I buy Little Child's used tubes off him for a buck (my kids will do chores for nickels and dimes, so a whole buck at once is a BIG HAIRY DEAL). The other two MFA Children were jealous and wanted to know what I'd buy of of them. \"Y'all don't have tubes. Nothing to buy,\" I said. \"YEAH!\" Little Child gloated. \"NO FAIR!\" the older two whined. \"Life's not fair, boys,\" I noted. Oy.\r\n* \u00a0 I lost fifteen bucks in cash at Soulless Corporate Megalith; it was in my pocket and I got bumped by a co-worker and then it was gone. I know who it was, but what am I going to do, accuse them? Probably there was a camera on us at the time but mehhh. I kind of had to laugh a little, because it's only like, THIS WEEK that that fifteen bucks won't break us (don't get me wrong, I'm bummed, but WOW how lucky with the timing and hey look we're not killing chickens anymore because there are groceries! WHOO!).\r\n* \u00a0 The turkeys are getting BIG. I had to clip their wings again because one of them kept getting out somehow and the only spot it could have fit OUT of was at the top of the roof of that enclosure. There's one I'm SURE is a tom (ugh) and one that I'm SURE is a girl-turkey (hen?) and one that is either a very small, effeminate tom (???) or a very large, butch girl-turkey (hen, I'm just going to call them hens unless one of y'all knows a breed-specific term I'm unaware of?). I guess we'll find out eventually!\r\n* \u00a0 Oh, some things we call the poultry, in no particular order, because we're silly people:\u00a0\r\nChuzzards - full-grown chickens, from chicken + buzzard. Because they love meat, duh.Chuzz-nuggets - juvenile chickensChic-tacs - the silver-laced Wyandottes, because they're extra-tinyThe Turducken Collective - Hotter noted that he felt it was important we use inclusive language to acknowledge the turkeys' poultryhood, or something. I think he's getting mushy over those stupid turkeys. We're totally eating at least ONE of them mofos, Hotter!\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter woke me up well before I needed to be awake (think four hours), allegedly because he NEEDED a prescription and wanted to make sure the pharmacy wasn't closed. \"At five p.m.?\" I asked. \"It's a weekday.\" \"I COULDN'T TAKE A CHANCE!\" he insisted. \"Why, what drug am I picking up,\" I asked, feeling around for my keys in a half-stupor and also confused because I thought he had full bottles of both immunosuppressants and his seizure pills. \"Nexium.\" I stopped and goggled at him. \"BLEEDING ULCERS, I'LL GET BLEEDING ULCERS, AND MY PEE WILL TURN RED FROM THE BLOOD AND DR. KIDNEY WILL PUT ME IN THE HOSPITAL,\" he said, histrionically. \"THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE, DUDE, WHAT THE HELL?\" And y'all, he looked at me with pity and asked me where pee came from. \"Your kidney,\" I replied. \"Yes, and before that? Where does the stuff you DRINK come from,\" he continued, as if he was being very patient with someone very simpled-minded. \"Most liquid is absorbed through the large intestine?\" \"WHATEVER, THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE STOMACH, RIGHT?\" And then my head exploded.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Yes, he probably WAS screwing with me (I HOPE) but now we're back to \"woke me up way early because he was lonely\" which, while sweet, OMG I NEEDED THAT SLEEP and work is going to suuuuck tonight.

I'm worried about my health. I'm worried, period.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Last night since I couldn't go to work and was angsty, I suggested to Hotter that we take the dogs for a walk. It was night-time, and so not AS hot and humid, and a walk along the edge of the road for the width of our front yard (as far as we are comfortable going from the house full of sleeping children with the window propped open) seemed like a reasonable undertaking.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Except I don't think my lungs and I saw eye-to-eye on that, because I woke at 3:30 a.m. with what I suspect may be a CO2 headache and a deep, rattling wheeze that wouldn't fuck the fuck off. I decided to eat a little something with some fat and protein in it to protect my stomach and hopefully keep my blood sugar from bottoming out if I slept for a while as a result of the Benadryl, take a whopper-dose of that to address any potential allergic phenomenon in action, some store-brand \"Excedrin\" to address the headache as best I can and also because the caffeine might help the lungs, do a nebulizer treatment, and hopefully get back to sleep, so that I'm awake tomorrow while the children are and also because Hotter was Very Annoyed with me for being up and told (!!!) me twice to go back to sleep.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I guess maybe he's starting to resent my odd sleeping hours, but those are a result of my job and not something I can change at the moment. Also I didn't mention it last night but I think Hotter was at least PARTLY annoyed with me for turning back from the service station instead of going on in to work and keeping an eye on the temperature gauge. But the coolant was really low too (I forgot to mention that because the oil freaked me out so much but, well...yeah) and my AAA membership is lapsed and if the van dies that is GAME OVER...\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Of course, even if the MFA Minivan is fine, that does us absolutely no good if my lungs continue to shit the bed this way.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It's possible that wouldn't be an issue, incidentally, if I had the money to have my actual DOCTOR manage the asthma, but I haven't seen her since well before the ER trip in April (yes, I was supposed to follow up with her after that, but I didn't have the money). I don't know if that's a big deal or not because thanks to the kindness of friends I have access to a nebulizer and the meds for it and that might be all she'd be able to do for me right now anyway (besides try to prescribe an inhaled steroid that I a) couldn't afford and b) would have serious reservations about using due to my body's effed up physical and mental reactions to steroids, even in tiny quantities, and I can fret about that right now without the actual prescription in-hand for FREE). It might be that she could figure out some kind of fix for the current monumental suckitude of my respiratory status, but I can't afford to sink any money into that until a) I determine what the minivan needs and b) I earn said money and if the van is dead then I have to keep on ignoring this for now and would rather not think about it, but oh look, too late.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I really hope I am not permanently harming my lungs by not having medical professionals handle their care and feeding right now.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I guess you could also say that I'm worried about my marriage, although Hotter is not CURRENTLY being an ass (I mean the TELLING me to go back to sleep was a little bit assy, but he was half-awake and he didn't bellow or anything--Hotter is very sensitive to me \"making the innernet hate him\" so I thought I'd throw that out there), a month ago I wouldn't have hesitated to wake him and ask him to keep me company until the worst of the jitters from the nebs have passed and try to help me take my mind off the pain in my head. Now, however, I'm mostly just hoping I don't wake him by accident, because I'm worried that he'd be irritated with me, either because of the lost sleep or because he thought I should be able to ignore all of this and go to sleep myself so as to be up helping him with the house and the yard and the kids tomorrow, or...I dunno. Maybe I'm being unfair with him and he'd be wonderful and make me laugh and say all of the right things, but I am feeling a little too close to the end of my chain to take the chance he'd be pissy, and that makes me sad.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Someone tell me a funny.

See the branch down? Also if you squint at the bottom right corner, you can see my fallen cherry tomato :(\r\n* \u00a0 I moved the MFA Minivan into the detached garage right before the storm hit, so it wasn't damaged by falling limbs. Very glad about that!\r\n* \u00a0 Our power was out for a total of about twenty hours. Not bad at all! I keep thinking of all the nice guys and gals I met at the Linemen's Rodeo and served coffee to. They sure were a good-natured bunch! I hope none of them get hurt restoring the power on the East Coast.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm really glad we were prepared; we used quite a bit of bottled water for drinking, washing, and flushing (apparently our bathtub drain-plug isn't all that watertight) and cooked two meals over Sterno cans. I was also able to use those to make Hotter some instant coffee this morning, so nobody perished in our house. The refrigerator stayed nice and cold (thanks to my idea of freezing a bunch of ice beforehand and putting it in a freezerbag, then transferring that to the top shelf of the fridge as soon as the power went) and the freezer stayed frozen. All in all our worst losses were Big Child's comforter (which the stir-crazy dogs pulled into the crate and de-stuffed) and a pan of fish sticks and french fries that were in the oven when the power blew (the chickens enjoyed those when we released them from their storm shelter).

The bad news is pretty much everything else in my life right now. Today's repairs cost $300 and it needs another $400 in work ASAP (when I asked him to rate the work I couldn't afford to get done today on a scale of one to ten in terms of how important it was, MFA Mechanic said \"six, maybe seven\").

Here is my actual Facespace update from yesterday, to give you an ideo of how grim the sleep-deprivation had gotten, between Hotter looking for reasons to wake me up and my waking up on my own with angst, asthma, and wretched headaches:\r\nMFA Mamaplans to sleep tonight, for a change, and has put her husband on notice that if he knocks on the door and doesn't have a dying child in his arms that she needs to rush to the hospital (not an ALREADY DEAD one--at this point if anyone in the house is ALREADY DEAD they will STILL BE THAT WAY IN THE MORNING) he'll be relieved of every appendage longer than his nose. SLOWLY.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 My dental insurance kicked in! WHOOOO! There was some doubt about this as a result of the insurance shuffle of six months ago (where Anthem canceled my insurance because the rates changed and I'd been paying the OLD amount), because the dental insurance I have only covers cleanings and checkups for the first eighteen months and I wasn't sure whether I had to start over with that, but apparently NOT and it has now been eighteen months, which means that my out-of-pocket to fix the mostly-missing front tooth is only (hahahaONLY) $375, as opposed to $800. That's still not going to be doable any time soon thanks to the EFFING minivan, but it's nice to know that I've got coverage should the thing go bad and my face suddenly swell up (I've had a tooth pulled without anesthetic before due to finances, and it is something I am VERY EAGER to NEVER, EVER DO AGAIN).\r\n* \u00a0 I went outside this morning to collect produce and check on the poultry and found--SURPRISE!--a zucchini as long as my forearm. I just looked at the zucchini bushes yesterday and saw nothing larger than my thumb! It's been a while since I grew zucchini and I forgot how comically rapid their growth can be.\r\n* \u00a0 The MFA Children have all thanked me several times over for yesterday's picnic; they really had fun and I'm so glad.

We all had a good time. We petted goats and fed bread to giant koi in a beautiful garden and admired ancient stonework and smelled flowers. The children rolled down a giant hill and nobody puked or got stung by a bee or skinned their knee or had an allergy attack (my lungs even behaved admirably, despite there being a lot of hill-climbing involved, and even some hill climbing avec five-year-old-on-shoulders on the way back to the MFA Minivan, which obligingly did not overheat).

Here's the deal:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 As y'all know, I had a freak dental accident on the way to a job interview about a week ago. This happened once before, about a year ago (I can't find it in my archives to save my life, but oh well) with the same (fake) tooth, and my dentist was able to glue it back together with some kind of dental-grade superglue. That cost about sixty bucks and was well worth it.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, thanks to a friend bailing us out in a big (at least to me!) way, I have enough in the bank to get my antidepressants refilled and have my dentist fix the tooth again (assuming it's the same fix for the same kind of money), BUT I don't know how we're going to cover rent and health insurance and prescription drugs next month (not to mention food) so I don't know if it's very smart to lay out the money for something as non-life-threatening as this tooth. It's a pain, yes (literally in that the exposed stump of the original tooth is very sensitive and figuratively in that I have to keep my mouthguard in 24/7 to prevent further damage plus OMG MY TOOTH GAHHHH), but it's not going to kill me. To further complicate things, I have a one-hour freelance-y gig in my professional field on Thursday that fell into my lap out of the blue and nothing says \"dumb, unprofessional white trash\" like a partially-missing front tooth (the freelance-y gig will not pay enough to cover the repair; it's worth slightly less than half, but I'm not turning down ANY work right now, for obvious reasons).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So I'm debating whether to lay out the $60 that I don't really have on this tooth in order to not look like a damned hick on Thursday (and end the discomfort, not to mention that Things Dental skeeve me out to no end so this is pretty demoralizing, and also I can't properly kiss my husband or do anything ELSE to him involving my mouth while this thing is like this) and worry about the rest of it later or just suck it up, try not to smile on Thursday, and see whether we survive the month of April before I worry about my stupid tooth.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Here, for reference purposes, is what the damage actually looks like:\r\n Figure One: I know, probably not as bad as you were picturing, but this makes me very unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline Surveys - Zoomerang.com\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834014e870e03a1970d-pi", "http://www.zoomerang.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/03/what-would-you-do-click-through-to-vote-in-embedded-poll.html", "title": "what would YOU do?

There was no wrong answer to this one, though (I can argue for either side of what to do about the tooth, which is why I resorted to a blog poll in the first place), and I even see the point of those of you who think I should just shut the eff up about the negative.

I heart the Hippie Food Coop! Seriously, that place always improves my mood and today was no exception. I did some cleaning and watered a bunch of seedlings, so it was pretty much exactly like being at home, minus the sick man and plus someone else making me breakfast (the owner made everyone sausage sammiches--whoo!). I came home with a free container of lavender ch\u00e8vre that someone (not me!) had dropped in stocking the cooler (the corner of the container cracked--the contents were fine but it was no longer suitable for sale) and a bunch of cosmetically-challenged apples, potatoes, and squash. Also, I mooched a couple of empty six-packs (the kind you plant seedlings in) from the Hippie Food Coop's greenhouse--my seedlings need repotting and I didn't really want to spend money for plastic crap to put them in. YAY!\r\n* \u00a0 The XY tried to cancel his dinner visitation on the grounds that he's sick, but I wasn't having it (the MFA Children are going to be exposed to sickness whether they go with their father or stay at home, so that being the case and given the state of finances here, I prefer the option that doesn't involve me having to provide dinner). I responded to his e-mail with word-for-word the same thing he e-mailed me one time when I asked him to keep the MFA Children an extra hour once so that I could go to the doctor (\"You lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas--ZING! Now THAT'S funny!\") and he responded with \"u really have a way with words is that really necessary?\" I wrote back and reminded him that I couldn't take the credit, and asked whether it was only funny if HE mocked the person I loved.

I can't promise you're not in store for more of that, but Hotter and I just had a good laugh and I thought I'd share...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I heartily recommend ducklings as Nature's finest (legal) antidepressant. I've been pretty miserable lately, but I think it'd be a lot worse if I didn't have four fuzzy reasons to laugh in a box in the other room. I mean, ducks, like chickens and goats, are inherently hilarious, and then there are the various puns they lend themselves to...my husband, for example, reduced me to tears of laughter prancing around the dining room earlier this evening holding the smallest duckling (whose name he insists is \"Billy,\" due to its smaller-than-average bill, despite the fact that officially we are waiting to see what gender the ducks are before Little Child and Middle Child get to name them) singing \"Billy, don't be a heeero!\"\r\nF\r\nFigure One: He has brain damage, y'all.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 By far the funniest thing to date, however, is the ducklings' terror of ramen. Yes, ramen, specifically the noodles. See, every night after the kids are in bed Hotter and I like to spread a towel out on the dining-room table, place a flower pot-bottom filled with water on top of the towel, and let the ducklings have a little swim. What can I say, we're two grown adults without teevee in the house who know how to party...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, the other night there was a bowl with some ramen still in it on the table (we save any leftover foodstuffs to throw to the chickens, hence the bowl with the noodles inside sitting around that way) and after I'd finished feeding the ducklings some torn-up spinach Hotter picked up a noodle and held it over the flower-pot lid.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The ducklings all shrieked in horror and flung themselves out of the water. One of them actually dashed off the table's edge, hit the floor with a splat and kept on hauling ass all the way down the two steps into the den (where we keep their box). \"Huh, I guess they don't like ramen,\" Hotter said sadly after I chased down the duckling and brought it back to join the others (who hopped back into the water as soon as Hotter withdrew the offending noodle). \"I wonder why that is? Ducks love carbs!\" We pondered that for a moment and then I had a thought and started laughing so hard it took me a moment to be able to speak. \"They...think...you're...a CHILD MOLESTER!\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter looked at me like I was the one with the brain damage.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"Remember that article, with the videos, that made the rounds a couple of years ago? About the duck-peen? It's SPIRAL! They think you're coming at them with a--HAHAHAHA!\" and we both cracked the hell up.\u00a0\"They're like NONONO, UNCLE BAD-TOUCH!\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 And we pretty much died.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tonight there was ramen on the table again (ummmmyeah, notice the pattern? I haven't eaten this much ramen since I was an undergraduate...) and I picked up a noodle and brandished it experimentally at the ducklings. They recoiled again, peeping, although when I broke it up into smaller pieces they gobbled it eagerly.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"Well now that you've compared it to that video that's just NASTY,\" Hotter observed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Never say we don't know how to have fun around here...\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/12/22/kinkiness-beyond-kinky/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/03/on-the-lighter-side-of-things.html", "title": "on the lighter side of things..."},

No, seriously, I ROCKED THAT GIG! So much so that it went from a one-hour, one-time thing to a one-hour-twice-a-week-for-six-weeks thing, and OMG YAY! As an added bonus, I genuinely like the client. Score!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 To celebrate, I went to the Hippie Food Coop (which is only three miles away from Freelance-y Gig) to buy a few groceries, and they asked if I was free to run the place next Wednesday (their paid employee has to go out of town again) in exchange for more groceries. DOES THE POPE SHIT IN THE WOODS? Whoohoo! From there I went to Big Box Store and bought a few things in bulk, then picked up a prescription for Hotter and came home to find an e-mail from one of the temp agencies I work with asking if I was free for a couple of jobs next week, and neither of them conflicted with Freelance-y Gig so DOUBLE YAY! Then, as if that wasn't enough, the OTHER temp agency I work with called to ask if I would be interested in doing a \"mystery shopper\" gig where I get to judge the performances of several people in the professional field I just spent eight years in.

And hey, at the end of the night the employees got to take what we could carry before they threw everything pre-made out, so I came home with several burgers, a big bag of fried chicken tenders, and a bunch of soft pretzels, which meant that the MFA Children greeted me like a benevolent goddess :)\r\n* \u00a0 Unfortunately, I started sneezing halfway through my shift.

I WISH JUST ONCE THAT I WOULD GET TO SLEEP IN, GOD DAMMIT!\" I pointed out that I kind of wished I wasn't sick, or exhausted from being on my feet for twelve hours yesterday, and that the child in question would quit wetting the bed and also that money would fall from the sky instead of snow (IN LATE MARCH.

{"date": "August 17, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Remember when I said we had some money coming to us in August, but that I wasn't certain of whether we'd actually see any/all of it or not? Well, so far so good! We're scheduled to receive the money in a total of thirteen installments over six months, and so far we've received two of those. I'm not thrilled with the idea of using this money for anything besides socking away a nestegg to replace the MFA Minivan when it goes to the big junkyard in the sky, but the fact of the matter is there are a lot of broken things and things we've been doing without that have been making us feel pretty deprived at best (and downright bitter/in pain at worst). So here, in no particular order, are some of the things we've replaced, fixed, or caught up on recently, either because we had to or because I decided the improvement in our quality of life was worth the expenditure:\r\n* \u00a0 For the first time in many moons, none of our utilities are currently in danger of getting shut off.* \u00a0 I replaced that part that Hotter was losing his mind over the other day.* \u00a0 I ordered the parts for our crockpot.* \u00a0 We've got a blender on the way; ours bit the dust a couple of months ago and I didn't want to replace it with a cheap piece of crap that wouldn't suit our needs (I use the blender for the usual stuff but also to blend things to put through Little Child's g-tube...while it's no Vitamix, which is the one you often hear about in connection with home-made tube-feedings, because I just can't bring myself to spend that kind of money on a blender, the one I've ordered is sturdily-built and comes with a nice warranty so hopefully it'll be almost as good).* \u00a0 Everybody in the house has the prescription drugs they need (I have been skimping on my Nexium and Mirapex, because while my quality of life suffers without them, I won't actually drop dead or anything serious, unlike with the other meds I take and pretty much all of Hotter's).* \u00a0 The MFA Children's school supplies are all ordered and on the way.* \u00a0 Both dogs are going to the vet today to get vaccines, and Isis's itchy ears, which haven't improved with use of the prescription cleaning solution from the vet or coconut oil, will be addressed.* \u00a0 While it wasn't feasible immediately due to the time-sensitive things I had to address first (such as the utilities, the school supplies, the prescriptions, and the vet), the MFA Minivan will be getting COMPLETELY fixed after the first of the next month and having a much-needed oil-change.* \u00a0 Hotter will be seeing a dentist for the first time in years, for dental issues that make me feel like a total dick for being upset about That Tooth (I do not plan on fixing That Tooth any time soon, because all of the above is costing way more than I wanted to spend of the restitution money and currently I am without a job, so we may need it to live on if that doesn't change soon, plus as much as it troubles my pride, That Tooth is purely cosmetic and not a medical emergency, whereas some of Hotter's dental issues are an infection hazard, which with him having two donor organs is no bueno) (if I land a full-time job or a longterm temporary position before we have to cut into the restitution money for living expenses I'll celebrate by having That Tooth fixed, however).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm still pretty worried about money in general, and looking hard for steady work, but currently (and for the first time since...ohhh, February?) it's not a \"worry myself sick and have midnight panic attacks over things like food and medicine\" sort of thing.

I finally got in touch with someone at Anthem, and they've done the same thing they did to me last time (raised the cost, not informed me, kept taking my money, and canceled my coverage). I'm starting to think they're assholes, actually. But as long as I pay the past-due amount as well as the currently-due amount by the 31st, they'll reinstate the coverage and all is roses. The problem with that is that I don't actually have the total amount handy, since I usually pay during the 31-day \"grace period\" because of the timing of my Anthem bill-date, and already paid them this month once (I'm like, thirty bucks short, and why yes that IS incredibly irritating!). So I can't do anything about it right now, but when I receive next week's unemployment I'll be able to fix my insurance situation, and hopefully I just don't get sick or anything before then. On the bright side, then I'll be all caught up and paying on time instead of during the grace period.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I...need to go and nap off the stress hormones.

And lo, they were available online, and there was great rejoicing, for The Peacemaker shall be resurrected! For those of you who didn't read that post, and/or are not inclined to click the link, I named our crockpot \"The Peacemaker\" when we did a little research while ordering chicks and discovered that our backyard would contain a veritable UN of poultry (Dutch Welsummers, Welsh Orpingtons, Chilean Araucanas, Australian Australorps, etc.).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is especially good news given that Loud and Crazy the turkey has been getting awfully belligerent with the other fowl; if he doesn't simmer the eff down he'll be simmering until tender! I'm hoping that his \"window of belligerence\" will slam shut on him before it comes to that (male turkeys are meek as poults and too big and bulky to be very quick or nimble compared to other poultry as ill-tempered adults; Loud and Crazy is at an in-between point where he's still pretty light on his feet and also has quite the nasty attitude) because he isn't very meaty as of yet and I think he'll be an impressive-looking critter when he's full-grown.\u00a0We'll see though, because he's also taken to stalking me when I'm outside; he creeps up whenever my back is turned and then retreats when I face him. I don't know what he plans to do if he actually succeeds in sneaking up on me, but if involves any sort of \"fowl play\" we'll be having an early Thanksgiving!

Yeah, well, that was when I thought all of my online orders from the week previous had already hit the bank account. Turns out the drugstore.com one (for stuff like plastic wrap and toilet paper and snack bags, nothing frivolous) hadn't, and gahhhh. The unemployment disbursement AFTER the next one won't hit my account in time to fix Anthem, and MAYBE the four-hour paid gig I have tomorrow night will (barely) solve things, except I have to put some gas in the MFA Minivan to get there and back, which might make the difference between \"covering it and having nothing to spare for the next two weeks\" and \"geez, another three bucks would have done it, DAMN it,\" and I AM SO SICK OF THE CONSTANT SHELL-GAME.

I didn't open mail from Anthem because I thought it was the usual \"pay up, loser!\" that I get every month for paying during the grace period instead of \"on time.\" I'm the loser who can't manage to support her family with a frigging Master's degree. I'm the one who married poorly the first time around and had the three kids with the jerk who doesn't pay enough child support, and the one who doesn't make treating her ADD a priority thereby increasing the FAIL-factor exponentially, and the one who didn't live up to her potential; I'm the one who could teach a Master's-level course in Shooting Yourself In The Foot. I'm doing all of the right things that I can for right now. I'm applying for every job within reasonable driving distance that I'm even remotely qualified to perform.

We were KINDA Jewish. We celebrated Passover and Hannukah and Purim, but had a Christmas tree and ate pork and mixed meat and dairy. We bought a box of matzoh for Passover but also usually had chametz in the house. I took bagels to school in my lunchbox before bagels were a \"thing\" (oh yes, America is a Bagel Culture now, but hasn't always been), but don't speak more than a smattering of Yiddish. Since I don't believe in the god of the Hebrews, Leviticus doesn't dictate what I eat, although I have an uneasiness about eating pork that I sometimes think might be some kind of \"cultural memory.\" I also cannot--CANNOT--bring myself to even sample most shellfish and seafood.

His thyroid was overactive for much of my childhood, and he could make bug-eyes like nobody's business.

Which, to be quite honest, we are talking blue-collar labor at a Soulless Corporate Megalith store in a very rural area of the American South; if someone manages to truly stand out in their incompetence and overall mediocrity then it's not even a question of whether management knows they suck at life. Management will be the first to tell you if you are looking for said mouthbreathers that they are \"probably walking in circles around the store, if they're not in the bathroom.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Last night at work the on-site representative of the boss-man at Temp Agency #1 (who is also working as a temp, as are his spouse and adult-ish child) clarified that the boss-man hadn't gotten this list in time to call everyone, so there was a mass reprieve. TOMORROW, he now says (by which I mean today, but I haven't slept yet, so), the axe will fall (although he did add that I shouldn't worry, I was a good worker and didn't walk laps around the store or play with the automatic sinks in the bathroom).

The best thing about working from home and the worst thing about working from home are one and the same:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 You're right there if anyone needs you.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 With three children who have various special needs, a bionic husband with two donor organs, a job, and the firm desire to remain in possession of my remaining mental faculties (I think at least ten percent of my brain exited my body with each placenta and a further twenty percent burned up in leaving the atmosphere of my first marriage), I have become an expert at unconventional forms of relaxation.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Y'all already know that I have a very special relationship with my lawnmower, and that she is named after my favorite guided imagery guru. But that's not all I use my iPod for! I also have a Very Special Playlist that I only listen to when the MFA Children are not at home, packed full of some of the raunchiest, most vile and profane rap and hip-hop with a smattering of Dutch trance and industrial noise, and...here is where those of you with any remaining respect for my dignity as a person should look away...I SING ALONG TO IT LOUDLY, AND WITH FEELING as I go about my chores.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 See, I get time away from my kids when they are at school or with their father, and I get plenty of time at home with Hotter, but what I almost never get (and usually never want...usually) is time ALONE. Time where I don't have to worry if someone in the next room is asking me where something is, or whether I feel like having a snack, or if we're out of raspberry preserves. I suppose I could listen to some happy hippie music (I usually go for the Indigo Girls, Paula Cole, Blues Traveler, Don McLean, etc.) but then I think Hotter would be more likely to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to take my earbuds out.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 FACT: Nobody taps the girl spitting rhymes about finding some West Coast [kitty word] for her Detroit playas on the shoulder to inquire whether a shirt looks too small for the youngest child. It's just not done.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I don't have to rely on Mommy's Bad Fun Playlist as much now that I'm getting out of the house now and then for work, but if I ever need to have a very special, very LOUD moment of Zen, my inner gangsta is only a shuffle away. So go ahead, come on over to borrow a cup of sugar, but if I open the door with my earbuds in and scream \"TO THE WINDOWWWWW,\" then point to you?

I called in sick the minute the clerk's office opened, explaining that I wanted to appear before the judge and see if he would dismiss this but was too ill. \"I'll ask him...you can call back later,\" she said. \"Should I leave my phone number?\" I asked. \"No, nobody's going to call YOU,\" she said, and hung up. Awesome! Not! Still, \"called in sick\" probably sounds better than \"almost got it straight in time\" and the check has (of course, NOW) cleared and worst-case scenario I get automatically found guilty in absentia and fined as I might have anyway even if present, but without getting yelled at by an MFA County judge (oh I've had one literally kick the bench and bang on it with his fist AND his gavel--you never know what the crazy emm-effers will up and do, hi ho!).

But that's not how I roll. So instead Big Child got to transcribe letters that I dictated to both his beloved teacher and his father explaining that he had made a TERRIBLE choice and was in HUGE TROUBLE and done something that could have really harmed his little brother WHO WAS JUST SICK IN THE HOSPITAL, and then lied about a set of events that four child witnesses and one independent adult witness pinned UNEQUIVOCALLY on him, and they ought to therefore keep a VERY close eye on him and report any further incidents directly to me, POSTHASTE. And I haven't EVEN decided how long he's grounded for because that fool then kept his victim (who sleeps in the bottom bunk of their beds) up urging him to come and tell me it hadn't been Big Child's fault, and as I explained, IT IS AGAINST THE GENEVA CONVENTION to deprive even SUSPECTED TERRORISTS of food, sleep, or bathroom privileges. Big Child said he was going to call the police and tell them he didn't feel safe in my house if I was going to ground him, too, and they'd take him away and...well, I very calmly and pleasantly asked just where he thought the police would take him given that a gaggle of witnesses was willing to testify that he had arranged to board the schoolbus with his one brother and leave the other standing in filthy runoff up to his armpits in forty-degree weather, and then I sent all three MFA Children on their way with the XY, but...yeah.

It still IS bad, but it's on the way back to good, because I have discovered that it's entirely possible to have your cake and eat it too, job-wise. I do not have steady, predictable employment, nor do I have any solid prospects on that, but I DO have several small gigs going on at once that seem like they just might cumulatively save our arses (one I've mentioned, one is private freelancing in my former career field thanks to the FACESPACE, of all things, another is sorta-volunteer-but-also-pays-in-barter, you saw the sponsored post earlier, and I have an interview for a second freelance-y thing tomorrow). And y'know, it's hell on the nerves and taxes next year will probably be an unholy nightmare, but it's also oddly exhilarating.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm about two weeks away from being able to exhale completely, and the whole house of cards could still topple, but it's looking up and I think we can safely STAND DOWN and relax in my little corner of the world.

I don't know if I was gritting my teeth in traffic (doubtful; usually I clench in my sleep and so I wear a mouthguard for that but I have been under a wee smidge more than usual of stress) or whether, as one of y'all suggested on the Twitter, someone (or several someones?) has an MFA Mama voodoo doll or...well who knows. I don't guess in matters. It sucks.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I felt like a total jerk for having a hissy fit in my minivan over my stupid tooth (thank you to those of you who offered sympathy on the Twitter, by the way) when I arrived at my interview and found that the lady interviewing me had apparently been burned over most of her body at some point in time; every visible inch of her was scarred. She was awesome though; we chatted for quite a while over this and that and laughed a lot and I got the job. First paid gig for THIS employer will be Tax Day. Boo to nothing sooner! Also, I have to locate a tuxedo shirt (a white button-down will not do) that will fit across my tits, preferably for less than I'll make my first night working. Ideas?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I worked at the Hippie Food Coop for a bit today since they are located within three miles of the place where I had the job interview, and that was a lot of fun. I did two signs for them (one in dry-erase markers, one in liquid chalk), with some silly little drawings folks there seemed to think were a hoot. Yay! I'm always in a better mood for having spent some time at the Hippie Food Coop, and I returned home with some cosmetically-challenged organic potatoes, spaghetti and butternut squashes, turnips, and apples.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I made cheesy garlic-mashed potatoes and turnips, enough to have twice, and froze half. I also made an apple pie and have enough cut, sugared, and spiced apples for another in a Mason jar in the fridge, because today was VERY humid and horrid weather to roll pie crust in.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 DUCKLINGS!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 So tired...I feel like there's more I should be telling y'all, but...meh.

One of them in particular is very friendly and loving, and the friend of my friend was really distraught, so I said I'd take him if she'd pay the shipping. He was guaranteed to be here by 3 p.m. today, but the tracking information hasn't been updated and we're all scratching our heads despite a false alarm that gave Hotter a small heart attack earlier today (I had ordered some La Cense beef, which arrived in a large box without airholes, which makes sense as the beef is already dead, but Hotter didn't realize that was arriving today and freaked out that we'd received a dead bird).

I like it less now, as you may already know if you follow me on the Twitter. See, Klout wants you to link up all of your social media accounts so it can accurately tell how important you are, and I went ahead and connected it to the facespace, and then OMFG KLOUT PUT MY FULL NAME AND PICTURE UP FOR THE WHOLE EFFING INNERNET TO SEE! I changed my name back to MFA Mama but couldn't for the life of me get rid of the picture, even when I went so far as to change my facespace profile picture to something anonymous and reconnect Klout and finally I said EFF THIS, WHO CARES and put my face on my Twitter avatar for like, seven minutes or something. During which my Klout profile picture changed back to the horns of anonymity. So I changed Twitter back, too. If this isn't in the DSM-V someone should probably get on that, no? Oy.\r\n* \u00a0 Natasha is ALLEGEDLY a rooster, y'all. I say allegedly because ACCORDING TO HOTTER AND BIG CHILD she is crowing. I have not seen or heard this; reportedly her crow sounds very pitiful and weak. If in fact she IS crowing then I am not surprised, as she's been humping the heck out of the other pullets. No, in case you were wondering, we're NOT going to change her name or even adjust our pronoun usage. She's the one who wanted to be all \"SURPRISE!\" and now won't even crow in front of me, so WHATEVER, NATASHA.\r\n Figure One: \"Look at meeee, I'm Natasha, I suffer from gender-confusion and pathological shyness!\"\r\n* \u00a0 The damn turkey still won't puff up for me, either.\r\n Figure Two: The one in front is the alleged male. His \"head-herpes,\" as Hotter calls it, is very pale in this picture. If you piss him off, it gets bright red. Turkeys are really difficult to photograph, which is why you don't see more turkey pictures. This is one of like, fifty pictures I took and one of the only ones where the turkey isn't half out of the damn frame or under a bush. Turkeys are dicks like that.\r\n* \u00a0 There's a squirrel in the neighborhood that's out to get me. I do the organic gardening thing, and Rodale's Guide suggests that if squirrels are biting into your tomatoes, they're just after the moisture. Because they're thirsty. And therefore if you provide them with a convenient water source from which to drink they will leave your tomatoes alone.\u00a0\r\n Figure Three: I call bullshit, Rodale. This squirrel is clearly just an asshole. I leave water out for it, and I wouldn't even begrudge it a tomato or two, because hey, squirrels get hungry too, BUT NO. It has to take a couple of bites out of EVERY SINGLE ONE, and then I don't even like to use them for sauce because I don't know how plant circulation works, but probably the whole fruit is contaminated by squirrel spit, and Hotter is immunosuppressed. Maybe the chickens put the squirrel up to it, since they get the bitten tomatoes. IT'S A CONSPIRACY.\r\n* \u00a0 So yeah. All of that plus the fact that I'm having my usual post-bacterial-infection autoimmune flare (the four horses of my own personal apocalypse: fatigue, depression, muscle pain EVERYWHERE and easy bruising) make me a very sad panda (although on the bright side, the autoimmune flare would seem to indicate that the antibiotics were, in fact, warranted).

Boris? The one that let me put the Blackberry ALL UP IN HER GRILLE? Is totally blind and okay, technically he actually thought that he was like, LORD OF THE POULTRY and had taught her to feel love and exhibit anthropomorphosized signs of affection and really she just can't run away from his pettings and isn't snuggling his chest with her head so much as she's feeling for an escape route from his loving arms and he was, like, DEVASTATED when I pointed out the truth but HE KEPT THREE KIDS WITH VARIOUS SPECIAL NEEDS AND A BLIND CHICKEN ALIVE, PEOPLE.

{"date": "August  9, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 I discovered Klout, y'all! I didn't really know what the heck it was, and then I thought it was stupid, and then a couple of people gave me Klout and I wanted to give it back and suddenly I'm all \"WHOO, KLOUT!\" No, I haven't scored any perks. They're all either full or else I am not important enough. Also, Klout is a little wack. It says I'm influential about bacon, moms, children, Iowa (WTF? I've been there before, but I don't think I've ever talked about it on the Twitter or anything...), and swimming (again, WTF? I haven't even BEEN swimming in over a year). I really enjoy bacon, but...whatever, Klout. I liked it better when you said I was influential about teeth and tacos. I like giving my friends Klout though. It makes me feel all benevolent and stuff.\r\n* \u00a0 I forgot to tell y'all, but remember that THING that was in my foot for like, at least nine months? I finally got it out. It was a piece of glass, and what finally ousted it was a box-cutter and a needle (I figured why not try YET ANOTHER home surgery on the thing, since I'm currently on antibiotics) (also it was under a really thick callus, hence the box-cutter--I'm not THAT hardcore! Didn't even bleed). I would totally be posting a picture, except when I finally got the point of the needle under the thing and pulled it literally POPPED out of my foot, flew through the air sparkling, and hit the floor somewhere. I couldn't find it. Probably I'll step on it again with the OTHER foot and it'll be with us for ANOTHER holiday season.\r\n* \u00a0 As those of you who follow me on the Twitter or are a facespace friend already know, Natasha still has us guessing as to her gender (I'm using female pronouns because we always have for her and probably always will, even if she starts crowing). It turns out the white egg was from a duck (we know this because we separate the ducks at night and they lay very early) and now Natasha is vigorously...topping...the other pullets. But still no crowing. And no fighting with Paul. Aren't cocks supposed to fight, or is it like pitbulls where they mostly just do it because they're treated badly/trained that way? Perhaps Paul is just extremely tolerant (he is from San Francisco, after all). Or maybe Natasha is intersexed? Natasha the transrooster, y'all!\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Not all of our poultry are so tolerant, though. Loud and Crazy the turkey has developed quite a hatred toward the ducks. He even hunts them all stalk-i-ty like. If he gets any more violent toward them he may have to Go To His Reward before Thanksgiving. Fortunately we'd still have two turkeys if it comes to that. He's pretty scrappy though, so if/when I do him in I think I'm going to have to sneak up on him while he's roosting and drop a sack over him like Borat did to Pamela Anderson. I was talking to Morgan about this on gchat and she was like \"oh emm gee, what would I have to do to talk you into vlogging that?!?\" I was like \"ugh, then I'd have to wear a mask, and the only ones I have are my kids' play ones, and I'd be That Crazy Lady Who Snuck Up On The Turkey In The Darth Vader Head.\" Which didn't make her any less excited about the idea.

So naturally I started wheezing on the way to work, where we were doing some demolition, and in helping to rip out a bunch of elderly fixtures I started wheezing and excused myself (much to the disgust of my coworkers and immediate superiors) to get some fresh air (hahahahaHAohFML), then gave up and went home after only three hours' work to take a whopper dose of antihistamines and go to bed in the AC with my nebulizer handy (thank you, innernet fairy godmothers of the nebulizer and albuterol amps!).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not sure whether going to work tonight is a good idea.

Booooo. On the plus side, I wasn't really looking forward to a solid twenty-four hours without sleep, so there's that I guess.\r\n* \u00a0 Little Child has been an eating fool lately; yesterday we only gave him formula once! I never get tired of watching that kid eat. Today he discovered Rainier cherries. It was adorable!\r\n* \u00a0 I wasn't entirely pleased with the way Hotter's birthday cake turned out. It was a chocolate cake recipe I hadn't tried before (but it received rave reviews online) and a caramel frosting recipe that I HAD tried before and loved, but I think I got the proportions wrong (it calls for \"one bag of dark brown sugar\" and I think they meant a one-pound bag, in retrospect...). It was still delicious, but mehhh. Considering how much I spend on ingredients for a homebaked cake it should have been better than that!\r\n* \u00a0 The turkeys are really not very friendly. Slow-moving and easy to catch, yes. Friendly? No. None of them are MEAN or anything (at least not yet...) but...well. The chickens, while not as friendly as, say, a cat or dog, come running when you go out there to see if you've brought food with you, and while they don't exactly LIKE to be picked up, if you tuck one under your arm it will settle down and let you pet it (they'll even close their eyes and make little happy sounds if you stroke their throats juuuust right). The turkeys? Don't care if you have food or not; they don't want anything to do with you. And if you pick a turkey up, you have to hold it AWAY from your body or it'll claw you to bits. They don't stop struggling for a SECOND unless you cover their heads, in which case they'll go still but stay tensed up and ready to escape the moment they can see again.\r\n* \u00a0 Ducks are nasty creatures. NASTY! I knew from reading about them that male ducks were rapists, but nothing I'd read ever said anything about group sex or female ducks helping male ducks rape other females! Also our drake tends to drag his tallwhacker in the dirt, which...well, ducks are NASTY CREATURES.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter pointed this out to me a couple of days ago, and I'm still stuck on the \"having sex with a pitbull\" part. Not that child molestation isn't terrible. But...HOW DO TWO PEOPLE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENGAGE IN SEX ACTS WITH A PITBULL? I can't imagine the dog being cool with it, and someone would have had to have the head end, so...yeah.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dreamindemon.com/2011/07/22/couple-charged-with-having-sex-with-pit-bull-molesting-child/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/07/updates-various.html", "title": "updates, various"},

I mean, if they'll employ people with rebel flags tattooed across the backs of their necks, probably The Crazy isn't a major issue in an employee from where they stand. Plus honestly? If these people were good problem-solvers they wouldn't be working at SCM.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I never thought I'd be so grateful to have about ten different cameras on me at all times while on the job (normally they annoy me, because how the hell is one supposed to correct a wedgie and then look Security in the eye ever again?) (one goes into either the bathroom or the fitting room, in case you ever run into that little dilemma--you're welcome). That said, lack of concern for Repercussions, Comma, Future is kind of a signature trait amongst The Crazy, so I don't know how reassured I should actually be by those cameras and am questioning the wisdom of going back to work tonight.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On one hand, I hate this job on a good day, there's less than a full week of work left, and I kind of like that out of Scarface and me, only one of us is currently sporting a slashmark across our entire face.

Oh, right, because I'm a deeply broken person who was conditioned by her family of origin and first spouse to think that screaming for help is totally useless! Gotcha. All sarcasm aside, it honestly HAD NOT CROSSED MY MIND that I could scream if Scarface came at me and thereby avoid getting stabbed. The only options I was coming up with were things like a) quit my job, b) pack a shiv in my lunchbox or c) get distracted wondering whether that People Of Soulless Corporate Megalith website would get hold of the security footage of me getting stabbed to death and whether anybody I know would recognize me if they did (because I would certainly be recognizable--part of what I've been helping to do in the course of renovating this particular SCM store is installing new cameras that can READ THE DATE ON A PENNY ON THE FLOOR OF THE STORE) and forget about the whole ugly business for a few minutes altogether.\r\n* \u00a0 We have a Houdini Duck on our hands.

{"date": "July 28, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I went to work last night, and didn't get stabbed.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It was still a shitty evening. Scarface was thoroughly unpleasant at every possible opportunity, making ugly comments every chance she got and spending much of the shift standing around doing nothing but watch me. It started to unhinge me a little. I was so angry! WHY? I haven't done anything to this woman! Why should I stew in this fury, and be afraid to go into the cameras' blind spots? Why, I kept asking myself, is she doing this? WHY ME?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the way home it came to me, something I've been told on numerous occasions but never fully believed (because I'm so good at blaming myself): some people are just deeply unhappy with their lives, and looking for a target. I know, some of you are probably all \"no shit, Sherlock!\" but it took an encounter with someone like Scarface who doesn't even arguably have a reason to hate my guts, someone with whom I have NO history of ANY kind to cloud things, to help me recognize and accept this. The only way Scarface \"wins\" is if she makes me miserable, and that's exactly what all of the anger has been doing. I finally believe, in my gut (and thanks in part to the people who remind me from time to time), that I don't deserve what she and others like her are dishing out, that the people I care about think highly of me, and that I am good worker.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I don't let anger out easily, because rigid self-control is my own peculiar form of rebellion against the people who raised me (thanks to the efforts over multiple years of a Harvard-trained therapist I can usually RECOGNIZE anger now, but that's about all), and I don't truly hate anyone enough to damage my own life by unleashing on them in grand style (I have, in the past, and I can honestly say that I regret it, if only because I don't like the person that even righteous anger turns me into). And punching pillows and such just feels silly. Maybe, though, rather than casting it out amid loudness and commotion, it's better to just set anger outside like a bin of recycling, knowing that it's served all the purpose it's ever going to in my life.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Tonight, the first time Scarface tries to start with me, rather than continuing to ignore her (which isn't working) or saying anything ugly back, I'm going to smile. And tell her I'm sorry she has so much hate in her heart, but it's okay, I forgive her, and better me than someone who has to be in her life for longer than one more day, because I'm not going to let the ugliness change me. She's probably going to think I'm crazy, and maybe I am, but if she keeps it up after that it says more about her than it does about me. Worst-case scenario, she goes ballistic on me, which she might do anyway, and at least there'd be witnesses who would have to say I wasn't asking for it or anything.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And while I'm at it, since I know she's reading, Stalky? I forgive you. Thank you for reminding me what a useless and toxic and UGLY thing anger is, and helping me arrive at the point of realizing that one of the most satisfying feelings in life is to lay it down and walk away. I hope you have a good time at BlogHer, if you really do end up going, and if you spend your entire time there talking smack about me, then that's okay. The people who matter to me aren't going to think any less of me because of you, and the quality of my work means you can't really threaten my livelihood. So, you know, go on ahead if it makes you feel better, and spares your husband and children and the other people who have to deal with you on a regular basis even a little from the rough side of your tongue: I wish you peace, and physical healing, and mental stability. If not for your own sake, then for theirs. If you want to continue doing what you do that's not about me, and now I can finally see that it never was.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twoadultsonebrownbaby.blogspot.com/2011/07/broad-of-questionable-smarts.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/07/forgiveness.html", "title": "forgiveness"},

The corn is a total write-off, and I'm starting to think that corn just doesn't grow well in our soil. The beans are producing, but not much. We've had a lot of fabulous salads, and gotten tomatoes (from the plants I grew from seed and the ones from The Botanical Garden) in dribs and drabs...this is partly the fault of my work-schedule and partly the fault of the weather and partly just that we're still working out the kinks in growing things here (I grew up in the area, but my ancestral home had completely different soil).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We've also gotten a handful of tomatoes from the ones the chickens \"planted\" (we used to have their enclosure up by the house, but moved it to the very back of the property when Paul arrived so that his crowing would be minimally obnoxious to the neighbors--at some point the original MFA Flock had some tomato scraps to eat and pooped a bunch of seeds out, and we quit mowing in that spot after I recognized the plants). The plants have always looked better than the lovingly caged, watered, and weeded ones I cultivated, but the yield was about the same and I was starting to think Casa MFA was just built on cursed ground...until today. I was parting the very long grass around the \"wild tomatoes\" to pick the last few cherry tomatoes on a cluster (that's what most of the \"wild\" ones are, although there's at least one that's growing HUUUUUGE tomatoes; none of those have ripened yet but they are much larger than my fists) when it occurred to me that maybe there were more of them hidden from view. So I started parting the grass here and there and...HOLY MOSES!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I brought in about three pounds of cherry tomatoes, and that's not counting the split ones (which I threw to the poultry)!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I've been outgardened by a bunch of gallinaceous fowl with brains the size of lentils, and next year instead of starting seeds indoors, nurturing them with great care, transplanting them outside, staking and fertilizing the plants, watering daily, etc. I might just take a dump in the yard.\r\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/07/the-one-where-im-out-gardened-by-a-bunch-of-gallinaceous-fowl.html", "title": "the one where I'm out-gardened by a bunch of gallinaceous fowl"},
{"date": "August 11, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I've been buying these totally awesome spice blends from the Hippie Food Coop for a while now, and out of the blue I decided to write to the lady who created them and ask about doing a review/giveaway. She responded enthusiastically, and I am just SO tickled to be able to do this, because my family is completely addicted to these products and now I get to share the goodness with one of YOU! I'll be posting recipes throughout the next week and on Friday, August 19th I'll be picking a winner via random.org.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is Jen. In addition to helping run a farm (including a CSA program!) and raise a family, Jen makes incredible flavors in the form of spice blends and all-natural lollipops. I've had her lollipops and they are TO DIE FOR, but the spice blends, believe it or not, are even better. Because you can use them any way you want to jazz up a favorite recipe or, in my case, get your kid who has been tube-fed for most of his life to EAT MORE (oh yes, Little Child is a Bangarang addict--he seems to prefer stronger flavors for some reason and likes to spice up his food). Jen herself described her four spice blends to me in an e-mail as \"a flavor flight, from sweet to heat,\" and I really couldn't put it any better myself!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Shebang, which is Little Child's favorite, is a spiced sugar blend with ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. I could pretty much eat the stuff out of the jar, but it's also excellent in baked goods, coffee, on hot buttered toast or popcorn...you get the idea. It's a key ingredient in my Zucchini-Carrot Bread, which (here is where I fail modesty) is the best veggie bread I've ever had. It's crazy how good this stuff is! And because I am a giver, I'm going to share the recipe with y'all.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nMFA Mama's Crazy-good Zucchini-Carrot Bread\r\nIngredients:three cups all-purpose flourone teaspoon saltone teaspoon baking sodaone teaspoon baking powdertwo and a half teaspoons cinnamonone tablespoon Shebangthree duck eggs\u00a0one cup coconut oiltwo cups sugarthree teaspoons vanilla extractone and a half cups finely-grated zucchinitwo large carrots, peeled and finely-grated\u00a0one cup chopped pecans (optional)1. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees and grease two loaf pans.2. Sift or whisk dry ingredients EXCEPT for nuts (if you're using them), sugar and Shebang together and set aside.3. Beat eggs, coconut oil, vanilla, sugar, and Shebang in a large mixing bowl.\u00a04. Add the premixed dry ingredients in several batches, beating as you go.5. Stir in the zucchini, carrot, and nuts if you're using any.6. Divide evenly into two loaf pans, sprinkle the tops with Shebang, and bake until a butterknife inserted into the loaves comes out clean (about 50 minutes).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is a pretty forgiving recipe, and if you don't have any Shebang (although you should totally buy some, because it's THAT GOOD) you can use two and a quarter cups of sugar and three teaspoons of cinnamon (I guess you could also try adding tiny amounts of ginger, cardamom, and cloves if you wanted, too) and get a pretty good result. Coconut oil is kind of pricey, and while you won't get quite the same flavor or consistency, canola will work in a pinch. I use duck eggs because their higher protein and fat content produces a denser, richer cake-consistency than chicken eggs, but you can substitute three large chicken eggs if you can't find duck eggs for sale and that'll work, too.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Next up: Shebangarang barbecue sauce, a.k.a. The Best Way To Dress Up Chicken Maybe EVER!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0To enter the giveaway, go and check out the entire Bangarang line and leave me a comment on this post saying which of the spice blends you'd most like to try. That's it! No facespace-liking, Twitter-following, or other hoops to jump through.

Probably not, unless you're wayyyy into poultry, so here is a key:\r\n Figure Two: 1. Zombie Chicken, 2. George de Ebil, 3. Mer the Ameracauna, 4. Mystery Brown Egger, could've been Lenny the Sex-Link, Blanche the Orpington, either of the Australorps, or either of the Barred Rocks, 5. Natasha the lone Russian Orloff, Who Is Not A Rooster After All, 6. One of the Welsummers, 7. Houducki, 8. One of the Jersey Giants.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How, you might ask, do I know who laid what? Well, it's like one of those word problems where you figure things out by hints and elimination. Zombie eggs we know by their color (blue and green layers each have a \"signature\" hue that they always lay in; it lightens as the bird ages but a blue egg layer will always lay blue, a green egg layer will always lay green, etc.). George de Ebil eggs we know by their size, color, and heft (for some reason hers feel much heavier than the others), Mer we know by color as well, Natasha is the only white-egg layer about, which makes her eggs easy to spot, the Welsummers are the only chocolate egg layers about so the dark one was definitely from one of them, Houducki's eggs are the only eggs of that color, have an oily feel to them, and are the only eggs we pull out of Duck Jail (yeah, we've contained Houducki finally), and the Jersey Giants are the only birds old enough to be laying in Cell Block C, where #8 was found. Right now we're getting a lot of wee small eggs because pullets lay small ones when they're first starting up. Hotter has offered his own crass speculation as to why that is, but it doesn't bear repeating :)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Now, who wants to come over for quiche?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834014e8a59dbc4970d-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401543439f4f9970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/08/i-can-haz-eggiz.html", "title": "I can haz eggiz?"},

So that's good. I bought gas yesterday on the way home from Weekend Warrior Job, at the small-town gas station near the Soulless Corporate Monolith job that I've discovered has it for twenty cents less than anywhere else in town, big-box membership stores included, so now we're stocked up and in a holding pattern (with enough for one half-gallon emergency milk in the bank) until payday.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Having food and gas both be several days to the good is such a comfort, y'all. I didn't exactly take it for granted before, but I had become accustomed to having it be minimally worrisome for a good long run prior to the past few months and now I pretty much feel like a bigshot if neither is on my immediate radar on any given day. And the phone is good because that's my lifeline on breaks at Soulless Corporate Megalith; yes I need to be able to keep tabs on Hotter and the boys and know if there is an emergency with them or call MFA Mechanic if the MFA Minivan strands me somewhere, but the good it does my mental health to have my Twitter peeps at three in the morning when I'm on lunch and Hotter's sleeping is not to be underestimated.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I do hope the universe doesn't feel like I need a little slap to keep me awake tonight at work or anything. A facespace friend recently compared my life to Wile E. Coyote, jumping in with \"at least there was no giant box of TNT going boom?\" I did laugh at that. Friends who compare me to a looneytune and sympathize with me on my \"pullet wound\" (yeah, a pullet attacked me and pinch-bruised the shit out of my arm) remind me that we can choose laughter. So tonight at work I'm just going to try and stay out from any giant safes or pianos on creaky, fraying ropes and hope for the best. It's all any of us can do I guess.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/06/so-far-today-is-better-than-yesterday-which-is-all-i-ask-of-it-really.html", "title": "so far, today is better than yesterday, which is all I ask of it, really"},
{"date": "August  5, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Houducki returned! After being gone for most of the day, she turned up in the evening, right in line with the other three ducks, so we went ahead and put her in Duck Jail with them for the night (actually they filed right in--they have already learned that that's their home and since Duck Jail includes a small run and the underside of the hutch that the hens lay in, which has three walls and a roof, I think they feel safe in there at night).\r\n* \u00a0 The ducks have upped the ante! TWO duck eggs this morning! In fact, the egg that I identified here as a Natasha egg? When I cracked it it was definitely from the second duck** (I didn't think a mallard would lay a white egg; the other lays camo-colored ones and that's what they're SUPPOSED to lay) (maybe her ducklings would be albinos?).\r\n* \u00a0 Big Child, who is my egg-eater (several times a week he'll ask for \"eggs and toast and butter\" for breakfast and I'll make him two fried eggs--he likes the yolks runny which makes ME want to puke but we know our eggs are from a clean source so ehhh) (he learned this from his father), asked if he could try a duck egg at breakfast yesterday. Hotter and I have talked about just trying a duck egg plain but somehow neither of us has had the nerve...Big Child is actually the most culinarily adventurous person in the house. Anyway, I made him one chicken egg and one duck egg, which we all agreed was the most logical way to compare the two, and plated them up, and everyone gathered around to watch him take the first bite. He pronounced it \"GOOD! DELICOUS! I LOVE IT!\" I asked him if it tasted any different from the chicken egg and he tried a bite of each, chewing thoughtfully. \"Yep!\" Good different or bad different, I asked. He tried both again. \"I dunno. It's really yummy though!\"\r\n\u00a0\r\n** Which means that Natasha still hasn't laid yet, putting her gender back into question (no crowing so we're PRETTY sure she's a hen, but she sure is flashy-looking for a girl-chicken and she carries herself different from the others and is very assertive...who knows, maybe she's intersexed?) AND meaning that she could theoretically lay pink eggs. Orloffs are supposed to lay tinted eggs according to some of my sources and we all keep hoping we'll get a pink egg layer (so far Zombie eggs are aqua, Mer eggs are a dark sky-blue, and Honeybadger eggs are green, but there's Natasha and three Easter Eggers who are younger than the other pullets who have yet to lay so here's hoping).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/08/hey-mikey-he-likes-it.html", "title": "hey Mikey, he likes it!"},
{"date": "June  6, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 The Reuben my chickens were eating was not food-waste from within Casa MFA (horrors!) (nor do we use bought bread at all, nor could I be arsed to make marbled rye; Hotter is lucky if I make him plain Swedish rye once in three months), but rather a \"hot-box leftover\" from the concession stand at Weekend Warrior job several weeks ago. Technically it was probably okay for human consumption, but just dried-up and fatty as HELL and Weekend Warrior Job has been kind enough to let me take leftovers on several occasions for my chickens with the caveat that they are NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION so I remain true to my word on that in the name of the local Health Department :) That is how my chickens have come to be connoiseurs of pricey hot sammiches and things like pigs in the blanket and marinated mushrooms. Lately I'm a fan of protein and fat for the poultry that I don't have to pay for, organic or no (and a surprising amount of the food served at Weekend Warrior Job actually is). So lest anyone think I'm buying and failing to eat fancy sammiches or letting them go to waste, that's the story behind the Reuben.\r\n* \u00a0 I tweeted a photo a while ago because the view from my seat at the dinner table made me giggle, and then almost immediately felt self-conscious because I've written openly about how grave our financial situation is on several recent occasions. In case anyone saw the tweet and was wondering/worrying/rubbing their hands together with glee and calling CPS on me, there was also a roasted chicken involved in tonight's meal, we just don't put the carcass on the table because SOMEone is sure to burn themself on the pan if we do (or start asking anatomical questions that will make at least one other person present queasy). The recent discussion of the tip jar made me worry that someone would either surmise that we had nothing else and feel uneasy/pressured to do something about that, or start a new Twitter account just to talk about how I'm a big misrepresenting liar who tells tall tales on the innernet to line their pockets via PayPal, or...hell I dunno maybe I overthink these things due to some of the stuff in Stalky's manifestos? Ennyhoo, there was a chicken. Swearsies! The end.\r\n* \u00a0 I also tweeted some garden porn today:\r\n Figure One: We thought the cauliflower the chickens ate was history, but it has made an incredible comeback!\r\n Figure One: Our first zucchini of the year forming on the bush with the flower still attached. I heart squash flowers! May have also inspired Backpacking Dad's new band-name!\r\nFigure Two: Substantially less impressive until I tell you that I only ever got ONE artichoke seed to sprout and transplanted it triumphantly into the ground at the same time as the cauliflower. It met a similar fate and lost all but one leaf down so far down the stalk that I despaired of side-branches ever forming, but because I love a lost cause I kept watering it.

{"date": "June  7, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 I got next to no freaking sleep today, due in part to my wanting to go to the Specialty Meat Store and redeem a gift certificate and in part to my ex-husband blowing up my phone just as I was drifting off and getting me good and riled up. Remember how he's sooooo poor he can't pay an additional PENNY in child support, and his job is sooooo inflexible that he HAS to leave the children with CATHERINE! or lose his livelihood and THEN where would we be? Well, he was wrecking my sleep (and yes, as I pointed out to him, it IS like he knew I was sleeping seeing as how I've e-mailed him in detail about my schedule) because he JUST TODAY decided that he needs to go to Big Apple City tomorrow and wanted to take his dinner visitation today instead URGENTLYOMGWTFBBQ. Do I even NEED to point out how many things are wrong with that? I THINK I SHALL!\r\n1. His job is so strict he can't see his children and yet they are okay with this trip?2. He's so poor, SO POOR! But he can afford to rent a car and buy gas for it or fly up there and back (the XY-mobile is ailing and he rents a car whenever he goes to Big Apple City)?3. Three hours' notice for a schedule change is not adequate. I've told him and told him that we start cooking each day's dinner between twelve and three hours before the meal because we can't afford convenience food...meh, narcissists, whattayagonnado?4. He knew I was sleeping.5. BONUS! He then proceeded to tell me that third shift is USUALLY 4-midnight (huh?) and therefore \"ure not working now!\" Well hmm, someone forgot to tell my boss that because I work ten at night to seven in the morning and NO I WAS NOT WORKING, THAT WAS NOT THE POINT, I HAVE THIS SLEEP-THING I NEED TO DO SOMETIMES GAHHHHH YOU DO NOT DESERVE A HEAD, LARGE OR SMALL!!!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I let the XY know (and will now let y'all know) that my refusal to change the schedule was NOT due to him being an inconsiderate dick who wrecked my sleep for the day. I hate him like poison, but this is not All About Me. We had a special dinner planned (Specialty Meat Store, yo) and it was already cooking. BUT! If he makes a request I'll have to refuse for entirely reasonable reasons AND is a dick in the process? It does brighten my day quite a bit to say no to him! HAHAHAHAOHMYGOD. I reinstated the block on his line from mine (Verizon insists on letting those expire after 90 days, which is a dick move on their part, because people like the XY don't stop being creepers OR trying to call you after 90 days) and hopefully this won't happen again for at LEAST 90 days.\r\n* \u00a0 Ham, y'all! Specialty Meat Store is famous for their ham. It's rather expensive. The lovely reader who sent me the gift certificate said something along the lines of \"enjoy the ham, not that $XXX buys much of it, hahaha!\" DUDE THAT IS STILL A LOT OF HAM BY MY STANDARDS. Hotter and I gleefully brought it home and he cooked it up for dinner and no joke, I think I ate about two and a half pounds of ham. The MFA Children love All Things Pork and were thrilled. Hamhamhamhamham...\r\n* \u00a0 I just realized that we're not going to make rent without something bouncing in the process. AGAIN. Dammit. So I picked up a lunch-banquet Thursday a couple of hours after my shift at Soulless Corporate Monolith is over and will officially be a fucking zombie by this time Thursday night. Not that it'll help in time, but at least I'll recoup the inevitable bank fees. We just won't think about how my car insurance is going to get canceled before I can do anything about it right now, because then I might cry and that would make me even more tired than I already am. Although on the bright side, the Weepy Willy Score is me FTMFW and the weepies ZERO since I got the Synthroid refilled (excepting when I got the latest ticket). And also, after the fifteenth of the month we'll be caught up on everything and this shouldn't happen again any time soon. Plus, we won't starve. We've got spare chickens out back and a garden that's ramping up the production and HAM. Lots of delicious leftover ham. I think I'm going to go and drown my sorrows in cholesterol...\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/06/exhaustion-ham-doom.html", "title": "exhaustion, ham, doom"},

He said well that is ridiculous, and loaned me $20 until payday so that I could come in. People are so nice sometimes!\r\n* \u00a0 Thursday was my Hell Day when I worked a lunch banquet at Enormous Downtown Venue through Temp Agency #2 and also had Soulless Corporate Megalith that night. I survived, and also? GOOD FOOD, OMG. It's kind of funny; when you work banquet service you're usually poor as hell and subsisting on ramen and then you go to work and eat like this:\r\n Figure One: Banquet in the break room! SO good!\r\n* \u00a0 Friday I slept all day. Like seriously, I got home from Soulless Corporate Megalith around 10:00 a.m., crashed, got up at 5:30 p.m., had dinner with my family, passed back out at 7 p.m., woke up for a few minutes around midnight when Hotter came to bed, and then went BACK to sleep until my alarm went off at six this morning. It felt like a total effing waste of my day off. Today was the first time in a long time that I wasn't dead on my feet though, so that was good.\r\n* \u00a0 Today I put in ten hours at Weekend Warrior Job, where they changed my name:\r\n Figure Two: This? Is not my name. \"We couldn't find yours,\" management informed me, \"but it's not like anyone cares what your name is anyway!\"\u00a0Thanks, boss! If you're wondering why they had my nametag, it's because we're not allowed to bring them home. We're not allowed to take uniform shirts off the premises either, so you have to show up, change into a hopefully-not-too-smelly-because-they-aren't-laundered-daily uniform shirt, work, and then take off your sweaty shirt and give it to management, who may or may not give it The Sniff Test right in front of you to decide whether some other poor sap has to wear the thing the next day. Um...yeah. If I had this job any more often I'd probably be irate, but honestly I find it kind of hilarious, because what else can you do with THAT?\r\n* \u00a0 I got home, ate ham and bean soup with the family, and...you guessed it. Passed out. And woke up an hour ago; the entire house is sleeping and since I have Soulless Corporate Megalith again tomorrow night (tonight, technically, as it's after midnight) I'm not sure if I should try and stay up so I can sleep during the day and be freshly rested or go back to sleep or what (yes, I could TOTALLY go back to sleep).\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 My back is...not good. As in, I wake up first thing in the morning and have a little bit of trouble even walking while the NSAIDs kick in. No, I'm NOT supposed to take NSAIDs because of the bleeding thingy I have, and currently I'm afraid to so much as pluck a stray eyebrow hair or I'll bleed like a stuck pig, but it's \"take NSAIDs, be able to walk and work, and be cautious around sharp objects\" or \"don't take the NSAIDs, not be able to walk or work, starve AND be in horrible pain while doing so\" so I have therefore made the conscious decision to disregard medical advice on the matter. If worst comes to worst, every time I've had my H&H checked since recovering from my hysterectomy it's been stellar, a little on the HIGH side even, and so therefore I'm pretty confident that I can withstand a major bleed if I'm injured or something without it necessitating a transfusion.\r\n* \u00a0 And um...yeah.

He put keystroke loggers on my old laptop\u00a0(yeah, I got rid of the thing because I wouldn't have felt safe in using it no matter WHO tried to clean it up), and some kind of doohicky that let him remotely view and record whatever was going on on my screen, and it was creepy and unsettling and felt like a violation of my trust in letting him \"fix\" the computer for me.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter knows this. He and I were good online friends for a couple of years before my separation and divorce, and we actually had our first telephone conversation as a direct result of the afore-mentioned hacking (the XY was accusing me of having an affair with Hotter, which I wasn't, I mean he lived four states away and we'd never so much as heard each other's voices until the accusations started to fly--I wanted to go over our previous talks online and didn't have access to all of that because I don't save such things, so I asked for his phone number from a public library). He knows how that whole thing made me feel.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So why, I wonder, did Hotter evidently comb through my PayPal account (and Godiva only knows what else) to build a case for MFA Mama As Fiscally Irresponsible and All-Around Selfish Person? It wasn't quite so devious as hacking me; my laptop Has A Sick and I've used his computer a lot lately. I haven't been careful about leaving things open because I trust(ed) my current husband, I've checked the \"store my password box,\" and hell, I've even used the same damn password for everything (and told Hotter as much). Because I am stupid like that and also because, again, I trust(ed) him.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The stupid part is, if he'd let me explain a couple of things he would have understood that I was, in fact, thinking of our family's best financial interests. I mean hell, I don't do much else BESIDES that lately. Every trip to the grocery store is agony, every time we have an overdraft I feel like a failure, and every time I get a shut-off notice and can't do anything about it another little piece of me dies. But honestly? I don't even care to explain myself to Hotter at this point. He has done that thing that people do when are petty, immature jerks and have either a complaint with or just an incomplete understanding of someone else's actions and gone and created a SECOND problem (namely that of taking a wrecking ball to the trust I worked so hard to be able to have in him or really ANYONE after certain life events, and being a dick in the process). And if I even discuss this with him at this point a) my head will explode, b) he shows NO signs of wanting to hash it out as grownups, so it'll be unproductive at best and damaging to my kids (since SOME PEOPLE can't maintain decorum around small children) at worst and c) I'll feel like I'm bowing to/reinforcing his shady behavior by even discussing things I would have gladly told him had he asked, except noOOOooo, he didn't ASK, he SNOOPED. Plus, again, NOW? Not so much with the caring about setting him straight. Just call me the honeybadger, because I no longer give a shit.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I know that money problems are one of the leading causes of divorce, which is cold comfort when you find yourself married to someone who, rather than make things EASIER when your family is struggling, pisses money away on credit card fees you didn't even know about (OH YES, YES I DID GO THERE, HOTTER), attacks you for buying a $3.31 tub of pretzel sticks for your kids' school snacks when he's out of coffee and OMG COFFEE EMERGENCY, and gives you the LASER EYES OF PURE RAGE when you return from the store without cereal, because they are not a morning person and hate to cook in the morning. I have bitten my tongue again and again, reasoning that Hotter is under a lot of stress being essentially a solo parent while I'm nocturnal, and not used to being this poor. But today, after the cereal thing, I finally Said Something, and he came back with \"DO YOU REALLY WANT TO START WITH THIS NOW?\" like some kind of THREAT or something, and when I said maybe I did he proceeded to blast me with his creepyness, IN FRONT OF MY KIDS.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Of course it's not really about the money (at least not for me). It's about the fact that he apparently thinks I'm selfish and I TOTALLY think I married a small, petty little man who can't control his ugliness in front of small children for the SECOND time in my life. Oh, and also that he doesn't seem to understand BOUNDARIES. Geez, that sounds kind of familiar too!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I have no idea what I am going to do with this. If he apologized, probably I'd be willing to accept the apology and try to make the best of things, but that doesn't look very likely and barring a motherfucking PROFUSE apology I kind of think this is A Dealbreaker, which makes me very sad. On top of which, I have NO IDEA how I am going to provide for my kids if I can't work due to lack of childcare. If this is how it's going to be I'll just have to figure something out though, I guess, because life is too short to spend married to petty, trust-violating cocknozzles. Been there, done that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0For tonight I guess I'll just go to work as usual and hope I get to hit things with hammers.\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. I have closed comments on this post, for I believe the first time in the history of this blog. I already know that it sucks and that this was a dick move on Hotter's part, and I already know ending a marriage isn't a decision to be entered into lightly, and I already know that life probably owes me a fucking break by now. I don't really want to give this any more headspace than I absolutely have to, though, so.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/06/the-one-where-i-probably-needed-to-change-my-passwords-to-everything-anyway.html", "title": "the one where I probably needed to change my passwords to everything anyway"},

I'm liking this better by the moment!\" I replied, but then he pointed out that I needed him for childcare and I grudgingly took the tweezers from him. \"You REALLY want me to take these pointy things and mess with your nuts right now,\" I asked. \"THAT IS HOW MUCH I TRUST YOU!\" he said.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I removed the tick, and didn't even insist on using the match method,* because we don't have any matches in the house I'm a fucking saint.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Karma, however, is a bitch.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Do not attempt the match method of tick removal!

I was planning on hitting the sheets early, and had been aware of a slight itch on my left calf for a while and thought maybe a flea from a dog at the hippie food coop had bitten me or something. As soon as I got in bed it became MUCH worse, and began to ache and burn and swell, and I had to get up and take a lot of pills and apply topical steroids and use my inhaler, then stayed up for about an hour after that to get relief and then ensure I'd avoided an anaphylactic reaction (been there, done that a few times).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Today I found a (very part-time) job.

{"date": "March  7, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 So today I needed to go to the Post Office and mail a few things I sold on e-Bay, plus three packages of Trader Joe's Heart Healthy Whole-Grain Instant Blueberry Oatmeal that I bought to send to a certain tiny friend in Canada whose mother would very much like him to just EAT SOMETHING FOR THE LOVE OF GODIVA and who loves the stuff (no TJ's in Canada; Canada loses ten points). I usually prefer to use the automated machine-thingy in the lobby, and when I got there there was quite a line inside, so I decided to mail my domestic items via the machine in hopes the crowd would disperse a bit.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 As I was weighing my packages and entering Zipcodes I couldn't help but overhear three older, rather fat gentlemen conversing at the top of their lungs over by the Post Office Boxes.\r\nOld Fat White Dude #1: --all the damn liberals' fault, most of these people don't even WANT to work!Old Fat White Dude #2: No, and don't want to pay their bills either! I got a building with twenty units in it, and half of 'em don't hardly pay their rent! I'm losing money like a sumbitch!Old Fat White Dude #3: Ayep, and it ain't gonna get no better 'til we get that dumb monkey outta the Whitehouse, America done lost its mind and now we ALL got to pay for it.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Et. fucking. Cetera.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It went on and on and ON, and a couple of times when they started in on the single mothers and the damn hippies and the overeducated damn fools clogging up the job market I ALMOST said something, but hey it's a free country and they can exercise their freedom of speech and freedom of assembly all they want, right? Grr...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Finally I mailed the last domestic package and went inside and took my place in line, starting on a Customs declaration form. The three old fat white dudes brought their conversation inside and got in line behind me, continuing to yammer on about the got-damn immigrants taking all the jobs (two of the three clerks working the counter at the Post Office in question speak with heavy accents and looked distinctly pained). When the person in front of me was called I was still writing, and had a small crisis of conscience.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 See, I am a NICE PERSON and generally if I know I'm going to be a moment I'll let the person behind me go ahead, but behind me were three truly wretched examples of humanity. I was honestly tempted to let them stand there and fidget, but then I decided that if I treated them differently based on their political beliefs then I wasn't any better than they were.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"Excuse me, sir, I'm still writing on this if you'd like to go ahead,\" I told Old Fat White Dude #1, and without so much as acknowledging me he went ahead of me, and SO DID THE OTHER TWO. Revenge was mine, however, because the Indian fellow behind the counter who was ready to help the next customer finished his transaction he pointed to me and said he was pretty sure I was next.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So I went ahead and mailed my package, while Old Fat White Dudes 2 and 3 grumbled about you couldn't hardly expect no different from someone in an obscene t-shirt (my shirt today says FCKH8), and I guess the take-home lesson here is \"don't bother trying to be polite to assholes.\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/03/how-rude.html", "title": "how rude"},

I minded the store all by my lonesome for about three hours (the owners travel a couple of days a week doing CSA drops, foraging, lobbying, etc. and the one paid employee had to drive to another state on urgent business) and didn't burn the place down (GO, ME!). I effed up (maybe? I'm not even totally sure that I did) on one minor credit card transaction (think \"less than five bucks\"), and other than that I think I handled everything perfectly, which I think was better than any of us there expected. In gratitude the owners gave the MFAmily a CSA share, which was awesome as we can no longer afford to be members and have been missing it.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I am going to be helping another local business out with a banquet this weekend. Which requires that I buy some black pants that aren't of the yoga variety and a white button-down, but I'll be making enough for it to still be worth my while after clothes and gas. WHOO!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The MFA Children came home from Daddy Weekend with some type of upper-respiratory bug and immediately infected me (EFF). I had...what, maybe two weeks? Free of Asthmapalooza '10-'11 and inhaled steroids and prescription cough suppressants? And now I think I am headed in that direction once more, and my rib, which had been feeling MUCH better, is rather painful again. Shoot and heck and crap, y'all. I canNOT be coughing at the aforementioned banquet, for obvious reasons.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The surviving chicks are now eating over a pound of starter feed per day, all nine of their insubstantial little selves. It's crazy!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I have EIGHT baby cauliflowers. EIGHT.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The splinter I have had lodged in my heel for...um, well, it's been a minute, I think this splinter (or possibly it's glass of some sort?) celebrated the winter holidays with us...anyway this thing in my heel is rather painful lately, and I've already tried home surgery a FEW times with no success; I can SEE the thing under the skin (it's like a dot drawn by a very sharp pencil--TINY)\u00a0but the instant I attempt its removal my stupid bleeding disorder takes this as its cue to turn things to eleven, which makes visibility poor and grasping anything in there nigh on to impossible (I can now honestly say it generates\u00a0a loss of\u00a0blood volume\u00a0comparable to slaughtering a chicken). I've soaked my feet half to death on multiple occasions, tried the Vaseline/Band-Aid trick, all of that crap...what does one do in such a case, short of going to the doctor, which seems ludicrous over a gee-dee splinter?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The XY is recently writing all sorts of high flown appeal-to-emotion-y E-mails Of Ostentatious Crap About How Life Is Too Short\u00a0(to impress his girlfriend? To hold up in Imaginary Custody Court?) about co-parenting classes (which I first begged for, then insisted upon, then gave up on and now cannot afford--don't worry, I've told him that if he pays I and even Hotter will be there, which ought to table the issue). As evidence of their necessity he informed me that two people (one about twenty-two years old, one a decade or so older than I am) who were \"the product of divorce\" were recently dead, one of a DUI-vs.-utility pole scenario and the other over \"an allergic reaction to a medication with liver complications\" (sounds like an o-v-e-r-d-o-s-e to me). \"THINK ABOUT IT,\" his most recent missive exhorted me. I find this rather offensive, as both of the people in question (friends of HIS, not mine) were wretchedly unpleasant sluts whose custodial parents were useless deadbeats, and my kids don't have THAT problem (and yes, I\u00a0told the XY as much). By all accounts I hear the MFA Children are very well-adjusted and the only dysfunction and unseemliness in their lives comes from the XY's direction, and you don't see ME peeing in HIS yard or contributing to getting HIM fired, so I'm not quite sure what he thinks he's getting at in the first place, although I AM sure I've had just about enough of whatever it is.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/03/many-different-things.html", "title": "many different things"},

If you decide to stay mad while your insomniac wife cries herself to sleep, at least let her wake up on her own before you apologize!). I don't even remember if I said anything or not before falling back to sleep, but I had anxiety dreams after that until the alarm went off, about things like getting an invoice for repairs to Casa MFA that I had no memory of, but dire things were going to happen if I didn't pay it, and getting my oldest (who was a teenager in the dream) his first cell phone, which was promptly canceled for nonpayment of some ridiculous four-figure sum, and GEE DO YOU THINK I AM FREAKING OUT ABOUT MONEY? When my alarm went off, Hotter was all up in my grille wanting to tell me a funny story about the poultry and I grunted a couple of times, then as I was on my way out the door he was all \"I loooove youuuu\" and I was all *slam* I love how he seems to have completely forgotten that anything is wrong. Oh, wait, no I don't, it irritates the FUCK out of me!\r\n* \u00a0 I debated calling in sick but went to work anyway, figuring I would be just as miserable if not more so if I stayed home but wouldn't be paid for furious cleaning here. Everygoddamnbody proceeded to get on my nerves, with their stupid smiling faces and entreaties to \"SMILE, IT AIN'T THAT BAD.\" OH YEAH? MAYBE IT MOTHERFUCKING IS AND FURTHERMORE FUCK OFF AND DIE IN A FIRE! Yeah, it was like that. In the break room, some asinine smiling mofo announced chirpily that \"you're like, BURIED IN YOUR PHONE.\" I went with \"mm-hmm\" instead of what I wanted to say, which was \"YES, IT MEANS THAT I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE,\" and got a further three minutes of \"so whatcha DOIN?\" and \"blogs, huh?\" and \"d'ya think it'll rain today?\" for showing such restraint. I don't really know why I'm not more of a bitch to people. Nobody seems to worry about hurting MY goddamn feelings, and being nice gets you NOWHERE in life.\r\n* \u00a0 If you follow me on the Twitter, you may have already seen my lunch-break freakout. Basically I was hungry, but didn't want to buy anything for myself to eat because I didn't feel like hearing about whether SOMEone thought that was a selfish purchase or not, and whined a whole lot. Gee, if you don't already follow me on the Twitter I don't know WHAT you're waiting for!\r\n* \u00a0 Because I don't have enough to worry about, Soulless Corporate Megalith announced that they're canning half the temps, but wouldn't say which ones. Apparently they're going to give Temp Agency #1 a list and have them do the dirty work via telephone sometime today. Awesome! Not!\r\n* \u00a0 Bottom line, I am in a foul frame of mind today and honestly I think Hotter just apologized because he wants this to go away and/or realized after reading my last post that I wasn't going to shrug it off, not because he actually feels like what he did was all that wrong or has changed his mind about me being a selfish and irresponsible person (or maybe he has--I'm generally only selfish and irresponsible if he is out of coffee, which he still is, so...I dunno. Used to be I was selfish and irresponsible if he was out of cigarettes but then his doctor and I made him quit, them because they worried about him dying of lung cancer and me because I was worried I'd snap and kill him myself...maybe if I decide against divorcing his arse he needs to give up coffee?). As for the level of wrongness, it's not like I have Things To Hide; it's more like this was all a little too Shades Of My Ex-Husband, plus I am sick and goddamn tired of his trying to make our poverty MY fault every time he's hating it extra-much. I get the urge to try and make it a fuckup on someone's part, because then it would go away if that person would only QUIT fucking up, but that's bad logic unless someone is actually fucking up (by oh, I don't know, paying a bunch of stupid-assed credit-card fees the other party doesn't know about? SOMEthing like that.). The repeated assurances that \"I only looked at your PayPal account, not like, your e-mails or other private stuff!\" and the way I keep tripping up when entering my new password are not helping me be any less rage-y about the whole thing. READ MY E-MAILS IF YOU WANT. THE POINT IS NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, IT'S THAT YOU CREEPED ME THE FUCK OUT, DUDE. I guess I also kind of wonder if his recent notion that I am untrustworthy means he's Up To No Good his own self in some way I don't yet know about and projecting.

One of the females (presumably the one that's been laying, as we haven't gotten ANY duck eggs since she started escaping!) gets out EVERY SINGLE MORNING. We put her in at night, and in the morning we find her outside the pen quacking and hungry. Probably she's got a secret nest somewhere, but we have no interest in baby ducks and MUCH INTEREST in further delicious duck-egg cakes, so this is pretty obnoxious on her part. Last night we locked all of the ducks into the original MFA Coop, which is a cedar and hardware-cloth enclave that we THOUGHT was unescapable. Apparently not, though, because Houducki pried the sliding door to the nesting-box part the chickens lay in open, hopped up into that, and then made her way into \"Genpop\" from whence she escaped (somedamnhow; we don't know how she does it and she's the only one, and yes, we DO know that it's the SAME one, because I clipped her head feathers for easy identification). Do you know that it takes at least two people (if they're both adults, and three or more if you're using children as chasers) to catch one escaped duck? Hotter dragged me from my deathbed this morning to help corral our wee quacking convict. \"I'd butcher her, but look how cute, with the one crap-flap slapping,\" I said, holding Houducki up for his inspection as she did her trademark one-foot-waggle. \"Plus she's the one who lays. I want more duck-egg cakes!\" Hotter said, grudgingly stroking her little cropped head. Then we tossed her back into the pen like that would accomplish anything. I dunno. We've clipped her wings, plugged all visible holes...my next brilliant idea is to saw a length of broom-handle to \"lock\" the sliding nestbox door. Stay tuned!\r\n* \u00a0 I still haven't seen the male turkey (a.k.a. \"Loud and Crazy;\" he's named after Hotter's brother) puff up and strut, but Hotter has, and he's also seen Paul the Rooster and Loud and Crazy facing off! And Paul won, despite being on the smaller side even for a chicken! GO PAUL! Hotter said it wasn't actual fighting so much as aggressive posturing and chest-bucking, but I would have liked to see that. Apparently Loud and Crazy went running like a little punk-ass bitch. Haha!\r\n* \u00a0 The four Wyandottes, a.k.a. \"the Chic-tacs,\" appear to be bantams. I say this because they're...not growing. They make up for their tiny stature in pure viciousness, however. NOBODY fucks with the Wyandottes. Not the turkeys, not the Jersey Giants, not Paul, and not even Hotter since one flew up and clawed his leg (drawing BLOOD!). They move around in a black-and-white miniflock like ninjas, flapping and hopping animatedly and exuding a palpable menace. Seriously, they're bad news! Yesterday I clipped their wings so they couldn't pull anymore Matrix-moves on Hotter, and the snarling sounds of fury they produced as I captured them (with great difficulty) and snipped their flight feathers were...well, they were quite something. When it became apparent that they were bantams, I had high hopes of using one or more of them as broody-hens, but...I dunno. They don't seem very maternal. More like they'd eat their young...AND YOURS, TOO!\r\n* \u00a0 Poultry, they're assholes! And their assholery is contagious! Hotter said that either Snooki or JWoww seemed like she wanted to lay, and was trying to get into Genpop and use their nesting boxes (Cell Block C also has a nesting box, but it's not as cushy). I suggested that he add more straw to Cell Block C's nesting box and he said he was going to, and also that he was trying to figure out a way to raise it up \"so it'd be more like a tree.\" I said wild chickens were ground-nesters, he said there WERE no wild chickens, and it was ON! Google tells me that there ARE SO wild chickens--see? The Red Junglefowl, a.k.a. Gallus gallus. TOTALLY different from the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). I read all of that out loud to Hotter, smugly. \"OMG I'm gonna punch you!\" he exclaimed. Some people just HATE TO BE WRONG! Also, I want a Red Junglefowl or three.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I'm sick and slightly delirious and if it wasn't Sunday I'd go to the doctor. It's THAT BAD.

She was nonplussed, and insisted that she was not EITHER full of hate! But she left me alone after that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Toward the end of the shift, we were all working frantically on The Steel Structure (yes, the one that fell on the man). Management had determined that it was four inches (yes, you read that right) off of \"print\" and that we needed to move it again. The Supervisor Who Enjoys My Arse said no way, no how was he asking anyone to push the thing by hand, and so we dismantled it, piece by piece, in sections, moving the parts of each one the four inches over before reassembling it. That wasn't going fast enough, though, and so Management called on all of us to go and find as many of the very pieces of equipment they had stated were not rated for indoor use in blaming the injured man for his own misfortune as possible, to use indoors to move the thing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As we were slipping the equipment into place, someone mentioned that it was seven o'clock. \"Y'all stay,\" said The Big Boss.

The donate button seems to be up and running again, and is located at the bottom right (scroll down if you don't see it--I didn't want it to be the first thing people saw when they came here but it's there if you look!).\u00a0\u00a0 Here is where we stand currently:*\u00a0\u00a0 Y'all are awesome. We now have approximately 35% of the full cost of treatment to hopefully eradicate these fucking mites! This is particularly excellent in that the weekly treatments are billed one at a time, so we've got enough to at least get started on treating her aggressively, and hopefully we'll be able to gather the rest as we go along. Middle Child has gallantly contributed the contents of his piggy bank (\"I haff enough coins to make a dollar!\") to help save the dog.*\u00a0\u00a0 As far as how our girl is doing, yesterday I was able to purchase at least SOME of the meds she will need and get her started on the road to recovery! The lumps on her neck, back, and flanks (which we now know are full of staph--YUCK!) have already gone down by at least half with the help of strong antibiotics (Cefphopodoxime, for the curious), which she will have to take for two weeks, although she's still rather bumpy if you run your hand down her body. She is also on a three-week course of oral Ivermectin (in liquid form--apparently not very yummy judging by her reaction to the stuff) to start killing the mites, and Benadryl (1 mg. per pound of bodyweight) three times a day to help control the itching. This makes her a bit stoned, but given the shape she's in currently that might not be such a bad thing!*\u00a0\u00a0 The rest of the treatment she needs will consist of weekly Mitaban dips (the vet said she'll most likely need five of these, although they'll do more skin scrapings to monitor her progress and depending on how those look she may need more treatment). These treatments have to be done at the vet (for two reasons--one, this stuff is really toxic and they don't want us using it in our home since we have children and two, this stuff is really toxic and Isis is a bit young to be on it, so they want to treat her first thing in the morning and monitor her for signs of an adverse reaction throughout the day; if she does okay we can take her home at dinner-time).*\u00a0\u00a0 The cost of all of this...oy. The good news is that we have Isis enrolled in the local Banfield Pet Hospital's \"Optimum Wellness Plan\" (she has the one in the right-hand column, which covers a bit more than the one in the left-hand column), so we don't pay a consultation fee for each visit itself AT ALL and we get 10% off of prescriptions for her. We also pay a \"member rate\" for diagnostic procedures including skin scrapings (without the plan it would have cost $142 yesterday for the appointment and skin scraping, but with the plan we only paid $52 for that and a total of $63 for the two prescriptions, although I need to get more Ivermectin, because I only had enough on me for ten days' worth yesterday).*\u00a0\u00a0 The rest of the treatment will consist of weekly Mitaban dips and at least two more skin scrapings. The cost (to us, at the member rate) of each Mitaban dip will be about $45 (this includes the drug itself, the dip treatment, and the day's monitoring, and a HAZMAT disposal fee).*\u00a0\u00a0 So the total cost of treatment (in addition to what we've already spent) is about $300 if she responds as predicted. If not, it could be more, but hopefully not MUCH more. It may not sound like much, but we budget down to the last dime here between regular household bills and Hotter's transplant meds, plus Little Child just got new glasses and last month we spent about $350 on getting Isis through that godawful GI bug (which we had to pay full cost to treat, as they would not enroll her in the wellness plan with a \"pre-existing condition\") and enrolling her in the Wellness Plan after she recovered (there's a one-time charge of $99 for that, after which it is $24.95/month).*\u00a0\u00a0 Right now Isis is pretty itchy and miserable in between doses of Benadryl, so I'm going to cut up an outgrown t-shirt of Little Child's and attempt to alter it to fit her to hopefully minimize the chewing she's been up to and cover her bald spots (right now in addition to the little spot above her eye that you can see in the picture I posted yesterday and a few isolated ones on her forelegs she's got a large-ish patch on the back of her neck and down her back that is losing hair, and her fur seems to be thinning all over her body; the vet said that unfortunately as the mites die in her hair follicles she may lose a lot more hair before we start to see visible improvement, although as I said the lumps she was getting already look a lot better). I'll post a picture if I am successful.*\u00a0\u00a0 As for the breeder, the mama dog, and Isis's eleven littermates (none of whom have sold yet--can't imagine why not)...the mama dog did have a flare-up when the pups were born (which the breeder swore was NOT mange), and the breeder weaned the pups early due to medications she was on (he said just antibiotics, but I suspect it was more than that, as she now has fur again). The breeder has pictures of the rest of the litter on his site, and I can detect signs of early mange infestation on four of them. I plan to turn him in to the county for running an unlicensed kennel the MOMENT those puppies hit sixteen weeks (the age by which all dogs must be licensed here).

{"date": "June  1, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Today (last night? Whatever the hell, I haven't slept yet) sucked.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It started out with a day of poor sleep (I am out of Mirapex, the drug I take for Restless Legs Syndrome, and while I don't know for a fact that that is to blame, I kept having horrible nightmares and waking myself up hitting or kicking the wall beside the bed), and then on my way to work I called the XY to ask if he could pay the child support before noon so that I could deposit it before going to sleep today. He then proceeded to scream at me, because Big Child evidently told him at the last dinner visit that his teacher had had to buy him some posterboard to do a school project because Mommy didn't have the money for it and also that he thought I was short on money because we haven't had dessert lately and I had to tell him a couple of times that he couldn't have seconds at dinner. Oh, and that I was killing the chickens for meat and it made him sad. The XY was pissed because he says Big Child is \"going around telling his teacher and everyone that he's poor.\" I don't know what to do with this, because none of what Big Child told the XY (or his teacher? I don't know what he told his teacher or whether the XY talked to the teacher or not, although I definitely owe her a thank-you note) was untrue. Maybe I shouldn't have told Big Child I didn't have the money for the posterboard, but our account was overdrawn that entire week and I couldn't think of a way to not buy him the posterboard and explain myself that would have been any less damaging to him than the truth. As I asked the XY (and I'm also asking y'all, because I don't know what the hell to do with this), would it have been better to say \"oops, forgot, maybe tomorrow\" and string him along letting him think his mother just forgot about his project? Say it was because he made his brother cry and make it like a punishment? Tell him I was just too busy and let him think he's not a priority? I don't like telling the kid we're broke, but it's not like he hasn't noticed and the truth seemed like the least hurtful thing to tell him. That doesn't mean hearing the XY put my inability to provide better for my children despite a current total of three jobs I am actively working into loud, accusatory words didn't cut like a knife or that I didn't cry like a little bitch, because I did. That miserable conversation was a new low, and I also cry easily when I'm off the Synthroid (which I am also out of) and/or skipping meals and right now both of those things are factoring into my mood. Did I fuck up, though, as a mother, by telling the kid I couldn't afford the posterboard? The XY clearly thinks so but he...is biased. And also not the most qualified judge in my OR the county's opinion of what is and isn't good parenting, or he wouldn't have lost his weekend visitation (yeah, I was trying not to tell y'all that because while Stalky is not my ex-husband, Stalky does love to accuse me of slandering my ex-husband and making up everything I've ever said about the guy online, but the observant among you will have noticed that the MFA Children aren't having Away Weekends anymore and that I haven't been smited by the courts over it, so. Yeah. I will go ahead and state that the CURRENT lack of Away Weekends is NOT a result of the XY causing any of the MFA Children direct physical harm with his hands or any type of implement, mostly so that Stalky doesn't try to say that I'm accusing the XY of that currently, but that's all I'll say about it, except that having to feed the MFA Children for four extra days per month is hosing our grocery budget). So...what say ye on the matter of whether I have erred in my parenting? I'm genuinely asking your opinions; if they're not something I'll enjoy hearing, well, I'm a big girl (my demeanor today notwithstanding) and I moderate comments in case anyone (aHEM, Stalky) goes all needlessly off-topic and\u00a0ad hominem.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, I showed up at work looking like I had been recently bawling, and everyone wanted to know why, and in order to avoid further waterworks on my part I just said \"this is just my face today, don't pay it any mind,\" but I think people worried when I proceeded to weep quietly every time a socket wrench wouldn't turn without a hammer and someone else had the hammer, or I saw a little kid (lots of people shop with their little kids at midnight on the first of the month, because that's when their food stamps hit their EBT debit cards) or a grocery item we particularly need (because it's a special kind of hell to work in a superstore where rows and rows of everything your family doesn't have and needs are staring you in the face while you move shelves, especially if you skipped lunch), or I got my finger pinched in the folding cross-braces that attached to the wheel units we were jacking shelves of product up onto in order to move them during the ongoing renovation.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It was pretty embarrassing, and I'm glad I'm a temp and don't have to worry about any of these peoples' longterm opinion of me. I seriously couldn't control it, and normally I am NOT LIKE THAT, not even a little bit. In fact prior to today (last night? Yesterday? Whatever) I could count the times I'd actually shed tears in 2011 on one hand and still have a finger free to flip someone the bird with (and two of those were in the past month of suckdom). Oh well.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If you're wondering why I'm not sleeping right now, incidentally, that would be because the XY is on his way to pay the child support and I need to get that into the bank before I crash. But he overslept, and allegedly there was also a work emergency, and then also he had car trouble (plus he's never been able to tell the difference between ten minutes and an hour in predicting his arrival somewhere--it used to drive me insane when we'd be in the car and he'd tell someone \"we'll be there in ten minutes! Wait for us!\" while we were at least half an hour away). He said he'd be here at eight and currently it's a quarter to eleven. I hate him extra-much today and really hope I can at least not cry in front of him when he gets here, although who am I kidding, I'm uncomfortably certain that I will (dammit).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm so goddamned tired, y'all.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the bright side, I've lost a ton of weight lately and am almost back into my skinny jeans, and also today when I arrived at work in furious tears I actually got to demolish shit with a mallet for money, and it was so fucking sweet that I cried when we were done breaking down old shelving units and I had to give the tools back (sigh).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Also, the funny for the day: about forty-five minutes ago a police cruiser came down our street (we live in a quiet little cul-de-sac), back up it, and then another arrived and they both stopped in the middle of the road to talk at length at the end of my driveway. Finally I walked down and asked them what was going on, figuring that if this was some fresh hell and they were coming to take me away (haha) I'd just get it over with (also Middle Child is home sick for the second day in a row and my kids have seen enough of the police to last QUITE A WHILE thanks to my ugly, ugly divorce and their father's subsequent mental breakdown). I mean, I haven't broken any laws or anything, but with my luck...? Anyway I asked them if something was going on in the neighborhood and they said someone had reported a suspicious person but they'd checked and hadn't seen anything. I said \"oh okay, thank you, and in that case could I ask a favor of you? My ex, who is usually guilty of SOMEthing, is on his way over here to pay the child support and if he sees two cruisers I'm worried he'll jet and I really need that check, so would you mind...?\" They recognized me (yes, the local police force knows us, sadly) and laughed and said no problem, we'll skedaddle. Heh.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/06/the-one-where-i-lose-my-junk-due-to-life-sucking-and-lack-of-synthroid.html", "title": "the one where I lose my junk due to life sucking and lack of Synthroid"},
{"date": "August 25, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 So I think I've mentioned before that we only have one bathroom here at Casa MFA. Um...yeah. So that's three boys, a man, and yours truly all using ONE set of facilities, and I clean it at least twice a week to avoid the Pee Smell Of Doom. Hotter does not clean the bathroom. It's his Thing He Won't Do. Mine is folding laundry. We do okay together most of the time, but this means that while I was at BlogHer doing this:\r\n Figure One: An artist's rendering of MFA Mama, drunk on \"Pink Twitters\" and dancing at Sparklecorn. That there is an actual photo of my boobs covered in glitter. I'll show you my tits but not my face; I'm weird that way. Still, this is pretty much EXACTLY what I look like!\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and the boys were at home turning our bathroom into this:\r\n Figure Two: Those are stink-lines. See? Even the fly doesn't want anything to do with it. I should totes become a cartoonist!\u00a0\u00a0 As you may have heard, at BlogHer there is a lot of swag. Usually I sit at home and seethe with envy, but this year I was fortunate enough to go to the conference and enjoy the fabulous company, copious alcohol, glitter, and yes, the swag.\u00a0\u00a0 One of the companies giving out swag in the Expo Hall was Scotch-Brite. They were giving out samples of their Greener Cleaner products. I came home with (among other things) a free Greener Clean Biodegradable Absorbent Sponge, which made me happy because I'm a Scotch-Brite addict (my drug of choice is the scrubby-sponge that's yellow on one side and green on the other, but for some damn reason drugstore.com doesn't carry them and I'm all for green alternatives to non-green cleaning products, as long as they don't suck).\u00a0\u00a0 When I got home, I got an e-mail from the Scotch-Brite folks encouraging me to get in touch if I was interested in doing a review or giveaway. DOES THE POPE EAT KITTENS???\u00a0\u00a0 Scotch-Brite sent me two sets of their Greener cleaning products:\r\n Figure Three: See? One for me to review and one for ONE OF YOU!\u00a0\u00a0 I used MY half of the haul to tackle the nasty bathroom, but I'm sparing you the pictures (you're welcome). It wasn't pretty. Just take my word for it that the Greener line of products works as well as the old non-green line, and is made of win. I was particularly impressed with the Soap-Loaded Scrubbers' sudsy-ness; they fought the good fight against our nasty vanity and faucet with suds to spare!\u00a0\u00a0 If you'd like to win one of the sets of Scotch-Brite Greener Clean products pictured above (and live in the United States or Canada--sorry international readers, but I'm paying the shipping costs out of pocket and I'm poor), just leave me a comment on this post (and please make sure you include at least an e-mail address, so that I can get in touch with you if you win).

{"date": "June  1, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Thanks for the great comments so far on my last post. Two of you in a row prefaced yours with something along the lines of \"dunno that I'm qualified to remark on this as I don't have kids...\" and I wanted to clarify that I was indeed asking for EVERYONE'S opinions. Whether you've had kids or not, all of y'all have at some point BEEN kids who HAD parents and I don't think one needs to have children to comment on whether or not someone is effing up as a parent. I'm especially interested to hear what those of you with divorced parents have to say about things, as my own parents (stupidly) stayed together until I was an adult. So comment away, children or none!\r\n* \u00a0 A couple of y'all have suggested that I put up a \"Donate\" button. If anyone is specifically LOOKING for a \"Donate\" button, the little doodad on the upper right sidebar that says \"Tip Jar: Change is Good\" is the same thing (anything thrown in there goes into my PayPal account). I guess a PayPal \"Donate\" button would be more obvious, but I feel like a button that says \"Donate\" is asking for something, whereas a Tip Jar is instead more like \"hey, if you enjoy this blog here's a way to tip your blogger.\" I don't tell y'all about the ugly things in my life because I want y'all to feel like you ought to donate money, though, it's more like I have to tell SOMEbody besides poor, longsuffering Hotter or my head will explode. Also, the only time I've ever put up a \"Donate\" button (back when Isis had the mange and we couldn't afford to treat it) Stalky went NUTS and started a bunch of Twitter accounts for the purpose of talking smack on me, and there seems to be an entire cadre of trolls who delight in picking on anyone who has a Donate button up and accusing them of faking or exaggerating. I'm not saying that folks who do go with a PayPal \"Donate\" button are doing those things, just that I a) don't want anyone who comes here to read for the hell of it to feel like I'm asking them for anything and b) am leery of doing anything that would get the trolls of the world any more het up over me than they already are.\r\n* \u00a0 Yeah, I'm obviously not asleep. I don't know why that is. I'm certainly exhaused and the XY finally did show up with the child support check (I DIDN'T CRY! WHOO TITS!, but...eh. Middly is home sick today for the second day in a row with symptoms not unlike those that led to his hospitalization (although thankfully not as bad, GI-wise and therefore hydration-wise). The XY is coming by soon to take him to the doctor (which is uncharacteristically decent of him). I'm worried. etc. Anyway, um...as you were.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/06/housekeeping-notes.html", "title": "housekeeping notes"},

I'm so glad I guilted the XY into taking him in for a throat swab even though he never did spike a temp (Middly usually runs around 97.4-ish and rarely has a fever with illness) (yes, I have asked Giant Pediatric Practice about testing his thyroid, since mind sucks, but they looked at me like I had two heads for even bringing it up).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This headache I've got better not get any ideas about turning into anything.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/06/strep.html", "title": "strep"},
{"date": "June  4, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I woke up this morning wheezing with a crushing headache, and went to work anyway, because thanks to a couple of innernet fairy-godmothers I now possess a nebulizer and Albuterol amps so I was able to fix the wheezing, and the headache sucked hard but wasn't a migraine or anything (no visual disturbances, photophobia, nausea, dizziness or sense of imminent doom) (plus I hadn't had a migraine proper in AGES, although I used to get them regularly before I got my thyroid levels straight) (that's called foreshadowing--I've been off the Synthroid due to poverty, remember?).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I left Casa MFA a few minutes early, because I had errands to run. I had to get to the bank to make a deposit before banking hours started, and while we can ill afford the retail price of a single energy drink, I decided to declare a state of emergency due to the ferocity of the headache, in the hopes that a jolt of caffeine would kill it and liven my arse up a little in general. Waiting at a light to make the turn from Main Street MFA County into the shopping center where my bank is located, I saw a hound dog dart into traffic, nearly get hit (at which point I swear I suffered a small heart attack), dart the other way, stop just short of disaster, elude a man who'd gotten out of his truck to call to it, and then weave back onto the sidewalk and trot right past a screaming woman.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I made my turn and was about to get out of the MFA Minivan at the bank when here came the hound, baying excitedly, with the woman in hot pursuit. I was now close enough to see that she was barefoot and in tears. I sprinted out of the MFA Minivan and up the hill from the bank parking lot, cutting the hound off before he went back toward the main drag, and he bayed fiercely and launched himself at my ankles, latching onto my tuxedo pants. The woman took advantage of this pause in the forward motion to grab the hound and looked up at me, horrified. \"I was the one who got in his way, it's just the pants,\" I said at the same moment as she began apologizing profusely. That settled, she looked down at the dog. \"YOU COCKSUCKING ASSHOLE MOTHERFUCKER! I FUCKING HATE YOU YOU DICK!\" she bellowed, patting the dog on the head, and limped awkwardly back in the direction they'd come from, leading the dog by his collar bent over and cursing a blue streak. I examined the tear in my pants-leg and considered calling out sick in light of that and the headache and now the lack of time for buying the headache any caffeine, but decided my arse needed to work unless I was dead.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I felt kind of funny on the way into work, kind of pukey and jittery-strange, but decided it was adrenaline from the chase and my near-mauling. I was spacey and off-kilter, and I'm afraid I was of virtually no use at all to my co-workers in setting up for a high-school reunion and serving the luncheon. Right as we were busing the tables in preparation for some sort of ceremony during which the client wanted waitstaff off the floor, two things happened: all of the symptoms I normally have as a migraine aura descended on me at once and a marching band in uniform marched into the banquet hall playing Stars and Stripes Forever at full volume.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It was like a commercial for a new and wondrous prescription migraine treatment, except no cheesy spokesperson came to my rescue with a magic pill. I had to chase down my boss and tell him in no uncertain terms that I needed to leave, and drive myself the forty-five minutes home, except it ended up taking an hour.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Because I got pulled over and got ANOTHER motherfucking \"you're-too-poor-to-update-your-registration-so-here's-an-expensive-ticket\" ticket.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I shouldn't have fucking gotten out of bed today.

I think THAT'S why I didn't cry in front of him yesterday, honestly: I was more shocked than I'd be if Bumpus turned to me right now and asked if I wanted him to make me anything for dinner)(how messed up would that be though, seriously? There's nothing to make for dinner! But dogs are stupid and it would be kind of bigoted of me to blame him, since he doesn't have thumbs to use on the refrigerator door. Bygones!), Hotter and I were going to have an evening ALONE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Bow-chicka-motherfucking-wow-wow.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I mean, it's not like MOST people can't have Stealth Sex while children are asleep elsewhere in the house if they lock the bedroom door and put Pandora on, but Hotter is not MOST people and the last time we attempted this he insisted on leaving his boxers on in case the sickly child threw up and he suddenly had to dash to the rescue, the end result being like silk-dyed Easter eggs. You know,\u00a0if by Easter eggs, you mean my vagina and...yeah.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0You can totally tell the lack of sleep and all the hanging out with crude-assed construction workers working construction at night is effing up my sense of decency.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Anyway.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So the MFA Children are gone. I am unusually well-rested because the foreman let us leave an hour early this morning and I was able to actually FALL ASLEEP when I got home because everyone ELSE was sleeping instead of running around getting ready to start their day (SEVEN! HOURS! I so needed that!). Hotter, being the girl of the relationship, expects me to ask him about his day and make some conversation before I try to rip his pants off (whatever, Hotter) and so I suavely started to read a post from one of y'all's blogs that I had particularly enjoyed from my Blackberry on my 3 a.m. \"dinner break\" aloud to him, and...then I heard snoring. Because while I was sleeping he was mobilizing the troops for the day and dealing with the poultry and the garden-watering and cleaning house, and he's currently passed out on the couch and I'm totally not getting laid until next Wednesday at the earliest.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0DateFAIL.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I can't even snuggle up to him because he's draped at an odd angle across the couch.

{"date": "August 31, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 So. Yesterday I took MFA Puppy for her first Mitaban dip treatment for the mange (thank you so much to everyone who helped make that possible).\u00a0\u00a0 It. Was. AWFUL!\u00a0\u00a0 I'm glad I had read all about Mitaban and its side effects before Isis's first treatment, because that stuff pretty much kicked her ass and if I hadn't been kind of expecting at least SOME adverse effects I would have been even more freaked out than I was (I mean, looking back that doesn't seem possible, but I never doubt the ability of bad things to be get even worse anymore, heh heh heeeeghhhhh...).\u00a0\u00a0 When I picked her up from the vet Isis's eyes were very watery and she seemed a little dopey, but I figured she'd act better in familiar surroundings and be like that for an hour or two at most. After all, the vet had examined her and determined that she was fine to go home, so how bad could it be, right?\u00a0\u00a0 Well, pretty damned bad, as you may already know if you follow me on the Twitter. Not only was the poor dog acting like a drunk (complete with swaying on her feet and staring blankly around her at nothing), but she also refused to drink (fortunately she still had a good appetite--she's a freak for that canned prescription diet--and we added some reduced-sodium chicken broth to her meals to give her a bit more liquid), swelled up hugely, seemed constipated (she only pooped twice yesterday, and this is a dog who usually poops at least twice after EVERY SINGLE ONE of her three daily meals and usually a couple times in between, too) and unable to pee (she kept squatting but peeing only a few drops, if at all), and her vision seemed to be affected (judging by the blank staring and the fact that when we took her out after the sun went down she pretty much refused to move, cowering fearfully, unless you got right up in her face and then she'd act all surprised to see you, and greet you like you'd just come back from being gone). She slept most of the day (and SNORED, which is not something she's ever done before; it almost sounded like her breathing was labored), and then this morning she woke up and was (thankfully) at a solid 85%. She did her usual morning routine of stretching, yawning, then coming up from the foot of the bed to lick our faces and fling herself into my arms, then Hotter's arms, then my arms again, laying her head on our pillows and generally being a ham. \u00a0\u00a0 When we threw the blankets back to get up, though, we noticed that she'd wet the bed. Huh. She does NOT generally have accidents in the house, and I'm glad we didn't scold her because when I took her outside she peed a puddle the size of her entire body, then walked a few feet and did it again. I guess maybe the stuff made her retain water? She's not bloated anymore and is definitely a couple of pounds lighter than she was yesterday, so that's our theory. She's still a little unsteady in her gate, but only if you're looking closely, and she's bouncing around and being her usual happy, playful self.\u00a0\u00a0 The vet decided to space out her treatments to one dip every TWO weeks rather than a dip a week after observing her reaction, and apparently most dogs who have a hard time with the drug do better with subsequent treatments, so hopefully this won't happen again (if it does I'm going to have a really hard time putting her through it over and over)! We got a bit of a surprise in that the dips are slightly more expensive than I thought ($86 yesterday because we had to buy the bottle of dip plus pay for the treatment process itself--next time it'll be $45 because each bottle of dip contains enough for two rounds), but probably I just didn't pay very good attention when they initially explained it to me because I was so stunned and distraught over the diagnosis itself, so my bad (I am not putting the donate button back up--it'll probably end up being about a hundred bucks more than I thought all together, but we can tighten our belts around here and absorb that cost without failing to meet any of the human family members' needs, especially since the cost will be spread out over a couple of months). \u00a0\u00a0 In case anyone was curious, the vet said that we can skip the monthly heartworm preventative this month (since Ivermectin is the active ingredient and Isis is on a daily dose of that for the next three weeks), but to keep using the flea stuff (Frontline), and that we'll have to hold off on spaying Isis until after her treatment is complete as the Mitaban can interact with anesthesia drugs. The spaying itself CAN cause a relapse (from the stress of surgery), but hopefully not, and they may put her back on a prophylactic course of Ivermectin after her surgery to help prevent that from happening. It's VERY important that we DO spay her, though, as the stress of going through heat cycles can bring on relapses as well, and dogs who have had demodectic mange really shouldn't be permitted to breed (not that we were planning on it!) since the susceptibility tends to be hereditary, so we want to be absolutely sure there are no accidental litters (also the stress of pregnancy can, you guessed it, cause a relapse). Apparently Isis will always be a dog with \"special needs\" (see that there canine-first language, y'all? HEE!) and we'll have to keep an extra-close eye on her health for the rest of her life (I'll let you make your own jokes in your head here; very funny, Universe, oh haHA WELL-PLAYED indeed).\u00a0\u00a0 So, yeah. I didn't post yesterday because I was busy fretting and keeping the dog from walking into things, and I also kind of didn't want to share just how bad it was because I know *I* felt horrible for putting the dog through that awful treatment and didn't want any of the nice people who helped fund it to feel that way, too! \u00a0\u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/mfa_mama"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/ill-preface-this-by-saying-shes-fine-now.html", "title": "I'll preface this by saying SHE'S FINE NOW"},
{"date": "August 26, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t...those of y'all who follow me on the Twitter or are Facebook friends of mine are already aware that MFA Puppy has had a skin thang going on that recently got a whole lot worse. We really didn't have the cash to take her to the vet until after the first but this morning I looked at the dog and she looked at me and I knew I had to get her some help or I wouldn't be able to live with myself.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So I took the dog and every cent we have to the vet and the news is not good. Isis has Demodectic Mange.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 These ugly little fuckers are burrowing into her hair follicles and attacking her skin. Most dogs have at least a few of these mites on them, but because Isis was apparently infected at birth (her mother has some pretty ugly skin issues that the breeder assured us he'd had tested and were NOT mange-related; in other words he lied--the vet said he'd bet his house and his dog on that) and was recently pretty ill, her little immune system can't hack it and she's covered in infected lumpy scabs and losing her hair (she has the squamous type of infection and an early stage of the pustular kind--the vet showed me her skin scraping and pointed out the nasty little mites wriggling around on the slide, and then I dashed outside, doused myself in Purell and torched off my entire epidermis in the parking lot) (okay maybe I just fantasized about doing that; seriously my nerves may never fully recover from the sight, GAHHH BUGS!).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Because pitbulls are particularly prone to Demodicosis, and Isis's case is a fairly severe one (her lymph nodes are enlarged and the skin scraping was pretty nasty, plus she has a secondary bacterial infection), the vet said that there are only two realistic and ethical options moving forward. One is very, very expensive (at least by MFA Standards) and the other...well, we're not ready to consider that. Apparently if we were to surrender her to the local SPCA they would automatically put her down, so that's not an option either.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I swore I would never put up a donate button, because that's just troll-bait and personally I don't much care for donate buttons on blogs, and our problems (or in this case, our dog's problems) are not yours, but we've got ten days worth of ivermectin and antibiotics for the dog during which to decide whether to pursue aggressive treatment (involving weekly dips with Mitaban, which involve Isis spending a day at the vet for treatment and monitoring, and more skin scrapings to monitor progress) or...not...and Isis is a very young, very sweet dog who deserves a long and happy life. SO! You'll notice that there is now a \"Donate\" button down at the bottom of the right-hand sidebar. I didn't put it at the top because I didn't want it in people's faces when they come here; if you feel like contributing then we will gratefully accept the help (and the button will go away when we've raised enough for treatment one way or another or...well, we're going to be optimistic, so yes, when we've raised enough for treatment). If you can spare some cash and feel like donating, please specify in the \"notes\" whether you would prefer a refund or to have your donation passed along to the local SPCA in the event that we end up with more than we need for Isis's treatment.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm sorry about this, y'all. Regular blogging will resume once we figure out what we're going to do about the dog. I'm pretty sad about this and not feeling the funny. Thanks.\r\n  Figure One: This is my favorite picture of Isis (sleeping in MY SPOT, but I'll forgive her). It's a few weeks old but I don't want to post a picture of what she looks like currently. It is Not Dignified.\r\nEDITED TO ADD********************************************************************************** \r\nApparently the \"donate\" button isn't showing up for everybody. I am no techie, so if you want to contribute to the treatment fund (which now contains approximately 30% of the cost of treatment--THANK YOU!) and don't see the button, you can also PayPal funds directly to mfamamapay [at] gmail [dot] com\r\n   Figure Two: Isis thanks you. I cropped this so as not to show the very worst because it is Not Pretty but you can see a few spots above her eye there--apparently puppies catch this foulness from their mothers through the close contact of nursing and it often attacks the face and forelegs first.

{"date": "August 29, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 So because she's MFAmily, Isis hit a little bump in the road to recovery today...apparently the drugs are kind of hard on her stomach and she lost her breakfast this morning rather abruptly (no preliminary retching like dogs tend to do, just sat up and yarfed).\u00a0\u00a0 And I? Immediately completed my transformation into a crazy dog lady by calling to ask the vet if dogs could have Zofran (I mean, we have plenty on-hand between Hotter and Little Child's GI issues...the vet said no, let's not add any drugs and suggested a prescription food that should hopefully help her tummy deal with the harsh meds a little better), and whether we ought to bring her in (no, not unless she does it again tomorrow, in which case we'll have to change the antibiotic she's on), etc. I have no problem with pestering my kids' or Hotter's doctors, but I felt like kind of a dick bugging the vet. She was very kind about it, though, and Isis received a prompter callback and more sympathy than MFA people generally do from their doctors, hmm...\r\n Figure One: Y'all did this. Thank you so much.\u00a0\u00a0 On top of the GI issues, Isis seems to be having a rougher time with the mange itself...she's much itchier and losing more fur (which the vet who saw her for the mange predicted--he said it gets worse before it gets better as the mites start to die in the hair follicles).\r\n  Figure Two: She's starting to get it on her snout.\r\n  Figure Three: Her hind-end has lost a lot of hair and you can see the crusty mange-rash. Also that's a hunk of dead skin on her tail where she's got a patch too :(\r\n  Figure Four: The other side looks a little worse; she's been gnawing and as you can see tufts of fur were festooning our bed this morning (I tossed the sheets in on the sanitary cycle and we've been changing them daily because I don't have the heart to kick her out of the bed while she's sick even if she IS messy).\r\n Figure Five: This is a close-up of what the demodectic mange rash looks like--if your dog has this GET THEM TO A VET!\u00a0\u00a0 On the positive side, though, the spot on her head where the mange first appeared and where she had one of the staph-filled pustules seems like it's already getting some hair back!\r\n\r\n Figure Six: See? There is new fur coming in on that lump! She has a tiny speck of mange on her top eyelid, the poor baby, but her face in general already looks a lot better!\u00a0\u00a0 Also on the positive side, we had set her first appointment for Mitaban dipping for the first of the month due to finances, but while I was picking up her prescription today I moved it up to tomorrow morning. I want to get started REALLY killing these fucking mites and am so, so grateful that we can do that!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134868a68ff970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3664469970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3664654970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f36647a6970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134868a7009970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3664d0d970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/in-which-isis-hits-a-little-bump-in-the-road.html", "title": "in which Isis hits a little bump in the road"},

It's also a little bit crazy, since ducks are supposed to lay LATER than chickens, and none of the chicken pullets (which are actually a couple of weeks older than the ducks) have laid yet! GO DUCKIES! To answer the questions that people I talk to about this offline all seem to have: Mallard eggs are about two-thirds the size of supermarket chicken eggs and sort of olive-drabby camo-looking, the inside of them IS different from a chicken egg but not disconcertingly so (the \"white\" is much clearer, not cloudy or yellow-tinted at all as you sometimes see with store-bought and farm-fresh chicken eggs respectively, and the yolk is darker and more orange than yellow), and they make the fluffiest, richest cakes you will ever shove in your piehole (I have not tried one by itself; I've always heard that duck eggs are fantastic for baking, and y'all know me and the baking, so that's all I've done with them so far). Also, something nobody thinks to ask but that I find noteworthy? The shells are very hard and thick, about as thick as a dime is. It took me three tries to crack the first one!\r\n* \u00a0 I'm kinda worried about finances (hahaha, okay, I'm always more than \"kinda\" worried about finances, and with good reason, so let me rephrase: I'm more worried than usual about finances), because the construction project I'm working on for Soulless Corporate Megalith by way of Temp Agency #1 is going to be wrapped up VERY, VERY SOON and I don't have anything else steady lined up (yet? See, I can SO be optimistic!). I'm not utterly terrified because a) the prospect of NO MORE THIRD SHIFT makes it hard to be entirely devastated about the end of the project and b) I should have some money coming in in monthly installments starting in August. I say \"should\" because while it's by court order, the party who is the source of said funds has demonstrated an extensive disdain for court orders in the past with very little by way of negative consequences. So I dunno. We'll see. It's not \"free money,\" by the way. It's more like restitution. But the offense was so long ago now that it kind of feels like a bonus (or a bitter, bitter dividend on a truly crappy investment; potato-potahto). If in fact said funds DO materialize I would really like to save them against the inevitable day when the MFA Minivan goes to the big junkyard in the sky, but if we have to tap into them in order to keep the electricity on and avoid killing anything in the backyard to put food on the table then I guess we will. IF there is actually any money.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I really hate uncertainty.\r\n* \u00a0 Oh but speaking of things in the backyard and killing and eating: TURKEY NEWS! The biggest turkey, which we have long suspected was a male, outed himself as such to Hotter by \"displaying\" and \"strutting\" yesterday (this is what it looks like when Narragansett toms do that--ours is only about a quarter the size of the bird in the video because he's only three and a half months old). I have spent probably a combined total of an hour or so since then chasing the poor bird around the yard gobbling at him, but so far I haven't seen it for myself. DAMMIT.\r\n* \u00a0 Yes, really. Shut up. I never claimed to have any dignity left.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter left his first-ever comment on the blog! He's kind of an asshole. Oh well, unlike the last asshole I married he's at least good in the kitchen and the bedroom, so I guess I'll keep him.\r\n* \u00a0 Today when Hotter and I took our early-morning walk down to the poultry pens (it's become our morning ritual--I get home around 7:30 a.m., wake him up, and we spend a few minutes caring for the fowl and catching up on anything little ears shouldn't hear) we saw a hawk land on a large nearby tree, and SO DID ALL OF THE POULTRY. They knew EXACTLY what it was, and in the blink of an eye all of the ones that were free-range at the time (we let the little pullets, the two Jersey Giants, the four ducks and the three turkeys out first thing, then after the layers have produced all they're likely to produce we corral everybody else and let THEM out--that way nobody lays in the woods or eats anybody else and everybody gets to forage) DISAFUCKINGPPEARED and the ones that were penned up (the pen does have a cover; both pens do because otherwise we'd have no poultry and some very fat local raptors) started RAISING HELL. Paul the rooster was sounding the alarm at the top of his surprisingly powerful lungs and two or three hens were cackling hysterically. The hawk (a big female Redtail, a.k.a. \"chickenhawk,\" haha) sat on a pine tree and stared hard at the pen full of chickens for a few moments, then whooshed off empty-taloned. It was pretty cool, actually--for all that our domestic yardbirds are dumber than rocks, their instincts are pretty impressive in action!\r\n* \u00a0 I should totally be sleeping, but I read something very trigger-y that had me on the verge of a panic attack for longer than I care to admit (I haven't had one of those in over a year). I am very cautious about what I say about my ex-husband on the innernet; for one thing he's my kids' father and for another it's troll-bait (Stalky et. al seem to be almost as convinced of the XY's victimhood at my hands as he is). I wrote an entire post and then erased it, because it didn't say anything so much as it avoided saying anything. But you should go and read Belinda's post, because too many of us are silent about what mental illness can do to a marriage and a family, and judging by the comments she's gotten my experiences with my ex are straight out of the Bipolar Handbook.** I never knew that until after the fact, though, and damn if intractible/non med-compliant bipolars don't have a way of making YOU feel like the crazy one when you're still in it. If you recognize your current relationship in Belinda's brave and very compassionate words, then I'm very sorry, but it's better you know.\r\n* \u00a0 To end on a good note, I gave Middly his traditional summer mohawk a couple of days ago, and I may not be the most objective judge but I think he looks crazy-awesome. Neither of the other MFA Children are interested in having a mohawk, or any haircut at all, and during the summer vacation I let everybody do whatever they want with their hair. Big Child's 'fro is currently adding a good two and a half inches to his height and Little Child's cowlicks and curls are insane. But it's their hair (or at least it is until school starts up again, at which point everyone gets the haircut that makes them look the least homeless in MY opinion whether they like it or not).\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n** In case you were wondering, it's not libel for me to write that; one of the defenses against libel is truth and all of the XY's DSM-IV diagnoses (there were three of them as of the last time I was privy to such information) are on record in the transcripts of our custody hearings and in the XY's psychiatrist's deposition. It's not slander either, Stalky, because that's verbal and this is \"print.\" It's not defamation of character because for that to fly in a court of law I'd have to be making a false statement, and it's probably not even invasion of privacy as I am not providing any identifying information about the XY and the facts I am referencing are a matter of public record (and if you can't find it that says worse things about your sleuthing skills given everything you know about my identity\u00a0than it does about my veracity, S.).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAFU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRyn0ubXfKo", "http://ninjapoodles.blogspot.com/2011/07/part-where-we-stop-dancing.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/07/partly-crappy-with-a-chance-of-bullets.html", "title": "partly crappy with a chance of bullets"},

I don't know if I could sit through the \"start-of-shift safety meeting,\" with the umpteen additional disclaimers there are sure to be, without calling bullshit and then they would DEFINITELY fire me (as opposed to only MAYBE firing me for a third strike--a few people now have had three and stayed, plus they're still hiring and we're nearing the end of the project so it's crunch-time) (the crunch of bones) (shudder).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I don't know if this is right, and good, and healthy (I haven't slept, I'm definitely nowhere near safe to drive, I'm protecting my family from CERTAIN loss of income and myself from from a total mindfuck, no lube, as well as the sorts of potential injuries that come with working with tools and industrial balers and assholes who think that thirty people ought to be able to shift giant steel structures) or just plain stupid (we can't afford a loss of income at all, not even a little bit, we have bills to pay plus Hotter needs the dentist in ways I don't even want to DISCUSS and the MFA Minivan needs work and I am still toothless my own self...) and self-indulgent in the extreme (so what, my back hurts and I'm tired and morally-conflicted about working even indirectly for Soulless Corporate Megalith in the first place: ma nishtanah). Also Middly has strep (again).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Either way I'm not going. Half the reason I haven't slept is that dead things give me the willies (why yes, yes I DO kill, gut, and butcher chickens when I have to and yes, it DOES bother me but not nearly as much as stumbling upon something that's just up and died of natural causes, oddly enough--perhaps that's my need for some semblance of control manifesting?) and not only did poor Blind Boris go to the great roost in the sky, but it's also so damn hot that the broody hen died on her nest, of apparent heat exhaustion.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Birds sure do look extra-dead when they've Gone To Their Reward.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Despite that, Hotter has a weak stomach (which I am not saying in any kind of insulting sense--after complete gastroparesis prior to his transplants resulting in the need for constant NG-drainage and IVs he's lucky to be alive and I will take him, weak stomach and all, even if it means being the resident undertaker) and so I got to deal with TWO dead bodies today.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The other half of why I haven't slept, too, is the way that man screamed when The Steel Structure fell on him. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It's just not a very good day when I can truthfully say that actual dead bodies were only the SECOND most disturbing thing I've seen.

PEEEEEPS!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Picked up my six babies (plus an extra one that I felt sorry for, because I am daft like that).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Talked to my only living relative I speak to, because THEIR only living relative had died. Yes, technically that made the deceased a relation of mine but as they were an utter bastard who considered my very existence a miscegenistic sin against all that is good and holy despite my literally rescuing them one time WHILE I WAS INJURED from a HURRICANE I did not count them as family and you do not need to feel badly for me on account of their death (and there will be no funeral roadtrip). This effed up my entire morning, actually, because I had to wait until it was at least VAGUELY civilized to call my relative on the other side of the globe (and I still woke them and their caregiver). Also my relative is rather senile and so I got to break the news all over again (twice) after I denied being THAT young female relation, no, not that one either, NO NOT YOUR EX-WIFE GAHHHH, NO, I AM NOT, AMNOTAMNOTAMNOT (said ex-wife is a twat).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Got rejected for several jobs via e-mail at stop-lights while driving to the hippie food coop TWO HOURS LATE to volunteer in exchange for cosmetically-challenged veggies and pleasant company (oh how I love me some hippies).

That inhuman wail you heard from the direction of the Eastern Seaboard this morning? Uh, sorry 'bout that.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Talked Hotter through logging into my e-mail and Eventbrite while driving and had him RSVP as me for a rooftop cocktails thingy with a *cough* blog-sponsor-ma-doodle-thingy in San Diego next August (so hopefully my arse gets a job soon and can make it out there).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Volunteered at the hippie food coop, where the boss-lady got to see me in full-on CLEAN ALL THE THINGS mode and seemed to get a kick out of it.

Stole one of Hotter's lagers and OMG BEST FOOD EVER. Yes, those lagers he bought for NYE because he was HAVING A DRINK (his first in five years, sanctioned by his various specialists).

And he didn't need to lose any MORE weight (seriously? I'm starting to wonder if he's manorexic or something), but looked like he'd lost ten pounds in three days (the dog, however, found them and doubled in size, holy hell) anyway, so I ended up taking him to fucking Burger King at midnight. Which was exactly what I wanted to do after getting PWNED by New York City today and then flying on a plane and driving the forty-five minutes home from the airport. \u00a0\u00a0 Did I mention that Hotter's kind of a dick? Okay.\u00a0\u00a0 So we were on our way to Burger King and we heard this PSA-thing on the radio that sounded to my travel-addled ears like it was saying that one in eight Americans is a struggling hooker, and then Hotter looked at me like I was the dick when I said \"the percentage of struggling hookers in the general population is THAT HIGH? Wow!\" (really it was one of these things saying how one in eight Americans is struggling with HUNGER) and Hotter was like \"WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?\" and I was all \"it's called making conversation,\" and then during his stunned silence I heard enough of the thing on the radio to realize my error. \u00a0\u00a0 Hunger is certainly no laughing matter, but honestly I was still pretty relieved, because if one in eight of us was a struggling hooker, then with the successful hookers also factored in that's probably like, a quarter of the American population selling their ass (because you have to consider the other side of the bell curve, obviously), and call me old-fashioned, but that seems a little excessive to me.\u00a0\u00a0 Good night.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/mfa_mama", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20639592860", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20644963590", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20653073235", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20656341194", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20658081208", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20658128029", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20665792328", "http://feedingamerica.org/faces-of-hunger/psa-campaigns/1-in-8/radio.aspx"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/you-probably-want-to-hear-about-blogher-but-instead-heres-what-happened-on-the-way-to-burger-king.html", "title": "you probably want to hear about BlogHer, but instead here's a story that's not really about hookers"},

I went to the feed store for poultry feeds, and they had old-fashioned wooden-handled rock candy pops. I got three, swung by the drugstore, and called the boys to the door. \"Purple, blue, or green?\" I asked Little Child, who got there first. \"PURPLE! And I know what it is! It's LOLLIPOPS!\" he yelled, jumping up and down, because usually I bring them dumdums when I've been to the bank. When he saw what I pulled out of my purse his eyes widened. Middly chose green and Big Child blue, as I knew they would, and it was the best expenditure of $0.69 x 3 ever.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The rain ought to come down any moment from the look of it outside (damned low-pressure stupid-head weather mothereffer...) and we have all of the ingredients for BLTs for lunch.

{"date": "March  1, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 This morning I woke up feeling mysteriously like ass (I think my blood pressure was too low, I dunno, SOMEthing wasn't right) and stumbled back to bed after the boys left for school. A couple of hours later I got up and staggered down the hall, pulling on my coat to go and check on the chickens.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Outside, I ran into Hotter, who had gone to the mailbox to retrieve a check we were expecting. \"It came,\" he said, waving the envelope, \"do you still want to go food-shopping?\" I grunted in the affirmative and went and got the eggs out of the chicken hutch, then went back to the house just as Hotter was shutting the door. \"You have your keys, right?\" he said casually. \"I locked the door!\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Now, Hotter is, as he often tells the MFA Children, \"blind in one eye and can't see out of the other,\" so maybe the whole \"coat over pajamas, hair not brushed, not wearing glasses\" thing wasn't enough to tip him off to the fact that I wasn't quite ready to leave right that very moment, but...seriously?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Seriously.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So there we were, locked out of the house, without phones or ID, plus I had to pee and did I mention our landlords are currently in CHINA?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 After I was done yelling at Hotter I found an unlocked window, ripped the screen off it, and prepared to climb through (no small feat as said window was five feet up a brick wall, but I figured that was better than breaking one of the other--locked--windows). Hotter offered to try and climb in, but as his donor organs are housed in his abdomen I didn't think HIM scrambling through the thing (which would require some balancing on one's belly half-way through) was a very good idea. Actually, I think my exact words were \"no, because then you'll break one of your donor organs and I'll have to worry about THAT.\" I am not my most fabulous self moments after waking up under the best of circumstances.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So I gave Hotter the eggs from my pockets, declined his offer to boost me up (I still outweigh him), hauled a plastic bucket over to stand on, opened the window, and hoisted myself up to balance on my belly while I reached inside to pull something over to break my fall (the room inside the window has hardwood floors). Hotter grabbed my feet. \"DON'T TOUCH ME, I'VE GOT IT!\" I yelled. Hotter began to PUSH on my feet. \"STOP IT, DON'T HELP, LEAVE M--\" and then he gave a shove and toppled me the rest of the way over, so that the windowsill scraped my entire body from the waist down, which at least slowed my descent straight down onto my face.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 How is YOUR day shaping up?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/03/so-pretty-much-the-only-reason-hes-alive-is-that-im-too-pretty-for-prison.html", "title": "so pretty much the only reason he's alive is that I'm too pretty for prison"},

My very wonderful husband has been cooking and cleaning and boy-wrangling and I've mostly been curled up in a heap with the dog sleeping or reading an old-fashioned paper book (at LaGuardia, after New York owned me, I got myself a consolation prize in the form of Cleopatra's Daughter, by Michelle Moran, and it was JUST what the doctor ordered). Other than that I've taken the dog (who has exactly doubled in weight since we got her) to the vet for boosters and to have a zit-thing looked at (apparently it's juvenile pyoderma, and a very mild case at that--she's had a total of five bumps and never more than two at once--that the vet said she wouldn't even suggest treating with medicated shampoo except that pitbulls are very prone to skin problems, so I've got some shampoo to use on her mostly as a precaution) and I'm completely freaking exhausted STILL.\u00a0\u00a0 I know you want to hear about BlogHer, and I'll post about it tomorrow, promise and swear, but right...yawn.\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of you?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mypetsdoctor.com/juvenile-pyoderma-in-puppies"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/no-blogher-talk-here-yet.html", "title": "no BlogHer talk here (yet)"},
{"date": "August 11, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 BlogHer. Damn. Where do I even begin? So many people have written better recaps of BlogHer than I ever could, and it was everything everyone has described and more.\u00a0\u00a0 The trip got off to an alarming start when my flight into LaGuardia got canceled due to bad weather in New York (or so they said; possibly there was a giant squid involved and the weather story was some kind of elaborate ruse). The ticketing agent was all \"I can give you a refund, or get you on a flight tomorrow\" but it was already Thursday and I was like \"no, I need to get to New York TODAY\" and he said \"well everything is full so my best advice would be to drive.\" So I called home and got Hotter to book me a ticket on the next train from MFA-ville to NYC, which would put me in Penn Station around midnight, and went back to the ticket counter and asked for a refund because I'd found another way. The agent was all \"why? You don't want to fly to New York\" and I was all \"dude, I would love to fly to New York but you just told me that wasn't happening\" and he was all \"but ONE SEAT just opened up on a flight that leaves in two hours\" and I was like \"fiiiine\" and he said I didn't have to fly to New York, I could go ahead and take the train and I was all \"WHAT THE FUCK, WHEN DID WE GET MARRIED\" and he printed my ticket out and handed it to me all surly-like.\u00a0\u00a0 The crossdressers kind of wanted to go back and kick his ass but I placated them with my Rachel Simon book:\r\n Figure One: I'll be reviewing this book on here at some point, but the crossdressers wouldn't share and I didn't want them to cause a scene and get us thrown off the plane.\u00a0\u00a0 Right before we got on the plane, I saw this tweet, which did not inspire confidence. And Jenny was totally right. WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT, ANYWAY? Please come over here and collect your kick to the babymaker, courtesy of me.\u00a0\u00a0 On the ground in New York City, I caught a Super Shuttle to the Hilton. This was my first time riding the Super Shuttle, and I wasn't expecting them to card me. I also wasn't expecting to meet my first fellow conference attendee right as the shuttle was pulling up, and I think I got a little flustered juggling my cards and my driver's license. This would bite me in the ass later. On the way through Queens the shuttle passed the XY's ancestral apartment, which, well, what are the odds. I think that was New York's way of tossing the gauntlet, but I ignored it and proceeded to grow old in the reprint line (because my badge was effed up). The one good thing about that was that I met DomestiChick standing on line (see, that's how they say it in New York), and even though she's ridiculously pretty I liked her just as much in person as I do on the Twitter.\u00a0\u00a0 After that I was starving and Miss Britt assured me that the Halal cart outside was the way to go. Man, was she ever right! SO good. Then it was on to The People's Party, where the crossdressers and I got a non-weird hug from Miss Britt's husband Jared (there was much discussion of whether a man hugging a woman was weird or not; I voted no because apparently I have no boundaries but Britt thought yes and pointed out that it made him seem either like he was trying to have sex with the hug-ee or else was...not...if you know what I mean...and then I changed my mind because Jared is awfully thin and hipster-ish for a heterosexual and then we all drank Pink Twitters and forgot our differences) and met the infamous Avitable:\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0Figure Two: At no point did the crossdressers go anywhere near his balls. I made sure of that.\u00a0\u00a0 We also had the pleasure of conversing with the one and only Anissa and her husband Peter, who were every bit as awesome as you probably picture them. This was really neat for me because Hotter lurrrves him some Anissa and followed her recovery closely (he had a stroke six years ago himself) so texting him and rubbing that in his face was big fun (I never said I wasn't an asshole; we're well-matched like that). \u00a0\u00a0 After The People's Party we high-tailed it over to Columbus Circle for the Schick Intuition Kiss & Tell shindig, which...well, that was pure insanity. Like crawling with celebrities, open bar with drinks served in honey-coated glasses, models shaving in a goddamn indoor waterfall and cute boys with trays of cheesecake lollipops NUTS! My Blackberry crapped out so no pictures of the coolest thing I saw at BlogHer (namely Caitlyn Moe playing the electric violet with DJ Mia Moretti; holy HELL was that amazing!), but just before it died the crossdressers insisted I take their picture with one of the models. So I did, because they're belligerent drunks:\r\n Figure Three: The crossdressers hamming it up with one of the Schick models. And a razor. \u00a0\u00a0 Then Gavin Degraw played, and y'all I didn't even know who that WAS until he started singing and then I was like \"OH SHIT, THAT DUDE IS FAMOUS.\" I don't get out much.\u00a0\u00a0 The sessions at BlogHer...well, there are official live-blog posts and podcasts of those, so I'll just say that I have a total girlcrush on Liz Henry which was (most likely) not the purpose of the fighting spam and hackers session but oh well, the session on writing about sex made me feel very vanilla, I laughed, cried, and handed around tissues from my purse at the one on grief, loss and tragedy, and OH MY GOD the memoir and poetic license one was SO FUNNY.\u00a0\u00a0 And then I got sexually harassed by Mrs. Potato Head:\r\n Figure Four: Yeah, you thought I was lying, didn't you? I couldn't make this shit up! WHY MRS. POTATO HEAD, WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE!\u00a0\u00a0 Saturday was the big Kirtsy Art Auction Thingy, where the floor signs were rather saucy...\r\n Figure Five: Hopefully there was no camera embedded in this thing!\u00a0\u00a0 ...and I completed my one and only mission, per Tara of BiteTheBedbugs:\r\n  Figure Six: YES!!!\u00a0\u00a0 to be continued... \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.threeseven.ca/2010/08/blogher-10.html", "http://thebloggess.com/?p=7847", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401348625e796970c-pi", "http://twitter.com/TheBloggess/status/20328255919", "http://domestichick.com/", "http://twitter.com/Domesti_Chick", "http://miss-britt.com/", "http://www.avitable.com/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f302806f970b-pi", "http://freeanissa.com/", "http://twitter.com/mayhewp", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013486261220970c-pi", "http://liz-henry.blogspot.com/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f302a56f970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013486262e84970c-pi", "http://twitter.com/bitethebedbugs/status/20280809342", "http://www.bitethebedbugs.com/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134862631db970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/the-crossdressers-do-blogher-and-i-tag-along-for-the-ride.html", "title": "the crossdressers do BlogHer (and I tag along for the ride), part one"},
{"date": "August 12, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Today Little Child and I hopped in the MFA Minivan for a trip over the river and through the woods to the University Hospital Over The Hill where he sees his world-renowned GI specialist.\u00a0\u00a0 This was our first trip there in a long time; things have been as stable as they've ever been, which is to say that with just the right care Little Child continues to look as healthy as any other slightly-shrimpy almost five-year-old. I have grown to like Little Child's GI doctor a lot. He's a kind, grandfatherly man who used to irritate the living bejesus out of me. Not because he was rude or inept--people come from all over the world to bring their children to see this man because he's a legend in his field--but because he wasn't actively working to figure out what was wrong with my baby. His approach to treating Little Child hasn't changed, but I guess I have.\u00a0\u00a0 When Little Child was tiny and alarmingly ill, we bounced from specialist to specialist, and sometimes they would remark on some aspect of his labwork or clinical presentation that clued us in to why he is the way he is, or discover something (such as the elemental diet, the daily proton-pump inhibitors and laxatives, the chronic iron deficiency requiring aggressive supplementation) that would help improve his quality of life, help him grow when he stalled out, keep him out of the hospital through the winter. What they never managed to do was tie it all together in a way that makes sense. \u00a0\u00a0 I've written about this before, the question mark that hovers over Little Child. There was a time when it threatened to crush me. The things we know (from the GI doctor - he has reflux and intermittent gastroparesis and can only tolerate an elemental diet in quantities sufficient to sustain growth, from the geneticist - he has Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, hypermobility type and \"something else syndrome-y going on, we'd like to follow him but at this point since the urine test for MPS was negative we just don't know,\" from the cardiologist - he's got a murmur, yes, but it's a benign one and his aorta looks great, from the hematologist \"a mild PAI-1 deficiency and macrocystic anemia,\" from the orthopedist - metatarsus adductus, from the dentist - amelogenesis imperfecta and delayed dentition, from everyone - damn he's cute!) were, at first, overwhelming. I just wanted someone to tell me everything that was wrong with him, so that we could either fix it or plan around it, give me a prognosis, help me find him some peers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The last time we saw the GI doctor he said that most children with Little Child's type of symptoms grow out of them by the age of five, and the ones who worsen instead of improving tend to end up with a diagnosis of something awful like chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction or mitochondrial depletion syndrome. I took that to mean that at this stage of the game (Little Child will be five in about a month) we would Know Something.\u00a0\u00a0 Here is what we know: Little Child weighs thirty-six pounds and is thirty-nine inches tall. His blood pressure is 81/42. He's very cute. And his GI status is the same as it was a year ago, and a year before that, and a year before that.\u00a0\u00a0 \"What do you think,\" I asked the doctor today, as he was palpating Little Child's abdomen and remarking on the nice, normal size of his colon since we started him on the Miralax. \"You mentioned that most children grow out of this around five...\" He smiled \"Did I? Well, that's true, but some take longer than that. He's finally growing nicely and he's looking great so I'm not worried; the main thing is that he isn't any worse.\" I mentioned that Little Child's GI tract still screeches to a complete halt when he's even a little bit sick. \"There's nothing we can do for the \r\ngastroparesis that we aren't already doing, in my opinion,\" he replied \r\n(we sometimes use temporary courses of erythromycin when Little Child is\r\n \"stopped up\" as a motilin-agonist, and this doctor doesn't like to use \r\nReglan, which he says doesn't work well and has some nasty side-effects,\r\n but there's not really anything else he feels is safe and effective to \r\nuse beyond the Prevacid and Miralax, and Zofran as needed). \"We could run more tests but those wouldn't be any fun for him and wouldn't change the way we treat him so I'm just going to say that he's allowed to get sick and feel yucky once in a while. Keep doing what you're doing and bring him back in a year, or sooner if there's a problem the pediatrician doesn't want to handle.\" I asked if we'd be able to lose the g-tube any time soon, and mentioned that we were having a hard time getting the school system to accept responsibility for it. \"Well, will he drink the Neocate?\" Heck no, I said, that stuff is nasty. \"So we leave it in. It doesn't seem to bother him, and if the school wants more paperwork that doesn't bother me.\" And he tickled Little Child's belly and gave him a hug and a high-five.\u00a0\u00a0 Two years ago, this kind of thing drove me nuts. Three years ago, I was certain that the lack of concrete answers meant that nobody knew what they were doing and my baby was going to die. Today, though, it made me smile. I don't know how, or when, but I've come to a point of being okay with uncertainty. It's like the flight of the bumblebee--it doesn't any more sense if you work yourself into a frenzy over the physics than it does if you simply acknowledge it and go about your business. I don't know why that used to feel like failure or how I managed to let go of the need to know and start being present in the moment rather than adrift in the hypothetical, but I'm so glad I did. He may not have \"fixed\" Little Child, but Little Child's GI doctor has helped me see my son less as a question mark and more as an everyday miracle, buzzing along. I'm so glad.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/2/7/the-purgatory-of-in-between.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/the-flight-of-the-bumblebee.html", "title": "the flight of the bumblebee"},

{"date": "August 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I'm still sleepy but starting to emerge from my fog; only three more days of Levaquin to go and they can't be over soon enough! My blogging mojo seems to be a casualty of the war on bugs, and while I owe y'all some reviews, I don't feel like I can do Rachel Simon's fabulous book justice quite yet (beyond why yes, her book was excellent. Go read it!) and I'm not up to staging photos of MFA Puppy's adorable food and water bowls, either.\u00a0\u00a0 So I've mostly been reading, and in branching out from my usual Bloglines staples, I've encountered a lot of good writing buried under bad grammar and usage. Here (from an actual professional, no less) are some things you shouldn't do in your blog if you want to avoid stylistic errors reducing your readability:\u00a0\u00a0 Ask me to \"bare with you.\" I might bear with you if you're having a hard time, but asking me to \"bare\" with you is a bit forward on a first date (see? When you use bare as a verb you're suggesting we get naked).\u00a0\u00a0 Tell me you're afraid of lightening. A lightning strike can kill you, but unless you're already underweight, lightening isn't a half-bad idea.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of which, your pants might get loose if you lose enough weight, and you might BE loose if you walk around without pants, but if you're talking about an inability to find something or an attempt to shed it, stick with one o.\u00a0\u00a0 If you do lose something, you might ask where it is. If you lose the pants you were going to wear, pick another pair.\u00a0\u00a0 There is a place. Their is a possessive. They're is a contraction of the words \"they\" and \"are.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Your website as a whole is a blog. Your website and another website or websites together are blogs. You write blog posts. You're welcome.\u00a0\u00a0 See how I did that? You're with an apostrophe is a contraction of the words \"you\" and \"are.\" Your is possessive, indicating something that belongs to you.\u00a0\u00a0 Affect and effect are tricky, so I'm less judgmental about these two, but it makes me smile when I see someone use them correctly. Generally affect is a verb and effect is a noun, but not always because the English language is tricky that way. Here's a good resource if you're confused.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of judgmental, there's no e after the g, even though it looks wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 Here's another tricky one: either/or, neither/nor. It makes me stabby when I see these mixed at random.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, while LOL has its (<-- no apostrophe; with an apostrophe it becomes \"it is\") place in texts, on Twitter, and on I Can Haz Cheeseburger, I really think using it in a blog post (or more than once in the same text or tweet) is overkill. Ditto with emoticons--I'm not against them in non-academic writing, and I use them in texts and on Twitter, but if I see them all over your blog it's a turnoff.\u00a0\u00a0 How about you? Do you have any pet peeves (of the spelling or grammar variety) you'd like to see wiped off the face of the blogosphere?\u00a0\u00a0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lightening", "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-difference-between-affect-and-effect.htm", "http://www.wsu.edu/%7Ebrians/errors/either.html", "http://icanhascheezburger.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/pet-peeves-in-spelling-and-groanworthy-grammar-.html", "title": "pet peeves in spelling and groan-worthy grammar "},
{"date": "August 21, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 To fully appreciate this, you need some background information. It's worth it, though. Here's the least you need to know:*\u00a0\u00a0 Casa MFA is situated in a...I don't want to name any one regionally-maligned race/ethnicity because that's not what this is about in the least, but suffice it to say that in one of the lily-whitest places to live in a very Southern state, we ended up moving into a lovely old neighborhood where we are the ONLY white family for several blocks around. I rather like this, as I worry about the MFA Children becoming cracker-fied in their top-rated yuppy-scum school system. I think getting a taste of being the Other is therefore good for them. But we? Are the minority in a neighborhood where pretty much everyone else is someone's sister or cousin or remembers their mama whuppin' them in the backyard one Fourth of July.*\u00a0\u00a0 While our immediate neighbors to either side and across the street are cordial to us and will lend us extension cords and exchange pleasantries at the mailboxes, anyone not bound by proximity to associate with us pretty much declines to do so. They know we're here, because we kind of stand out, and we know them by their vehicles (and wave when they drive by). The running joke Hotter and I have is that we're the trashiest folks in the neighborhood and they hate us for having a chicken coop and a vegetable garden in the front yard (the backyard borders some woods, whose inhabitants would probably like to eat both the garden and the chickens, so we put them up front).*\u00a0\u00a0 Our local Kroger ran an insane sale recently featuring, among other things, this for $0.39 per bottle. I bought some to drink after exercising or mowing, and because if it was calorie-free and $0.39 per thirty-two ounces, I would pretty much buy bottled horse piss.*\u00a0\u00a0 My husband and soulmate, as a former diabetic, has had a number of laser surgeries for retinopathy of diabetes and has very little peripheral vision, particularly on the left side since his stroke, and can't see a damned thing in dim lighting. The stroke affected his balance a bit. He also lost twenty pounds during his Surgi-ma-callit-ectomy and Massacree that spanned from mid-Spring to early this summer, and none of his pants fit, and he doesn't currently own a belt (we're planning to go and buy him one tomorrow).*\u00a0\u00a0 Our neighborhood has no sidewalks, just a narrow little blacktop road with deep ditches on either side.*\u00a0\u00a0 The MFA Children are with their father this weekend.\u00a0\u00a0 So it came to pass that the dog had to pee at one in the morning, and having no reason not to (and both still being up), my husband and I took our pitbull puppy for a walk. She's pretty good on a leash but we had to pass a roadkilled toad (which on top of being disgusting, would be poisonous if she got into it) that the dog was interested in, and I handed him the bottle of Powerade I'd been nursing since mowing most of the lawn this afternoon in order to wrangle the dog with both hands (he meanwhile was bitching because that only left him one hand to hold his pants up with).\u00a0\u00a0 Then a car barreled around the curve in the road just ahead of us (hi, Mazda with the one crumpled fender!) and I yanked the dog over to the right side of the road. Hotter was closer to the left side, and in keeping the dog from getting smooshed I didn't see him step off the edge of the blacktop (I usually let him know if he's near a curb, step, ditch or sharp incline). There are streetlights here, and I could see perfectly well, but remember, Hotter can't see in dim lighting. As he started to lose his balance, he evidently let go of his pants.\u00a0\u00a0 So the end result was that in the gleam of the neighbor's car's headlights, it probably appeared that the neighborhood's only white residents were out at one in the morning walking their pitbull, when one of them saw the car approaching and dropped his shorts, then fell in the ditch clutching a bottle of Purple Drank. Fortunately, I don't think our lead-footed neighbor saw the other one wet her pants laughing in the rearview (and no one was injured).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.us.powerade.com/zero/#/grape", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=purple%20drank"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/this-story-probably-isnt-worth-the-buildup-but-damn-it-was-funny-or-maybe-you-had-to-be-there.html", "title": "this story probably isn't worth the build-up, but damn it was funny, or maybe you had to be there"},

The bad news is, my poor kid has a severely infected ear and has lost his ability to hear in the affected side. Hopefully this is temporary and will resolve with (actual, ordered-by-a-medical-professional, from-a-pharmacy) treatment. So I have a child home from school whimpering about his very sore ear, an antibiotic prescription I couldn't really afford to somehow pay for (I'm already not going to be able to keep my own damn health insurance because of what it cost to take said kid to the doctor, so I guess I'll just use some of the rest of the money that had been earmarked for that but JESUS, REALLY?), and a severe case of the \"will-cut-a-bitches.\" Also probably a court date sometime in the non-immediate future, because my ex-husband IS in fact stupid enough to sue me for refusing to condone his violation of the \"no-overnights\" clause HE insisted be included in our custody order by sending my kids to CATHERINE!'s house for any more weekends (although that wouldn't be ALL bad because the look on the judge's face should be priceless).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Screw you, Monday.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/04/ear-update.html", "title": "ear update"},
{"date": "August 22, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 A few months ago, we started ordering from Angel Food Ministries. I'd heard about them online, and read reviews both good and bad, but it finally came down to our budget getting really grim in April and us therefore deciding that we'd give it a try even if the quality wasn't all we might hope for.\u00a0\u00a0 The first month we were pleasantly surprised to find that the food is indeed \"restaurant quality\" as advertised; Hotter is a chef and I used to cook in an upscale restaurant many moons ago so we're food snobs and we'd definitely notice (and I'd definitely tell you) if we were getting poor cuts of meat or freezer-burnt veggies. So far, though, that has definitely NOT been the case! We've been very happy with all of the food we've gotten, and while you may be able to do as well price-wise if you clip coupons and watch sales like a hawk, I enjoy the predictability-factor of buying from Angel Food Ministries and the fact that you're getting staples with which to cook your own meals for the most part rather than processed foods that may have more sodium, allergens, or seasoning than you want. Instead of going on and on about why this program is so great for my family, I'm going to cut to the chase Q&A-style, and address the stuff I was most concerned about before trying Angel Food Ministries for myself, point out a couple of things I didn't know from my own research, and show you a typical AFM menu to compare against actual pictures of the food we got this month.Q. Is the meat nasty? Some online reviews are a little scary.A. Nope, not at all! We've found that the steaks are very tender (yes, they use chemical tenderizers, which we don't have a problem with, but if you do don't say I didn't warn you about the MSG), the chicken nuggets are nice, whole chunks of chicken breast without those nasty gristly clumps you sometimes get, and the sausages (the month that we got some) are nicely flavored and not overly fatty. I'm not a huge fan of pork in general, but even the porkchops we've gotten from AFM are fairly lean and nicer than a lot of the ones I've seen in supermarkets.Q. How are the veggies?A. Excellent! They all seem like they're frozen very fresh, and you're not getting a lot of broccoli stem pieces or carrots with the ends on or anything like that (as I've noticed with some of the inexpensive frozen veggies I've bought at the grocery store), and the corn doesn't tend to have cob-bits in it. They aren't in \"steam-packs,\" so you have to cook them on the stove (although I imagine you could nuke them--personally I prefer not to cook with the microwave), but they're good quality and we've been impressed with the flavor.Q. Have you ever gotten broken eggs? What size are the eggs?A. No, every time we've gone to pick our order up we've seen the volunteers who assemble the boxes checking the eggs, and we've never gotten any with cracks in them. We've always ended up with \"Medium\" eggs.Q. How is the shelf-stable milk?A. Well, you don't want to drink it without chilling it first. If you have keen tastebuds you may notice that it has a flavor reminiscent of those little half and half tubs you get with diner coffee, which I'm guessing has to do with the way its preserved. If it's cold, though, and you're cooking with it (yes, I've used it for baking) or using it in cereal, you probably won't be able to taste any difference.\u00a0\u00a0 Some things you may not expect:*\u00a0\u00a0 There is a $2.00 fee for ordering online with a credit or debit card. You can get around this if you make an appointment at the host site and pay in person.* \u00a0 You can buy Angel Food Ministries food with food stamps. This isn't something I've personally had any experience with, so I don't know how that works, but thought it was worth mentioning.*\u00a0\u00a0 The food does not come with cooking instructions, although those are available for some items online here. If you're not an experienced cook I'd suggest scoping out instructions on comparable items at the local grocery store if you are stumped on cooking times and temperatures.*\u00a0\u00a0 The frozen dessert items may not be cooked. We've only gotten one frozen dessert item (a pumpkin pie), but it was NOT precooked (fortunately I checked online before messing with it--apparently some folks thawed it and ended up with a mess on their hands--and found instructions).*\u00a0\u00a0 What you get may differ from what you see on the menu. This is something we've only experienced once, and it happened this month. The menu showed \"1.5 lb breaded chicken breast chunks\" and we got boneless wing fritter pieces instead. I was a little bummed because we love the chicken breast chunks, and wing-meat is higher in fat, but Hotter and Middle Child are both underweight so I plan to serve these to them on nights when the rest of us have breaded chicken breast nuggets or tenderloins from the store (shhh).*\u00a0\u00a0 You can find coupon codes online for 5-15% off either your entire order or a particular \"box.\" ALWAYS search for coupon codes, y'all!*\u00a0\u00a0 You don't really need to bring boxes/bags. Or at least you don't at the host site we use. They've always had boxes ready and this month they had official AFM boxes and a strapping young volunteer carried mine to the MFA Minivan for me (in fact he pretty much insisted).*\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently in the past, you had to buy a Signature Box to get any of the special meat or veggie boxes, but not anymore--we got a steak box once in addition to the Signature Box and were happy with the quality.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, here is this month's food menu picture:\r\n  Figure One: Picture menu from the August 2010 Angel Food Ministries Signature Box\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And here is what we got:\r\n\r\n  Figure Two: What we got in our box. The spaghetti sauce is canned rather than jarred this month, although we've gotten glass jars in the past.\r\n  Figure Three: A closer look at some of the veggies.\r\n  Figure Four: The substitution wing fritters.\r\n  Figure Five: A closeup of the end of the egg carton--note that the expiration date is a good ways away. I checked, and these eggs were NOT part of the recall.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.angelfoodministries.com/", "https://www.angelfoodministries.com/recipes/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013486640b82970c-pi", "https://www.angelfoodministries.com/menus/menu_2010-08_en.asp", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f33fc5f3970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f33fc7fb970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f33fcaf6970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013486641cb1970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/my-uncompensated-unofficial-review-of-angel-food-ministries.html", "title": "my uncompensated, unofficial review of Angel Food Ministries"},

Also, diminished hearing on that side that is hopefully temporary? None of which would have happened, most likely, had he started antibiotics on Saturday when he woke up slightly feverish and crying about his ear?) GOD DAMN IT TO HELL SEE, I AM TRYING VERY HARD NOT TO WORK MYSELF UP INTO A TOTAL CONNIPTION HERE...\r\n...deep, cleansing breath...in through the nose to a count of seven, out through the mouth to a count of seven...again, in with the good air...out with the tension...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway the longer I even THINK about Big Child's ear, the higher I can feel my heartrate climbing and I have deliberately not taken my blood pressure with Hotter's machine because I am not SUPPOSED to be monitoring that per any medical types and probably it's spiked into the \"uh-oh zone\" but seeing confirmation would alarm me further and...yeah. So let's talk about what I did outside to relieve my feelings, shall we?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I transplanted my six little blocks of half-inch tall chamomile into the front bed in front of the broccoli (which is, in turn, in front of the sunflowers, and all of this is in front of the largest window of the house, into which the sun shines in the summer--I figure the shade will help keep our cooling costs down). I watered everything (I have two kinds of corn, two kinds of beans, half a forty-foot row each of turnips and onion starts, and more kohlrabi coming up now).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 three and a half hours later\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Well now the kid is coughing and coughing, and has already been up once apiece to complain of that and a sore throat, and Middly had fatigue and a headache an didn't eat dinner, and Little Child is the healthiest one in the house (!!!). It's looking like poor Big Child might not be well enough to go on tomorrow's much-anticipated and pre-paid-for field trip to a park a good trek away (eff. word.), and he's already weepy and emotional from pain even with anti-inflammatories, even though he says it's MUCH better since \"it hurt so bad and I couldn't hear; now it just hurts SOME and I can hear SOME but the stuff coming out is gross.\" Yes, buddy, it is. The stuff coming out is PUS, and in fact I hope think we got you on antibiotics just in time to keep you from being REALLY sick. I bubbled the goo out with hydrogen peroxide and got the mucousy ropes of it off his outer ear canal after he drained it into a white cloth (turning it colors I won't describe). After he got up for the second time and came seeking comfort and help I promised Big Child we'd go to the park the next weekend I'm not working if he was too sick to go tomorrow with his friends (his eyes got HUGE above his flushed cheeks at that).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I.

She's my favorite hen, mostly because she's terrifying and the closest I'll ever have to a pet dragon:\r\n Figure One: And in my fantasy? She also lays golden eggs. In reality they're a pretty shade of blue but not worth killing over, at least not in MY opinion--she and I have agreed to disagree on that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter is the one who usually gathers the eggs, since I'm generally asleep when the hens are laying.

Causing him to scream like a girl because \"OMG, EWW, IT'S HOT, GAHHH\" and me to nearly pee myself.

I don't have the time to slaughter a chicken until Friday at the earliest, but I think I know what I'm doing on Friday. Ugh.

So here you go!\r\nLove: Thursday night/Friday morning was my last \"workday\" of the \"week.\"Hate: I dunno whether to say \"yesterday\" and had to think for a minute to decide what day it was today, because effing third shift screws you all up that way.\r\nLove: I just got a nice 12+ hour block of sleep that I clearly needed.Hate: I woke up hungry and wheezing, with a godawful back/SI-joint ache that demanded forbidden-to-me NSAIDS, and had to figure out what to eat with those before sitting down with the nebulizer because third shift robs you of the normal rhythm of a day and you don't know whether to eat breakfast foods, lunch foods, or dinner foods at any given time. Like right now? I just had a banana, a peach, and some cheese and crackers. At six in the morning. Oy. Plus I'll probably crawl back in bed with Hotter about ten minutes before the boys wake for the day.\u00a0\r\nLove: The way the nebulizer sorts out the gunk in my chest and saves me from doing the \"do I go to the ER or not?\" dance.Hate: The way high doses of Albuterol make me feel ASIDE from the whole \"able to breathe\" thing (hint: I've never tried the street-version of uppers but I'm guessing it's a lot like that).\u00a0\r\nLove: My chickens.Hate: My rooster, who is crowing his effing head off, and also the THING on his head that I had to lance yesterday (during his time in the 'pound, Paul was attacked by other roosters who broke a lot of his head feathers off and one got VERY INFECTED). Poor bird has a bright red tonsure glistening with Neosporin. And since he's this kind of chicken it's extra-ridiculous.\r\nLove: My Middle Child.Hate: That he had a total emo meltdown yesterday at the breakfast table shortly after I got home during which he refused to speak and sat there with fat tears darting down his cheeks answering all questions with a gasping-fish lip-puffing that looked exactly like what my father did to signify having just suffered a major stroke. I finally said \"if you do not say SOMEthing I am taking you to the hospital\" and he howled \"WHEN I EAT CHEEWIOS IT'S LIKE...IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYFING!\" Which was, in fact, SOMEthing but...existential crisis over cereal? THE HELL? Finally we figured out that he has taken a sudden and epic dislike to Cheerios and I gave him a cup of yogurt and he cheered the hell up but DAMN.\r\nLove: The facespace and the funny little window it gives me into the daily lives of friends.Hate: The fact that I am so paranoid due to Stalky and Co. that an out-of-the-blue friend request yesterday sent me into a panic. I'm MOSTLY certain that the person who sent it is totally harmless and lovely, but did not accept just in case. Which felt rude.\u00a0Hate 2.0: The invitation a friend-in-law on there (i.e. someone I am only friends with because they are an old friend of Hotter's) sent me THREE TIMES to a \"wear purple for Caylee\" event (this neatly outlines how I feel about the whole leave-your-porch-light-on/wear-purple/change-your-profile-picture-for-Caylee kerfuffle).Hate 3.0: Facespace \"events\" in general.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How about you?

She still seems to enjoy herself if you keep food and water handy, and prefers to lie in the shade near the rest of the flock, which she still trails by sound, so we're leaving her be.

It was just getting started though, so I went back to bed where Hotter snuggled up to me and then said \"is that your LUNGS? That's NASTY, baby!\" Ugh. Also, I don't get all the Royal Wedding hate. Why NOT all get collectively excited about something frivolous for a change instead of outraged? This made me smile when I saw it at a more decent hour.\r\n* \u00a0 The school finally saw fit to return my call. I was on my way into the dentist's office at the time, though, and let it go to voicemail. My phone is currently charging and I am currently composing my thoughts. I don't want to lose the principal's attention by being all ad hominem; I'm more interested in talking about how to assure this NEVER happens again. The clinician should already have known, and therefore either needs to be reminded or educated on the importance of accurately reporting bleeding incidents in the two out of three MFA Children who have the bleeding issue. Also, I'd like an apology from SOMEone on the matter of anyone lying, PERIOD. I mean, again, I get that nobody wants to call Mama Pitbull and tell her the Preeeeecious got bopped in the nose, but if she either didn't know or didn't listen to how this happened because she was in a hurry to get the kid onto the bus she should have said she didn't know what happened. I'd rather get an honest \"I dunno\" than a dishonest ANYTHING.\r\n* \u00a0 My dentist re-glued the tooth, and didn't charge me anything.

That is IMPRESSIVE. I'm going to send this to your insurance company and they're going to be like 'OMG, Dr. Dentist, PLEASE help that poor girl!' and I'll be all 'don't worry, I am highly-skilled, and our client will be FINE!' and then they will THANK me!\" I laughed and he said \"either that or they'll tell us to piss up a rope and I'll do a crown for the lab and materials fees, but this isn't working.\" I asked how much THAT would be and he said $800 and I said \"GET THE SUPERGLUE.\" He said let's just see what the insurance company says in a few weeks and go from there.

They said yes, yes they were. I said okay because I will have to give him medication...yes, they were sure. I met said child at the bus stop with a syringe of medication to help his blood clot in-hand and, in my hurry to deliver it as per hematologist's orders, already hooked up to a g-tube extension. I'm therefore REALLY glad said child is such a vocal little bugger, because apparently he got punched in the nose. YAY! I mean, shit, my kid got punched in the nose, but this kid hadn't had a spontaneous scary nosebleed in AGES\u00a0and it would have represented quite a setback in my estimation of their overall health. But, problem with that? Is that if I had administered the clotting drug when the kid was NOT having a bleed from the blood-thing (bleeding after a punch in the nose is normal, bleeding as IF punched in the nose...not so much) it could have caused kidney damage and/or a stroke. Um...yeah. The principal and county health supervisor haven't returned my irate phone call as of yet, but my next step is the local news media.

NEVER. Not once in four years of having first one, then two, then three children at this school, and not for lack of trying, either). The vice-principal was less apologetic than I would have preferred, harping on the whole \"well maybe the clinician just didn't KNOW--\" and I kept gently but firmly reminding her that if that was the case \"the nosebleed was spontaneous\" was not a true answer. She promised to look into it, though, and let me know if they need any \"further documentation\" of the bleeding issue. Hmph.\r\n* \u00a0 Big Child's birthday celebration went well; the pizza was well-received and the cupcakes, being Gwendomama's recipe, were of course phenomenal.\r\n* \u00a0 Unfortunately after dinner I went out to mow and must have run over a clump of ragweed (the only environmental allergy I have per testing) or something, because I had an asthma attack so fierce that a buttload of Benadryl, an emergency dose of steroids, and my inhaler did nothing to alleviate it. I stuck it out at home for about an hour but it only got worse, and finally I had to admit defeat and go to the ER. Which is NOT what our finances needed, but at least I felt vindicated in making the call when my pulse-ox upon arrival was 88 (this should be 98-100 in a healthy, non-smoking adult, and certainly no lower than 95--anything under the lower nineties is abysmal). Three hours, a chest x-ray (which was clean, which is good--I was starting to wonder if I wasn't getting pneumonia again what with last night's coughing/wheezing fit), a whopper-dose of IV steroids, several breathing treatments and a slug of codeine later I got back into the mid-nineties and managed to go several minutes at a time without coughing. That was good enough for them to send me home with prescriptions for a better inhaler, a taper-pack of prednisone (the dose they had to use to break the attack in the ER was so high that it wouldn't be safe to not do a taper, plus clearly something is blooming right now that irritates the HELL out of my lungs and therefore that's probably my best bet if I don't want to end up back in the ER sometime this week, DAMMIT) (those of you who know me might be shocked that I acquiesed to steroids at ALL given my history with the accursed things, but I refuse to take them \"unless it's a matter of life and death,\" and breathing is rather important if you want to live, so, yeah), a bottle of codeine cough syrup, and instructions to take a daily antihistamine for the next little bit and DON'T MOW THE EFFING LAWN WITHOUT A MASK (in my defense I usually DO wear a mask, but the chickens got ahold of it today and ran all over the yard with the thing; I didn't want to put it on my face after they'd played soccer with it with their poop-feet).\r\n* \u00a0 Aaaaand I got pulled over on the way home for having an expired registration. Boo, hiss.\r\n* \u00a0 Yes, I am TOTALLY going to work tomorrow. I can't afford not to, especially now that I've got an ER bill to worry about. Damn and BLAST! Plus my job tomorrow involves spending the day at a rodeo, which is something I've never done, and when I'm not actually having an asthma attack I feel pretty much fine so there's no reason to stay home (plus I'll be on a robust enough dose of steroids for the next few days that the odds of another attack are pretty slim).\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/04/today-was-not-my-day.html", "title": "today was not my day"},

And I said yes, because you don't say no to the Big Boss, and lifted the weight, and I must admit, in the name of honesty, of \"journalistic integrity,\" or whatever you call it when someone is telling the truth in writing about their life, I lifted it, even though I felt sinews give, and muscles pull.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It hurt, and I felt sorry for myself.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I felt sorry for myself, I am ashamed to say, until The Big Boss said to push The Steel Structure. The Steel Structure, I'd say (were I pressed to guess, because what do I know?), that weighed three times the weight of the heaviest horse I've ever owned, three times a Clydesdale, three tons, and we pushed The Steel Structure, I and my twenty-nine co-workers, we pushed it until it began to tip on one of its' two weight-bearing axises, and it began to fall.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It began to fall, hurtling towards the ground, and we screamed \"look out! It's falling!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And only one of us didn't hear, or didn't heed our call, and it landed on one of us, and he screamed.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Oh god, I'll hear that scream in my dreams, no matter how many more nights I sleep.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It fell on him, and we screamed, and we lifted it back up. But it was too late. The man it fell on, he screamed, and screamed, and all of us pushed, and some of us cried.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0He still went with the Big Boss, because the Big Boss said to come, and gave his testimony, out of our hearing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The rest of us put shelves on a rack without a top tie-rail, later, after The Big Boss told us to get the fuck out of there;\u00a0it kept buckling and it fell at our feet because it had no top tie-rail, and we said to each other, \"it has no top tie-rail, the shelves are the only thing holding it up!\" and we piled them on anyway, the shelves, not counting notches in the pegboard, or shelves fallen, and picked back up, until the Big Boss said Go Home. And we went, the shelves lying on the floor, filing past our fallen co-worker, sitting on a chair, having reviewed security footage with The Big Boss, waiting for someone to take him to the hospital, who despite his injuries was sitting on a chair. We said things like \"you okay?\" and \"feel better,\" filing past him, putting our hands on his shoulder to prove to ourselves that he was alive, \"feel better, and sue 'em good!\" some of us said, because it's what comes to mind anymore when something like this happens. \"I hope you're okay,\" I said, \"you should go to the ER,\" and he said, smiling faintly, out of it and shocky:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I will. They just want me to do some paperwork.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And the person I am today patted him on the shoulder. \"I hope you're okay,\" I said, with one foot out the door, because The Big Boss was looking. \"If I were you I'd demand medical attention first, and do paperwork later,\" I said, the person I have become, \"and I hope you're okay,\" I told him, and I went home and made love to my husband, because that is what the fortunate do.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That is what I did, because The Steel Structure didn't fall on me.

I wasn't too happy about being \"Blog Raptured,\" but the fact that I had a broken link in my last post that then stood for a week? GAH! It's like the OCD gods were trying to teach me a lesson...\r\n* \u00a0 You may or may not have noticed that my BlogHer badge has vanished. I had to think long and hard about it, but during the radio silence a letter came from the IRS letting us know that the student loan people had seized our entire income tax refund (which was roughly twice our average monthly income, for a sense of context) and that tipped the balance from \"it'll be tight but sometimes one must do things for oneself\" all the way into \"fiscally irresponsible and selfish as hell.\" Between that and the fact that BlogHer '11 is being held right in Stalky's backyard, (and she'll be there--she's said as much on the Twitter to her friends, not just in her usual \"I'll see you there and be passing out copies of my big creepy dossier All About You when I'm not busy crying bitter tears over our ruined friendship and carving our initials into my thigh with an Xacto knife!\" e-mail)...meh. I'm not going to make my family eat ramen for the next two and a half months so that I can fly across the damn country and run into my stalker in a ladies' room.\r\n* \u00a0 Anyone wanna buy my tickets? I have one full conference pass and one parties/expo only ticket that I'm willing to sell together as a \"lot\" for $350. Shoot me an e-mail at mfamamablog @ gmail DOT com\u00a0if you're interested.\r\n* \u00a0 My lungs, in case you were wondering, still suck. I can't even begin to afford a doctor's visit ($30) plus Levaquin, steroids, and more inhalers (~$100 if I'm lucky) until my next paycheck comes, and am not even entirely certain it would even help for more than the duration of treatment. I took last week and this week off from the various temp agencies, and have just been working Weekend Warrior Job in hopes that the rest would help me recover, but it hasn't, really.\r\n* \u00a0 The MFA Eggs (or, Hatch 4.0) seem to be doing fine. Or rather, nobody has unplugged the incubator, they've been dutifully turned, and all of them are in one piece. Who knows. I'm kind of jaded on the topic. We'll see. As for the other poultry...the ducks are starting to look like two male/female pairs although we won't know for sure for a few more months I think. The older chickens (what remain of them--we've eaten so many that egg production is just a trickle anymore) are in disgrace because they ate my cauliflower to the ground again and haven't been out to forage for a few days. \u00a0The pullets aren't laying yet but are almost there. The Consolation Chicks and turkey poults have gone outside the past two days in a small pen and loved it. I have a hilarious poultry-related vlog (yes, VLOG!) for y'all, but can't figure out how to get it from my semi-broken Blackberry to my craptop (the cable to connect them got et by a dog long ago, and there doesn't seem to be a way to upload the video without e-mail capability, which doesn't work on my phone anymore for some odd reason). I'll keep trying!\r\n* \u00a0 I'm getting rather depressed about our current level of poverty (I really ought to see a doctor about the lungs, for example, and I also still don't have a front tooth), but then CASE IN POINT over the next few days I'll probably be rather depressed in general as I can't afford to refill my Pristiq ($60) and am on half doses for the next few days, then quarter doses for two after that until the first. That ought to at least keep me from having a seizure (which is what happens if you just STOP taking the stuff...), but as I recall from the last time I had to taper off the stuff I still have a crushing headache and blackest depression with bonus anxiety dreams to look forward to.\r\n* \u00a0 Gee, aren't y'all glad I got unsilenced just in time for THAT?\r\n* \u00a0 How are you? I've gotten comments, I just couldn't approve them during the outage...but really, what are YOU up to? How's things? Did you lose weight you look extra-slende--OH! I won a slenderizing Lands End swimsuit in a Twitter party. I KNOW! I hate those Twitter parties TOO; I don't even know what made me participate but WHOO! FREE SWIMSUIT!

We use Groupon here for things like veggies at The Hippie Food Coop and trips to the Science Museum (when we can afford it). They have a lot of good deals!

They DMed me an e-mail address, I poured out my tale of woe, and they responded with a phone number for their Executive Response team. I didn't feel like calling anybody because I hate the phone on a good day but figured I was probably the jerk in the situation if I didn't follow through and called, and...they were NICE! It turned out that my account is still with Wachovia (which is in the process of being absorbed by Wells Fargo) and the Wells Fargo people couldn't even pull it up, which honestly?

Hang on though...you can't ask a bunch of dogs if they are extremely unlikely, somewhat unlikely, neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat likely, or extremely likely to polish of the turd they're just taste-tested...OH MY GOD, HOW MUCH DID THEY OFFER PEOPLE TO COME AND TELL THEM HOW MUCH MORE LIKE SHIT THE SHIT WITH FORBID IN IT TASTED? \u00a0\u00a0 Surely the cost would be prohibitive when you're developing a product that retails for $1.25 a packet.\u00a0\u00a0 I call bullshit shenanigans; this has got to be a joke. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.greenies.com/Splash.aspx", "http://www.greenies.com/en_US/Products/DentalChew.aspx", "http://www.greenies.com/en_US/Products/DentalChew.aspx", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f2d4f77c970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f2d4f92a970b-pi", "http://www.amazon.com/For-Bid-Packet/dp/B0002YFBGM"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/08/seriously.html", "title": "seriously?"},

The chicks were understandably not fans of this behavior but none of them were seriously injured (one had a bruised toe and held its foot up most pitifully for most of a day but is now walking around on it again). The turkeys will be five weeks old tomorrow, and five weeks is when they \"shoot the red\" (that's apparently turkey-farmer jargon for when their head and neck feathers all fall out and they get those genital-wart-looking things on their necks). Having never had baby turkeys before, we're not sure whether this will be a gradual process or whether they'll all just POOF! lose their head and neck feathers at once. I'll keep you posted!\r\n* \u00a0 This is hilarious.

The venue was told to expect 6,000 people for this concert, and instead it was more like 150 who showed up, and the beer truck I was managing (heh, yeah, I had three people working under me today, which was kind of hilarious) only made something like $150 in sales, which when you figure that the two beer truck guys made $40/hr apiece just to be there (they didn't like, pour or hang out around the truck or anything, just set it up, went and took naps, and drove it away afterward), times seven hours, plus my time and the three temps I was managing (who made slightly less per hour than I did but whose time cost the venue about one and half times per hour what they were paying me)...yeah, Weekend Warrior Employer took one in the pooper today. Which meant that management wasn't happy AT ALL and also that they slashed everyone's hours for the REST of the weekend, so rather than a thirty-six hour weekend for me at this job it became a seven-and-a-quarter-hour weekend. OUCH! Also ouch? We were supposed to have a tent but management decided it might block the beer truck sign and hurt sales, so my forehead (oddly JUST my forehead) is really effing sunburnt. Crap.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was also annoyed because Temp Agency #1 wanted me to start work at Soulless Corporate Megalith tomorrow night or Monday night, and I told them I'd start Monday night since I was supposed to be at Weekend Warrior Job tomorrow (and Monday during the day), and wanted to see if I could still start Sunday, but Temp Agency #1 doesn't have anyone in the office on weekends. I decided to take some freaking initiative though and called the Soulless Corporate Megalith store directly and they said yes, come in tomorrow night, PLEASE, and Temp Agency #1 and I will settle up for that on Monday I guess (they're cool so I trust them to make it good). So that's good, but all in all I'm not particularly happy, since I specifically TOLD Weekend Warrior Job I couldn't afford to come out there for less than eight hours (it costs me $20 in gas round trip just to get there), and today was supposed to be twelve but ended up being seven and a quarter. Also I am usually one of two employees running a concession stand or one of a herd of banquet servers, and instead I had to manage the beer truck, which meant that I was responsible for inventory and the till and telling the temps what to do. Plus my forehead really hurts and I have a family history of skin cancer. Etc.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the bright side, a very kind reader mailed me a gift certificate to a specialty store that sells fancy meats, and it arrived today.

Of course, that's not particularly possible but I might be able to pull a Hail Mary with a rubber check (go ahead and judge me for that; I do) and make it all work. Nobody better get sick!\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of sickness, Hotter is better, thanks for asking. Of course, now he's done something to his back, but back pain isn't a going-to-the-doctor ailment in this house unless you're also paralyzed in at least one limb and/or pissing yourself on a regular basis.\r\n* \u00a0 I just cut a particularly lovely-looking salad from our garden and got some about-to-expire sale-priced lean ground beef when I was at the grocery store earlier, so Hotter is making burgers (YAY! He makes awesome burgers) and we're having those with corn on the cob and watermelon. Mmm...I love summer food. There's blackberry cobbler for dessert, too, made with berries from our yard.\r\n* \u00a0 We moved the \"Chick-tacs\" outside permanently; after establishing that the turkeys still lift them by their feets (and that the turkeys can't hack it in \"genpop\"--the hens converged on them and nearly ate our Thanksgiving dinner!) we put the smallest enclosure inside the turkey pen for the littles.

Hotter rather enjoyed my aggravation, since he is the one who puts up with it most, and when he came outside and heard me complaining and Paul crowing shouted happily \"THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS, PAUL!\"\r\n* \u00a0 He's had pretty much the same reaction to my dismay at the MFA Children's rudimentary tribal society and its barbaric little customs. I made them a lovely brunch (homemade pizza!) and Middle Child still managed to complain about that and get Little Child going, too. \"This is how they are EVERY DAY, ALL DAY,\" Hotter informed me.

What does bother me, though, is that she's even thinking of me anymore at all. Because we're talking about someone I was friends with for less than a year OVER THREE YEARS AGO. We haven't had any contact AT ALL in nearly TWO years (well, I haven't had any contact with her; she's done her creepy stalky commenting/making gmail accounts based on my name and e-mailing manifestos thing a few times). I only think of her when she actively stalks me, or when someone goes \"hey she's talking shit about you on Twitter again!\" or, sadly, when I decide how to describe something new to do with my life or work on here (I always have to consider whether she could potentially use new information to worry or annoy me). But apparently she thinks of me quite a bit, unprovoked, has made friends with other creepers on the innernet solely for the purpose of continuing to discuss and harass me, and just. isn't. letting. go. and that? Bothers me. It's creepy, and I'm actually starting to feel kind of sorry for her, because the way she reaches out to me around holidays and major life events of HERS makes me think she's not all that invested in her own life and family, and that's sad. What she's doing, this unhealthy dwelling and obsession (to say nothing of the stalking and cyberbullying), is probably indicative of a real sickness. I feel even sorrier for the real victims of all of this, the children Stalky is responsible for; I grew up with severe mental illness in the household and it's not an easy thing to live with as a kid (or hell, ever). As an adult who is unrelated to Stalky and lives on the other side of the country from her, I have (and have exercised) the option to cut ties with her, change jobs and homes and phone numbers to make it harder for her to screw with my life, and surround myself with the love and support of people who are immune to Stalky's charms and dirty tricks. Her kids can't do that. That sucks for them.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0S., if you're reading this (and I know you are), please just stop. Stop reading my blog, stop stalking my Twitter feed (I blocked you, so maybe the next time you're signing out of your account in order to view mine you could take a moment and evaluate honestly whether what you are doing is a healthy and beneficial thing), stop your incessant researching of my life both online and off. What happened between us was unfortunate and I'm sure we both have our regrets, but I've moved on and so should you. Don't do it for my sake, do it for your own and that of your kids. For everyone's sake I wish you peace; you have a lot of good things going on in your life and we'd probably all be happier for it if you'd focus on those instead of me.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/05/oh-stalky.html", "title": "oh, Stalky"},

The corn and okra, and about half of the tomatoes are stunty, as in \"not going to amount to much, I don't think.\" They're perfectly welcome to prove me wrong. So far the beans and the other half of the tomatoes and the zucchini bushes and the straighneck yellow squashes are our best performers (aside from the lettuce, which has been great, and the cucumbers, which haven't produced much as of yet but are very much On Their Way). My herb garden is fabulous! And this year I think we'll get some good moonflowers, which is always exciting (they're the only flower I much screw with that you can't eat or make tea out of).\r\n* \u00a0 The turkeys are suddenly getting rather huge. I had to trim their wings some more (although one of them bled, ack!) because they were eyeing the gaps at the ends of the roof of their enclosure (we keep them under a tarp-roof so they can't drown in heavy rain, which they absolutely would have a few days ago during some crazy storms) and they're not very easy to hold and contain. Hotter is getting rather averse to it, actually, so I may be on my own next wing-trimming time...in his defense they do beat the hell out of you with their wings and the cut feathers are kinda sharp and pokey. The older pullets are starting to look like they're ready to lay, and could theoretically do that any time now (probably it'll be another few weeks). The very moment one of them does we're slaughtering George, who is so evil anymore that even Boris the Blind shies away from her (perhaps she emits a palpable menace? Hotter thinks Boris is working on a crude sort of sonar...) and everyone is missing a feather or two from her savagery.\r\n* \u00a0 Tonight we had a \"firefly party\" after I made a feed store run (and gave this URL out to some nice ladies there who were thinking of getting some chickens--HELLO!).

A  virus has been making its way through them starting with Middle Child (who  stayed home yesterday after impressive puking and retching, went back  down with Tylenol and a dose of kids' Zofran and slept until noon then  ate lunch and was fine) and now Big Child (who coughed all night last night  but insisted he felt well enough for school and didn't have a fever so I  didn't make him miss the Halloween party and dosed him up on Tylenol  Cough and Cold).

I've been canning all day (when I wasn't building a fence around the winter garden or cleaning out the game room).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I made some apple-cranberry butter, and went to blend it in the Cuisinart, and Hotter said what he usually says about how you shouldn't blend boiling mixtures and I said what I always said about how I'd never hurt myself doing it and hit the switch, and then the top of my Cuisinart blew up and sprayed boiling apple-cranberry butter all over my left forearm, lower lip, chest, and shoulder.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Really bad burns don't hurt at first. I stripped my shirt off and ran cold water over my arm (which had been holding the top of the Cuisinart in place with a bar-towel and got the worst of it), and when it started to blister before my eyes and I got dizzy I squirted some cold aloe from the fridge on it, threw some gauze over that, and slid a piece of Surgilast over everything, calling to Hotter that I thought we ought to go to Patient First because I'd just burned the crap out of myself. Hotter, being a chef, is not fazed by burns and reminded me that they'd just dress it pretty much the way I had and give me drugs. \"I...want...drugs...\" I said, sitting topless with blisters rising all sexy-like. \"I'm just...getting...my shit...together.\" I think I may have gone into a mild state of shock as I got dressed. Hotter was dubious about my ability to drive, but we made it to Patient First okay.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The nurse doing triage looked at my arm and sucked air through her teeth appreciatively, then walked me straight back to a treatment room and poured a bunch of cold saline over my arm. That felt great. A doctor came back and peeked, and winced, and took my blood pressure and shook his head, and said it was definitely second-degree and that I must be in a lot of pain judging from my blood pressure (it was 130/90, haha, oops). He told me to take my wedding ring off in case my fingers blistered, too, keep antibiotic ointment on the area when the blisters burst, watch for signs of infection, take two Vicodin every four to six hours for the next couple of days, and refrain from blending boiling mixtures. Hotter snickered. I refrained from telling either of them to eat a bag of dicks and gathered my blisters and my wounded dignity and we went back home. So THAT wasn't awesome.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 What is awesome is the cranberry sauce I made today and canned so it'll have plenty of time to jel by Thanksgiving. It's so pretty, and smelled so festive! Also today was a four-egg day and I processed a large pumpkin and have pie filling in the crockpot making the house smell marvelous, too.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I'd been wrestling with what to call the cranberry apple-butter, but after all of that? Crapplebutter it was.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Don't blend boiling mixtures, y'all.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The Mennonite butcher I called about venison went hunting for us today and got a buck. He's turning it into four \"summer sausages\" (they're like giant hard salamis), vaccuum-sealed tenderloins, and packets of ground meat for chili and spaghetti sauce. Doesn't get much more organic and local than that! It's illegal to sell venison here so he's giving us the deer and we're paying him the $80 to process it the way we want it. I like knowing that the meat was handled properly from field to fridge, and have been very impressed with this company's work in the past on grass-fed beef I've bought from a local farmer and venison I've had in the past. My going entirely vegan isn't practical since Hotter isn't down with meatless dinners, but I'm done with factory-farmed meats and this plus the milk and meat CSA seems like a good compromise.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 OMG THE DOG! I am so proud of her--my next-door neighbor (the older lady to the left, not the asshole with all the mangy pitbulls to the right) had her nephew and his kids over, and they wanted to see the dog and she was GOOD and LISTENED and did all of her tricks for them and they were very impressed and thanked me profusely for bringing her over. Personally I KNOW I have the cutest, smartest, most wonderful dog on Earth, but it's nice to hear that confirmed by others. GOOD DOG, ISIS! I have some adorable pictures of her in her Halloween kerchief, but it is time for more Vicodin so perhaps I'll load those later.

Wells Fargo, I HATE YOU. It's not your fault I'm a broke-ass deadbeat, but do you seriously HAVE to mess around with the dates of purchases so as to charge me even MORE money I don't have in overdraft fees? And...what the hell do I have overdraft protection from my savings account (and its' entire three dollars of life savings) for if you're going to say \"haha, you overdrafted, here is your fee!\" and THEN throw the three bucks down the negative-balance K-hole? That's just mean, it's like you're rubbing salt in my wounds. I'm not going to sit here and say I didn't deserve at least one overdraft fee, because I knew that that would probably happen when I bought food at Sam's Club but, well, my children want to eat three times a day and my ex already calls CPS on me every time he gets a stick up his arse, so feeding them is kind of non-negotiable. I was prepared to suck it up and start the month of June in the red in order to keep food on the table. I was NOT prepared for you to eff with the dates of purchases like this, which will add at least two MORE overdraft fees, which if you look at the amount of my paycheck that I deposited on the 23rd means that half my next week's income will go to JUST covering bank fees. And while we're on the subject of how you suck, Wells Fargo, how about we discuss that $44 transfer to savings that you do EVERY MONTH and that I've NEVER ASKED YOU TO DO and TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO CANCEL? This entire clusterfuck is a prime example of BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IN ACTION. I may not be able to afford to switch banks now, and I may be resigned to taking your crap lying down, but someday if I'm ever in a position to take my business elsewhere you can bet I'll do just that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, Wells Fargo has pretty much guaranteed that I won't be able to climb out of this bottomless pit any time soon, and now you see why I decided that BlogHer this year would be sheer idiocy.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0BUT! It totally won't fix my life or my tooth or my lungs or even, sadly, my mood for the day thanks to Wells Fargo, BUT! Typepad/Say Media? IS AWESOME. I woke up to this in my in-box this morning:\r\nHi-I noticed your tweets about TypePad gift certificates, and I wanted toreach out by opening this help ticket in your account.Offering an option for TypePad subscriptions to be available as giftsis something the support would like to see made available, and we'vebeen conversing with the rest of the TypePad product team to providethis feature.

Just let us know how we can help! (Let usknow the address for the other blogger you want to help out ifapplicable.)-Jen\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Jen, I heart you. I didn't ask Typepad/Say Media for a danged thing, but they just happened to be present on Twitter when I was bemoaning my blogless-due-to-finances state and a friend was saying she wished they offered gift certificates so that she could sponsor my blog, and they decided to reach out and help. THAT IS AMAZING. THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER SINCE 2005. Wells Fargo, TAKE NOTES!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Now I'm going to go back to coughing up a lung (yeah, I guess I won't be going to the doctor next pay period, either--THANKS A LOT, WELLS FARGO) and being bitter over the fact that my ex is a cocknozzle (yesterday he proceeded to treat my six-year-old like his therapist and tell him how he's SO CONFLICTED because he'd LIKE to take his weekend visitation but mean old Mommy and the judge won't let him have the boys cohabit with him and his girlfriend and Daddy hates his own house because it's MESSY and NOT AS NICE AS CATHERINE'S so he didn't know what to do! Because yeah, he COULD take his visitation but that would mean Daddy being very sad over his messy house and missing his girlfriend!) who can afford to buy extravagant gifts that he won't let my kids bring home, and tells them they can play with them at CATHERINE'S house when mean old Mommy lets them come back there to visit. And all the while he's stiffing me on child support because he's terribly poor. But he bought my kid a pair of light-up Darth Vader Stride Rites last night that cost more than I spent on groceries last week (see above) and if I comment on that then I'M the asshole. Let's all take a moment and weep for the XY, shall we? That poor guy! It's terribly hard when people expect you to spend every other weekend away from your sugarmama's nice big clean house! Almost as hard as it would be if you only got to SEE your significant other every other weekend for over a year due to that same \"no overnights\" clause in the court order! Oh wait, that was ME!

Stop what you're doing and go and read stellar commenter and friend-inside-the-computer of the MFAmily AlexMac's post, \"Isis the Puppy Needs You.\" She gained some additional entries into the MFOrganics Giveaway and Fundraiser for Isis, and also made Isis and me both smile.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Bonnie, another super-cool reader and commenter, e-mailed me and wanted to know if I'd be introducing any new scents/varieties of MFOrganics Sea Salt Scrub and mentioned that she'd especially like some rose-scented scrub. I told her it was a funny thing, actually, that I was planning on doing rose but trying to find some affordable and certified organic food-grade rose water, then in the time I took just after sending the e-mail to source some excellent stuff Bonnie e-mailed me back suggesting the very type of Bulgarian Rose extract I ended up going with. I decided to stick with the Isis theme and call the original formula of MFOrganics Sea Salt Scrub \"Lucky Dog,\" and in honor of Bonnie, I'm naming the soon-to-be-released coconut-rose variety \"RedDogRose\" (she'll recognize the reference I'm sure).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I was talking to a friend-inside-the-computer who's having a rough couple of months in a \"been there done that\" place that I do not look back on fondly at all, and twisted her arm to let me send her an organic mini-Thanksgiving in a Basket. If it comes together as nicely as I think it will (I'm picturing some pumpkin pie-filling, cranberry dressing, baking mix for bread, possibly candied yams...?), would y'all be interested in a raffle of sorts to win a duplicate basket? I'll show you pictures when I get that done.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I've had a few people write to ask how Isis is, and she's doing great! We still see her favor her leg once in a while when she takes a bad hop or something, but no more so since tapering down on the steroids (she's down to 5mg of Prednisone twice a day after first 20mg then 10mg for five days each), which is a good sign. We've started adding some glucosamine/chondroitin/antioxidant joint supplement granules that smell like someting a dog would love to her food, and she's back on normal rations (no more prescription food). I'm also trying some home remedies suggested by the vet as well as ones I grew up using on animals; my position is that if I know it won't hurt, and the dog is willing to eat it in her food, and it seems to help, I'll do it in addition to what the vet prescribes. So she gets a clove of garlic minced into her breakfast and dinner, and four Brewer's Yeast tablets mixed into each meal to hopefully make her less palatable to the mites as well. She's very shiny (I use the \"Lucky Dog\" on her--so I guess I can't say that it wasn't tested on animals, but I tested it on myself first so there's that, and then towel-dry her and comb her with the Furminator).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Meredith's mama sent me some dog kerchiefs that she made for Isis, and is providing some for the winner of my fundraiser/giveaway.

He's alert enough to open his eyes when the doctors poke at him, which he wasn't for a while there, and when I left the hospital this morning the XY was feeding him pancakes.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The official verdict is \"probably some kind of GI virus or else maybe food poisoning, but either way someone else in the house would be sick\" (my current respiratory crud doesn't count because it's not GI-related in the least and Middly isn't coughing). So they really don't know. His whitecount is a LITTLE bit elevated, but not much. His sodium level is out of the seizure zone into the \"merely pretty damned sick\" zone (and Middly did NOT actually seize at any point, which I very much appreciated), so that's good. His kidney labs weren't awful so they're chalking up the non-peeing to dehydration and watching and waiting on that. He does NOT appear to be diabetic (Hotter heard \"acidotic\" and went off on a diabetes-tangent, because when he was a wee acidotic lad that was why but it turns out babies and small children get acidotic if they're just really dehydrated).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Because it can't ever be easy, though, the admitting physician at Hospital B discovered a new and fairly noisy heart murmur in his exam. He didn't say anything until after a litre of fluid was in because apparently there are sometimes murmurs in otherwise-healthy kids who are just really dehydrated. Nobody thinks this is related to the current illness that CAUSED the hospitalization or anything, but because Middly has my connective tissue disease and the cardiologist who did echos on all three of my kids when they were diagnosed determined that Middly had a \"pulmonary flow murmur\" but nothing else cardiac wrong with him (and really, if your kid has a murmur you want it to be a pulmonary flow one because they're so harmless the other term for them is \"innocent murmurs\" and kids just outgrow them), and our pediatrician hasn't heard that in two years, they're not thinking that's what this is. Nobody wanted to guess or anything, beyond \"NOT a pulmonary flow murmur, this is louder and more to the right,\" but they said that if Middly holds his breakfast and lunch down and starts peeing he can probably leave the germ-infested pediatric ward by tonight and have the echo as an outpatient (if he stays they'll scan him tonight). So I'm guessing this is nothing to panic over, but hearing that one of my children has a cardiac abnormality is Not My Favorite Thing.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 CATHERINE! called me. She seems very nice.

{"date": "February 20, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I felt like I owed y'all an update, but I'm tired and not feeling very witty at all. Middly is at CATHERINE's house with the XY and reportedly doing better, although I think I kind of preferred it when he was in the hospital and I could go and check on him if I wanted to. As to why Middly is at CATHERINE's...I was forced to back down from my \"you take them over there and leave them with her instead of taking them home with you ONE MORE TIME and I will--\" stance because honestly? The XY's house could be on Hoarders. It's truly scary. And while CATHERINE is clearly...y'know, I can't even call her an idiot because the same thing happened to me; the XY is very charming until he's not...so we'll just say artificially ignorant of what she is dealing with here, after speaking to her I can say with 100% confidence that she will take excellent care of my son in her huge, huge house with her scads of money and her clean, hygeinic beds and refrigerator full of healthy food, and that's really all I care about right now if I can't have him home, although this is absolutely THE LAST TIME (and the XY has backed down and actually verbalized understanding that this is THE LAST TIME because [insert legalese here]).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 That said, while I am glad that the XY and I are finally on the same page with regards to his leaving the children with CATHERINE at her house (largely without him present) every time he has them, I think it may really harm his relationship with CATHERINE and destabilize him in general, which is never a good thing. Because I will not share details of how I know this, but after speaking with her I can say with absolute certainty that she's dating him because of the kids. She is an excellent mother without any children who was essentially pleading with me to be okay with the XY delegating my children to her because she loves them so for most of the lengthy conversation. She kept telling me about how she has SUCH A BIG HOUSE and THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN ROOMS and she GOT THIS HOUSE TO RAISE CHILDREN IN (she was ladylike enough to leave out the GOD DAMMIT but I'll say it for her because what has happened to her regarding children prior to the XY is unquestionably Not Fair)...I don't know how well it'll go over when he puts his foot down on this with HER. And no, before anyone asks, I'm not insisting we all follow the \"no overnights\" clause because HE insisted on it and I'm bitter that my kids got a stepfather they'd barely met because of it (although I am bitter about that). I'm insisting on it because this clearly Will Not Last and they're already attached to CATHERINE and they have lost enough; when she and the XY inevitably split it'll really hurt them and I don't want them to feel homeless on the XY's weekends to boot when that happens, plus they have all mentioned that CATHERINE is awesome but they'd kind of rather spend the weekends with their father.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This whole thing is breaking my brain. CATHERINE seems like a genuinely nice person who has had life hand her a lot of shitty things (and I mean a LOT; girlfriend could give me a run for my money in the Pain Olympics) and I can absolutely see how life has set her up for a sociopath like the XY to swoop in and take advantage, and it's breaking my brain. Because if I told her to run screaming I wouldn't meet the next girlfriend, and the next girlfriend probably wouldn't be Mary Freaking Poppins, and I'd be right back to where I was before I spoke to her. If I didn't have children I would go down to the courthouse, get a transcript of my divorce hearing, and give it to her, and she would be spared a lot of pain. But the fact is, I am a mother, and I am not her mother, so...yeah. She's on her own.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Which makes the fact that the XY has apparently told her nothing but GOOD things about me and she wants Hotter and me to come over and let her cook us dinner REALLY fucking awkward. I told her I thought that might be a bit much and that I didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable.

I can't exactly say anything approaching the truth (that we're not that amicable, not even close) without tipping the XY's hand, but I also can't be a bitch to CATHERINE and blow her off because I just spent FOUR MONTHS raising hell with the XY over his refusal to let me meet her, plus it would be like kicking a puppy. But if we just bite the bullet and go it will be the most uncomfortable meal EVER because the XY and I are nowhere NEAR that amicable, Hotter is pleasant to the XY but understandably Not A Fan, CATHERINE seems rather intimidated by my looks (for whatever reason, I don't get the impression she's ugly or anything and I assure you that I am not All That) and insecure in her relationship with the XY, who remains fundamentally unable to NOT look at my tits if I'm in the room (as evidenced ONCE AGAIN by our time at Hospitals A and B) and all in all if we do this I think any survivors of the evening will end up on the evening news...Plus okay, FINE, I'm worried that if I gave her any reason to suspect I'm anything less than perfect she'd jump the shark, marry my ex-husband, and put her fortune to use suing me TO DEATH for the children because SHE wants them. I don't get the sense that she's the kind of person who'd do such a thing, but I'm frequently wrong about people and the XY would totally be on-board with that plan (if he hasn't already suggested it) and I?

{"date": "April 17, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Now that I've got work, and am slowly but surely getting our finances caught up (yes, we're still flat-fucking-broke, but that's AFTER I was able to afford Hotter's transplant meds rather than him having to ask family for help with those, so baby steps, right?), I've noticed something...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm all gimped up again. DAMN it!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 See, while I know it's some kind of tributary to that infamous river in Egypt, I had thought my general health to be much-improved. And it is\u00a0compared to when I was living with the XY, but I've once more got a persistent cough with occasional wheezing, and a stress fracture in one leg and arthritic morning agony in the opposite ankle, and my calf muscles are back to being persnickety crampy whores, and my back aches, and...yeah. I know, intellectually, that connective tissue diseases don't go away, but I'd somehow convinced myself that I was no longer as damnably delicate as I once was, and apparently I still am, it just wasn't a problem as I wasn't working outside the home. Sure, I was able to dig in my garden and mow and do housework and go for hikes in the park, but looking back I was also able to take frequent breaks during those activities, and stop for the day if something began to complain. Not so much when I'm working in a giant kitchen or scurrying around a banquet hall.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It's not the type of work that's problematic, really, either. When I used to work at a desk I'd routinely have episodes of bursitis in my hips from the sitting, repetitive-motion injuries galore, computer-user's hunch-related issues in my neck and upper back...the fact is, any time I ask my body to perform work on any kind of clock (where I can't change positions or lie down for a bit whenever I need to, or quit for the day when something starts aching) I'm going to suffer, and while nothing is currently in the \"unbearable, MUST get some medical attention\" place, it's probably only a matter of time.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This worries me. Not only because I dislike pain as much as the next person, but also because I love being a temp, and as a temp I don't have short-term or long-term disability coverage the way I would if I had the same job every day. And while the obvious answer to that would be to get a regular full-time job, that's not practical given that in this house, someone occasionally needs the hospital and I'd just end up losing my job over that, or else I'd have an injury that would mean restrictions on what I could reasonably be asked to do once a doctor weighed in and THAT would end in my losing my job. As a temp, if I'm ill or injured I can decline to accept work until I've healed up without penalty. But then, what do I do if something REALLY major happens? What if I'm in a car accident and I break a bone? What if I get a pinched nerve that lasts for months and months? THEN what? I still don't think going on permanent disability is an option for me, although my specific connective tissue disease has been added to the list of officially qualifying conditions, because I'm not crippled by it on a daily basis at this point, only SOMEtimes. Plus with the household caps in place and Hotter already being on disability, I don't think we'd get enough between the two of us to pay the bills even if I DID qualify. Plus going on permanent disability requires that you document your ailments with trips to the doctor, tests, etc. that I really can't afford anyway.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm trying to take things day by day, and today the most important bills are covered and I'm sore but could still work if I got a call to come in tomorrow, so I'm going to try not to dwell on hypothetical situations that are beyond my control.

I am not superstitious!) and held off, and now it's DEFINITELY not in the cards any time soon (thanks a lot, Botanical Garden, you pretty little fool*) but maybe I was wrong, maybe putting it out there will motivate me to work harder (and get on board with the temp agency where my twice-former co-worker/friend's company goes for their overflow staffing needs, so I DO have something in the works, plus possible additional Weekend Warrior Job hours) and turn it into a self-fulfilling prophecy?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hi, I'm MFA Mama, and I just said THAT. But seriously, as some of my older co-workers have taught me, being optimistic is free. So here's a prioritized list of what I NEED to make happen, or else seriously re-evaluate going to BlogHer and possibly sell our tickets (sigh):\r\n* \u00a0 Pay co-worker who saved my arse yesterday back the gas money I borrowed.\r\n* \u00a0 Purchase \"deer fencing\" (something LIKE that--not that very one probably as it was just the first Google shoved at me when I was looking for an example to show y'all--I can probably find a much better deal, possibly through e-Bates with site-to-store delivery) to keep the garden safe from deer and chickens, so our plants don't get eaten. I've butchered most of the roamers at this point (poultry ones, not deer) but the younger ones are starting to come up there so clearly it's just What They Do. Plus we actually have deer. The kids love them, and I'm fine with them grazing in the yard, but NOT from my garden. Probably I'll have to spend at least $100 on that though (we have our own poles from the clearing we're doing at the back of the property).\r\n* \u00a0 Have the MFA Minivan serviced (only $21.99 at MFA Mechanics, including oil, filter change, and tire rotation) and get it a new headlight (about $60 plus installation, although usually MFA Mechanic cuts me a break). Then update its registration (about $150 all told due to my needing to pay the property tax on the thing to register it).\r\n* \u00a0 Get the Dyson and the lawnmower fixed. Probably going to be about $300 (?) all together, I'm GUESSING. The mower needs a lot of work including a new blade if they won't sharpen our chipped and dented one.\r\n* \u00a0 Fix the fucking tooth. I dislike that almost as much as a day of toothlessness, because I'm mostly immune to dental anesthetic. My dentist and I have agreed that the lingering soreness I get from him attempting blocks is not worth the very minimal benefit and that he'll crank the nitrous all the way up and just try to be quick while I go to my happy place. \"And if you cry, I'll cry, so raise your hand if you need a break,\" he always reminds me. I never have, it's just like ripping off a bandage--better to have over and done with. But never another extraction. If I need another of THOSE I'll have to find money for the general. Bah. Fortunately I've done root canals like that before and they're not TOO bad. Which is to say, they still suck about as much as you'd expect, but I've had worse. Even with my dentist cutting me every possible break, that's $800. Ouch.\r\n* \u00a0 I need to have a vision exam and glaucoma check, as it's been a few years since I saw an eye-doctor for non-emergent/non-surgical eye things, and get new lenses from my glasses (which have valiantly soldiered on since 2006). I already have some new frames I bought on e-Bay one time for a song while I was rich, so it's just the exam and the lenses, which'll still probably be about $250 since they'll have to dilate my eyes to check for lens issues (THANKS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE!).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Okay.

It was grueling enough, and I couldn't afford enough groceries to take lunches through enough of it, in fact, that I almost lost my pants on several occasions during last night's banquet (particularly the breakdown phase). I hadn't catered in almost two weeks, I think, something like that and found that I could pull my waistband out like the dude from the Subway commercials. It would have been A Very Bad Thing had my hips not caught the waistband once or twice, as I was going commando. Whoops.* In all fairness, the pants were one size too big when I acquired them, but Goodwill shoppers can't be choosers: they were nice black GAP pants with the tags still on and the only pair that nice. Now, though, it's more like four sizes too big (probably?) and I probably looked like Charlie Chaplin in my tuxedo shirt and clownpants. D'oh!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, the job may have almost broken me physically, and then let me down by ending too soon, but I'm a much fitter person than I was before.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I...don't wear belts. Don't even own one anymore. Can't tolerate 'em, have never been able to abide 'em since spending seven months in a bodycast as a teenager.

{"date": "May 15, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 In response to \"why no undies,\" which is an entirely valid question...funny story there. Hotter lays out the MFA Childrens' school clothes for the morning each evening after they are in bed, and during my biggest grossing weeks this spring has taken over the laundry completely (like seriously, he doesn't even let me touch the machines, haha) to the point that rather than have me waking him up before dawn to ask him where stuff is he lays mine out too. The first time he did it I saw my work shorts and shirt and bra and undies and socks and keys and inhaler and purse all in a tidy little heap and laughed so hard that it woke him up anyway, bless the man. He has a poor memory for whether I'm wearing underwear after my evening shower and sometimes omits the undies (or lays out lacy, synthetic blend undies of the crawl-up-my-heinie variety that I wouldn't unload trucks of plants/cook hospital food/cater a fancy banquet in loose pants in for less than a double hourly rate, because NO THANK YOU to drawing the eye, truly), and sometimes when I know he's been up with a dodgy tummy and don't see any I'll just shrug and skip 'em (plus depending on whether I'm wearing pants that fit, meaning probably khakis or carpenter shorts, VPL may be an issue anyway as I've had bloating issues relating to prednisone off and on since Asthmapalooza '11 kicked off). I did that the first time in recent memory I wore my black banquet-serving pants, and plan to scout Goodwills and thrift stores at the first available opportunity, perhaps even tomorrow, since they so catastrophically NO LONGER FIT (which yay, really, just boo, money) and I DO NOT WEAR BELTS. That's the long answer. The short answer, I guess, would be \"because I'm a spoiled brat.\"\r\n* \u00a0 I planted SO MANY TOMATOES today. See, I had this moral dilemma. The Botanical garden culls and replaces any plant that is less than perfect, even if that is just because a guest ripped the tags out and they're not certain of the variety. They compost TONS of vegetable plants, perfectly lovely four-packs with maybe one plant broken or all four perfect but untagged, and employees are officially NOT ALLOWED to take them home, but the boss was out one day and in wheeling out a truckload of plants for destruction a few most excellent tomatoes and peppers caught my eye and well, I just couldn't do it. It's like wasting food. So now I have lots of mystery tomatoes and peppers, which is awesome. I like that kind of surprise, since no matter what it is we'll be grateful for its fruit!\r\n* \u00a0 The prednisone is not treating me as well this time around. Prednisone baby is back with a vengeance to the point that I'm REALLY uncomfortable and may need to be seen by my doctor for diuretics and to have her listen to my lungs for signs of fluid overload in there, too. My lungs especially do not need this shit, as their struggling is what led me to be ON the goddamned Prednisone!\r\n* \u00a0 I ate a bunch of watermelon and drank a cup of coffee in hopes that the natural diuretics will help me get on top of my fluid balance issues, and have my fingers crossed. I wish I still had some Lasix about! I so can't afford to see one more damned doctor over this, although I can afford the ER again even less. Gahhh...\r\n* \u00a0 Three cheers for employers who are generous with leftovers ONLY because they know how bad I have it right now due to the recent communication foul-up. That stress may have been well worth it, in rosy retrospect, as we're now eating very well in the days after Weekend Warrior Job, and what we don't eat, the dogs and chickens enjoy!\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of you?\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/05/miscellaneous-and-sundry-on-a-rainy-sunday-evening.html", "title": "miscellaneous and sundry on a rainy Sunday evening"},

I finally conducted autopsies (which is what you're supposed to do with a bad hatch, because you can learn from the results where you might have gone wrong) and only three had formed beyond the early embryonic stage; of those three they were all freshly dead and not fully formed so I'm thinking this was a combination of \"temperature a little on the low side due to still air incubation as opposed to pricier forced-air\" and \"bad handling.\" With the handling, I didn't let the eggs \"settle\" point-down before setting the clutch (which you're supposed to do, evidently, so that the air cells move correctly into place before the peeps form) and also Hotter decided to MOVE THE INCUBATOR while I was at work a few days ago, about the time I think the three \"good\" eggs stopped forming. Take-home lesson at the end of the day, based on autopsies, innernet, and consulting my old Mennonite lady chicken-guru: let the next batch \"settle\" (which they are right now--we've been collecting for the past five days JUST IN CASE), skip the candling because I evidently suck at it anyway and it cools the eggs unnecessarily, and DON'T MOVE THE INCUBATOR. Also, buy an automatic turner if possible; even the little old Mennonite lady said she had crap luck until she got one of those.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0What I decided to do was all of the above EXCEPT buying the automatic turner, because while it's only $40 or so, that's money we don't exactly have to spend on a non-necessity right now (plus it's a bit late now to be hatching anything with the intention that it start laying before winter sets in), especially for only a POTENTIAL gain. I'll give the incubator as-is another go with the eggs we've collected and am hopeful that we'll get a handful of chicks out of that; worst-case scenario we wasted some eggs. Hotter and I also went to the feed store to pick up sweet potato tubers and got some chicks while we were there to fill the MFA Childrens' and my gaping baby-animal heart-voids left by the failed hatch. BABIES! We got a mix of Silver Laced Wyandottes and Easter Eggers.\r\n* \u00a0 The turkeys seem to have turned a corner of sorts and are now loud, active, and being pains in our arses. Yay!

Because if you're an emotional trainwreck staring into space for hours at a time then you're catatonic and you need serious help, whereas if you're an emotional trainwreck staring into teevee (or your laptop) for hours at a time you're just relaxing and that is a HEALTHY thing to do.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Aaaaanyway, I just mentioned to Hotter that I'm surprised by how much I've enjoyed learning from the show--they mention a lot of really cool medical procedures that I end up having to Google and some of this stuff just blows my mind. Like did you know there's this thing called a heterotopic heart transplant where the end result is TWO hearts in one person's chest? Wild!

He's halving her time on steroids as a result, which is great news since they aren't the best thing for a young dog to be on while still growing (plus there are the liver and GI side effects and let's not forget the risk of another mange relapse). YAAAAY! He did say there was a chance the Lymphnode of DOOM would swell up again as we decrease the dose, and if that happens we're to immediately jack the steroids back up and call him to plan long-term treatment. So let's hope that stupid thing stays gone!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The BAD news is that Dr. Brightside checked her leg out and while it doesn't appear to be hip dysplasia (which apparently wouldn't show up on an x-ray this young so no point in taking any films just yet) or anything else terribly sinister, her ACL (I didn't know dogs had those!) feels \"loose\" to him (looser than her other back \"knee\") (he said knee but isn't it a hock? Or am I just thinking horses?) and he thinks she may have injured it somehow. He doesn't think it's torn, just pulled, and said he'd put her on NSAIDs if she wasn't on the steroids but the combination causes ulcers, so we're supposed to keep the steroid-crazed puppy's activity minimal for the next week or so and let him know if she doesn't improve. Sigh.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The other not-so-great news is that she's lost nearly a pound from her illness, which isn't something you want to see in a growing puppy. Dr. Brightside wasn't too concerned about that and probably it's better that Isis be a little on the lighter side given that she has a joint injury, but we're upping her rations a bit (she would DEFINITELY eat more) and I'm giving her the yolks from my eggs in the morning (I don't eat yolks due to cholesterol issues). Those should have a lot of good Omega-3s in them, which she needs for her coat ANYWAY, due to all the flaxseed and walnuts our hens eat.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In neutral news, Dr. Brightside refilled Isis's Ivermectin script to hopefully prevent a mange relapse due to steroids, but he wasn't too happy about doing that because the poor freaking dog is on so many drugs and her liver is still very young.

Express Scripts: They screw me so much my husband is starting to get jealous. *rimshot*\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Don't forget, guest post going up tonight over at Meredith's place (around 8:30 p.m. EST). Meredith, like me, is a lapsed Jew who wears glasses, bakes a lot, and has kind of a thing about her long, pretty hair. Biz introduced us on the Twitter, and she's become kind of like the younger, better-looking sister I never wanted! (<3 you, Meredith)\r\n*\u00a0 The chickens laid three eggs today, but one was a double-yolker so I'm calling it three and a half. GET IT TOGETHER, CHICKENS. THERE ARE EIGHT OF YOU.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Isis seems to be feeling great overall and the Lymphnode of DOOM is down to the size of a marble (after growing to the size of a golfball Tuesday morning). YAY! Unfortunately, she's now limping more with that one leg that she's been favoring off and on, and we can't find anything stuck in her pads or any swelling or anything to explain this. She has an appointment to see Dr. Brightside for a re-check tomorrow anyway and I guess we'll ask about it again and maybe get it x-rayed then (to be fair, the last time he saw her she was trying to die on his table so her sometimes-wonky leg was pretty far down the list on things to worry about). I wish I didn't have such a bad feeling about this, but I'm thinking either hip dysplasia or some kind of godawful bone cancer with the way OUR luck is running. I hope I'm wrong.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm cranky today because I have stress-acne that needs its own place-setting at the dinner table. Seriously, I look like I'm rocking some Smallpox. Not cool, body. NOT. COOL.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Also, my new-to-me coat arrived and fits perfectly, except that it's REALLY tight in the bust. I am hoping that when I lose this stress-weight (thanks a lot, Hotter-with-your-summer-of-hospitalizations and Isis, the Dog Who Is Determined To Die) the girls will shrink down some. Also I haven't worn a bra in a couple of weeks because even the double-D grandma bra I bought at a special bra shop where I had to get measured and groped while topless won't contain me anymore. Don't worry, I wear tanktops with shelf-bras in them under layers if we have to go anywhere where decorum is required (so pretty much to the doctor or the vet--sorry, Kroger, Post Office, and Pharmacy). Hotter thinks this is awesome. I'm just glad our house is a rancher, because if I'm going down stairs in a hurry I have to hold 'em still with my hands. Yes, really. My grandmother had this weird condition where her tits grew until she died, and I'm starting to think I'm doomed to the same fate, which means that in ten years or so I'm probably going to have to consider a reduction. Greeeeeat.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Why yes, yes I DO still have that Deadline of Suck, and maybe I AM procrastinating just a little bit (okay fiiiine, I'm talking about my tits on the innernet and not even getting paid for it, so I'm DEFINITELY procrastinating...wait, no, it's still Breast Cancer Awareness Month--CHECK YOUR TITS, Y'ALL!

Assuming she can pull out of this tailspin with the assistance of the meds, the second hurdle will be whether she can tolerate the full course of treatment without her liver or GI tract throwing in the towel (she's on an adult-human dosage of antibiotics and steroids--TWENTY MILLIGRAMS of Prednisone, y'all, and she only weighs thirty-six pounds!), and after that it's a question of whether leaving her on the Ivermectin can keep her from relapsing with the mange (since Prednisone is an immune-suppresant). It would totally suck if she responds to treatment and tolerates it well but then relapses with the mange, because we can't afford to treat that again, but right now I'm not going to worry that far ahead.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/not-going-on-hiatus-although-life-still-sucks-a-fat-one-and-maybe-you-should-go-on-reading-hiatus-fo.html", "title": "not going on hiatus although life still sucks a fat one and maybe you should go on READING hiatus for the next little bit"},

Only once in my adult life have I been sick like this and NOT needed antibiotics.

She's ninety-five but she's a tough old bird--she fell down a flight of stairs last year and was fine aside from needing a few stitches in her head (I would've broken every damn bone in my body).

They promised it would be gone today, but it wasn't. ExpressScripts is a bunch of lying cocksuckers who lie and (I've said it before and I'll say it again) don't deserve to have heads. Hopefully the \"one-day hold\" will be gone tomorrow (day THREE) and it'll all work out okay, but if not I won't be blogging until we get that straight because no joke, y'all don't want to see that much emo.

It has been a LONG TIME since I sought employment outside the home, long enough that the 89-question online aptitude test to determine whether you're a good fit for Company X is new to me. Some of the questions involving actual on-the-job scenarios make perfect sense, and others, such as \"I believe it is okay to steal from my employer, yes or no\" seem unlikely to garner an honest response from the type of person they're designed to weed out but at least somewhat relevant.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Others...well. \"My use of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, and/or ecstasy has interfered with my ability to arrive at work on time and complete my job-related duties 0, 1-2, 2-5, or more than five times in the past month\" just seems silly. First of all, who's going to cop to doing any of those things on a job application? Second...say someone really does have a problem with street drugs and yet feels oddly compelled to fess up...do you really think they're going to go with \"more than five times???\" Would anyone with that bad of a drug problem even be LOOKING for honest work? Also, I want to know who answers \"strongly agree\" to \"I often feel the need to physically attack others.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The only question that gave me pause was a rather long-winded one to the effect of (and I'm paraphrasing): \"If I were the owner of a large company, and found out that an employee had stolen from one of my stores, but the amount of stolen goods totalled less than $5 over the course of a year, I would fire them\" (yes or no). I picked yes, because regardless of whether I'd actually fire someone for stealing less than five bucks from me over the course of a year, it seems unwise to condone stealing in any way on a job application (the honest answer is: I'm not sure), but then Hotter pointed out that maybe this question was geared toward weeding out the overly-rigid, and now I wonder if I chose wrong?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/02/i-want-to-know-how-many-people-who-these-questions-actually-apply-to-answer-honesty-my-guess-none.html", "title": "I want to know how many people who these questions actually apply to answer honestly (my guess: none)"},

MFA Mama declines to discuss OBGYN + no shower vs. vigorous belly-rub with \"adequate\" shower, citing that Hotter's reasoning is inherently fallacious (faulty analogy). Hotter insists on an answer to the question of whether MFA Mama would go for a pelvic exam unshowered and proceeds to perseverate.\r\n10:06 MFA Mama turns the radio on, begins car-singing with FEELING.\r\n10:15 Hotter turns the radio off.

Before you throw rotten tomatoes at me for such an act of fiscal irresponsibility, a dear friend gifted us a Red Robin gift card, so we did not spend any money out of the household budget! The last time we went out to eat together was over three months ago (and I'm not sure Burger King one time on a gift card I won in a blog-contest really counts as going out to eat...) and it was really, REALLY nice to sit down together and people-watch and eat something neither of us cooked! We also had rootbeer floats, which were AWESOME.\r\n* \u00a0 To further celebrate, we built a second poultry-pen today (a permanent one, rather than my ghetto-fabulous shelving-unit doo-hickey of a few days ago...) and moved the ducklings outside! I'm not sure you can even call them ducklings anymore...they're about half-grown and starting to look like adult mallards! It was fun having them inside while they were tiny, but they are not tiny anymore and they ARE stinky, so YAY! Two out of four ducklings can still fit their bodies through chain-link fencing (improbable as that seems from looking at them), so I made an emergency trip to Southern States for some chicken-wire to run around the bottom two feet of the enclosure.

Almost, in fact, as excited as Little Child himself when he found out he got to help me earn money by thoroughly checking out a video game...\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Little Child's health continues to be much-improved, but I make him stay inside during extreme weather or when he's feeling punky. I recently gave him my review copy of Petz Bunnyz Bunch on a sick day and found his \"slow-ca-vore\" (slow, local food-eating) take on the game to be rather hilarious. See, we grow and/or produce a lot of our own food (as much as possible), including chickens and ducks for meat and eggs. So this is a typical day at Casa MFA when Little Child is feeling good:\r\n Figure One: Harvesting the first turnip greens of the year! Little Child ate these raw :)\r\n  Figure Two: Feeding the ducks--they like turnip greens too!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Video games here are either a treat you work toward after dinner or else something to distract you when you're sick. Little Child spent a sickday home happily \"caring for\" his virtual bunny (which he named \"Jet\"). He liked that the bunny was \"easier to clean up after than the peeps or my brothers' dogs\" and noted that radishes were on the menu of fruits and veggies he could \"buy\" to feed the bunny (\"I'll give him lots of radishes; radishes grow fast so it's okay if he eats them all up!\").\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I was pleasantly surprised to find that Little Child picked up several new sight words from the way the game incentivized reading comprehension (if you want to take good care of your bunny, you have to follow occasional written prompts, which we sounded out together), and aside from the spelling of the title of the game (come on, you HAD to know I'd have feelings about that) I thought this was a really cute little simulation of pet ownership. As for Little Child, he has mentioned on several occasions that \"I definitely want to keep this game like you said I could after you write about it,\" and reminded me just today to tell \"everyone on the Internet\" how much he was still enjoying it after a week, so I think that's two thumbs up!\r\n\u00a0\r\nDisclaimer:\u00a0While\u00a0Ubisoft\u00a0provided me with this game to review, the opinions I've expressed here are solely my own and represent my honest viewpoint.\u00a0Ubisoft,\u00a0Clever Girls Collective\u00a0and I promote\u00a0Blog With Integrity.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340147e3fd85f6970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834014e877e9d6d970d-pi", "http://www.ubi.com/US", "http://www.clevergirlscollective.com/", "http://www.blogwithintegrity.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/04/the-official-little-child-review-of-petz-bunnyz-bunch.html", "title": "the official Little Child review of \"Petz Bunnyz Bunch\""},

Hotter came to tell me my work clothes were in the wash, I asked if he'd checked the pockets before throwing them in, he ran for the washer...the inhaler? Was fine. I cried like a baby. I'm not a crier. But oh my fuck, I can't breathe well enough at work to avoid another costly hospital trip without that thing and don't have ten bucks to replace it and IT WAS FINE...yeah. My head, I think, is broken.\r\n* \u00a0 The turkeys live! Hotter reported that they perked up quite a bit yesterday, and they're eating, drinking, and tottering about! I'm very glad.\r\n* \u00a0 Work is grueling. I uh...well, I unload trucks of plants, mostly. I am not cut out for that sort of thing. Yeah.\r\n* \u00a0 I saw a friend of The Narcissist's at work today. She's a designer. She was picking out plants. She didn't recognize me and asked me for help. I helped her. She hung out for a couple of hours walking around. I ducked her. She kept trying to come up to me. This is someone who ate dinner at my house several times a week when I was growing up. Someone who knew what was happening to me, and did nothing. I don't know what, if anything, she thought she ought to say to me, and I didn't know what, beyond \"NO I DO NOT KNOW WHO THAT IS, NO RELATION!\" I would have said in reply. It sucked. I was kind of looking forward to coming home and talking to my loving husband about it, except...\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter effed up. He made An Unspecified But Downright Stupid Mistake, I called him on it, and he...went all Ad Hominem on me. Yeah. Ouch. There's not really much to say about that (I mean, I could tell y'all EXACTLY what he did and we could talk about Teh Stupid, and I could tell y'all EXACTLY what he said to me, and we could agree that he's a petty, injudicious dick, but...well, it was stupid and then he was a dick, the end, y'know?) except that it was the very last thing I needed and it hurt a lot. I'm disappointed.\r\n* \u00a0 The advantage to working long hours of hard labor is that you get too tired to dissect things very far; well, that and you lose weight (especially if you are out of groceries). I'm going to bed the MOMENT the children are home from dinner visitation and in bed.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Oh, well, they're back. The XY asked if I was sure I didn't want him to take the MFA Children this weekend (I told him that after the ear candle bullshit I wouldn't be sending them to CATHERINE'S house so they were staying here unless he promised to care for them himself). I said of course I WANT you to take them, they miss you and I can't afford to feed them, but they don't much enjoy your girlfriend, as it turns out, and she makes stupid decisions involving their health that I can't deal with, so unless you're going to take care of them yourself I'm not turning them over. He...didn't even offer to do that, and wasn't all that upset. Didn't seem to care. That made me sadder. I didn't think that was possible.\r\n* \u00a0 I have not felt this low in a long time. I'm working my ass off, it's still not going to be enough that we'll make rent, I've never NOT made rent, the most solid thing in my life (my marriage) has had a wobble, I feel bad that my kids don't have a decent father, I feel ashamed of my missing front tooth and ashamed of myself for CARING so much, I'm worried that my lungs aren't handling the steroid taper so well anymore, I'm worried that this will all finally be what breaks me and feel lame that my life has come to this...I used to have such big dreams, and now I can't get the dirt out of the cracks of my hands or stop crying.

Don't get me wrong, my lungs were utter dicks and I did cough for most of the day because I won't take codeine at work, but if I had saved the breath I used up in explaining that I Wasn't Quite Dead Yet to everyone it would have been easier to power through the day (which I did, in fine style, and even garnered several compliments on my work from supervisory-types and one very nice little old lady buying flowers).\r\n* \u00a0 Big Child's ear is still leaking blood and pus, and while he seems to FEEL perfectly fine this troubles him (and me). I have shamed the XY into picking him up from school to take him to the pediatrician for a re-check as my next chance at a POSSIBLE day off is Friday; perhaps this is normal with a ruptured eardrum but I seem to recall my own experience with same drying up by this point into antibiotics and would like someone with good equipment and a prescription pad hand JUST IN CASE to take a gander.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter hadn't made much progress toward dinner, because he was busy with other things, and I had fun helping him in the kitchen even in dinner was\u00a0late. At least I did until Big Child began to interrogate me about dinner as he likes to do while I was carrying the Shepherd's Pie to the table, getting me so flustered (not because him questions were tough ones, but just because they were like a staccatto stream of machine-gun fire; it's a combination of developmental delay-driven angst to know about the food, ADD-fueled impulsitivity and speed, and desperation for my attention that I have banned at least once for every twice that he does it, so multiply ten years minus the two it took him to speak at all clearly by three hundred and twenty or so, to account for time I've been in hospitals or he's been with his father, THAT MANY TIMES, not that it helps to prevent a damned thing and do you see how this was all one run-on sentence, yeah, it's like THAT) that I burned all four fingertips on my left hand.\r\n* \u00a0 I set dinner down intact and told everyone to stop what they were doing and be aware of the fact that Mommy Needs Five Minutes Badly and leave me alone, went into the kitchen to run my hand under cold water, declined Hotter's assistance, sent Little Child to wash his hands, told Big Child to stop wiping his face on the couch (it wasn't wet or dirty, but that's Not Acceptable Sensory-Seeking In My House And You Wouldn't Do It At School, At Least I Hope Not), refused to let Hotter see my fingers, grabbed something from the freezer to grasp, told Middle Child to Wash HIS hands, scurried into the den, turned Big Child back from following me because I needed three minutes, JUST THREE MINUTES WITHOUT ANYONE IN MY FACE STARTING NOW, told Hotter I meant him too, assured him that even though he WAS a chef and The Expert In Burnt Things it wasn't That Bad and I needed just ONE MINUTE, SERIOUSLY, ALONE, NOW, REALLY IT IS FINE IT JUST HURTS and then I got about thirty seconds of everydamnone in the house palpably sulking in my general direction and decided to call that a win.\r\n* \u00a0 I then declared to my bickering children and pouting husband that we were going to have a pleasant dinner during which we would voice nothing but positive thoughts about each other and words of appreciation about our delicious meal that we were fortunate enough to be eating together as a family, and I must have REALLY had The Crazy Prednisone Eye because I only had to warn everyone at the table (except Big Child, who loves black-and-white rules like a fat kid loves cake and was cheerful and correct enough to irritate the bejesus out of everyone else) once apiece that they were \"dangerously close to non-appreciation\" and say to Middly ONCE that I knew I was only hallucinating from a long day at work and he wasn't REALLY chewing on his shirt because Six-Year-Olds-Do-Not-Do-That and I knew that when I turned back around his shirt would not be anywhere between his teeth SEE THAT'S MY GOOD BOY!\r\n* \u00a0 I did a bit of after-dinner-and-bedtime-for-children candling, and of thirteen MFA Eggs currently incubating, there are eight yeses, three maybe-could-go-either-ways, and two \"looks-like-a-no-to-me-but-I'm-no-expert-yet-so-we'll-reevaluate-in-two-days\"es.

{"date": "February  8, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently February 6 - February 12, 2011 is Feeding Tube Awareness Week, and since my Little Child eats primarily via g-tube, I thought I'd say something. As more and more severely premature children and children with protein allergies/malabsorption issues or anatomical defects survive past infancy and beyond, feeding tubes are becoming pretty common. My son's smallish elementary school alone has four tube-fed students in attendance, and chances are you'll run into a kid with a tube sooner or later. Here's a quick overview of what a \"feeding tube\" actually is and some things NOT to say if you notice that you're in the presence of a child with a feeding tube.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 NG (nasogastric) tubes, the tubes you sometimes see running out of babies' noses and taped to their cheeks, are usually the first type of tube a baby or child will get, because they don't require surgery and are very easy to remove when the child doesn't need the tube anymore (you just pull them out). If the child's stomach isn't functional or they're at high risk of aspiration, sometimes a radiologist will help guide this type of tube down to the jejunem (small intestine), bypassing the stomach.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 G-tubes are a more permanent solution for children who need long-term tube-feeding; they are surgically inserted into the child's upper left abdomen, and after an initial healing period with a \"pull-PEG\" starter tube (kind of like how you get \"starter earrings\" if you pierce your ears) consist of a \"button\" held in place by a water-filled balloon. There is a valve on the side to inflate and deflate the balloon with a syringe and a port to attach an \"extension\" (thin, flexible tube through which you give formula or pureed foods) to. Some kids end up needing a \"G-J\" tube (a type of tube that uses a \"button\" at the G-tube site to anchor an internal tube threaded down to the jejunem) or even a separate J-tube (these are a few inches lower than a G-tube).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 If you notice a little kid running around with a tube running out the bottom of their shirt into a small backpack, probably they have a \"Kangaroo Pump.\" Children whose stomachs don't tolerate high volumes sometimes need to use a pump that delivers a measured rate of formula. Little Child had a pump for the first year or so that he used his G-tube (after five months of an NG or NJ), but is now able to have \"gavage feedings\" (where I attach a 60-cc syringe barrel to his extension, hold it up, and pour formula down it, letting it run in via gravity).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It's normal to be curious when you see something different, but how you express that can be the difference between making a new friend and being \"that IDIOT\" some mother of a tube-fed child rants about to her friends.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Asking about a feeding tube is usually fine, but just come right out and ask \"is that a feeding tube?\" rather than saying \"what's wrong with your baby???\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Asking how long the child's doctors expect them to need tube-feeding is fine. \"He won't have to have that thing FOREVER will he?\" and \"when will he get that taken out?\" are not. Because maybe the tube IS expected to be permanent, and if it is then probably the kid's parents are just grateful they're alive--you could hurt their feelings or worse, make the child feel uncomfortable by implying that a permanent tube is such a horrible thing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Asking about a child's prognosis on a first encounter is NOT okay. First of all, if you don't know the child or their parents, it's none of your business. Second, if the prognosis is uncertain or poor, you're asking a stranger to tell you their greatest personal tragedy on the playground, and that's rude. And third and probably most important? If the kid is right there you're being grossly inappropriate; you don't know how much the parents have told the child about their condition. Also, if you say it like \"but he's going to be fine...right?\" you're essentially asking the child's parent or caregiver to reassure you for your own peace of mind. That's not their job.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Asking the child questions about the tube (unless the child engages you and brings it up) is not cool. If you have questions about the tube, ask the parent or caregiver, and if you're just making conversation, make it about the child's super-cool shoes or beautiful curly hair or whatever you'd remark on to another child withOUT a tube. The kid is probably keenly aware that they are different, so you don't need to emphasize that.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, and this is kind of odd but I've heard it on several occasions, do NOT watch the child's parent or caregiver prepare to feed them and then point and shriek \"IS THAT STERILE? THAT DOESN'T LOOK STERILE!\" Feeding tubes are not like central lines; they are not sterile. The gut? Is not sterile. Formula that goes in the tube and the implements used to deliver it therefore do not need to be sterile. I tell people \"it just has to be dishes-clean\" and am usually pleasant about it but really? The child's parent or caregiver knows what they're doing. If you see them do something with their child's feeding tube, probably that's exactly how they're supposed to do it.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for reading, and hey if you want to help brighten the lives of lots of kids like mine, click and support this organization, which is trying to get Sesame Street to include a castmember with a feeding tube.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://feedingtubeawareness.com"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/02/i-didnt-even-know-there-was-a-feeding-tube-awareness-week.html", "title": "I didn't even know there WAS a Feeding Tube Awareness Week!"},

I am fretting because it's rather late in the year for any of them to START laying and I had hoped we'd be getting at least two eggs per day throughout the winter (Barred Plymouth Rocks lay through the winter, which is one of the reasons we chose this breed).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I have some kind of abscess-type thing on my boob, and I'm none too pleased about it. I brought it to a head the night before last with compresses and it drained some; I've kept Mupirocin and a bandaid on it since then and it appears to be getting better but I'm awfully wiped out. We'll see I guess (if you're wondering why I don't go to a doctor, a) I can't swing the co-payment right now unless it's a dire emergency, which currently this is not and b) I try to avoid using antibiotics unless there's a clear necessity due to my allergies limiting what I can take and my history of resistant bugs, also c) Mupirocin penetrates a quarter inch below the skin and can therefore take care of many local infections without systemic drugs--I have successfully treated staph infections with it several times in the past).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 FOOD! We're eating local more here at Casa MFA, and while we've never been huge consumers of processed foods, we're trying to cut back even further on those. We haven't watched Food, Inc. yet because I know I would end up losing my junk and going vegan again, but this image, which has been making the rounds on the innernet, scarred me for life and the more I learn about the way commercial dairy products are produced, the more I have The Crazy.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 MFA Puppy is recovering well after being spayed on Friday; this morning in the wee hours she woke up and yakked on Hotter's side of the bed (GOOD DOG!) and so we think perhaps the Rimadyl was too much for her delicate stomach even though we were giving it to her with meals. We held the morning dose today to see how she'd do and she's still bouncing around and wanting to play; I think she'll be okay without pain meds from here on out. Hotter and I have both had multiple abdominal surgeries our own selves and several times a day we stare slack-jawed at our energetic and happy dog and remark to each other on how we hadn't even ditched the catheter/stood up/eaten anything/etc. at this point in our own recovery from _____.

This is kind of hilarious to me because I hate hate hate television like poison; Hotter on the other hand loves it and I think it was a bit of an adjustment for him going from premium cable and pay-per-view to \"no teevee in MFA Mama's house,\" but he's handled it gracefully (for the most part) and suffered minimal DTs.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Many times he has tried to seduce me with various teevee shows. He especially enjoys the various CSI iterations. I do not. He occasionally coaxes me into watching a movie, but that's about all I'll put up with in terms of \"chewing gum for the eyeballs.\" Maybe it's all the extraneous education, maybe it's the ADD, maybe I'm just prematurely crotchety. Hell, I spent a solid five minutes today scolding my checkout girl for saying (when the bag boy out of nowhere volunteered that he was reading The Great Gatsby for AP English) that Fitzgerald failed to hold her interest because \"that novel was like, all over the map.\" Oh yes, and I may have even shaken my FINGER at her all \"not only is The Great Gatsby one of the most magnificently compact examples of a fullfledged novel, but it's also a seminal work of American literature, and was in no way ALL OVER THE MAP!\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 For whatever reason, though (well okay because it's masterfully written), Bones has captured both my attention span and my heart, and over the past several months Hotter and I have spent our evenings snuggling on the couch with episodes from Netflix. We've worked our way up to the current season playing, and that isn't available through Netflix. Hotter then pointed out that it was on Hulu. So we settled down to watch this evening, and five minutes into the first episode--\r\n--YOUR FREE PREVIEW HAS ENDED!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Oh yes. Apparently Hulu only makes it LOOK as though you can watch things you really want to see, and chooses five minutes into whatever it is you're watching to hit you up for $7.99. Which is more than I currently have to spend on additional entertainment, so now I have blueballs, and I just wanted to take this opportunity to let all of y'all know, lest the same thing happen to you. This is some of the very WORST and most infuriating marketing I have ever seen in action, and honestly? When I get paid on the 15th I'll probably be willing to cough up a few bucks on something fun and had Hulu been HONEST and posted that those episodes of that show were available to \"Plus Subscribers\" for a fee I might've just made a mental note and come back to Hulu next week. But this little ploy on their part has ensured that I will never give them a penny; I'll either pay for the episodes elsewhere or watch them next year.

I'm not alarmed by this so much as chagrined, since my lungs have responded nicely (albeit slowly) to treatment and my initial dismay was mostly because it was so very tempting to connect the two (the pain and the breathing difficulties), and those two things when connected are usually Not Good. In conjunction they can make you wish for death repeatedly, but are not any more dangerous than the sum of their parts. I am proud to say that throughout this most recent illness I have stayed AWAY from Dr. Innernet, up until today when I asked Twitter whether dislocated ribs usually get worse before getting better (apparently yes, they do) and whether they take long to heal (yes).

{"date": "February 15, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 This morning The XY took Middle Child to the pediatrician for an ADD med-consult. This is huge, as he was in denial about the kid even HAVING ADD until the IEP modification meeting last week where they doubled his hours with the special ed. teacher and let us know that currently he is failing first grade. Of course, the XY was half an hour late to the appointed meeting spot, where Middly and I sat in the MFA Minivan from 7:44 a.m. to 8:20 a.m. (his actual appointment time), and THEN the XY arrived assuring me that he'd called to tell them he was running late and barking at me to cut him some slack because he's under a lot of stress. Apparently the wheels are coming off the bus? I am really hoping that the pediatrician located the notes from the Very Pompous Neurologist I took Middly to see as a toddler when we were worried he was having absence seizures (his EEG was clean although the neurologist DID diagnose him formally with PDD-NOS and ADD).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm working on a deadline currently, so I'm probably going to be a little absent here for a bit (more).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I debated whether or not to say anything about this on here, but I'm kind of worried about Hotter. Lately he's really absent-minded and I'm not sure what's going on. He does, as he often throws out to excuse various things he does that make me twitch, have brain damage, like for real not just to kid around about. But as I told him, I fell in love with and married him with the brain damage, and I have accepted the fact that he will never, ever, EVER put the butter away after he uses it or remember my birthday if I put him on the spot (to his credit, he does consistently gets the month and the digits correct, he just reverses the date). What BOTHERS me is when he's bumping into way more things than usual, spilling ALL of the milk one day, and dumping orange juice in his coffee the next. Part of this is likely vision-related, as Hotter and I both need new glasses and he has recently had a small bleed in his \"good\" eye (this isn't anything that needs medical attention unless it obscures his entire field of vision, which it apparently has at least once in the past, and they drained all of the vitreous fluid from his eyeball and replaced it with saline and even thinking about that makes me gag but anyway it's a known issue). Hotter's vision, thanks to diabetes and dozens of laser surgeries plus a stroke, is dim, blurry, and lacking peripheral perception on a good day and he hasn't had one of those, eye-wise, in a while. So maybe that's part of it. But then there's also the way he comes up to me urgently and tells me the oatmeal is too thin and the oats are too hard, then when I ask where it is says it was perfect, so good that there's none left, the kids inhaled it, what do I mean he just criticized the oatmeal? Nevermind, don't pay any attention to him, he just needs coffee...etc. It's gotten to the point where he'll be off on a tangent and realize he's off on a tangent and sigh, hold both arms out, and bare his teeth because he KNOWS I'm going to jump his case with a home neuro-exam. I don't like this, but it doesn't seem like an emergency because his seizures are completely controlled right now. But I don't like it.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 And how are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/02/the-word-of-the-day-is-absence.html", "title": "the word of the day is: absence"},

When I had a credit for TWENTY-THREE (the price of three bags of feed I never picked up for my former PMU rescue Clydesdales)???\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It was like kismet, y'all!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 When I asked about the laying pullets via the feed store's website contact-box this morning, they told me they had ISA Browns, and I said \"great, we'll take two!\" and Hotter and I packed up a Rubbermaid tub and hopped in the MFA Minivan. We figured we'd get two pullets and a spare bag of feed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 At the feed store's chicken house, the girl in charge of the chickens went into a large, eye-wateringly stenchy pen and netted us some pullets. I was sad to see that the birds were debeaked (I hate that!) and very, very scrawny. Meanwhile, Hotter meandered over to where a pen of assorted fancy chickens was milling about and called my attention to a magnificent rooster (I think it was an Australorp--Hotter wanted to get it so that he could \"take people out back and show 'em my big black cock!\" but I vetoed that because...well do I even need to justify that? No, I think not). Then I saw a flash of gorgeous plumage and it may make me a very lame panda, y'all, but I swear my heart skipped a beat.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"ARE THOSE ARAUCANAS,\" I shrieked. Yes, the highly-amused chicken wrangler said, they were.\r\n \u00a0Figure One: This is an Araucana.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 YOU GUYS! Just yesterday all three MFA Children were (after a conversation about eggshell colors during which they wanted to know if brown eggs and white eggs looked or tasted different when I informed them that eggs were like people and no matter what color they were all the same on the inside and equally good and why yes, I AM proud of that one) begging--BEGGING!--me for some \"Easter Eggers,\" as Araucanas and Americaunas are collectively called in the chicken world (most \"Easter Eggers\" are mongrels but the ones we saw today were show-quality Chilean Araucanas). Why, you ask, were my children throwing a fit over chickens? Because this is the kind of chicken that lays multi-colored eggs.\r\n Figure Two: Like this.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Since first of all, I do not get to give my children what they wish for nearly enough due to finances, and second, they remained despite my best attempts CONVINCED that \"easter eggs\" would taste different, I pretty much had to get at least one of these birds if at all possible to reinforce that we are all the same (and prove they don't lay blueberry eggs!).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I asked how much they were, prepared to hear that we'd only be getting one chicken, and...THEY WERE SEVEN DOLLARS, TOO! The only reason they hadn't mentioned these birds when I asked about laying pullets is that they haven't laid yet (they're a week younger than the ISA Browns, who hatched the same day as the original MFA Flock)! I said nevermind, we'd just get two of those, but...well, the girl had already netted the one ISA Brown and put her in the Rubbermaid tub, and she was so little and skinny and pitiful with her uneven and half-missing beak that I wanted to take her home and make her oatmeal and love her and pet her and call her George.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So we ended up with three new chickens. Innernet, meet Nameless the First, Nameless the Second, and George:\r\n Figure Three: And they'll all live happily ever after as soon as the new pecking order is sorted out (the Barred Rocks, not pictured, are Not Amused and were on the other perch on the far end of the coop throwing gang signs).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["www.mypetchicken.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISA_Brown", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debeaking", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australorp", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f5045b63970b-pi", "http://www.feathersite.com/Poultry/CGA/Arau/BRKEaster.html", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401348823858d970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013488241806970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/fresh-meat-in-the-mfa-flock.html", "title": "fresh meat in the MFA Flock"},

The day before yesterday was NOT PRETTY AT ALL. Yesterday I took three naps. Two so far today. So, yeah.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Little Child had his first field trip yesterday! We slept late and I had to drive him to school (I had to drive all three kids to school, but ran Little Child in first so he woudn't miss the bus!) but he made it in time and was VERY excited when he got home. The class went to a local shopping center and visited several businesses there. Apparently the Japanese steakhouse was a big hit--a chef there did some tricks involving fire. WHOO, FIRE!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 MFA Puppy went for another skin scraping and Mitaban treatment today, and I'm worried about her. Not only because those dips kick her poor little arse, but also because she has one VERY enlarged lymphnode in her neck. JUST one. I'm hoping it's not a tumah but with our luck? Oy. I'm not going to think about it any further until the vet weighs in, la-la-la...\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Three eggs yesterday! Two from the Barred Rocks and one from George. I'm having to lock the original flock up a couple of times a day so that the newcomers can eat and drink in peace, so we know who's laying what (I provided an extra \"nesting box\" consisting of a Rubbermaid tub full of straw outside of the henhouse but they wait until they've got access to the house itself and do a sort of \"chicken pee-dance\" outside it when they have to lay, which is kind of hilarious). George's eggs are also a darker brown than the Barred Rocks' are, and almost spherical.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The new chickens are breaking my heart, y'all--they won't eat treats of any kind, just chicken feed! Those birds need to learn how to live the good life, especially George, who is so damned skinny I worry about her laying daily as she's been doing since she got here--it seems like that would take a lot out of a body and she's just bones and feathers! She gobbled up some ground oyster shell that I provide all of the hens with for calcium, so that's good, but I want to see her gain some weight before it gets super-cold.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I'll probably be doing some more fundraising-type stuff on the Twitter today while Isis is at the vet getting scraped and dipped and having her stitches removed. The Donate button is still up at the bottom right and if you have a few bucks to spare we'd appreciate the help in getting Isis better...we're almost at the fundraising goal!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday I baked bread, cleaned an entire pumpkin and roasted the seeds, made half of it into a pie (the other half is in the fridge and will probably become soup), and made cream of broccoli soup. Today I had planned to bake our caption contest winner some cookies...look at me all domestic and shizz!...but I think I'll hold off and do it Monday so that the cookies a) do not have cooties and b) do not sit in a mail truck all day Sunday. Also yesterday wore me out. For the holidays this year I would very much like a working immune system, please and thank you Santa and Hannukah Harry!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Something I love about having chickens, aside from how much fun they are to watch and how nice it is to have fresh organic eggs? FOOD DOES NOT GO TO WASTE ANYMORE. Hotter and I are both leftover-eaters, but when the kids are sick-ish or have made a mess of something by gnawing off just the toppings or something that creates wasted food (which on top of being a sin in general is extra-appalling since Hotter and I are both excellent cooks and we're using a lot more high-quality organic ingredients lately, which are not cheap)...or at least it DID until we had the MFA Flock, which happily devours pretty much any kind of leftovers (I don't generally give them meat, not because they won't eat it but because I worry about scraps creating bacteria in their enclosure that would then potentially make their way into the eggs, but the dog is more than happy to have trimming and half-eaten leftovers of meat from the table in her dinner). Today a half-eaten piece of pumpkin pie left over from breakfast (yes, I let the MFA Children have pie for breakfast just this once--I made that pie and the top three ingredients are organic pumpkin, condensed milk, and organic eggs so while it also had more sugar than a typical MFA breakfast it was actually pretty nutritious, plus it was a special treat for them--I baked the pie last night and they're going to their father's for the weekend, so...) became brunch for the hens, and WHOOBOY, stand back! The MFA Flock approves of my baking, too.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of you?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://bkfamily-andthentherewerethree.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/in-which-i-am-sick-and-we-have-a-three-egg-day.html", "title": "in which I am sick and we have a three-egg day"},

WHOOHOO!!!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 As far as where we go from here, Dr. Brightside said he's definitely having the vet tech go ahead with today's Mitaban dip since Isis was just spayed and that can weaken the immune system and cause relapses--we don't want to let those nasty mites get a leg up!--and keep her on the Ivermectin, then do another scraping in two weeks and if that's clear, we \"call it good.\" He's pleased that we went ahead and ordered the woo-woo supplement he suggested (apparently he's seen good results in using it to boost dogs' immune systems in situations like Isis's, and so I decided it was worth a try), and said to continue that, the Omega-3-rich salmon oil we've been adding to her food, and the Pet-Tabs Plus vitamins.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Today's fill of Ivermectin could conceivably be the LAST mange-related expense we have, which would be awesome.

All were from the Barred Rocks; I think poor George has stopped laying for a bit due to malnutrition (she and the Araucanas have only been eating a couple of times a day while the Barred Rocks are locked up to give them a chance). Today I started a new system of going out first thing and locking four Barred Rocks up in the smaller run with access to the hen-hutch and leaving George, the Araucanas, and Speck with the run of the pen (and a nesting box consisting of a Rubbermaid tub full of straw, which Speck laid in today). Speck seems to be the alpha-hen, but this way she's outnumbered and has no choice but to treat the newcomers well; I figure her accepting the new birds will set an example for the other four Barred Rocks. After everyone lays I let the original MFA Flock (including Speck) outside to forage and leave the newcomers alone in the pen to have some stress-free time, then an hour before dusk I throw everyone in together (they willingly share the hen-hutch at night now--I think they suspend hostilities in order to maximize the warmth from all crowding together in there).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In non-good news, I feel like I'm getting one of those sucktastic secondary infections I tend to get, and this sucks even more than in just the \"oh crap I'm sick\" kind of way, because I really can't afford to go to the doctor and get antibiotics if I end up needing to (which I kind of think I will unless I improve overnight) due to having \"borrowed\" from the household budget to cover MFA Puppy's Ivermectin on Friday. If I have go to the doctor and pay for antibiotics, I won't be able to cover the power bill, and if our online payment to them gets rejected for non-sufficient funds, they'll kick us off the budget plan (which would mean paying several hundred dollars extra to maintain service, which is NOT doable).

That was nice. I needed that to remind me I'm alive! I was looking forward to discussing this with Hotter, who had ceased his OWN fuckwittage (thankfully).\r\n* \u00a0 Oh except he really didn't, see, when I called him on my lunch and told him what I would need from him to let go of this and forgive and forget? Yeah, he said \"absolutely, done, I love you baby!\" and then totally went back on that, and oh my lord y'all, this isn't open season on Hotter or anything because I do love the damn fool and if he's only going to make me want to wring his neck twice in sixteen months that's still a pretty good average for a husband, but that said, REALLY, DID HE HAVE TO DO IT TWICE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WHEN MY EYELID WAS ALREADY TWITCHING, SRSLY DUDE? He assures me it won't happen again, and y'know, this me-gone-all-the-time thing is hard on all of us and I'm not my most fabulous self right now either, really, I underSTAND, but one more tomorrow and you'll see me on the news, is all I'm saying. He failed marriage today AND yesterday, and it was the absofuckinglute LAST thing I needed. For one thing, I kind of wanted to ask him if he thought I was being an asshole on the issue with the XY, but if he can't be relied upon to tell when HE'S being a petty shithead then how can I rely on him to tell me whether I'M being a petty shithead? Plus SRSLY DUDE?\r\n* \u00a0 I got a comment on here that scared the crap out of me. Now, I'm not saying this to guilt the person who left it. As far as I can tell (although I freely admit that I misread people, OFTEN), they left said comment from a place of sympathy and caring, and they actually had a really good point vis a vie perspective that made me think about where my life is and realize it could be AND HAS BEEN worse, and therefore I can do this, really, even though it sucks, and for that I thank them whatever their motive might have been. But this is someone who in the past has clearly wished me quite a bit of ill, and therefore I can only conclude that either a) I am so fucking pathetic anymore that a former tormentor felt sorry for me or b) they were trying to breech my defenses and move in for the kill and well...damn. I don't deny being pathetic, hell, I don't even know why I'm talking about this crap except that I feel kind of alone against the world right now for the first time in a WHILE and in the past I've treated the innernet as the family and friends I lack and it's (mostly) been very kind in return (incidentally, y'all's cyberhugs and words of support and affirmation in the comments section really helped prop me up today, and I big-puffy-heart every single one of you for that)...but clearly I am having some kind of mental stability challenge either as a result of my life sucking balls or the steroid taper or both, and it occurs to me that maybe I ought to shut the hell up until that's over with since there ARE those who wish me ill, y'know? Especially since the XY has, as of this evening, declared his intent to sue my arse off (which could totally be bullshit, as he only actually sues me about once for every twenty times he threatens to, but still). So I'm not blogging until I recover my zen, which'll either be when the last of the prednisone (which I took today) wears off, and/or the next paycheck comes in, and/or Hotter manages to string together two or three consecutive days of not-making-me-feel-like-the-girl-who-marries-stupidly. SOMEthing's got to give, right? I can handle this. I've handled worse. It'll all be okay in the end, and if it's not okay, it's not the end. But until things are a little less godawful I don't think I ought to be running my mouth on the innernet, just in case. I'll be checking e-mail if you want to poke me with the pokey-stick-of-making-sure-she-ain't-dead-yet, and I'll probably check in on the Twitter, but uh...yeah.

The Narcissist had a way of ruining all holidays when I was growing up, reminding everyone how we were letting her down, and so naturally a holiday all about her was extra-awful.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The first-grade teacher put out a call for photos of students with their moms. I didn't have one of me and Middly, and had to take a quick snap early one morning. Me in my work-shirt, trying to smile without showing any teeth, Middly puffy from recent sleep. I looked at that picture and hated everything about it. I looked at it and saw everything wrong with my life.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Last night was rough. Things actually went downhill some more, and I ended up drinking quite a bit and crying quite a bit more. I woke up hung over and feeling brittle, irritable. I forbade Hotter to speak to me. I stomped around and made plans to slaughter a chicken, because there's nothing much left in the freezer.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then I remembered about the tea. I didn't want to go. I didn't want people to see my missing front tooth. I didn't want to ruin Middly's event by being shy and sad and grubby and grim. I felt thoroughly sorry for myself. And then I thought about The Narcissist, and how her feeling that she deserved so much better than her life including me always came to the forefront, and was ashamed. I think part of why I'm so very down when I'm down is that at my very worst I remind myself of her. And well, fuck that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I thought about Middle Child, and how excited he was, and asked myself, what do little boys want from their mothers? They want them to be pretty and happy and carefree. And I set about making myself at least look that way. I scrubbed as much of the dirt as would come out out of my cracked hands and painted my nails. I put on a lacy shirt and a flowered skirt, even though my tits have gotten too big for the shirt and I had to sew myself into it. I pinned my hair back and cut rosebuds from the bush out front to put in it, because Middly sometimes talks about \"fancy ladies wif flowers in dere hair.\" I put on my makeup, which required using a mirror, and just tried not to look at my goddamn tooth. And I put on my party shoes and drove to the elementary school.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The tea was very sweet. Middly ushered me proudly to his desk and pulled out the chair for me. The children served us crudites and cookies, tea in little plastic tumblers. They sang us songs. Ours wasn't the only last-minute-looking picture in the slideshow. My necklace from Middly matched my skirt:\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the wall was a bulletin board covered with articles the children had written about their moms. I remembered Middly interviewing me one time when I was hot and tired and grouchy, asking me questions, and I forget what I said, but this is what he wrote:\r\nMy mom is the best. My mom works a lot and she misses us, but she is still a good mom to me, Big Child, and Little Child. She loves us no matter how tired she is. My mom will not give up. She is strong and she has a big heart.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Oh, buddy.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0After the tea, the special education teacher and the classroom teacher took me aside to tell me that since he started ADD meds Middly has completely caught up to his peers. There is no more talk of him being held back; he doesn't even need to go to summer school. The reading specialist dropped in to tell me that Middly is one of the dearest children she has ever worked with: he is just such a joy, I cried when he reached his goals to stop working with me every week, she said. We all had a little weepfest.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am still Not Running My Mouth On The Innernet about myself, but I had to come on here and brag about my kid. He works so hard, and loves me so much, and I don't see HIM moping around feeling sorry for himself. Way to shake me out of my funk, kid. Your mom will not give up.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834015432276d50970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/05/mothers-tea.html", "title": "Mothers' Tea"},

It really is, most of the time, hell, the innernet gave me Hotter and saved my dog's life, and today y'all have gotten me gas and grocery money that will hit my account FRIDAY and hell, I can figure out one day even if, as I said to someone after I e-mailed them a thank-you and they responded (it's someone REALLY SUPER-AWESOME, TOO, LIKE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD OF HER, BUT DAMMIT SHE WON'T LET ME SAY)(because I want to THANK her by name, not just brag about how we're acquainted), it's \"cous-cous egg mcfuckingmuffins with ketchup optional.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It's not though. I realized that my totally picked-bare pantry and back yard contained all of the ingredients for a modified version of my chicken mock-tortilla soup. I call it that because I originally threw it together in imitation of a local store-brand chicken tortilla soup, but it lacks several key ingredients due to a combination of household-members' food and textural aversions, current poverty, and personal preferences. I kind of married tortilla soup and a Mennonite pork recipe I used for chicken and fell in love with involving squash, tomato, onion, and cumin.\r\nMFA Mama's Mock-Tortilla Soup\r\nSet a canning kettle of water to boil and go into the yard, watch the bald hen until someone comes along and picks a feather, grab the feather-picker, take her inside, and shampoo her feathers with dish soap. Bind her feet, hang her from the engine hoist out back, slit her throat, and leave her to bleed out while you get the kettle. Scald her until the wing feathers will come out easily, then re-hang her and pluck her, saving the breast and back feathers for a pillow. Gut, de-foot, and behead the bird according to these instructions. Serve the organs minus the gallbladder to the dogs along with the head and feet.\u00a0\r\nPut the chicken in the crockpot along with water, a can of tomato paste, a four-ounce jar of pumpkin preserves, a couple of tablespoons chopped onion, half a dozen whole peeled cloves of garlic, half a jar of salsa, cumin to taste, pepper, salt, one packet of sazon, and a dash of cayenne. Cook on low all night.\r\nIn the morning, carefully use a spatula and serving spoon to maneuver the chicken onto a plate and stick it in the freezer. Put the broth in the fridge. Make corn tortillas and mash a can of pinto beans while they chill. Pick the chicken carcass until all outside meat is off, chop that, and add back to the broth after it cools enough skim the fat off and strain the broth. Put the broth in a large pot on the stove, add the meat and mashed beans, and heat to simmer. Add a handful or two of rice, and remove from heat when that is cooked through. Instruct your spouse to top with fresh cilantro from the herb garden and fried strips of tortilla, put comments back on moderate, and go to work at a large venue out of town without worrying about food, gas, or trolls.

OH MY GOD, THAT FILTHY FOUL CUR, NOOOOOOBADDOG!!!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I ended up loading a syringe with mouthwash and cleaning her mouth out thoroughly with gloves on, while Hotter laughed himself sick. NASTY-ASSED DOG, JESUS CHRIST, FEH!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Isis's mystery lymphnode in her neck was examined yesterday by Dr. Brightside, who said that since it was just her neck glands that were enlarged and she looked pretty healthy otherwise we'd give them until her next follow-up skin scraping in two weeks and if they were still enlarged at that time THEN we'd worry about them. So naturally the thing tripled in size overnight and is now clearly visible from across the room. I'm on the fence as to whether to just continue watching this or take her back to the vet. I think we'll give it until tomorrow.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I goofed when I said that yesterday's refill of Ivermectin was hopefully the LAST mange-related expense.

The Zany Housewife cracks my shit up.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter still wants that big black cock. In fact, he's kind of perseverating on the subject, and has gone so far as to opine that the hens will lay better in the presence of a rooster. He has also pointed out that we need more feed in about a week and the place where we saw the cock sells feed so it could be a dual-purpose excursion. Obsess much?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 One of the mice looks to be in danger of exploding, which means that we should have pinkies soon. Poe still hasn't eaten the pinky-daddy (we bought two females and a male, and after leaving the male in with the females for about a week, put him in the snake cage to be a meal for the snake, except the snake is on some kind of hunger strike--snakeFAIL!), and while the herpetologists I have consulted via the innernet suggest cutting a pinky's head open to expose the brain in order to entice a reluctant snake, Poe may just have to starve to death, because EWW!

It's a pain in the arse chest at times, and it's inconvenient and costly (at least by my standards), but I have never had a hospital admission due to asthma, for example. I am whining here because I don't like what I've got, not because what I've got is so epically tragic and awful, and I get that.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter is so very sweet about it when I'm sick. He brings me heated Bed Buddies for my feet and boxes of tissue and hot tea and smooches. I am very cognizent of how lucky I am to be sick on a day when I don't have to work or wrangle small boys, in a warm, clean bed, with a Hotter about.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I guess I'm nervous of doing anything even approaching whining or complaining, not only because I am wholly fortunate and well-aware of that, but also because I've got to adjust to writing with a stalker all over again. I write, and then I ask myself, does that make you seem too ill to be a \"fit\" mother in the eyes of X or will someone say you're angling for Y to happen with the sickness? \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 But I'm learning to let go of that.

I mean, I read a lot of blogs myself because I think there's still that anthropological pull in us toward commonality, and also in some of us toward understanding what makes us different; I'm not saying you're some kind of cyber-perv if you're reading this (or at least that you're no more of a cyber-perv than I am, technically, so) but just that...really?

I reminded her that I react badly (VERY badly) to systemic (or even localized) steroids and she speculated that she could always do a twenty-three hour admit and put me on them in-house. We compromised on a month of inhaled steroids, which I worry will still trigger the godawful side effects, but breathing trumps just about everything else so there you have it. She's also having me do another course of Levaquin \"just in case\" since I'm not moving the junk in my chest around very efficiently, and ordinarly I'm not a fan of antibiotics \"just in case\" and will demand a CBC with demonstrably elevated white count or \"left shift\" before I'll even entertain the notion if I don't have a fever, but I've been rather worried about my inability to cough effectively due to the rib thing and decided to go with the medical professional's judgment on this one. Since I agreed to do the steroid inhaler and the antibiotic, she even took pity on me and wrote a script for some kind of super cough-syrup that's supposedly quite strong (I couldn't read her writing but it started with a T and I'm hopeful it's the stuff you make Purple Drank out of, because that would be cool), and also re-wrote the scripts for my four maintenance meds (since I've decided Express Scripts is simply not to be trusted and plan to fill everything locally and absorb the extra expense), and y'all, when I walked into the pharmacy and handed them my eight prescriptions I was SO FREAKING GRATEFUL because DAMN.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I have always felt fortunate to have health insurance but never so much as I did today, because one or two more days of this and I think my arse would've landed in the ER an unfetching shade of blue.

See, I felt like I was getting kicked in the ribs by a baby when I coughed, and since one rib can't move on its own I assumed this was coming from my lung-al area and something to do with either the asthma or the steroids kicking its arse or the years of smoking cloves as a teenager or something.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Then I discovered (through remembering my father's recovery from his bypass surgeries and friends on the Twitter offering suggestions for what one ought to do about agonizing chest pain with coughing) that holding a firm pillow, rice sock, or other giving, pressure-distributing object up against my ribs HARD before coughing easied the pain by about 80%, and the antibiotics and steroids started kicking in, and then speaking of kicking, WTF?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Now, I have been largely incapacitated for several days, meaning Hotter has done the lion's share of household-y things and I have spent a lot of time on the couch wrapped in sweatshirts and robes, bracing my ribs and sucking on inhalers. So a few minutes ago I was caught by a pending coughing fit in the kitchen (where I was getting ready to put an artichoke in to boil before watching something on Netflix with Hotter, and now he's sulkng because I'm on here but I HAD TO TELL Y'ALL ABOUT THIS) and didn't have anything on me (because the MFA Children are not at home and I had just taken a hot bath), both literally as in clothing and as in anything to brace my ribs in, and so I pressed my hand against my bare chest and--WHOA! On the third cough, I FELT IT. I braced and coughed three more times. Yep.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I grabbed Hotter and shoved his hand up under my right boob and coughed three times and--\"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"Remember how I said it felt like a baby kicking in my chest? MEET THE BABY. OH MY GOD, IT'S LIVER-BABY! Your LIVER is under your right chest! You felt her, right, I'm NOT crazy?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"Oh I felt it alright. That's nasty, honey. Seriously, you need to get that checked out.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 True story. Because it's Friday night, and why not? Now I get to spend all weekend asking Dr. Google what it means when it feels like a baby is kicking in your chest.

Very, VERY unwell. So the poor dog spent the night in her crate, and to her credit she held it and didn't soil her bedding in there, but as soon as we got her outside she...well, I'll spare you my description but trust me when I say that it involves the words \"projectile\" and \"at LEAST a foot!\" Also possibly \"like the chocolate fountain in a wedding in HELL.\"\u00a0\u00a0 I don't think I've seen anything like THAT since the time Middle Child spent two days in the hospital with Rotavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 We gave her half of a leftover can of that prescription dog food for GI problems mixed with a LOT of Gerber Rice cereal and water for breakfast, and we're keeping an eye out for dehydration (she's peeing copiously though, and honestly she could stand to lose some fluid volume since the Mitaban dips make her bloat up spectacularly), but we're worried. Hopefully this is from the (free to us but unnecessary per her stool sample results) deworming she got yesterday at the vet and not the increased dose of Ivermectin, but if she's still like this after lunch-time we may take her back in and have the vet take a look.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, the Donate button is still up; we're a little over the halfway mark on the fundraising effort and Isis isn't going anywhere right now, but we still need to raise quite a bit for her to be able to stay permanently (and after the day and night that I, as the least soft-hearted member of the household, had yesterday, it's readily apparent that we need to make that happen SOMEhow).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/26056630879", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/26057801416", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/26057817099", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134868a68ff970c-pi", "https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=7a-jbqZg8Q3W2eYfyPTLKkmy3PgIRoCqZR-36puOy_vwOdahrkvzg5M14te&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8dc18bca4c6f47e633b393e284a5f8a8f8"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/worried-about-the-dog-not-hotter-or-the-kids-but-still.html", "title": "worried (about the dog, not Hotter or the kids, but STILL)"},

We plan to just keep an eye on her here at home since Banfield is open on the weekends if she takes a turn for the worse.*\u00a0\u00a0 The mange treatment fund is coming along; we're almost three quarters of the way there and I'm starting to think we can actually pull this off--YAY! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!*\u00a0\u00a0 I am still worried though, and I still mow when I'm worried so I fired up Belleruth and did a very little bit of that, and now my ankle is killing me. Booo.*\u00a0\u00a0 The MFA Flock has continued, between the five of them, to produce one egg per day, which is better than no eggs at all. I made them some chicken treats out of flaxseed meal, flaxseed oil, cornmeal, peanut butter, and ground TUMS (for calcium) rolled into balls. They love that stuff! Hopefully bulking them up a little encourages them to step it up a little with the egg production.*\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child is lucky it's a Daddy weekend, because I was about ready to...well I don't KNOW what I would have done since We Do Not Beat Children Here, maybe boxed him up and Airmailed him to the Hague so they could try him with the other war criminals? He hurt one of his little brothers, which is not cool, and lied about it, which is REALLY not cool, then tried to talk over the littles when I was interrogating witnesses, and then the XY rolled up.*\u00a0\u00a0 The XY took in the situation (sobbing smaller child, Big Child with his telltale Lying Face on, me with the Crazy Eye and Hotter standing by with his arms crossed, which is what he generally does when I am reenacting that scene from Downfall, minus the subtitles, because of something the children have done) and got The Crazy Eye too, because apparently Big Child is feeling his oats at the XY's house lately as well. Messed up as it might sound to say this, it felt pretty good to be scolding Big Child in concert with the XY today as a cohesive coparenting unit out in my driveway; we presented a united front for maybe the first time EVER with the MFA Children. YAY!*\u00a0\u00a0 And now I have a weekend alone with my husband and dog ahead of me for the first time in a month and I feel pretty danged lucky over it, I'm not gonna lie. We may be broke but we've got plenty of projects to tackle around the house including a dining-room table to refinish (and by \"refinish\" I mean \"have sex on\"), and food the children wouldn't eat to cook, so we'll have a good time.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 I hope y'all all have a lovely weekend!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=NOmHJlwctV7x_SkHudbwSGc5lzbAWz-zpTNoVUOvGDUhacmyWaOlwig5itG&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8dc18bca4c6f47e633b393e284a5f8a8f8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqxRPZdfvs"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/updates-in-bullet-form.html", "title": "updates in bullet form"},
{"date": "February  5, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Well I am pleased to report that we all three got a good night's sleep here (me, Hotter, and Sabrina) (what? Oh, well, if I'd ever had a girl it was either that or Isabella and seeing as how all three MFA Children are boys and I am lacking 2/3 the reproductive organs necessary for NORMAL gestation, Liverbaby is my last chance at a girl and it was always going to be either Sabrina or Isabella, but I like Sabrina a hair more today).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Which is good because last night the little scamp had me nearly in tears despite copious hydrocodone syrup. She's more active at night, as a rule, or when I'm worked up or moving around/lifting overly much, and so while I can see that probably the wisest thing would be not to get worked up, move around, or lift overly much, the problem with that is that I'm stressed to the max, the pregnancy is most uncomfortable when I'm sitting or lying down so it feels good PHYSICALLY to be up and doing things as well as mentally because I haven't yet managed to balance my laptop on my burgeoning belly and walk around typing, and EVERYTHING I lift (from my laptop, with less than both hands, to Bumpus, who really doesn't weigh much at all, to a watering can full of water for the MFA Flock) is overly much depending on when I last took a fistful of meds and Sabrina's mood.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This is very frustrating, y'all. I mean, obviously it sucks that I need to be really ABLE right now and I'm really NOT, but this is also a) freaking my shit out because I HAVE BEEN DISABLED FOR LONG PERIODS BEFORE AND NONONONONONODONOTWANT! and b) not even the SORT of disability with which I am familiar enough to have a mental list of life-hacks to help survive it. I know how to deal with \"post-op/autoimmune everything hurts\" and \"can't stay awake more than ten minutes due to drugs/endocrine failure\" and \"catastrophic GI issues, all sorts\" but RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS? Fuck this, y'all. I am not cut OUT to deal with shortness of breath, not even a little bit, not the kind where you sometimes get winded from walking to take a piss, just NO. I'm pretty upset about things I dont' share here, and obviously about the job, and there are life's ongoing niggling worries (Little Child was in semi-GI shutdown when I handed him over and I won't know how THAT'S going until I either get him back Monday or hear from a doctor's office or emergency room that needs his accurate medical history and vital statistics, Middle Child's IEP just got emergently modified because it's turning out to be much harder for him to learn than expected this year and he may need meds, Hotter needs to go and see Dr. Kidney, etc....) and OF COURSE we all hate to be sick, but...I really do take this rather personally. Lungs? Feh.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Also I am beginning to suspect (this being day five of the antibiotics and steroids and such) that if I feel this bad now, I won't feel that much better when I've completed the course of treatment, and I'll have to go back, and I'm not looking forward to finding out what the next level of diagnostics for this sort of shit is and how much that'll cost. Phooey.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/02/updates-from-the-expectorant-mother.html", "title": "updates from the expectorant mother"},
{"date": "October  4, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 In-laws. Man oh man. As I explained to a laughing Hotter earlier today, while Grandma XY can out-nut and out-manipulate any one of his family members any day of the week and twice on Sunday AS AN INDIVIDUAL, the difference between the XY's family and his is that his is less vicious in general, which means they are capable of the sort of cooperation it takes to hunt AS A PACK, making them arguably MORE dangerous in the end.*\u00a0\u00a0 As I also explained to Hotter, I am too sane and tired for any amount of familial drama. He says it's one of the things he loves the most about me. So I gave my facespace friends-list an enema and it was awesome.*\u00a0\u00a0 In case you missed the cryptic tweet lizzee was referring to in the comments earlier, here it is. Due to the circumstances surrounding the situation I obliquely referred to in said cryptic tweet being not-my-story-to-tell, all I can really say is that there will be no sixth MFAmily member of the human variety afterall. Stand down, y'all! This is good news and bad news, in that we need another body in this house like we need scabies, but the reason we won't be getting one is rooted in a tragedy my husband is keenly affected by, so: boo, universe.*\u00a0\u00a0 I think my poor husband's beard turned about 50% more gray today. The reasons for that were entirely outside of my control, so I screwed his brains out before the children got home from school, then sent him outside to take out his remaining feelings on the deadwood in the line of cedars along our driveway with a pruning saw, handled dinner, and baked two kinds of pie for dessert. With whipped cream. *\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child would probably be very much in favor of daily tragedies if he had any idea at all what was going on behind the scenes in light of the TWO. KINDS. OF. PIE, but as the situation in question is not unfolding under our roof and does not involve people the MFA Children know very well at all, they are blissfully unaware and I think that is exactly as it should be.*\u00a0\u00a0 My weekend sucked quite a bit overall, I won't lie. Friday was excellent, but I spent most of Saturday in bitter, bitter tears, most of Sunday literally and figuratively hung over, and most of today in a protracted state of suspense and outrage that only ended shortly before dinnertime (the suspense bit, anyway--the outrage I think is mine to keep). FIE ON THAT. FIE I SAY!*\u00a0\u00a0 MFA Puppy is doing much better, did not throw up at all today, and seems to be starting to itch a little less. So I think it was the dose of wormer she received along with her Mitaban dip that made her so ill and not the increased dose of Ivermectin (which she is still on and will be for at least a couple of weeks), which is good. She needs that stuff to kill the mites! Tomorrow I'll see if she can handle a fully normal diet again (we kept her on half regular dogfood, half bland prescription GI diet today), and if she does okay then on Wednesday we'll see how she manages without Benadryl every eight hours for the itching. Friday is her appointment to get spayed if her liver enzymes aren't out of whack so I would imagine the fewer drugs in her system by then, the better. If you'd like to contribute to her treatment fund, go here.*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm in the process of separating the entries in the caption contest from the identifying information and will be sending them to our celebrity judge, Pal M.D. of Whitecoat Underground, tomorrow. I heart Pal; his blog is excellent and you should all go and read it, because I probably won't have anything interesting to say for a day or two while I'm taking care of some stuff here and trying to cheer Hotter up. At least I hope I don't. Because this weekend was interesting enough to last me until 2011.

Hotter and I took the clippers and the pruning saw out and felled a smallish pine, cleared two coppiced fencelines, tamed the wild azalea corner, and cut some large deadwood from that tree I got in a fight with.*\u00a0\u00a0 It also turns out that that tree is trying to kill me! Or else something-something-self-confidence-not-looking-down but anyway I climbed up the thing like some kind of monkey-ninja to get at a particularly large and unsightly broken dead limb and sawed the limb free no problem, then looked down in handing the saw down to Hotter and...well, my feet were way up over his head and I had to crouch down holding the end of the saw for him to be able to grab the handle and then I was all stiff and nervous-like climbing down and wedged the top of my leg between two trunks somehow.\r\nFigure One: This is my left outer thigh. It is normally blueish-white, because that's how I roll, but not blue-ish blue and purple--THAT is all the tree. Up in the upper left corner you can kind of see my belly. Not pictured: my maturity and sense of shame. That tree is out to get me and if it keeps this shit up I will figure out how to work the chainsaw out in my garden shed and WE WILL END THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.*\u00a0\u00a0 MFA Puppy had a pretty good day today. No more barfing, she's back on her usual food, and she made it through the morning and afternoon without needing any Benadryl (I think it helped that she was outside \"helping\" us and thoroughly distracted). She did need a dose of the stuff toward the evening when she started scratching herself half to death, but she's doing better than she was a few days ago (when sadly, even WITH Benadryl, she was pretty miserable).*\u00a0\u00a0 Tomorrow Hotter and I are going to go to an indoor Farmer's Market that sells fresh local foods (fruits and vegetables, eggs and meat, dairy and artisan breads, arts, crafts, etc.) with a 50% off coupon in-hand, and we're VERY excited! Between that and going mostly-cloth here at Casa MFA (I say mostly because yes, we cook and clean with bar towels, dry our hands with napkins I keep in baskets by the sinks, and use cloth napkins but I draw the line at cloth arse-wipes), growing veggies, and keeping chickens, we're turning into damn hippies over here or something. I'm looking forward to the Fall vegetables and local dairy the most--I think we'll spring for the bottle deposit and get some milk (as long as it's not \"raw\" because we are not down with extraneous bacteria here) and I definitely want to try some farm-fresh butter!*\u00a0\u00a0 The situation I'm not discussing is mostly over with, or at least it seems that way, and I am hoping that tomorrow things will be at least somewhat back to normal. Or else I may have to cut a bitch.

{"date": "February  5, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 There are two major components to why I am so GOD-damned miserable right now, and I have treated them both as Unbloggable because a) specific commentary in a public forum would obviously be stupid if I was to be involved in any kind of ongoing lawsuit, obviously, as in the case of the first one and b) believe it or not, I do keep some things to myself (two things, actually) and the second thing is one of them.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thing One is just Not Up For Discussion, and y'know 99% of the time I am FINE with that, because it's no fun to discuss and nobody is going to have any new ideas that I and the various professionals I have hired and my various friends with experience with such things have not already had. I don't lose anything by not being able to talk about Thing One except for maybe the \"ability to vent,\" which honestly (and yeah, you might laugh at this and I'm certainly not going to tell you not to) I think is overrated. The fact is, you see as much Evil* as you will look at, and you hear as much as you will listen to and give voice to on your own. This is a lot of why I don't have the teevee here; I know my own capacity to deal with Evil and it very rarely extends to matters outside of my own four walls here. I would literally rather have my teeth drilled without anesthetic (and that is not me being all metaphorical, it's something I have done before, several times, because my jaw is UnNumbable) for half an hour straight than watch a primetime news program, be it local, national, or global. Just...no. I do my best to keep up with curent events selectively through the innernet so as not to become ignorant, and I do know what is awful about things like the wording in the \"forcible rape\" bill and the unrest in Egypt, I just don't want to discuss them with the people I love or dwell on them. And Thing One is the closest thing in my life to pure Evil and therefore I am usually more than fine with not giving it any space on here.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thing Two falls under the category of \"self realizations; painful\" and involves People Who Aren't Me, and I try not to discuss the ongoing events in PWAMs' lives because generally unless someone has asked for an opinion, they don't care to hear yours. I would like VERY much to be able to discuss Thing Two with y'all, but I don't because I have learned painfully the lesson of Don't Write About PWAMs' Lives On The Innernet. Especially if you know that Other People are probably right and you are not doing what they would in your shoes, or that Other People are probably wrong and know it, and/but don't want to hear it from you. Both of those scenarios can fall prey to Mob Rule and end in Godwin's Law faster than you can say \"what I really meant was--\" and oh, y'all. I just don't need that. I'm not up for it.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm talking to you as though I'm going to Reveal All or something, and because I hate to let you down I'll go ahead and say right here that I'm not going to do that. What I am doing, here, is less filling y'all in on these two things and more trying to describe a problem I have encountered. See, Thing One is 99% Evil, and Thing Two is 99% Good, and normally they balance each other out. Sometimes, VERY RARELY, Thing One is that 1% Good and it screws with my head, oh lawd does it ever, to the point that I'd pretty much rather Thing One stay bad. Thing Two is ALMOST NEVER that 1% bad, and THAT screws with my head as much as when Thing One is good, plus it pisses me off because of the two Unbloggable Things, Thing Two is the one whose involvement in my life I VOLUNTARY submit to. There has been ONE occasion in the years that I've been dealing with Thing One and Thing Two that they've both been in 1% mode, and that had me cross-eyed and dicombobulated for the better part of a week.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 What's going on right now, though, is that Thing One is bad, and so is Thing Two, and in times like this I look at the two situations and I know that I cannot possibly deal with them both and the only solution (as Thing One is unescapable in life and 99% bad and Thing Two is something in my life that I involve myself in voluntarily) that I can see is to say \"I can't take 100% Evil in my life and can't control 99% of it, so the 1% coming from Thing Two has to go.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, if I'd been able to deal with moving through life with only the 1% of Good from Thing One, I would never have sought out Thing Two, and nobody held a gun to my head and MADE me do that, and in fact 98% of the time I am the first one to pat myself on the back for working things out rather nicely overall.

GOOD!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In the eight hours since then the following things have occurred:\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Something Truly Uplifting that I thought was lost forever was rediscovered thanks to a friend's sleuthing, and I got to marvel at it.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I opened my mail for the first time since last Saturday because I've been THAT OUT OF IT and discovered Life-changingly good news. Like, drop the mail, scream and jump around, dance with your husband even if you're officially miffed with him and about seven months pregnant in your liver kind of good.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 My main freelance client PAID ME EARLY! Well actually they paid me right on time, but since I'd spent the past two years dusting off my resume with a secondary client who paid later, I hadn't planned on having the money yet. I mean, it's not FREE MONEY or anything. Just money I already expected, in time to keep from having to bounce any checks, forego any medical care or prescription drugs, or default on anything, which I hadn't anticipated or dared to hope for. I'll even be able to Fix What Ails The MFA Minivan (it's always something) and contribute a little to savings.

But the end result of all of the above is that Thing One, while Evil, is in Good mode for the forseeable future, and Thing Two, while still pissing me off in general, therefore has some time to get its shit together and remember that it's Very, Very Good 99% of the time. I can deal with 1% Evil. I can do that with both hands tied behind my back and a baby kicking me in the lung. Just watch me.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n** Why yes I am drunk now. A little.

{"date": "February  7, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 As of Saturday I am once again in midst of a rather urgent legal imbruglio, and as a result I will most likely have to go to court sometime this week. It's never wise to discuss legal things online, so I won't be any more specific than to say that *I* am not in trouble, it's civil, not criminal, and it does NOT involve the MFA Children (for once, thank Godiva). This is therefore a rather stressful and expensive pain in the arse, but falls pretty low on my own personal Richter scale. I'm more worried about what I'm going to WEAR than anything else.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Liverbaby was a real pest last night and I didn't sleep very well, so I'm going back to the doctor tomorrow to see what she wants to do about this. Here is where I have to give a shout out to my good friend Marie-Baguette, who in addition to being an innernet pal from waaaay back kindly thought of me when she was downsizing (heh) her bra collection, post-lactation. See, the place where you can feel Liverbaby kicking requires you to stick your hand under my right tit if I don't have a bra on, and I DID NOT HAVE ANY BRAS THAT WOULD FIT. Like, not even close. I wasn't looking forward to being all \"so yeah, just lift that up and it's RIGHT THERE\" but the package arrived today and therefore spared me some embarrassment. Thanks, MB!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 We took both dogs to the vet this morning, because Isis has been scratching her ears to death and Bumpus needed to get enrolled in the Wellness Plan and start his shots (I know, I know--I was putting it off because we were so damn broke, but it turns out that might've been a good thing because they have to be a certain age to receive some vaccines and he's quite a bit younger than we thought). Isis has a bacterial AND fungal infection in both ears, because of COURSE she does, so we've got some earwash and drops to use for that (to the tune of a hundred bucks, dammit). Bumpus was pronounced healthy and still nutless by the vet, and also UNDER sixteen weeks of age (he has a few adult incisors but no adult canines or molars yet, so the vet said DEFINITELY under sixteen weeks). Which means the poor dog was only about a month old when we found him, and explains why he was so tiny and determined to nurse off of Isis. \"He's going to be BIG!\" the vet said, admiringly (currently he is twenty-six pounds). As far as WHAT he is, the vet agrees with Devivo that he's most likely a Redbone Coonhound with maybe a little of some other kind of hound in there.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 We went to the feed store for chicken feed but they were out of the organic stuff AGAIN. I've just been baking for the hens for the past few weeks because they were out LAST time...grr. The GOOD news, though, is that our feed store now carries fancy chickens and orders peeps in the Spring, so we placed an order and YAAAAY BABY CHICKS! We'll save a lot of money by not having to pay for overnight shipping from MyPetChicken.com. The new additions to the MFA Flock should arrive March 1st, and will be a mix of Buff Orpingtons, Welsummers, Australorps, and Russian Orloffs. It's gonna be like the Chicken UN up in here with the Barred Rocks and the ISA Brown representing America, the Araucanas from Chile, the Buff Orpingtons from the UK, the Welsummers (Dutch) and the Orloffs! I hope they can all get along. Also, I'm renaming my crockpot \"The Peacemaker.\"\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 We're also thinking of getting a heritage turkey to raise for Thanksgiving, which should be good for a laugh (baby turkeys and particularly adolescent turkeys are HILARIOUS-LOOKING). And yes, yes I would ABSOLUTELY eat a turkey I raised. Better that than a COMMERCIAL turkey I DIDN'T raise, and without a CSA membership our grassfed organic turkey from this past Thanksgiving would have cost well over seventy-five dollars. Baby turkeys are like, three bucks, and since we already have poultry underfoot we might as well save some money there. We'll most likely try to get a female, because fullgrown male turkeys scare the piss out of me and Hotter both (before you laugh, have you ever MET one? They're very aggressive, and THEY RATTLE THEIR BONES AT YOU).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of YOU?

I considered hocking my engagement ring (which made Hotter kind of...upset) and then did the longterm math and decided I was at peace with going four more months and hoping PCIP was decent. Then Kathy at Anthem went above and beyond, and tempted me with her dogged pleasantness and offers of continued coverage, and she and I exchanged several (dozen) e-mails, culminating in (I will not publish any of her words but rather my own, to her, unedited):\r\nDear Kathy,\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, thank you SO much, that does make sense! I am  fine with the $XXXrate with a 2/1 effective date and will pay the  balance due ($XX?) at that time. Is that doable without the waiting  period as you and I had previously discussed?

DO A CHEST X-RAY AND TAKE SOME BLOOD AND CALL A SPECIALISSSSSSST!!!\"\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Joking aside, as Hotter asked me to clarify, there still isn't anything anyone can really do for me, health insurance or no. The generalized nerve pain and sacroiliitis have subsided to entirely tolerable levels at this point, meaning that Lyrica wouldn't help me enough to be worth the side effects, and while the rib thing continues to be agonizing, the only thing to really do even if it IS cracked or dislocated is whimper and perhaps take narcotics. Narcotics sound delicious right about now, in that they could probably bring the pain level down to a nagging three or four on the much-vaunted one to ten scale, but I'm not so certain that'd be an entirely good thing--probably if I felt that much better I'd overdo it and aggravate everything. Plus when you have a history of refractory pain issues and long-term narcotic use due to same, any time you throw your system another hit you're jacking your tolerance back up in a way that'll bite you in the ass if you're in an accident or have to have general anesthesia, so kind of like the Lyrica, narcotics remain an option I reserve for use in cases where I am hurting so badly I don't even GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANY OF THAT, GIVE ME THE DRUUUUUUUGSSSSSSSSSSS. We're not there yet right now. Right now we're just at the point where it's a really nice fantasy, the idea of walking into a doctor's office, having them locate something fixably wrong, and dispense with the relief and healing, and fond as I am of that happy daydream I know that the reality of any medical interaction I'd have right now would disappoint (and cost a lot of money).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 My primary freelance client of the past nearly-a-decade effed up BIGTIME and sent my offer letter for this quarter's (much more than usual) contract work to a many-years-old address of mine LAST MONTH, where it was apparently noticed TODAY and opened by...my ex-husband. EFF. WORD. He now knows exactly how much money I make, which he could have found out by filing an official request with the courts at any time, but that would cost him a couple thousand dollars and require someone thinking he needed to know, and now he knows FOR FREE and I still don't have the same intel on him. I think if I wasn't in such exquisite, agonizing pain currently I would be a lot more irate about this than I am, but still, ANNOYING. Hotter pointed out that as I have a voicemail in which the XY essentially reads my mail to me out loud, I could probably have him charged with a federal offense. Which: hee!

At this point the best possible outcome would still involve some legal expenses and protracted unpleasantness, and the worst would involve a LOT of legal expenses, protracted unpleasantness, AND major changes that nobody really wants (Hotter and me, the MFA Children, OR the other party). The other party has always been a go-down-with-his-ship kind of guy, so I'm not terribly hopeful that we'll end up with the lesser evil but will still be sad if/when things go (further) south from here.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Five eggs today! This is noteworthy because production has been down overall since Deathtrek '10 (the hens are spoiled and don't appreciate treatless days). Yesterday we only got TWO eggs.

Yes, you all told me so. Dammit. But on the bright side, we can't afford to buy any gifts this year so HEY OMG PUPPY!

And despite the unbloggable vagueness I'm REALLY looking forward to cooking with my husband tomorrow and having a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner with the boys.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Oh and hey, despite the mental breakdown involving the can of fried onions I appear to be losing weight (we still don't own a scale but things are fitting a little better and yesterday Hotter grabbed my ass and asked if I'd lost weight because it felt smaller to him) (and why yes, he DID get lucky shortly thereafter).

Maybe it's because I've had three children and lots of medical procedures and I see my body as public domain where gloves are concerned, maybe it's a sign of mental health (or mental illness?)...I dunno y'all, but if a gloved professional has to touch my goodies in the capacity of doing their job I don't see the point in getting het up about it. I've been getting SPESHUL PATDOWNS for ages because a) I have big boobs, that require a big underwire, which sets off alarms and b) I usually fly Priceline at the last minute, which apparently marks you as suspicious and earns you closer scrutiny. I've never had the agents be anything but politely disinterested as they do their thing. And as to having children get patted down, I think if I were to fly anywhere with my children (which is highly unlikely because I'm poor and also NOT INSANE) I would just say \"this is only okay because they're doing their job to keep us safe and I'm right here\" the same way my pediatrician always tells them \"this is only okay because I'm a doctor and Mom is right there\" when she checks their junk out. If it's not okay with someone for a TSA agent to touch them or their child, there's always the bus, and I know that might sound harsh, but...well, honestly it seems rather narcissistic to me for anyone to be all \"I'M not a terrorist and therefore if they touch ME it's ASSAULT.\" I've been assaulted. That's not assault. The TSA has definitely failed some travelers with special needs by not showing sensitivity to their situations, and some specialized trainings may be in order there, but overall? I think people need to get over themselves. YOUR GOODIES ARE NOT THAT SPECIAL.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 What might actually be assault is the way Bumpus keeps trying to suckle off of Isis. It's hilarious. Maybe he's a little younger than we think? At any rate, Isis desperately wants to either hump or play with the puppy and is mystified as to why he keeps darting underneath her to put hickies on her belly. She's been surprisingly good with the little runt overall, and he has no problem letting her know when he's had enough (you have not laughed until you've seen a puppy that looks like an overgrown weiner dog snarling and baring his milkteeth at a pitbull and the pitbull cocking her head like \"seriously?\" and whimpering in confusion).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bumpus-Hounds/41074973774?v=wall"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/11/of-teats-and-tsa-screenings.html", "title": "of teats and TSA screenings"},

{"date": "November 25, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 In nearly a year of sharing my life with y'all from back here at my old Typepad URL, I've blogged the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there's been way too much bad and not a little ugly, but before I vanish in a slick of butter I wanted to take a hot minute and be thankful. Because for all that this past year has had its moments of great suckitude, I've still had more to be thankful for than any other year in my life.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Many of y'all are aware that I've blogged in a couple of other places over the years (I can't believe I've been doing this since 2005), but MFA Mama was my first blog, and the only one whose name reflected the good in my life, the things I'm most proud of (my studies in my career field and being the mother of three great kids), and it's good to be back.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In this wretched, conservative state getting divorced takes FOR-E-VER (even if the other party doesn't fight it, which in my case...yeah), and my divorce was uglier than...well, pretty much anything outside of Hollywood...and was the culmination of a decade of 99% sheer misery in the marriage department. So as odd as it sounds, I'm damned thankful to have finalized my divorce not quite a year ago.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of the divorce process, there's one real gift it gave me: an extra shot of empathy that I lacked before hitting my own personal rock bottom. Last December I had the chance to help a friend out as another friend once helped me, and as much as it pains me to admit it in a public forum, I'm not sure it's something I would have done before, so while the divorce process was less fun than losing a hunk of my crotch the size of a NY-strip steak to MRSA, at least it left me a better person (unlike the MRSA thing, which just left me a BITTER person).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I'm grateful for this every damn day, but it definitely needs to go in the list: this past year I married my best friend (yep, pretty much the moment the ink was dry on the final decree of divorce, and no, we were not romantically involved during my first marriage; he was my PLATONIC best friend for a couple of years before the XY and I separated and in the year and a half-ish between that and the finalization that obviously changed). I'm so lucky (love you Hotter!).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I've heard enough blended-family horror stories to be VERY thankful for the fact that my kids have loved Hotter from day one :)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I've been INVOLVED in enough in-law horror stories to be thankful for my mother-in-law being a good egg.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This year I got back into gardening, and I'm so very thankful that the home we rent came with a couple of acres of good soil and that my health permits me to take full advantage of that!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of my health, it's the best it's been since my oldest child was born, and having almost bought the farm on at least one a couple of numerous occasions since then I'm deeply thankful to be able to say that. Hotter's health was...problematic...this year, and he gave me a real scare this summer but came through it and I think we can finally say he's fully recovered, so obviously I'm thankful for that, too.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I think it was Gudrun who said that in her opinion a dislike of pets reflected a major heart/brain disconnect, and until July that was pretty much me. I didn't like dogs one little bit (mostly because my birthmother and ex-husband prioritized dogs above me, I think, and owned spoiled, obnoxious dogs). That all changed when we added MFA Puppy to the family. Now I'm one of THOSE dog people, whose dog sleeps in the bed, sits on the couch, and comes along on family road trips (and now there's Bumpus, too). I'm not so sure I OUGHT to be thankful for the worthless curs, but I am. Especially since Isis was so sick so many times (too many to pick a single post to link to) and y'all saved her life. Thanks for that!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This year I got to go to BlogHer for the first time, and I'm thankful as hell for the experience (and the fact that nothing godawful happened to me in New York City, because it and I have a long-standing and thoroughly mutual hatred for each other).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Possibly best of all, Little Child seems to be making that turnaround his doctors told me to hope for around age five (they predicted that five would be a watershed year where he'd either grow out of most of what ailed him or receive a truly grim diagnosis). This kid has been turning me gray since he was born, and there have been way too many times I've thought I'd lose him. Now for the first time ever he's ON THE GROWTH CHARTS and NOT ANEMIC and has NO DIETARY RESTRICTIONS and OMG YAY GO LITTLE CHILD!!! I'm so thankful for that that I've been scared to admit just how well he's been doing; I've been MIA over at Hopeful Parents, even. But y'know what, I really don't believe in \"jinxing\" and if I'm listing things I'm thankful for I can't not mention this. Today he got popped in the nose, and while it bled impressively and I had to drain a bunch of blood out of his g-tube and give him a dose of Amicar, it was so nice not to have to go to the ER or call the hematologist...thankful doesn't begin to describe it.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, I'm thankful for all of you. I considered linking all \"you and you and you\"-style, but was afraid I'd leave someone out, so y'know what? If you're reading this?

{"date": "November 28, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I'm all bunched up, y'all.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Part of the reason the XY and I are at odds is that he's been taking the boys to spend the night at his girlfriend's house on his weekends (excepting this last weekend, during which they evidently went home late at night and came back early in the morning for breakfast...sigh) and they LUFF her.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, it's better that they love her than hate her. No, I would not prefer that she lock them in the basement and feed them bread and water. But does it sting that my kids got a stepfather they'd met TWICE due to the XY's writing it into our final decree that there be \"no unrelated male overnight guests, or unrelated female overnight guests if they are of romantic interest to WIFE\" and he's now easing them into his new love interest by having her bake with them and squirt whipped cream in their mouths on his weekends? You bet your arse it does! Does it aggravate me that they come home with baked goods from CATHERINE*, singing their praises? Yes, especially since personally I think her pie is nothing to write home about.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 They said she makes better pumpkin pie than I do, y'all.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 But my catty thoughts on that and pride in my baking prowess aside, there's more. This weekend? He brought them home early (he claims to be getting sick, probably he's just Getting Some, but whatever, I want them home Sunday nights anyway because they'll go to school on time, having had a good breakfast, and wearing clothes they haven't been wearing all weekend) with girlfriend apple pie AND homewrecker brownies.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 From Jan**. Jan the woman he moved in with while I still loved him and our infant was in the hospital fighting for his life and we were still (allegedly) a family five years ago this very week. This is not okay. Not just because they're obviously box-brownies, but because if he's taking brownies from Jan, then he can't be that serious about CATHERINE***, and in that case why are my children getting attached to her? I was already worried since a couple of weeks ago they were apparently fighting and the kids saw her crying...they do not need to watch him destroy another woman.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So I'm sitting here with a girlfriend apple pie in the fridge and a plate of homewrecker brownies on my dining room table, worrying. \"Think of it this way, Jan did you a favor! She stole a shitty man and baked you brownies. YOU WIN,\" Tara counseled me via facespace chat. \"I'm overthinking the brownies, aren't I?\" \"You're overthinking the brownies.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Poor Jan, she's probably trying to win him back with her box brownies and has no idea they'd end up on his ex-wife's table, the target of innernet mockery.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Poor CATHERINE, I wish I could meet her, follow her into the ladies' room, and tell her that if he hits her I'll testify. I wonder if she knows about the brownies?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Poor boys. I wish I could see this somehow not ending up as a(nother) mindfuck for them.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 And while I'm at it, poor me. I know I need to get down off my cross, use the wood to build a bridge, and get over this, but the pumpkin pie thing? Really stung (also I woke up with a brand-spanking new pinched nerve in my neck, and there's a virus moving through Casa MFA, and I swear those stupid effing processed box-mix brownies are taunting me and reportedly CATHERINE is skinnier than I am, too).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 How are YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0 Lord no, that's not her real name.\r\n**\u00a0 Not her real name either.\r\n***\u00a0 I have no idea why it's CATHERINE, in all caps, but it is. Tara urged me to do all-lowercase, like e.e. cummings, but she's CATHERINE, all-caps. My children say her name that way and CATHERINE she is.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["www.bitethebedbugs.com", "http://www.bitethebedbugs.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/11/homewrecker-brownies-and-girlfriend-apple-pie-how-is-this-my-life.html", "title": "homewrecker brownies and girlfriend apple pie: how is this my life?"},

Boo.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Lord, but men are cranky when they're sick.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 At dinner, Big Child said I was a better cook than CATHERINE. This is why he is my favorite today. Little Child, however, followed that up with \"but CATHERINE makes better pumpkin pie, and next weekend she's baking us CAKE!\" Sigh.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I think part of the reason I'm bitter is that the XY makes damned good money (much better money, in fact, than he declared last time we were in court, and probably I can't afford to force him to be honest on that but oh, if I could...), and CATHERINE must do okay since she has this BIG, HUGE HOUSE where everyone has THEIR OWN ROOM when the boys are there, and together the XY and CATHERINE will probably end up taking my children to Disney and going on fancy vacations and doing all sorts of things I've never gotten to do with the boys (or without them, for that matter) and likely never will. Things I'd love to share with my children. Like oh, all having healthcare at the same time, but there I go with the bitterness again so I'll stop.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Seriously, what kind of asshole doesn't provide for their children's most basic needs and then goes and spoils them rotten with shameless consumerism to make the other parent, who is going without insurance to feed them, look like even less fu---well that's not stopping. Sorry.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 But seriously, does EVERYthing have to break at once? The MFA  Minivan has a headlight out, the toilet seat came apart, all but one of  the bulbs across the top of the bathroom vanity have blown...none of  which I can do a damned thing about until Wednesday at the very  earliest.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I was going to enter some blog giveaway for a Toys R Us gift card, but you had to leave a comment saying what you were getting your kids for the holidays and I'm uh, not really...well I mean Big Child got a PUPPY (he found the Bumpus so that's his gift, as Middle Child already has Isis and Little Child doesn't want a dog, which made him my favorite for quite a while) and Little Child wants a fish, so probably I can make that happen but I'm stuck with Middly...I considered just lying but ultimately didn't even enter the effing contest because lying about what I'm getting my kids when I can't actually afford to get them ANY toys this year due to their father failing to comply with various court orders...well that's just a little too depressing, and not worth the 0.0001% chance of winning a gift card to a cost-inflated retail giant of plastic crap and excess packaging, anyway.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 In short, apparently I have nothing nice to say today. Bah motherfucking humbug. How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/11/i-haz-the-sads.html", "title": "I haz the sads"},
{"date": "November 30, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I lost my temper on here earlier. And I'm not proud of that at all. Not because I feel it was unwarranted, exactly, so much as because while I'm guilty of MANY uncharitable thoughts, I don't generally verbalize (or write) those types of things. It's one of my least-favorite things to hear (or read) others do, and I'm a big believer in the whole \"criticize someone and it says more about you than it does about them\" school of thought.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So what did the events of earlier today say about me? I guess most obviously that I'm jealous of people who appear to be a lot more financially secure than I am (and downright pissy when they still complain about being broke). See also: people with large, loving families (Hotter and the boys are great, but they're all the family I've really got; my dad is still alive as of the last time I checked, but doesn't remember who I am most of the time, so, yeah...I am jealous as hell of people with one or more living parents who are in their lives, people with siblings, people who would automatically have a place to sleep if their house burned down, because yeah, I don't have that). It's also pretty clear I'm jealous of people who get an arse-load more child support than I do (especially if they get it for fewer children and/or children with less expensive physical and mental healthcare needs). Also, I'm jealous as HELL of people who get any kind of help with their expenses, because while my family has in the past, currently we do not qualify thanks to my having gotten a job (although I still make well below the federal poverty line for a family my size...why the heck do they HAVE that thing, anyway?).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It probably also says I'm a shitty feminist for judging another woman's life-choices.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It reflects poorly on the completeness of my understanding of how human nature works, because generally if someone's a dick to you and you're a dick back and are all \"how'd THAT feel?\" Well, they're not that likely to have second thoughts about having been a dick to you to begin with. If one of my kids was in a situation like that I'd probably tell them to tell the other person how their words or actions made them feel and ask them not to do it, and if the person in question continued to be a jerk then they weren't a good friend for them.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, it says I'm probably feeling defensive about having let my kids keep the damned puppy given that we just finished having a huge freaking crisis over here with Isis's health, which I am, and probably that's because it wasn't a very smart thing to do. I effed up there, y'all, not that it makes it particularly nice for anyone to shove it down my throat after I've indicated that they ought to stop it, but maybe I should just accept that as a natural consequence?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 We already all knew I hate the mothereffing holidays like poison.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hell, I dunno. But I feel pretty lousy over the entire thing, because none of my personal failings or character flaws are y'all's problem and I brought the nasty here, to a place that I generally try to keep positive for all our sake, and for that I'm really sorry.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/11/the-one-where-i-owe-all-of-yall-an-apology.html", "title": "the one where I owe all of y'all an apology"},

{"date": "December 11, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Here at Casa MFA, everyone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Having chickens but not one of those heated watering thingies (yet) means that you can't truly sleep in, even on a childfree weekend, because you will have brought the poultry waterer indoors (after knocking the ice out) before bed and the chickens are up with...well...themselves...and thirsty. And overly thirsty hens will not lay as well, so you will sleep until your eyes pop open, detect sunrise, and the guilt kicks in that will not abate until you've filled the poultry waterer and run it outside.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A dash over frosted turf in a parka, an over-washed fuzzy pink robe, and a pair of clogs does little for one's serenity, in case you were wondering, especially first thing in the morning before you've had any Synthroid or caffeine. Bonus points if you're asthmatic and going from room temperature to below freezing makes you chug along the way like The Little Engine That Could.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 While I was wheezing my way to the chicken run bearing a dripping poultry waterer and a couple of \"hen waffles,\" Hotter was seeing to the dogs. They sleep in Isis's crate lately (no, you should NOT crate two dogs together, but they both whine incessantly unless you do here because they like to spoon) and apparently our taking a night off from the 4:00 a.m. alarm during which we attend to the needs of the puppy's bladder had Had Consequences. The bedding in the crate was soaked and at least one dog needed a bath.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Out by the chicken run, I noticed a strange sound that, upon investigation, turned out to be coming from our heat pump, which also appeared to have continency issues gauging by the amount of leakage. OKAY! AWESOME! EXCEPT NOT REALLY!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I were regrouping on the front porch (if by regrouping you mean taking turns interrupting each other's soliloquies on the suckage of our life, because clearly this was a tragedy of the highest order) when the mail truck pulled up and left a large package for us.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, friend M., for cheering us up so thoroughly. The pants and shirt are the perfect size for Little Child, and he's gone through a sudden growth spurt after wearing the same winter wardrobe for the past three winters that has left us scrambling for things that fit him (not many, as he's just grown into the size Middle Child was during the greatest poverty of the divorce--the hand-me-downs from Big Child took a beating during heavy rotation for Middly) and that he hadn't worn yesterday of a morning. So we are more pleased with that little outfit than you could possibly know! Little Child will probably enjoy it too I guess.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The jacket is just the size for Big Child to grow into, which he probably will by Spring, and he is of course The Boy Who Loses Jackets, so a spare jacket is a wonderful thing (on one memorable occasion he went to school wearing MY hoodie, which wasn't pink or anything but was cut a bit girly, AND THEN HE LOST THAT).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The boys will ALL love the checkers, because OMG CHECKERS and the pieces are big enough that hands with delayed fine-motor sklls ought to be able to manage them without incident (I've shied away from teaching the boys checkers due to visions of intersibling violence at men being knocked asunder by mistake dancing through my head). The oversized pieces are PERFECT! The other games are sure to be a hit, because, ELECTRONIC JOY, but I'm particularly excited about the checkers as I can play that with them (I fail at the electronic games).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 And finally, with boys you cannot go wrong with anthropomorphic trucks that have fangs. A were-truck? WHOO, TRUCK! \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Friend M., your hand-me-downs are made of WIN and the boys are going to love them! I'm going to wrap them up before they come home from their father's house and hide them away in my closet, so it ended up being perfect timing, too (in more ways than one). You rock!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 And now I'm going back to bed.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/12/in-which-a-package-from-a-friend-cheers-me-up-considerably.html", "title": "in which a package from a friend cheers me up considerably"},

GEEZ...years paid me a week earlier than they usually do for this quarter. WHOO!!! I mean, it was already all earmarked for various bills, but one of the items in the budget was a bag of chicken feed and I was VERY happy about that because I'd been throwing together \"hen waffles\" out of the pantry for a few days and I prefer to scoop and dump and not worry about the nutrient balance (not enough sodium = no eggs, not enough calcium = no eggs, not enough protein...you get the picture), y'know?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So Hotter and I rolled out of bed after taking a nap on Saturday, hoping that this would \"reset\" the day, and headed to the feed store in the small town where I lived for a number of years pretty recently. It's owned by a prominent local Mennonite family and operated by a delightful older gal and her assisstant, who we'll call Winter (not her actual name). Winter is the one who helped us capture George and the Araucanas when we went hen-shopping and is good people. When she showed us the Araucanas we could choose from she pointed out two with scissorbeaks as \"Lefty and Righty,\" and said she was taking them home in case we were also suckers for gimpy ones.

He was surely either her brother or her husband, and after she rang up our purchase she handed us our receipt and said \"Mouth over there'll git your feed.\" That's also what you do at the feed-store--you give your receipt to the teenage nephew or \"retired\" grampa farmer hanging out on the porch and they pull it from the storage area and load it into your vehicle if you're a girl or look like a city slicker.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"ORGANIC???\" Mouth sputtered, upon reading the receipt. \"Yep.\" He looked at me slackjawed for a moment. \"Organic Layer Pellets?\" I nodded. \"WHO--\" he began, and Winter cut him off. \"Boss orders it special for 'er.\" Mouth swept his hat off his head, scrubbed at the back of his neck with it, and slapped it back on more securely before heading off to the storage area.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 At the rear of the MFA Minivan, my tow-hitch and the fact that the rear cargo area was strewn with straw seemed to set Mouth at ease again. \"I know what you use THIS van for,\" he noted, smiling. He plopped our feed down and was halfway through wishing us a pleasant weekend when he shut the lift gate and noticed my FCKH8 sticker. \"Eff...Cee...Kay...what does that say,\" he asked, squinting at it.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"Fuck hate,\" I said, since that was about the only thing to do, talk my walk right there in the feed store parking dirt-strip. Mouth goggled at me, as if surely I hadn't just...\"what did you say?\" I cleared my throat and spoke up. \"Fuck hate; it's showing my support for marriage equality.\" Mouth crossed his beefy arms and leaned back on his heels, chewing on that a minute. \"You mean like, a boy and a boy, or a girl and...?\" I nodded. \"Yep. Now run tell Winter about the dirty hippies and have a good weekend!\" And I got into the driver's seat next to Hotter, who was clutching his face in the passenger seat, and we both made it to the dirt road\u00a0 before busting out laughing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Educate and fight the hate, y'all!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/10/fresh-meat-in-the-mfa-flock.html", "http://fckh8.com/", "http://fckh8.3dcartstores.com/Bumper-Sticker_p_35.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/12/feed-store.html", "title": "bad fun at the feed store"},

And knowing that she'd made that important step toward having a life of her own really would warm the cockles of my black little heart, but I think putting all of one's holiday hopes and wishes in the hands of one's stalker would be just a little too sad, even for me, so I'll still save a spot on my mantel for a printout that I've doodled hearts on.

Why don't I have that movie on DVD, dammit?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm ill enough that Hotter tended to the MFA Flock today, which meant that the poultry princesses waited until 11 a.m. for their water to be de-iced and also suffered an empty feeder. They produced five eggs (including a blue one, so this may end up being our first six-egg day, even) during their mistreatment, and now I'm thinking of skipping a day once in a while just to shake things up if this is the effect it REALLY has on the dumb sluts.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 You know how certain Tibetan monks can sing more than one note at a time (also some Mongalian nomads and the Xhosa people of South Africa, it seems)?

I call this little trick his \"polyphonic squee,\" and no one else here thinks that's as funny as I do.

I haven't put any of the MFA Children into debt to finance a new set of tits or slept with any random guys yet, so probably I shouldn't really worry about a), but when your biological mother is the most human evil you've ever beheld in one body, pretty much any little similarity is grounds for contemplating seppuku on the front lawn.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I am still Very Unhappy about things I can't talk to y'all about.

{"date": "January 18, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Once you have whisked your dry ingredients together, you're ready to add the wet stuff (if you didn't read part one and are like \"the hell?\" then welcome to my long-overdue bread post, which I decided to break into a series so it wouldn't seem so overwhelming, because I make the best, most nutritious and thoroughly OVERTHOUGHT bread evah) (and if you're reading this going \"jesus, it's just bread\" then I invite you to go and read this lady's archives and see if you ever feel the same about food again afterward) (also, I'm sorry if you just went and had your mind blown, well, not really, but...anyway).\r\n Figure One: Oh look, it's that giant bread graphic again. Not only does this let the idiots among us know that I will now continue to talk about bread, but it also took me a LONG BLOODY TIME to do with MS Paint so here it is! Ohhh. Ahhh.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This is where you add 2 and 1/2 cups of the same temperature water you'd use to bathe an infant (or your poodle, or your own self, I don't use a thermometer but make it comfortably warm, okay?), and since water is fairly boring (well actually it's not but I'm trying very hard not to turn this into a manifesto so just use the same water you and your family drink) there's no picture of that but heeeey look! An egg! And some oil!\r\n Figure Two: This is the kind of egg and oil I prefer to use, but remember the first rule of home-baking? I'll now proceed to talk about some different options, but not in italics, because they annoy me.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 For the egg, just use whatever kind of egg you feed your family. I have issues with \"factory-farmed\" commercial eggs (in that the chickens that produce them have miserable lives, and eat diets containing things I don't want to indirectly ingest through their eggs, plus those eggs in the store are often several weeks old), so we have the MFA Flock. Our chickens eat organic layer diet plus lots of table scraps and extra omega-rich treats like flaxseed and walnuts, as well as fresh vegetable scrap from cooking and canning like pumpkin guts, carrot peels, wilted spinach, etc. They also spend part of most days \"free-range\" in the backyard foraging for bugs and weeds, which gives their yolks and even the whites (to a lesser extent) a distinctive orange hue:\r\n Figure Three: I'll shut up about chickens and eggs now, but would you LOOK at that YOLK?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 For the oil, I use organic flaxseed oil when I can afford to, because it's SUPER  good-for-you, and nobody really notices the difference (I can taste it  if I think about it really hard) between that and something tastier/more  texturally suited for baking like butter or coconut oil (organic,  ideally, but it's a personal choice and I totally get that it's likely  to be dictated by finances--nutrition is TOTALLY a class issue, sadly,  and you will not save any money baking bread the way I do it). I do NOT  use hydrogenated vegetable shortenings at all, ever, because they have that  fucked-up plastic fat that I don't care for from an ideological  standpoint alone, without even getting into the possible health  repercussions. The egg in both pictures is from an Araucana, and there is  no logical reason why since they taste the same as the brown eggs do, but I always bake with the fancy-colored eggs. It just seems festive, and I'm easily-amused is why :)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 After you stir the wet and dry ingredients well enough that your mixer won't kick up a dustbstorm in your kitchen, beat this at high speed for approximately three minutes. I suppose a stand-mixer would be best, but alas, I do not have one. If you do, then use it at this point, and know I hate you just a little bit in my heart of hearts. If you're thinking \"screw that, I'm going to knead the dough anyway and that'll mix it just FINE so why dirty the mixer?\" then COME HERE AND KISS ME because you are my PEOPLE, and also here is why you should use the mixer: a lot of what makes bread have the texture you want it to have has to do with the gluten (this is why we added extra gluten to the dry ingredients as well), but no matter how much gluten you add, there's a mechanical aspect to helping it reach its full potential. The main purpose of kneading bread dough is to break up and release the wheat's gluten, which requires smooshing of the dough. Beating is kind of like cheating at this, because it agitates the HELL out of the particles in your sponge (yeah, it's not quite dough yet) and brings the gluten out to play so that the yeast can make big, stretchy bubbles in the dough as it rises. I don't even set a timer when I beat the sponge anymore because I can see by the ripples in the top when it's done. I couldn't capture those very well on film, but here's what you should have at this point, and where we'll leave off for the day:\r\n Figure Four: No, YOU don't scrape your mixing bowl enough!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fedupwithschoollunch.blogspot.com/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340148c7bf2cb9970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340148c7bf3cca970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340148c7bf4fcf970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340147e1b641fe970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/our-daily-bread-part-two-wet-ingredients.html", "title": "our daily bread, part two: wet ingredients"},

{"date": "January 23, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I have had a horrible weekend filled with bad news, bad health, and the worst bad mood ever, which probably still doesn't excuse what I am about to admit to so much as it just explains it, but oh well...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I logged onto the facespace a little while ago because my phone made the facespace notifier sound, and found an interesting follow-up comment to a comment I left on a friend's wall...see, the Friend In Question had posted a link to this article (an op/ed piece proposing that insurance companies charge anti-vaccine parents higher health insurance premiums based on their child's voluntarily--on the part of the parents, anyway--increased health risk, sort of like they already do with cigarette-smokers) and was all \"Haha, this is brilliant,\" and of course I \"liked\" that and also left a comment stating that the anti-vax wackaloons* make my blood boil since I'm allergic to the pertussis vax and have asthma, making me dependent on herd immunity.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 THEN!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Someone Friend in Question is friends with on the facespace jumped in and specifically addressed me, stating that she didn't think I had any right to call anyone a wackaloon unless I myself had a child with autism (as she did).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Then angels sang and a heavenly light shined down upon my keyboard, because seriously, MY BIRTHDAY WAS A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 A better person than I might have had the restraint to leave that shit alone, but a better person I am not and so you bet your ARSE I jumped right back in with \"Well, X, actually I have TWO children on the autism spectrum so I'll say it again: THEY'RE WACKALOONS. Also, as a fan of logic I object to the notion that only those of us with children on the spectrum are allowed to comment on an issue of public health.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Then X went and erased her comments, so I erased my second one and then Friend In Question saw me gloating about the whole thing on the Twitter and was like \"TELL ME THE DRAMAAAAA!\" and checked her e-mail notifications, then DMed me and said \"Is it wrong that I was thrilled that you have two children with autism? I'm ashamed.\" I assured her that there was NOTHING wrong with that, or that I was at least equally wrong in that I was thrilled to have two children with autism spectrum diagnoses right then. I mean REALLY, how often does that make me the unequivocal winner in life?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 At the very least, hopefully X will think twice before she plays the \"autism card\" again. Teachable moments for the win!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Also, sadly, this was the high point of my weekend. How are YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Why yes, yes I did just call anti-vaxxers wackaloons. They deal in hysteria based on falsified data and the toll in human lives as a result of their collective insanity is very real. Ordinarily I avoid flame-wars on teh innernet like the plague, but if you're one of the \"well of course I don't vaccinate my child, I'd hate to have to raise a kid with autism!\" types then a) you are insulting two thirds of my children by implying that devastating and potentially fatal illness is preferable to being like them, b) your logic, and I use that term VERY LOOSELY, is flawed, and c) YES I ABSOLUTELY JUST CALLED YOU A WACKALOON, YOU FUCKING WACKALOON, BECAUSE YOU'RE ENDANGERING MY CHILDREN AND YOURS AND FURTHERMORE YOUR MOTHER WEARS COMBAT BOOTS. WHEN IT COMES TO A LITERAL MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH FUCK YES, LET ME GET MAH CAPS ON.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://bit.ly/fR7EFi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/this-may-be-the-worst-bad-fun-ive-ever-had.html", "title": "this may be the worst \"bad fun\" I've ever had"},
{"date": "January 25, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 No, not because of the bullets in this post, because gun humor isn't funny right now or really ever unless we're talking about Elmer Fudd getting his shotgun barrels tied in a big loopy bow by a certain wascally wabbit. It just seemed like a good title in that that's what ails me physically at the moment: I'm not sick, I'm suffering from a painful reminder that my own freaking immune system gets as fidgety under stress as my children do (and is even less cute in the ways it occupies itself when it hits a breaking point than they are, which is saying something).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I guess the bright side here is that if I was sick with, say, a sinus or chest infection that needed antibiotics my uninsured state would be harming me, whereas even with access to medical care there's not much to do for an autoimmune flare-up (for me, with my particular issues--if you have an autoimmune condition or are researching them for a loved one please don't think I'm a typical case because I'm not, and I'm also not a doctor, etc.). I can't take steroids (my body reacts to them in dangerous, bad ways), I'm unwilling to take Lyrica at a time when my asthma is flaring and I'm using the rescue inhaler daily because it makes me retain so much fluid that I worry that wouldn't be a very nice thing to do to my heart, and narcotics are never a good long-term solution when one needs to work and drive and manage small boys. So I'd be waiting this out and alternating ice and heat and balancing illicit over-the-counter NSAIDS (I'm not supposed to take them, per se, due to a very mild bleeding disorder and GI issues but if I'm in agony I use naproxen with great caution) with leafy greens and antacids either way. Also while I hate, hate, HATE to let go of my denial and admit that I'm still broken (I know it's silly but after each flare part of me hopes this'll just go away as mysteriously as it arrived in my early twenties and never happen again), almost two years is a good run as far as remissions go and it's not like I haven't been under an unusual amount of stress recently, which beats a random attack I suppose?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I've been hurting for several days and trying to pretend it was just the aftermath of that godawful coughing sickness (yes, I'm still coughing SOME but it's improving, FINALLY) or from, you know, all of the hacking, and today I did that stupid thing I do at least once per flare-up where I try to pull myself up by my bootstraps. I baked bread (which we ran out of Friday evening but the children weren't here and I felt like death warmed over so I didn't bake all weekend, then yesterday I was working and also feeling crappy so today I kind of HAD to), fed and watered the chickens, cooked dinner, and gave the boys some overdue haircuts. That is not a lot of physical exertion AT ALL and yet I feel like I ran a marathon in high heels with my nine-year-old on my back. Possibly uphill. In August.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 These \"flares\" can last anywhere from a few days to several months, so while I'm trying to take it a day at a time and stay positive, it doesn't exactly give me the warm and fuzzies when my body does this. I apologize if I'm not very entertaining for the next little bit. I'll finish up the bread series soonish, but right now I'm going to go lie on a heating pad and whimper.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/friendly-fire-.html", "title": "friendly fire "},

{"date": "January 26, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Kali asked in the comments, and others of you have asked me via DMs on the Twitter and via e-mail, so I thought I'd go ahead and answer this (well, not really, but sort of).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I do not have a diagnosis of one of the big-name autoimmune diseases (Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, etc.) at this time. I have been through all of the testing by several different rheumatologists, and while the general consensus is that I sure do have some kind of autoimmuney-looking thang going on, yep, my symptomology, labs, and imagery results do not fall under the specific umbrella of any one known condition as of the last time I had any. At various times general practitioners filling in for former primary care physicians of mine have speculated that I had Ankylosing Spondylitis, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis and a host of other seriously scary diseases, but I've gone to the trouble of ruling those out, because obviously I wouldn't want to have one of those and not be treating it. I *have* had a couple of different doctors formally diagnose me with fibromyalgia, and whatever it is that I have DOES respond very favorably to Lyrica, so I have no problem with letting them call it that as it gets me access to a medication that's very helpful to me when I'm at my absolute worst, painwise, but honestly I think I was hurting everywhere they pressed because my entire body from skin to bone, head to toe, hurt at the time that they did the \"trigger points\" test. At that time I was recovering from a bout with MRSA septicemia and the theory that has held the most water in my opinion was the one that classified my woes as some sort of \"post-staph rheumatoid phenomenon\" plus neurological damage from an extremely potent and toxic drug I was on to rid me of the infection and a side effect it caused in conjunction with another medication I had been taking when I fell ill (seratonin syndrome - which I would quite literally rather die than go through EVER AGAIN).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 That is all a very convoluted way to say that I'm not keeping anything from you, dear friends, when it comes to a formal diagnosis. I just don't have one I'm comfortable latching onto due to lack of empirical evidence, so I say \"autoimmune DOOOOOM\" and leave it at that. Whatever I have responds EXTREMELY well to systemic steroids (another point in favor of this being autoimmune), however I have very bad reactions to those (as in congestive heart failure) and can't take them anymore. There's not a lot I can do except take it as easy as possible, soak in the tub and use heat and ice as needed, take NSAIDS when my H&H and stomach will allow, and complain bitterly unless I have the means to procure more Lyrica (I am out, alas), but I am not terribly frantic over that because I am not at the point where I would go back on it long-term due to...yep, side effects.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This isn't to say that what I have is so bearable that I'm snubbing good treatment options so much as that the pain level has to be bad enough to make me seriously not even care whether the drugs to relieve it are potentially dangerous to my wellbeing or not. Steroids I have specifically instructed my physicians NEVER to give me outside of a life-or-death situation with close monitoring, and Lyrica is stressful enough for my circulatory system and fluid regulation that I hold it in reserve for getting me through the very worst of times. This current \"flare\" is brutal, but not THAT brutal (yet?) (I mean, um, AND IT WILL NOT BE, DAMMIT).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Is that about as clear as mud? Okay then. Now you (don't) know (either).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/what-autoimmune-disorder-do-you-have-exactly.html", "title": "what autoimmune disorder do you have, exactly?"},

He doesn't feel sick at all, just tired, but in the past that's been an indication of wonky labs. The good news is, thanks to Dr. Kidney's transplant coordinator Knowing How I Am we have a standing stat order for full transplant labs at the local LabCorp, so if he's not feeling any perkier tomorrow I can take him by there in the morning and by afternoon we'll know if it's anything to worry about.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Isis seems to be doing very well.

They'll probably ride buckled into  Little Child's Britax Marathon in their tank.

I said I didn't see why the hell people liked open caskets anyway, and he said \"well when YOU go you've having an open-casket service.

Sorry  about that. We're in DEFCON-5 mode here and I'll tell you about it when  it's resolved (probably no later than tomorrow afternoon). Everyone hold a good thought that we can make the best decisions, and I'll tell y'all about the trip itself.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Loud and Crazy (my brother-in-law, not to be confused with Big and Scary, my STEP-brother-in-law, who is Out Of The Herd) was his usual bipolar self, but for the first time got attitudinal with ME and I didn't relish it. Hotter wasn't there at the time, but wasn't surprised when I told him what went down (in short, Hotter's mom's household consisting of her and Loud and Crazy, the Big and Scary family, Hotter's son and his vapid girlfriend, and the MFA contingent were all venturing from Arctic Tundra State to motherfucking New Jersey for the funeral and there were logistics involving everyone BUT the MFA contingent wanting very much to not drive their own vehicles there, because I was the only one who naively feared for the age of my vehicle and the sanity/fitness of its driver less than I was petrified of MOTHERFUCKING NEW JERSEY TRAFFIC and Hotter and I had discussed it beforehand and agreed that we would take no passengers) (this was less to do with us both being antisocial curmudgeons and more to do with the fact that MFA Puppy's crate took up the entire cabin behind the front seats, leaving zero legroom in front of the rear bench seat--other parties involved wanted to take the crate out and pile either themselves or their least desirable loved one in with us but we weren't willing to leave MFA Puppy in Arctic Tundra State, period, end of story so she needed a safe place to chill in the MFA Minivan unattended for brief stretches) (which she really didn't because I mostly stayed with her anyway--she was my excuse for boycotting the funeral itself because I was led to believe it would be a church service and I can tolerate that but not a funeral home because I KNOW WHAT GOES ON THERE). Loud and Crazy was trying to avoid transporting the Big and Scary household in HIS vehicle, and wanted to have The Wrath drive her car with him riding shotgun so that he could remain unsober, and so was telling Loud and Crazy over the phone that everyone could ride with me and Hotter without so much as asking. I corrected that immediately and he was all \"YOU ARE TAKING X, X, and X IN YOUR VAN, MAWWWWM TELL HER\" and trying to get The Wrath in my face about the whole thing and I pretty much said \"not happening, believe me now or believe me later when it doesn't happen, up to you.\" Hotter's entire family tiptoes around Loud and Crazy but between my family of origin and the ten years I spent with the XY it takes true shit-throwing psychosis to faze me anymore. *shrug*\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter's son (yes, if you're shocked that he has a son that might be  valid, because I don't much discuss young Lefty on here, but  Hotter has an adult son who lives in Arctic Tundra State) looked great.  Really, really great, and I'm not going into the whole story because it  isn't mine to tell but there was Reason For Concern there and seeing him  cleancut, well-dressed, and minus all of the extreme piercings in his  face was like a breath of fresh air. It was Very Encouraging, and I  haven't felt optimistic on my step-son's behalf in a long time (and  neither, I think, had Hotter) so that was good.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 This was my first time spending any great length of time driving  in New Jersey, so you'll have to pardon my observations on the state,  especially if it's where you live and you're somehow NOT an asshole, but  OH MY GOD. The drivers. \u00a0\u00a0 Now, I am quite the road warrior and  always have been--I made my first multi-state road trip alone within a  few weeks of getting my driver's license, commuted from MFAville to my  graduate alma mater a hundred-ish miles away for four years, married an  effing NEW YORKER when I was young and stupid, and after rectifying that  error proceeded to commute from MFA State in The South to Arctic Tundra  State visiting Hotter every other weekend for over a year because love  makes you stupid.\u00a0\u00a0 All that to say that I thought people drove like  assholes around our nation's capitol but no, they're just in a hurry.  The motherfuckers in New Jersey (which borders Arctic Tundra state and  is where The Grandwrath lived and died) all have ISSUES and apparently  think they're immortal, and while I'm offending everyone from New Jersey  I'll also throw in that OH HAI, YOUR STATE SMELLS LIKE THE ROOM WHERE  MICHAEL JACKSON GIVES SATAN HIS DAILY RUSSIAN PROSTATE MASSAGE, LORD,  WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I may not have totally explained to y'all just how bad my phobias of  the elderly and of dead bodies and of night-time driving and being lost  all are, but being LOST, in NEW JERSEY, at NIGHT on the way to the  open-casket funeral of a nonagenarian? DEAR LAWD. I was keeping an eye  out for a giant hairy spider and/or a hidden camera after the fifth stop  for directions, when I got out of the car and walked briskly up and  down a block before I could speak to Hotter (who had accused me of not  Having Respect in that I was ready to quit effing wandering New Jersey  whether we found the goddamn funeral or not) (don't worry, I set him  straight on how we wouldn't have been there in the FIRST place if that's  what my issue was and he either realized I was right or saw that I was  ready to cut a bitch and dropped it).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 It's brutally cold already in Arctic Tundra State, and ALSO in motherfucking New Jersey.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 For all of my feckless meanderings across the map of our country,  I never had done more than scratch the surface of West Virginia before  this trip (why no, West Virginia is not even remotely in between MFA  State and Arctic Tundra State, but we like to multitask here and had  business to attend to there and so we went between The Funeral Debacle  and home). West Virginia was very pleasant (scenic, not terribly  populated, speed limits of 70) and then it provided us with the best and  most needed laugh EVER when, in driving between two mountains, the  radio of the MFA Minivan simulcast at least two stations at once (one of  which was playing some Collective Soul and the other of which was  playing Jimmy Buffet) and created an impromptu mashup of \"Shine\" and \"Margaritaville\" that...well...\"Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh, it's my own damn fault!\" West Virginia wins.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I am really fucking sick now. I can't imagine that had anything to do with the five hours of sleep in seventy-two or anything.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, crazy people suck, I hate New Jersey, Hotter eventually Paid His Respects, I am now MISERABLY ILL, and I Have A Secret. Also, if The Wrath dies tomorrow I no longer have enough respect for the sanctity of my marriage or the memory of any hypothetically-dearly-departeds to take my little household to the GOT DAMN funeral, so she had better take her vitamins and get her flu shot.

It's like for the past five years I've been pushing a boulder up a hill, and yeah, it was hard and painful and exhausting but it wasn't until I got to the top of the hill, sat down, and looked back at how far I'd come that my legs gave out.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 When your child might be dying, doctors focus on the positives, the things still left to try, the possibilities still open...you know the possibility of a bad outcome is there but you're so damn busy dealing with everything necessary to (hopefully) achieve a good one that you don't give it a lot of airtime in your head.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 When your child is a walking question mark and no one can tell you what will happen except to say that it'll go one of two ways, the absence of any indication which way it'll ultimately go sends your mind into overdrive.

At least half the people who hear that I have chickens respond with some variation of \"I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED CHICKENS OMG CHICKENNNNNS!\" (the other half are split pretty evenly between \"heh, cool,\" \"WHAT! WHY?\" and \"hahahahachickensbawwwwwkbegawkhahahaha\"). Of the people who aren't downright envious, the vast majority are at least curious, and the main question we get is \"how many eggs do you get from the chickens?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Our first hen laid around seventeen weeks, I think, and our last ones JUST started a few weeks ago around six months of age. Currently we have eight pullets (five Barred Plymouth Rocks, one ISA Brown, and two Araucanas), and we usually get between four and six eggs per day (in a typical week we'll have maybe one four-egg day of \"WTF,\" two five-egg days, and four six-egg days) from them. Let's round down a little, though, to account for the two or three per month that get broken in the nest boxes, and say five eggs per day as an average. This month we gave away half a dozen eggs to a neighbor and kept around 144 (twelve dozen eggs).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 That breaks down to...three dozen a week??? Wow.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 You'd think we'd have eggs coming out of our ears but honestly we don't tend to have more than half a dozen usable (not hard-boiled or put away to age before being hardboiled--very fresh eggs are IMPOSSIBLE to peel and you save a lot of cursing by keeping them for a couple of weeks...most of the eggs you buy at the supermarket are at LEAST that old) eggs on-hand at any given time. I usually use one or two per day in cooking and baking, Big Child and Hotter eat them microwave-poached for breakfast, I am an egg-salad FIEND (I only use one out of maybe four yolks due to cholesterol concerns but the dogs are happy to eat those yolks so they don't go to waste), Isis enjoys an egg cracked into her bowl at mealtimes...I'd say for our family of five (only three of whom actually eat eggs except in baked goods) eight chickens is just about perfect. We are DEFINITELY going through more eggs than before, because they're cheap and nutritious and RIGHT THERE, but if we weren't keeping the chickens as a money-saver/green/sustainable-living endeavor rather than a hobby (or were in a place right now to afford hobbies) I'd probably have more birds just so I could give the eggs away to friends and neighbors.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/how-many-eggs-do-you-get-from-the-chickens.html", "title": "how many eggs do you get from the chickens?"},

No? ME EITHER. Eff.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I really wish Hotter wouldn't get angry with me about things like this. I'm plenty angry with myself and with life, and well-aware that I have the math-skills of an educably-retarded fifth grader (per a learning psychologist's testing; I'm not abusing the \"r-word,\" it's just the truth) without anyone else pointing it out.

But y'know, we ARE thinking about getting another dog, SOMEday, HYPOTHETICALLY when things suck a little less and maybe it should be \"were\" instead of \"are\" because I was reverting to that happy mental space where Hotter's gramma was still alive and not bankrupting me with her goddamn funeral and we weren't taking the XY back to court for dropping the parenting ball in a big, huge way that violates the terms of his visitation MAJORLY.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Plenty of people retreat into denial in major, life-destroying ways when faced with insurmountably adverse circumstances. I goofed on a caption on an effing funny-ha-ha cartoon on the facespace.

Might be a couple days, might be longer. Meanwhile if anyone wants to buy some MFOrganics Sea Salt Scrub, that would be GREAT (I am NOT putting the \"donate\" button back up because our problems are not y'alls, but if you're looking for an excellent, organic salt scrub or a nice holiday gift I have no problem with selling you a jar) and here is what one buyer had to say about it (I really am rather proud of the stuff).

I've been ad-free on here since October of last year, mostly because after Google deemed me too sexy for them and tried to censor my use of \"big black cock\" I was pissed, and then I couldn't get the AdBrite code to work, but then we got Bumpus and there was DRAMA on the Twitter and I opened up Sitemeter and went \"huh,\" and got a whole lot more motivated to figure out the HTML. It's taken me a while to figure out how to work the publisher dashboard, and I apologize for the, erhm...assertiveness...of the first ads. I have disabled the ones that I think were the most irritating, and while I know people do not enjoy the full-screen dealies I did at least ensure that those will (as soon as the changes take effect) be family-friendly, and hopefully we can all live with this because ideally I need the blog to at least pay for its own hosting in order to keep it running.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 On an unrelated note but also annoying: I've gone back to partial feeds.

{"date": "January 17, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I want y'all to know that I wrestled with what to call this series. Because the title I finally did give in and use is SO. OVER. DONE. but it's pretty much inescapable; it's even emblazoned on the end of the slicing guide my kids pooled their resources and gave me for my birthday, so it is what it is. See?\r\n Figure One: Cropped from an image I took in my kitchen; that is the bread we eat in all its glory!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I've shied away from writing this post, even though several of y'all have asked specifically about it, because bread is so huge to me, but then I decided I'd do a \"bread week\" and since I'm eating a lot of feelings doing a lot of baking right now why not, right?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The Mennonite preacher's wife who taught me to really make bread did it as a home-based business; she shared her \"secrets\" willingly with me over several flour-dusted baking days I spent in her home drinking tea with my babies crawling around our feet ages and ages ago.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The first thing Mrs. MPW taught me is that flour really matters. I rode with her out even further into the country than her small farm to a Mennonite country store where spry lady of perhaps seventy waited on us and rang Mrs. MPW up for fifty pounds of red wheat. We took our receipt out to the parking lot and the lady from behind the counter appeared with the sack on her shoulder and tossed it into the back seat of the truck as if it weighed nothing at all! Back at the farm Mrs. MPW showed me her wheat grinder and apologized to the babies before firing it up and WOW THAT THING WAS LOUD. The fine, off-white flour it produced from the wheat kernels was silky and unlike any other flour I've worked with...\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Due to financial constraints I can only long for and covet a grinder so that I can someday use local whole wheat; for now I buy my flour from the store. What kind of flour, you ask?\r\n Figure Two: I heart me some Red Mill. This is my favorite flour for bread, hands-down.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The first rule of home-baking, though, is that you have to be able and willing to work with substitutions. One time when I was just a leetle bit short on flour I added some of this stuff, and it came out so nicely that now I use a half a cup in every batch!\r\n Figure Three: I actually bought this for Isis's BARF meals, to add fiber and some complex carbs. Live and learn! It gives the bread's flavor a subtle complexity that we really enjoy here.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 That's not all I add to the flour, though. The first part of my bread recipe, the dry ingredients, is as follows, in fact:\r\n3 cups flour of your preference1 packet dry yeast (I use fast-rising but the slower kind produces the same outcome, just not as fast)1/2 cup coconut flour2 tbsp. flaxseed meal2 tbsp. wheat germ2 tbsp. pure gluten (this acts as a \"dough conditioner\" and helps make the bread spongy and soft)1/2 cup brown sugar (this was also the result of a substitution when I ran out of white; now I use brown)1 tbsp. salt\r\n Figure Four: Here is what it all looks like in a big stainless steel mixing bowl. I use a whisk to combine the dry ingredients thoroughly before adding the wet ones. We'll discuss those in part two!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340147e1ad5d35970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340148c7b691da970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340147e1ad7725970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340148c7b6a1bb970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/our-daily-bread-part-one-flour.html", "title": "our daily bread, part one: flour"},

Just take my word for it though that 2010 is forever on my shitlist.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Does anyone know whether \"easter eggers\" like Araucanas consistently lay the SAME COLOR eggs?

Those of y'all who follow me on the Twitter might already be aware that I attempted to bake 100% rye bread and failed miserably (it was like bricks without straw and even the chickens struggled to eat the stuff) a few days ago. Then we ran out of bread and I used some regular table-bread sponge to attempt a \"Swedish-style\" rye today and OH MAH GAW, it came out PERFECT! This is the chewy, carraway-rich rye of the Jewish delis of my childhood, and I'm so very tickled with myself!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually feeling some Jewish guilt. Like, actual JEWISH GUILT. I thought I was immune, but the fact that my children don't have any idea what kugel is (this came up while Hotter was reading a Slate piece about why Jews shouldn't have \"Christmas trees\" out loud to me this morning--I woke up without a voice and can make squeaky mid-pubescent-boy sounds now but didn't have it in me this morning to do much more than hiss \"kugel is kugel, dammit, it's got noodles and it's sweet like a dessert!\" at him) bothers me in the sense that we are, culturally if not religiously, Jews (I and the MFA children are, I mean--not Hotter) and the boys have no idea. I'm seriously going to start taking them to a local reform congregation's services, I think. Just maybe not this week since there's apparently going to be some kind of effing blizzard.

Am debating salt-scrub, only because I dunno what each teachers' stance is on homemade. My ex-husband, for example, wouldn't eat my homemade bread because (and I quote): \"I saw this thing on, like, Discovery Health or something, where someone was baking their own bread and because it didn't have all the preservatives and stuff that store-bought foods have they opened the bag and these SPORES shot up and their WHOLE FACE FELL OFF.

Instead of serving, the servers for the most part stood around and got to know each other better while polishing things. As a trainee I make minimum wage either way, but some of my co-workers were (understandably) unhappy not to be making more money.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0After work I went to the YMCA; I missed today's yoga classes due to my work schedule but I wanted to get in some time on the elliptical; I skipped a few days while getting over that cold and adjusting to getting up at oh-god-hundred and don't want to lose my momentum. The first machine I got on was not the one I usually use (yes, I am a creature of habit that way), and when it couldn't pick up my pulse and kept beeping errors at me I switched to a second machine. The second machine said my pulse was lower than I have ever seen it. Puzzled, I switched to a third machine, my usual one, which concurred with the second machine. At that point I decided it was probably me with the issue and not the machines and just went about my business:\r\n\r\nFigure One: Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't one's pulse be higher than this after forty minutes of, um, CARDIO?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yes, I was that douche using their phone's camera in the gym today. This was just so weird, though, that I wanted to get a photo for when I have my next appointment with my GP (I had to promise I'd come in within a month to get her to call in the Effexor). I asked Twitter what they thought after I got home, and medically-inclined friends of mine were all \"surely you're on beta blockers? No? Irregular heartbeat or impaired circulation, maybe?\" Concerned, I decided to check my pulse manually and see if I could notice anything amiss. I probably wouldn't be able to spot a subtle arrythmia if bit me in the arse, but I like to think I'd notice something hospital-worthy. I didn't feel anything out of the ordinary, but my resting pulse was 88, which was much higher than my average pulse while working out.

Boooo, security guard.\r\n* \u00a0 I really like the crew I'll be working with. My immediate superior seems genuinely nice, and that is always a plus. The senior employee who is training me explained everything very well without being condescending, and was patient with my confusion over the one part of our job that has anything to do with numbers. I didn't meet a single person today who seemed like an asshole, including the customers even! Yay!\r\n* \u00a0 I noticed about halfway through my shift that sounds coming from the left were...not right. Like you know how your speakers sound in the car if the paper inside them is torn, that weird vibratory buzz that you get from the bass? That. By the end of the shift it was quite apparent that while I am already over that orientation-day cold IN GENERAL, Bad Ear is getting infected, and there is absolutely fuck-all I can do about it until the fifteenth. Boo :(\r\n* \u00a0 To end on a positive note, the restaurant at my new workplace has an entire gluten-free station in their breakfast buffet, and when we were closing that down my boss asked me if I'd like to try something from it. THERE WERE BLUEBERRY MUFFINS! I had already asked the kitchen staff where they got the cookies, which actually looked really good (most gluten-free baked goods are a little odd-looking), and they were like \"hey, have a cookie too! In fact, take one of each kind because we're just going to throw all of this stuff out anyway.\" I HAD A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN AND A SNICKERDOODLE AND AN OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE YOU GUYS, OMG. If you are not gluten-free you will not get what a big deal it was to get to have high-end gluten-free baked goods without paying an arm and a leg for the privilege, but I think even the gluttens among you will have some idea of how exciting it was to have a muffin AND cookies for the first time in eight months (yes, there are gluten-free things like this available for purchase SOMEwhere in town, but I can't justify paying eight bucks for a bag of cookies or twelve bucks for a four-pack of muffins that are JUST for me when we are this broke and I am trying to lose weight anyway).

{"date": "September 30, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 We saw the vet who first diagnosed Isis today; we really like him. *\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I met with him to discuss the prognosis, and there's good and bad news there. Between ten and twenty percent of dogs with demodectic mange can't be \"cured,\" and relapses during treatment are obviously not good. BUT. He pointed out that Isis has nearly doubled in size since she started treatment and had outgrown her dosage of Ivermectin long before she stopped taking it two weeks ago. Then flames shot out of my eyes and I had a conniption right there on the spot, because I called THREE TIMES to ask if we needed to raise the dose, and spoke to an actual (different, and apparently clueless) vet myself once, and all three times they told me nono, the dose was fine. THE DOSE WAS NOT FINE. I asked why the dose hadn't been adjusted based on weight, particularly since I'd called and ASKED ABOUT IT SPECIFICALLY and today's vet said \"I don't have a good answer for that; I've been on vacation and I'm not pleased about it either. The good news is, we can't call this a true treatment failure and that puts her odds of beating this with the correct dose a little higher than if she'd been on the right amount for the full course before.\" We'll call him Dr. Brightside.*\u00a0\u00a0 So Dr. Brightside changed the Ivermectin dosage from 0.4 ml (what she was taking when she weighed two pounds less than she does right now) to 0.75 ml (yeah, nearly double, which is what her weight has done since she started the previous course).*\u00a0\u00a0 I asked about getting Isis spayed, since she is five months old now, and going into heat usually brings on relapses (as does surgery or major injury/illness), and also if worst comes to worst and we have to place her in a no-kill shelter, most of them won't take unaltered pitbulls. Dr. Brightside said he's willing to spay her while she's in treatment as long as it's between dips and her liver enzymes are okay (they'll check those before operating and if they're elevated it'll force us to hold off on the surgery), and that he agreed with me it was better to get that out of the way and THEN finish treating the mange rather than get her well, have her go into heat or spay her and bring on a relapse, then treat her all over again. So we have a tentative surgery date for next Friday, with the caveat that her bloodwork has to look good the day of surgery or it's off.*\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Brightside said that if this doesn't work there are two things we can try. One would be to go to weekly Mitaban dips for a while, but he doesn't like to do those because they're so rough as far as side effects. The other would be to try a drug called milbemycin daily for at least a month, but that stuff is about ten bucks a pill, so that times thirty...well, let's all hope she responds to the correct dose of Ivermectin plus the dips, yes?*\u00a0\u00a0 You may have noticed that I'm speaking as if Isis will be staying right here and completing her treatment and living happily ever after. Yes, well. We've raised half of what that will (hopefully) cost and I'm trying to think positive. Please feel free to spread the word if you know anyone who might be able to help out. *\u00a0\u00a0 Also if you have a dog or a cat, the Banfield Wellness plans? Are totally worth it. I'm not being compensated in any way for saying so, but have a look at this and judge for yourself:\r\n Figure One: Y'all are the only reason we're still in this fight. Thank you.*\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully the money that's supposed to come in tomorrow comes in a timely fashion, because I totes floated a check to the vet all \"oh it's still September?\" See how sneaky I am?\r\n Figure Two: I know, I'm awful. Also I just felt the need to say that this is a sample checkbook we got when we opened the account and haven't used up yet; there's absolutely nothing wrong with patriotic checks but I am a) too cheap to pony up for anything but the generic bank-logo ones and b) not stockpiling canned goods and ammo for when The Rapture arrives or anything. Just um, wanted to clear that up. Also my handwriting sucks, but usually not THIS much. This is what happens when you write a check while holding the leash of a dog who desperately wants to get OUT of the vet's office. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.interceptor.novartis.us/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f4c06cf1970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f4c07198970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/the-treatment-plan.html", "title": "the treatment plan"},

She's been itchy and I was thinking maybe she was allergic to something she ate or had another infection; I hadn't even considered that she could have relapsed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Crap.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know what we're going to do, y'all. I went ahead and told them to treat her today, because I'd planned on the expense of a skin scraping and dip, but this has killed our budget the past two months in a row and we can't afford to keep doing this. We used the last of the donated funds to cover half the cost of the latest secondary infection, and at this point the total of all the vet bills to date is approaching a thousand dollars with no end in sight because to get her better would mean at least three (probably more) dips and two skin scrapings, IF everything went perfectly. In all honesty I probably should have told them to put her down when they called, but I couldn't do it and I'm mad at myself for that because intellectually I know that people trump dogs and we're at the end of what we can afford, and at that asshole breeder who swore the mother didn't have mange, and at life in general.

I kind of doubt we can raise enough to keep her here with us, but if any of you are filthy rich feel free to drop $500 on us and save the day (I am pulling that figure out of my arse, but it's what we've spent on mange treatment so far and is therefore probably the minimum treating this would take; if we had that much we could probably carve the rest out of our budget over the next couple of months).\r\nETA: I am speechless--you wonderful, amazing, borderline-crazy-but-in-a-good way people have ponied up half the funds it'd take for us to keep Isis right here at Casa MFA and treat this mess! I'm starting to think this is do-able. Thank you SO MUCH!

{"date": "July  9, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*   Yesterday I had a FABULOUS day at work! I had expected to be sucking on minimum wage as a trainee through the end of the week, but once they realized that I knew what I was doing with the POS system, table service, etc. I got turned loose on the general public a little early due to it being busy, and I? LOVED IT. I had a great time interacting with the customers, and everyone was very generous with the tips, including way more in cash tips than I had grown accustomed to receiving at The Hotel California (not like, \"we're gonna be rich\" or anything, but cash tips were rare and exciting there). To the point that I was able to tip out the bus boy, pay for my parking, and get the MFA Children a little treat (my employer owns a Starbucks on property that I get an employee discount in, and yesterday they had lemon cake pops, which everyone was raving over, and so for less than $5 I was able to get one for each of the MFA Children, who were surprised and ecstatic to get such a treat after very grim times here at Casa MFA), and still pick up a few vital groceries on the way home. And with what I made today, I will not be unable to get to work later in the week due to running out of gas, which was a real concern prior to today. YAY! Charge tips were pretty decent, too, both yesterday and today, and all in all I am MADLY IN LOVE with my new job (and not just because of the money--my co-workers are awesome, management is helpful and kind, and the clientele is classier and more congenial than the demographic I was used to dealing with in my former workplace).\r\n * Unfortunately, when I got home yesterday Hotter greeted me with an angry tirade, which...well. In addition to being kind of fucked up (he was mad because I mentioned my frustration with him over something that I was 100% NOT WRONG about on the facespace--he knew how I feel about said issue already and I didn't say anything I hadn't said to his face--he actually FORBID ME TO SAY IT AGAIN the day before yesterday, which went over about as well as you might imagine now that I have worked and exercised my way back to something resembling self-respect),  I had come home ecstatic about my workday and bearing gifts (our department at work is currently doing Candygrams as a fundraiser for a charitable cause I can personally get behind--each month a different department raises money for said cause and this month happened to be the turn of the department I was hired into so I got Hotter a Candygram in addition to the cake pops I got for the boys) and walked into a spouse eager to shake his finger in my face with rage and scold me until I was in tears. Which a) I was not in the wrong, and b) what the fuck dude, give me a minute if I walk in the door with a smile on my face and bags of gifts in my hands before you shit all over me, I think that is just basic common courtesy and a good way to make sure I actually COME HOME after work. So I unfriended and blocked him on the facespace (again). Not because I plan to talk shit about him on there or anything, but because anyone I know on there who goes off on me for something I post and threatens to talk shit about me to everyone else I know on there would get unfriended and blocked for such behavior, and he doesn't get to behave in such a manner simply because I am married to him. \r\n\r\n*   I swear, it's like the universe just decided I was TOO FUCKING HAPPY what with the gainful and rewarding employment times two (yes, I still work for Temp Agency #2 and will continue to do so for as long as it remains awesome), the health insurance, The Narcissist no longer being a threat to me and my family, the relative good health, and the working out and doing yoga. So yesterday life was like \"here, have some totally unfair marital discord and also a really bad earache. ENJOY!\" Today Hotter finally, after three got-damn years of my asking, took care of The Issue via five minutes spent online. I'm really happy about that, and I love Hotter to bits, don't get me wrong, but I swear, sometimes when he's being a jerk like he was yesterday I just want to high-five him. In the face.\r\n\r\n*   Speaking of working out and my health, I did thirty-five minutes on my usual elliptical machine and then seventy-five minutes of Yin Yoga yesterday. I felt fine the whole time, but am officially Slightly Concerned about my heart's health, because my heartrate started out by bottoming out in the low sixties in response to exercise, then after ten minutes rose into the range I would expect the heart of a non-smoking, relatively healthy thirty-four-year-old host-body to be in during strenuous cardio and stayed there for most of my workout, then bounced (seemingly at random, given that I kept the machine at the same incline and level of resistance throughout my workout and maintained a consistent number of strides per minute until the last five minutes of cooling down) between the low sixties and as high as 203 beats per minute. I...don't know what the deal is with that and will call my doctor tomorrow and make an appointment. I don't think I need to quit exercising seeing as how a) I FEEL perfectly fine aside from some occasional dizziness relating to standing up quickly (I have been chalking that up to the med change from Pristiq to Effexor XR since the onset roughly coincided with the med change, but in light of other variables am not sure I should write it off as such given that it's been a couple of weeks now), b) exercise is good for the heart, and c) the YMCA where I work out has a blood pressure machine and my BP immediately after I stepped off the elliptical was 115/79. But yes, I am concerned about the low heartrate in immediate response to strenuous exercise, the wild variability of my heartrate, and the bottom number of my BP creeping up toward the undesirable range. I don't know enough about Things Cardiovascular to tell whether the nice, low top number cancels out the heading-into-the-undesirable-range bottom number (or, in fact, they have anything to do with each other), or how worrisome the weird heartrate stuff actually is, and given my strong family history of coronary artery disease, valve issues, and arrythmias don't think I ought to ignore this longterm. Dammit. Hopefully after I get this checked out we can all laugh at my concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Actually I kind of wonder if the whole heartrate thing might fall under the umbrella of \"weird shit MFA Mama's body does in response to infection.\" Because Bad Ear started draining copiously today while I was at work (AWKWARD!), and the pain became excruciating bordering on incapacitating. So I called and got an appointment to see one of my GP's partners after work, and went and had my ears looked at, and I'm sure it will surprise no one to hear that Bad Ear was indeed pretty badly infected. Antibiotics and Tramadol for me, and while it sucks that this happened I felt pretty damned lucky to have my shiny new insurance and a job where I was able to make alllllmost a copayment's worth of cash tips (yeah, I took the old rubber checkbook to the doctor today, because I kind of had to get my stupid ear addressed in order to be able to function and go to work tomorrow, where I will most likely--HOPEfully--be able to make good on the rest of the copayment and get that into the bank before the check hits the account). The prescriptions I was fortunately able to cover with a CVS gift card from the bay of E that I already had for Hotter's meds. Three cheers for having the ability to get much-needed medical attention and prescription drugs!\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/07/work-is-great-bad-ear-is-bad.html", "title": "work is great, bad ear is bad"},

The doctor on call was very nice, and said no no, Zithromax should kill whatever was in my ear, but if I was still having pain and taking the antibiotic and decongestant as instructed then it was time to add in a steroid for the inflammation as well. Stupid Bad Ear!\r\n* \u00a0 Work today was lovely as usual. Everyone there is just SO very nice. Well, except for one person, who wasn't there today. I worked alone with that person on Wednesday right before my days off, and everyone I worked with today was eager to know how it went. I said pretty well, a little confusion at first but management sorted that right out (with extreme prejudice I might add), so no big deal. By confusion I mean they tried to do something unfair and underhanded, and I threw them under the bus without hesitation because if you screw with my money that is what I will do, but I was trying to be nice so I went with \"confusion.\" No one was surprised, and told me that said person was A Bastard. I guess that is good to know. But even The Bastard at this place is at least pretty decent to your face and doesn't threaten anyone or go on angry tirades, so if The Bastard is the worst I have to deal with there all is still roses as far as I am concerned. Because even The Bastard at my new job is nicer than the nicest person at The Hotel California.\r\n* \u00a0 I spent an hour on the elliptical trainer working off the initial high-dose steroids, and exhausted myself.

So that's a total of $528 we've spent since getting married for me to make 176 inconvenient extra trips to the bank. All because he wouldn't switch his direct deposit over to our account. I even suggested he open an individual checking account locally, in case it was the security of having the money be in his name only that he was after. NOPE! Toward the end of the monthly disagreement he FORBID ME TO MENTION IT, and I got seriously pissed. I finally put it to him in the context of \"do you just not care about our financial wellbeing or my time?\" and he put his hackles down and changed it. It took FIVE GOT-DAMN MINUTES.

This is huge as I've had writer's block since Big Child (nine) was a toddler.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Bizy Body-lizabeth moved blog addresses, and it took me a while to get that sorted out on the MFA Blogroll, and she had to poke me on the Twitter, so anyway if you got a 504 or \"blog closed\" thingy clicking her link recently try again, please. She's adorable and has equally adorable children plus she's funny and has a dog who is Isis's innernet-lovah. She's made of win and is personally responsible for my attitude adjustment over the Hellidays.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 School tomorrow! School tomorrow! Whoo! Can walk to the bank and grocery store as the MFA Minivan is still tits-up. Should be clear so it'll be good for us both.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Okay Hotter is out of the shower.

{"date": "November  1, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 The burns are still healing well, so that's good.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Pretty much all of yesterday sucked though. Hotter decided to be an asshole, which is rare, so rare that I convinced myself I was being paranoid and he wasn't really being an asshole, he just wasn't aware of how he sounded (in my defense, this isn't total delusion on my part as the brain damage that I sometimes joke about does make Hotter occasionally unable to tell where \"funny\" leaves off and \"divorce proceedings\" begin; he'll totally think he's being all sarcastic/ironic and hilarious and I'll totally be cut to the quick and it SUCKS but I've learned that if he sounds like an utter asshole then there's a 98% chance he thinks we're both enjoying his little joke). I was even on g-chat with a good friend beating myself up for getting annoyed at all, because the poor guy doesn't know he's doing it and what kind of wife gets mad at their husband for something he can't control? I had gotten as far as wondering whether it was fair to poor, sweet Hotter that I have so much emotional baggage surrounding men who are assholes and get my feelings hurt SO EASILY when he is having a spell of Shittyremarkitis when he came in and asked what was wrong. I agonized briefly over phrasing things in a tactful, non-demeaning, low-reactivity way and explained that I was really upset but trying really hard to get over it, and he stopped me and clarified that no, HE MEANT WHAT HE SAID AT FACE VALUE.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 What he actually said is irrelevant; I will say only that it reflected an incomplete understanding of what my capabilities were yesterday as far as what I could and couldn't do with my left arm bandaged up and threatening to deglove and that it was NOT anything to do with the sex. I'm not interested in rallying the innernet to prove how right I was in being shocked and horrified by my husband's insensitivity because I already know he was in the wrong. I don't generally write about marital discord on here, first of all because this is only the third time in eleven months of wedded bliss that I've even been angry at Hotter, so it's not really something I have to consciously Not Talk About. I also don't think that making him feel attacked by involving y'all in the context of \"and BY THE WAY the innernet thinks you're an asshole, too!\" would be conducive to letting things simmer the hell down, and finally as I said I have baggage relating to men who are assholes so half the time I'm overreacting anyway. This, however, is not one of those times.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The dog escaped out the front door yesterday and did her level best to kill both the chickens and yours truly; we did about three complete laps of the property (and by \"we\" I mean at least one frantic chicken, the dog, and me) before Hotter came out and helped and I effed my ankle up again. Ow.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Because I had nothing nice to say to anyone, I took my hurt feelings and my bum ankle and went on a garbage run, then stopped at the grocery store to get something in case we ended up getting any trick-or-treaters (we didn't), and because we're health nuts over here lately I ended up getting some organic animal-shaped fruit snacks. When I got home I decided to taste them, since my blood sugar was in the toilet, and my furthest molar back on the lower left side (which wouldn't be YOUR furthest molar back, as I had to have that one pulled due to infection and poverty during the very worst of my separation and divorce a couple of years ago) came apart entirely. That tooth had had a small \"sticky spot\" that my dentist put a filling over just to be safe a couple of years ago, and the evidently it is rotten under the filling, which came off taking some tooth with it, and there was (is) a big, black hole leading straight down to what I think may well be my VERY LAST EFFING NERVE. And the Vicodin I'm on for the burns? NOT EVEN HELPING A LITTLE BIT.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I retreated to the bathroom with a flashlight to assess the damage (which looked even worse than it felt, which is saying something), ascertained that it would be More Dental Work Than We Can Possibly Afford (I do not have dental insurance), remembered how awful getting that OTHER tooth pulled without anesthesia was (I am immune to novocaine and general at the oral surgeon is about $250 that they demand up-front and I didn't have then and don't have now), and just lost. My. Junk.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter (who I am STILL furious with, but actually start to feel a little sorry for at this point in the narrative) heard me crying and came and asked (rather belligerently, as I suppose he thought I was trying to make him feel guilty) if I was crying over what he'd said earlier. I yelled at him, y'all. I am not a yeller. I don't generally express anger at all. But I effing LOST IT and hollered something to the effect of \"NO IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT YOU, I AM CRYING ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS LIKE HOW I OVERDREW OUR FUCKING BANK ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THE FEE AND MY ARM HURTS AND I AM MISSING HALLOWEEN WITH MY CHILDREN FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW AND MY ANKLE HURTS AND JUST NOW MY TOOTH FELL THE FUCK APART AND YOU KNOW I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT DENTAL EMERGENCIES FROM THE LAST TIME AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THE ANESTHESIA AND I CAN'T SIT STILL FOR ANOTHER TOOTH TO GET RIPPED OUT WITHOUT ANY, I JUST CAN'T AND IT HURTS SO MUCH AND THIS MEANS THE HOLIDAYS ARE CANCELED AND I FUCKING GIVE UP! I CAN'T EVEN DRINK WITH THE VICODIN AND YOU'RE ALSO A DICK, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BE A DICK TONIGHT? WHYYYYYYYY????!!!!??!eleven?!!\"\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The rest of the night consisted of Hotter attempting to hug, spoon, pat, and otherwise comfort me, me giving Hotter the cold shoulder, my dentist failing to answer his pager, and then I stepped on a tack with my GOOD foot (we think the tack fell from a child's school art project, because we don't even USE tacks) and it went all the way in. I just had to laugh grimly while I rummaged for a butterknife to slide under the head and pull the thing out because we JUST established that I'm up-to-date on my Tetanus shot at Urgent Care due to the burn and REALLY universe? At that point a tack was kind of lame. Even in the good foot.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 So the bank account is overdrawn, my arm still hurts, the tooth is exquisitely painful, my children will be home any moment, I am waiting for the XY to pay the child support before I can go to the dentist but I can't imagine that'll be anything less than THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES, and probably my foot will turn gangrenous and fall off soonish.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I give up. I just fucking give up. I think I'm going to go back to bed and try that denial thing for a bit because eating my feelings is out (tooth) and I can't even go for a nice run to clear my head (ankle) and...yeah. Wish me luck in avoiding falling safes for the rest of the day; I'll be back when I can think of something, ANYTHING nice to say. I hope y'all are all in better spirits than I am on this shitty, shitty Monday. I really do.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/11/so-thats-where-my-very-last-nerve-resides-perhaps-the-dentist-can-remove-it.html", "title": "so THAT'S where my very last nerve resides; perhaps the dentist can remove it?"},
{"date": "January  1, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I do not tend to talk overly-much about my health on here. Some of you may be smiling and shaking your heads because I bitch about having colds plenty and occasionally mention prescriptions, but that's really only the tip of the iceberg (and while in some households mine might be the most egregiously bad health of all, this is not one of those households, heh). There are several reasons for this:\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 It's troll-bait to complain about your health struggles on your blog no matter HOW bad they are.*\u00a0\u00a0 Some of my health problems are pretty rare and the combination of numerous very-rare health problems is rather identifying if you're a medical professional, or a troll, or a troll who plays a medical professional on the innernet.*\u00a0\u00a0 Some of my health issues are shrouded in mystery, as my health was Very Fucking Bad for about two and a half years and then improved so dramatically with the \"surgical removal of the spouse,\" as my endocrinologist termed it that it's kind of unreal, even to me, and I lived it. Plausibility issues in writing bug me because I spent years in Gradual School learning how NOT to write, and plausibility issues on a blog are...troll-bait.*\u00a0\u00a0 In my opinion, it's entirely possible that one of my most pressing physical health issues is a misdiagnosis, although ultimately that question is academic as the diagnosis I have been given is widely misunderstood and there's not a heck of a lot of doctors who know much about it and not a lot known even among those experts about how to treat it, and so is the other condition we already know based on empirical evidence that I have, which I think is the actual culprit for the symptoms that lead to a clinical diagnosis of condition the FIRST, so it's irrelevant really and OH MY GOD DO YOU SEE HOW BORING THAT JUST WAS? I went through an intense phase of knowledge-acquisition with each diagnosis as a geeky sort of empowerment exercise but honestly, I have reached my saturation point for discussion and debate and the SEARCH! FOR! ANSWERS! and I think my saturation point on the matter is higher than most, so: BORING!*\u00a0\u00a0 I don't like to dwell (anymore; I laid down in this initially and wallowed but that's just unattractive from the inside and outside). I may seem pretty damned zen about all of this but there is a small part of me that I've compartmentalized in my head that never stops shrieking in dread over a certain (as in certainty, not as in particular) prognosis and I have no desire to play peek-a-boo with it because it's all very cute until that ESCAPES.*\u00a0\u00a0 It's troll-bait to discuss money on your blog, and doctors cost money, and prescriptions cost money, and money definitely influences my treatment decisions, a LOT, so I can't logically discuss my health without explaining why I'm not doing x, y, and z, or taking drug a instead of drug b, etc. and there are those (by which I mean trolls) who would say that that is the same as asking for something.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 All of which is to say that I woke up feeling much better and think I just had a stupid little cold on the heels of the infection the Levaquin was killing off, so yay, but then I put my arms up to fasten my hair into a ponytail and pinched a nerve in my neck/shoulder area, and OWWW. There's a certain non-narcotic (it's actually a neuroleptic) prescription drug that helps this sort of nerve pain for me (whether it is due to condition one, an autoimmune/inflammatory one for which said drug was prescribed, or another facet of my underlying connective tissue disease), and I have a bit of it on-hand, and it may or may not be enough but more of the same drug would be prohibitively expensive, so I'm worried, and stress exascerbates the condition this allegedly stems from in some part so I feel like I shouldn't worry JUST IN CASE the medical professionals are right but DAMN, y'know? Add to that the fact that the MFA Minivan is tits-up and I am not impressed with 2011 so far, not at all.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I've been propped on the couch for the past hour since this happened with an icepack and a Lidoderm patch on my neck, and have taken some anti-inflammatory drugs and the prescription I have for the nerve pain, and I think it may be SLIGHTLY less acutely and searingly painful but honestly I'm not sure. Also, due to some previous nerve damage my left hand is goofy on a good day and the current pinched nerve is affecting my RIGHT arm, so this should be...interesting.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sigh.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/01/the-one-where-i-make-vague-and-disgusted-reference-to-my-health.html", "title": "the one where I make vague and disgusted reference to my health"},
{"date": "July 12, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Zumba is NOT MY FRIEND. I should have known as soon as the instructor came into the room that this was not for me; she was as big around as one of my thighs (I'm a size 8 these days, for reference), and if you had turned her head backward on her neck her body would not have looked any different from the front. I had the thought that, should she compete in the Olympics, the judges would want to see a karyotype done to prove she was female, and then mentally scolded myself for having that thought. Bodies come in all shapes and sizes, I told myself. She's amazingly fit and you're just jealous!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then the class began. I was aware going in that Zumba is pretty intense, but looking around the room I would put myself in the top 25% fitness-wise, so I thought I would be okay. I do thirty-five minutes to an hour of cardio a day and have a physically-demanding job. How hard could it be? The answer: too damn hard.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Gentle Readers, there was no way I could physically move my body as fast as that, even trying as hard as I could and completely disregarding my soft tissue continuing to fly in one direction while my skeleton moved in the other, like a whiplash of flesh. I looked around surreptitiously and saw that nobody else was keeping pace with the instructor either, and decided I was being overly self-conscious. So I started keeping up with the direction the instructor's body was moving, but omitting every other step-ball-change so that I could at least keep up without losing an eye to one of my own flying tits or elbows.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fifteen minutes into the class, my chest began to hurt. It was mostly on the right side, not the left, so I told myself it wasn't a heart attack and to woman up.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Half an hour in the chest pain intensified and I started having trouble breathing. Surely the class is almost over, I told myself, and then I looked at the clock and said FUCK THIS and got out of there.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah. Zumba and I are NOT FRIENDS and I will stick to yoga and the elliptical from here on out. I kind of hate dancing anyway. I'm still coughing stuff up the way I do after an asthma attack and sweating after taking a shower and chugging a bottle of Gatorade. Fuck. That.

He worked on it for a while today and I have to go back tomorrow and get an x-ray to make sure it's not infected under the filling or something, but he either removed or covered up my very last nerve, which is great. I still feel like I got punched in the jaw from the numbing shots (I asked him to skip them since they don't do anything for me anyway and I'm broke, he said it unnerves him too much to drill on my teeth without at least trying to numb me up and offered to eat the cost if I'd just let him use the shots, so I let him use the shots but OW) but I spent a good half-hour snowed on nitrous oxide and that was the high point of today so I'm calling the dentist a wash.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently the XY took the children with him for an overnight at his girlfriend's house. According to the boys she smokes and was up late crying with Daddy in her room (they said she told them she had a stomach ache) or else making noise that sounded like crying. I am about as pleased with this as you might imagine (I think the \"crying\" thing bothers me most of all, because either girlfriend is a screamer or else they were fighting, and ohgod I hope he's not hurting her), especially given the XY's insistence on a very Puritanical custody order specifically prohibiting either of us from having overnight guests of the opposite sex during our custodial time (\"or of the same sex if they are of romantic interest\" in my case as well) (yeah, my lawyer was all \"I think he just called you a lesbian\" and I was all \"but how about if there's no romance and I'm just bringing home a piece of ass?\") (okay not really, but I totally should have).

I love our stupid dog but I love my husband and my kids more. Thing is, who wants a pitbull with mange?

{"date": "December  1, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 About ten years ago, when I was pregnant with Big Child, was the second time I almost got divorced (the first time I almost got divorced was when I didn't abort Big Child, but that's neither here nor there). Reason being? We had just found out Big Child would be a boy and I refused to have a bris in which some shaky old fart powered by Manischevitz hacked at my (then fetal) firstborn's foreskin with a dubiously sterile blade in my living room. Just, no. I may not be religious at all, but I'm pretty down with cultural traditions that don't involve amateur gentital mutilation (or professional genital mutilation, in all honesty, but the compromise that the XY and I ultimately arrived at was that Big Child and the subsequent MFA Children were circumcised, just in hospitals, by MDs, with topical anesthetic). The XY, however, was irate at the time, and yelled and blustered and thundered, and accused me of everything from failing to resist the diaspora to wanting the future Big Child to be mocked in the locker-room in high school.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It was not pretty.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 All that to say that the CATHERINE situation came to a head tonight when the XY returned the children over an hour late (and a solid half-hour past their bedtime) claiming that Big Child had failed to do his homework in a timely fashion. Big Child sold his father down the river the moment the door closed, however, and said that they were late because they had gone out of town to CATHERINE's house so that she could cook them dinner, and he hadn't been permitted to start his homework until after they'd eaten, which took a while because she made something special and I don't know, I think my eyes kind of glazed over for a little while there, but I really was determined to be nice and said that I was glad they'd at least done something special for the first night of Hannukah.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"No, Daddy forgot! I asked him if we were going to light the candles and he was like 'oh it's Hannukah?'\" Big Child said, looking digusted. \"We didn't have any gelt, and I was excited because this year I can have the dairy in the chocolate,\" Little Child said, lip quivering. And my heart broke a little bit and I grabbed my father's menorah and a couple of candles and started digging around for a lighter, because that is what I do, I try to make it up to them when their father's hypocrisy lets them down.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"You're supposed to light the candles at sunset anyway,\" Middle Child said derisively, \"it's too late.\" I said that while that was true about lighting the candles at sunset, Hannukah was a holiday that celebrated the Jews' ability to make do with what was on-hand, and since I hadn't had them on hand as they were at CATHERINE's house with their father failing to resist the diaspora we would just hearken back to our roots and light the candles (yes, it's the first night, but you start with two, the shamash or \"helper candle\" and the first proper candle of the eight) \"WELL THAT'S DUMB AND I BELIEVE IN JESUS LIKE CATHERINE ANYWAY,\" Middle Child bellowed, and then I told him that he could go believe in Jesus in his room while the rest of us lit the dadblasted candles but couldn't quite keep the quaver out of my voice because REALLY? Middle Child wanted to mix it up some more but Hotter stepped in and told him to quit making his mother cry and marched him to his room where he proceeded to pitch an overtired fit. Good old Hotter!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's okay Mommy, I won't hassle you about Jesus tonight,\" Big Child said magnanimously back out at the dining room table where I was fiddling with the candles (the miracle of Hannukah! Big Child loves to razz me about Jesus because he's a punk that way), and Little Child said he was okay with waiting until tomorrow for the gelt, and I told them how our menorah had belonged to my dad and to his mother before him, and how my father always burned his hands trying to melt wax to make candles stick to the rims of the impossibly small and crooked holes in the cheap piece of junk and cussed, and then I burned my fingers and Big Child said I could cuss if it would make me feel better but I said that was okay, and we talked about the probability of one night's oil lasting for eight days. \"I dunno buddy, I wasn't there,\" I finally said. \"Maybe it did, maybe it didn't, maybe the atmospheric conditions or the length of the wick in the lamp helped it last longer, who knows, but Hannukah is a holiday that celebrates things working out so that you have what you need even when it seems like there's no way that's possible. The Jews had just had their tuchuses almost handed to them, the Maccabees were some scrappers but it was an improbable victory and they were the underdogs, kind of like us. It probably wasn't pretty, and it probably didn't look good at all, but they made what they had work kind of like we do today, I mean look at me, I didn't buy gelt or make any latkes because I thought you were celebrating with your father who was being a bad Jew this year and failing to resist the diaspora with CATHERINE, your brother is down the hall pouting about Jesus, and I'm out here in my bathrobe with a snotty nose burning my stinking fingers past bedtime with a couple of birthday candles and a jacked-up menorah, because it's what we do. We make do with what we have, even when things suck.\" Then Big and Little children giggled over me saying \"suck\" and headed to bed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 After that, I had a talk with Middle Child, who said he wanted to change and be like CATHERINE so she'd like him, and told him that changing so that people will like you is never a good idea, because either they like you the way you are or they don't, and if they don't they're not worth trying to change for and that didn't tend to work anyway. \"But I really want her to like me,\" he bawled. I asked him if Daddy had ever liked me even though I tried to change who I was. \"No, Daddy has NEVER liked you,\" he said. I asked him if I seemed happier when I was trying to change who I was for Daddy or after I gave up on that. \"After,\" he said. \"Well okay then. You find people who like you for you, and don't worry, CATHERINE sounds like she likes you plenty and I like you just fine even when you take a poop on me while I try to make the best of a bad situation because you're awesome, but please don't do that again. It really hurt my feelings.\" He said he wouldn't.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 After the children were in bed, Hotter asked what the hell kind of Jew forgot about Hannukah. \"The kind whose girlfriend puts her tree up BEFORE Thanksgiving,\" I reminded him (yes, the MFA Children ratted CATHERINE out as being one of THOSE). \"Isn't it the same time every year?\" I said no, no it wasn't, it was actually pretty confusing, but those of us who weren't failing to resist the motherfucking diaspora looked it up on Google AS GOD INTENDED and we had a laugh over that, but...well, hell, y'all. I guess it's not such a mystery why hypocrisy is making me blow my stack lately afterall.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I hate the effing holidays.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Can I go to sleep and wake up around Boxing Day, y'reckon?\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. My Twitter stream is unlocked once more; Stalky got shut down for TOS violations. I have grumbled about Twitter plenty since they wouldn't do a thing about it a few months ago when Stalky first started up her \"anonymous\" antics on there, but apparently trying to get a pseudonymous blogger fired by talking smack about her professional abilities with two-thirds of her full name on Twitter is okay but posting several timeline pages' worth of butthurt vitriol because it wouldn't put the lotion on its skin and Stalky has no hose you got called on your bullshit and don't WANT to provide your own address is NOT okay if you're all \"but since you had to go and get CUTE about it here's YOUR home address, neener neener!\" and include said blogger's home address in your next tweet. HAPPY HANNUKAH TO ME! Thanks, Twitter. I'm sure Stalky will just start a new account, because she doesn't seem to have a whole lot else to do with her time, or maybe start leaving hateful comments or sending e-mails from anonymous g-mail accounts as she likes to do to let me know she's pining for me around holidays, but maybe she'll find something productive to do with herself instead.

THANK GOODNESS. That was the most acutely horrid I've felt in quite some time.*\u00a0 MFA Puppy is also much improved. Just the past few days something has shifted; she's lengthened out, filled out, and really come into her own personality-wise. I don't quite know what the major shift there has been, or whether puppies go through developmental leaps like human babies do or what, but suddenly there's a quiet intelligence in her beady little eyes, a presence. The dignified sort of presence very large, noble-looking dogs like Wolfhounds or Great Danes have, almost dignity. Don't get me wrong, she still picks up, tugs on, mouths, and plays with every damn thing she comes across and has fits of heightened stupidity and rampant silliness, but she listens now and understands that you're communicating with her, whether she chooses to listen or not. Her first fully-mastered command, \"sit,\" got its first actual real-world use today when we took her to Petsmart and placed her on the Banfield Pet Hospital's scale. She scrambled and lunged and strained to be off the stainless steel plate as usual, but I pulled my hands away and barked \"SIT!\" and she plonked her butt down and sat perfectly still long enough for the number to steady. GOOD DOG, OMG YES!!!*\u00a0 I don't want to jinx myself, but I actually think that the combination of catching up with my sleep deficit and treating the infection that must've never fully gone away is going to make me feel much better than my recent baseline \"blah.\" I thought it was BlogHer hangover and maybe old age, but maybe not. I was starting to think maybe I ought to get my thyroid levels checked because of the persistent fatigue but it seems to be lifting. Yay!*\u00a0 The reason we were at Petsmart, although we also picked up more food for the pitbull princess, was to buy feeder crickets for The Undertoad. OH YES. I caught him last night when he leapt out of a potato ditch I was weeding, and since I had my gloves on and he was RIGHT THERE...yes. For those of you who don't know me offline or on the facespace, Underdog slithered underneath the big rock in the sky and we had an empty terrarium. Don't worry, though, if you're one of the several people I instructed to junk-punch me if I rescued another critter you may STAND DOWN. This was not a rescue and the toad is not a pet (although Hotter, who has always loved and rooted for the toad, is trying to put that kind of spin on things). This was an apprehension and the toad is a prisoner. That motherfucking thing was my nemesis and he can't leap out from under foliage across my bare feet and terrify me if he's locked up tight.

{"date": "September  8, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0 Sorry for disappearing, y'all. Hubris got the best of me after I posted how very much better I was feeling and I have been humblingly ill the past few days since then. My ear IS better, and the sinus pressure is much improved, so I think it's more that the original virus is taking its time fucking off and less that the antibiotics aren't doing their job. Usually by the time I go to the doctor much later in the process, I think the virus has run its course and the infection is all that ails me, but this time I was gun-shy enough about the ear that I still had some misery in store from the original virus when I went on antibiotics.*\u00a0 Hotter didn't catch this particular bug, which is somewhat miraculous given just how much swapping of fluids we did over the holiday weekend (the MFA Children flew to Yankee State with the XY for five days to visit family and Hotter and I had Wednesday through Monday footloose and child-free). I think he was feeling a little outshined by my spectacular phlegm production or something, though, because he has developed a new and unpleasant Mystery Malady of his own.*\u00a0 This is what's wrong with Hotter:\r\n Figure One: Back off, y'all, he's MINE!\u00a0\u00a0 It started as a blotch like this on the side of his neck, about the size of a saucer, and now there's one like a dinner-plate on his back and this one on his flank right around where one of his kidneys would be if he was a normal person (his native kidneys are dead and shriveled up and he has one good, donated one in his BELLY of all places). The initial blotch was just funny-looking for nearly a week, then felt like a bad sunburn, and now he says all of them hurt pretty badly, all the way down through the muscles, badly enough that he ASKED to go to the doctor yesterday (usually I have to drag him in with a pole-snare, more or less). The doctor was all \"Jesus, wow, what the crap is THAT?!?\" and said he'd never seen anything like it, and ran a CBC (which was normal except for slight anemia, which is actually a good thing given that Hotter has polycythemia) and a creatinine level (a bit lower than Hotter's last one, so also good), and sent blood off to test for Lyme Disease because Hotter (like 98% of the general population here) got bitten by a tick over the summer and dang if the spots don't all look like bullseyes. He said that if this IS Lyme it's a rather atypical presentation, but that's probably what I'll end up putting on Hotter's tombstone in fifty years so we all agreed it was worth checking. In the meantime Hotter is on some antibiotics just in case (since nobody likes infections in a transplant patient) and has some acetaminophen-free narcotic pain pills to take if he needs them (he said the pain if you touch one of the spots is an eight of ten and then declined when the doctor offered, but I overruled him and pointed out that if he didn't need them he didn't have to take them and the doctor sided with me--Hotter hates to take narcotics but last night did cave and take a half dose, so probably he was in agony).*\u00a0 The dog, at least, is muchmuch better. We didn't realize how much hair MFA Puppy was missing until she'd started treatment for the mange--it turns out her butt and underbelly aren't supposed to be bald, after all. Go figure. She's grown back nearly all of the hair on the affected area on her back and neck, and while Hotter and I can still see the spot on her head, the XY couldn't when he saw her last (we picked him and the MFA Children up from the airport and he gave us some gas money--why yes, that IS awfully grown-up and civil and I don't know what to make of it either but am just going to go with it), and to look at her now you'd never know the dog was in such a bad way just two weeks ago. She's also added \"shake\" to her repertoire of tricks and seems to pick up about one new command a day now (currently she knows come, sit, shake, drop it, and \"get in your crate\") and is shaping up to be quite a bright little dog! *\u00a0 So yes, hi, I'm boring and I think I'll go and take ANOTHER nap before the children get home from school because this summer cold is kicking my arse.

The symptoms are unchanged, except that now he says it itches a little in addition to hurting like a sumbitch. We have a call in to the Transplant team so that they can take a look next (the internist who saw Hotter kept mentioning that he just didn't know about \"all those weird drugs!\" and said he didn't want to send Hotter for a full dermatology work-up when this could be something Transplant sees all the time, which I guess is fair enough).*\u00a0 MFA Puppy went to the vet today for her first follow-up skin scraping:\r\n  Figure One: Isis was less than enthused when she realized that we were going into a treatment room instead of just stopping off to use the scale.\u00a0\u00a0 When we hoisted her up onto the exam table, she looked positively sad:\r\n  Figure Two: She drooped considerably the moment her paws hit the steel, and I don't think the rabies vaccine and skin scraping did much to brighten her day.\u00a0\u00a0 As unhappy as Isis was with our visit to the Banfield Pet Hospital today, the results were good! Her skin scraping from today was negative for demodex mites, and if her next one is negative, too, she'll be officially cured of the mange! Her next dip is Monday, then two weeks after that she'll have another, and then the next follow-up skin scraping after that will determine whether she's done in three dips.*\u00a0 The final negative was a bit less happy. This is the sign on the door of the room where my youngest child goes for his after-lunch tube-feeding every day (I asked that they not feed him in the clinic, as he's pretty susceptible to viruses and who wants to eat where they send the pukers and the nosebleeds?):\r\n Figure Three: MEDICAL PROCEDURE??? SERIOUSLY? I'm sorry, but once my kid can read I think that'll have certain...connotations.\u00a0\u00a0 When you go inside the room, this is what you see:\r\n  Figure Four: Yeah, another sign in case you missed the first one, and a pair of rubber gloves. Little Child has some VERY negative associations with gloved people, and looked pretty nervous today while I was talking the clinic aide through feeding him.\u00a0\u00a0 I am trying not to be a bitch about this, y'all, I am, but...gloves? For those of you who have never fed anyone through a g-tube, it is NOT a gory procedure. You don't touch any body fluids, there is no sterile field, and there's pretty much no reason to wear gloves while you do it. For all I know there is some procedural code in place that says they have to wear gloves to do this, but it seems like overkill and combined with the signs...well could they make my kid feel like any more of a freak, y'think? Maybe I'm being over-sensitive, I dunno. I am deliberately refraining from commenting on the signs because I'm aware that this might just be my \"stuff\" but what do YOU think? Would it be unreasonable to ask that the sign just say \"reserved?\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134871e9edb970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134872d1b5b970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134872d1f21970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134872d2926970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340134872d2c94970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/negatory.html", "title": "negatory"},
{"date": "September 13, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 First the good news! As I mentioned earlier, MFA Puppy went for her second Mitaban treatment today, and Hotter and I picked her up around 2:45. She is MUCH less affected by the dip than last time, thank goodness, and is probably functioning at a solid 85% so far (I say so far because it's just now getting fully dark, so we'll see if she's night-blind this time around although she's not uncoordinated or apathetic and is drinking normally so fingers crossed).\u00a0\u00a0 The bad news is that the small lump I noticed was in fact the beginning of another secondary bacterial skin infection, in the opinion of the veterinarian who saw Isis today. She said that unfortunately it seems that Isis is going to be one of those dogs who's just really prone to this, either due to strong genetic predisposition/a chronically weak immune system OR due to her rough start in life as an early weanling who arrived in our home very ill from a bacterial GI infection. Obviously we're hoping it's the latter, and that once the mange is long-gone Isis will stop getting skin infections, but either way this bought her another two-week course of a different antibiotic (the vet skipped the impression slide this time around since this presented exactly like the last infection and coincided with the cessation of the previous antibiotic, and I'm glad she spared us the lab charges and agree with her reasoning). Or rather, y'all did:\r\n  Figure One: Y'all did this . Thank you so much!\u00a0\u00a0 After her veterinary ordeal, Hotter and I (or, uh, the doggy tooth-fairy, since Isis lost a puppy-tooth last night) treated our pup to a nice smoked beef rib (they're under two bucks and provide three to four hours of solid happy gnawing time during which she's not looking for trouble or harassing whoever is cooking dinner). I think she forgives us for abandoning her at the pet hospital yet again:\r\n  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f42ec8e2970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f42ed181970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/an-update-on-mfa-puppys-health.html", "title": "an update on MFA Puppy's health"},

I have a job again! Whoo!).*\u00a0\u00a0 MFA Puppy is at the vet for her second Mitaban dip as we speak (thank y'all so much). I'm a nervous wreck and probably won't get much done until Hotter and I pick her up (hopefully in about two hours if all goes the same as it did last time). This stuff effed my poor dog up so badly last time...stupid demodex mites! Also she has one tiny little lump on her back that I asked the vet to look at; Isis took her last antibiotic tablet four days ago and I hope the skin infection isn't returning! I'll let y'all know what the vet says either way.*\u00a0\u00a0 The XY and I are having the dumbest fight we've had since the separation (although sadly it's far from the dumbest fight we've ever had). In a nutshell, he has wanted for years to pursue a career for Little Child as a child actor and I am against this, but lately he's really got a bug up his butt about it, and since I can no longer bring him back in line by threatening to withhold sex (seeing as how I've been doing that for two years and counting ANYWAY) he's not dropping it this time. I feel like Little Child has enough making him \"different\" with the g-tube and the stunted growth, and his brothers have enough reasons to feel resentful and/or like Little Child gets \"special treatment,\" and furthermore I can't think of a single child actor who went on to be a happy, sane, well-adjusted adult. When I said that to the XY he brought up Scott Baio, and the conversation went downhill from there (Google \"Scott Baio Twitter\" if you don't know what I'm talking about). At this point things have deteriorated to the point that I'm worried our newfound amicability is in grave danger, and I'm extra-stabby because really? We're not going to go to the mats over medicating anyone's ADHD, whether to send the boys to Hebrew school so that they can have bar mitzvahs, or the wisdom (or NOT) of putting the baby on growth hormones? We're going to go back to acrimonious hostility to the detriment of our childrens' mental health over whether to let Little Child become a white Webster? This is my life, y'all.

The Bloggess signing my boob, decorating dildoes at a sex-toy party, meeting Aunt Becky on the dance floor and getting a free We-Vibe from Sandy of Toy With Me (I heart their sex toy reviews and have been meaning to write one about that thing, but Hotter is scared of it and calls it the \"cootchie clamp\" so...yeah). Fabulous sessions, crazy parties, the madness that is Sparklecorn (this tweet pretty much sums it up). Losing my friends, my suitcase, my ID and my composure in Manhattan (I found the suitcase, by the way, which was pretty much a miracle, and TSA found my ID in my back pocket while searching me extra-close as an unidentified flier).\u00a0\u00a0 You know what stands out the most in my mind, though? The shuttle-ride to LaGuardia. I debated whether or not to even write about it, but I can't get it out of my head so I think I kind of have to. \u00a0\u00a0 When the Super Shuttle pulled up to take me to the airport, the driver took my suitcase and said \"I'm sorry but you gotta sit in the front.\" I climbed into the front passenger seat, turned to fasten my seatbelt, and found myself face-to-face with none other than Tanner Bawn. Yes, that Tanner. Catherine of Her Bad Mother, who I'd had the pleasure of meeting and talking with at some length during the conference, and Katie of Motherbumper, who I hadn't managed to actually connect with, were sitting in the far back with Tanner's mom, and Tanner's chair was secured in the middle of the shuttle, which put him right up behind me, so I said something silly like \"OH! You're TANNER! HI!\" \u00a0\u00a0 We talked the rest of the way to the airport, about a half-hour ride, about our pets (when I told Tanner I was allergic to cats, he looked at me with obvious pity and asked if I'd ever gotten to pet one and feel how soft they are), the kinds of houses we lived in versus the types of buildings around us, different forms of mass transit we'd ridden on, and license plates. We played the license plate game (Tanner has a keen eye and was able to spot plates from different states much faster than I was). He asked me if I had any kids, and whether they'd started school yet (kids in some parts of both our countries were going back to school that day, although Tanner and my own kids still had a few weeks of freedom left). I asked him if he was excited to be getting on a plane to fly home, and he said he was worried that his chair would get messed up again. I told him I didn't think so, that I was willing to bet the airline would be super extra-careful since they now knew that all of his aunt Catherine's friends would fuss at them if they weren't. At the airport, Tanner and I said goodbye and wished each other safe travels, and I've thought about him every day since then. \u00a0\u00a0 It's one thing to read about a kid like Tanner; of course you think \"wow, that poor kid\" and \"those assholes better fix that chair!\" But when you meet him, and he's every bit as sweet and goofy as your own nine-year-old at home, and likes the same things and kills time on a long car-ride the same way...well, damn. The idea that a kid like that could be dying just doesn't compute. \u00a0\u00a0 I don't know what I'm trying to say here. I don't know what to do with this memory of a shuttle-ride that keeps tapping me on the shoulder. I think I'll wear my tutu when I go running tonight, maybe, and hug my kids extra-close. But there you have it: my favorite celebrity sighting from BlogHer. Happy Friday, y'all.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://we-vibe.com/", "http://toywithme.com/", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/20604601373", "http://herbadmother.com/tanner/", "http://herbadmother.com/", "http://www.motherbumper.com/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10895108"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/the-long-overdue-blogher-wrap-up-post.html", "title": "the long overdue BlogHer wrap-up post"},

AND! If you make a purchase through there you are entered in a raffle for a $50 Pampered Chef gift certificate. BUT WAIT, if you go there and make a purchase and e-mail Hopeful Parents letting them know that you read about the fundraiser here (you will need to include my \"name,\" blog name, and e-mail address, a la \"I heard about this fundraiser from MFA Mama at www.mfamama.typepad.com and her e-mail address is mfamamablogATgmailDOTcom\" then we BOTH get entered in a raffle for a $50 Pampered Chef gift card. PLUS ALSO Pampered Chef products are fabulous.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 We here at Casa MFA regularly use a few Pampered Chef items that I've had for years and years since I was rich enough to buy such things; this is what I use to divide my dough when I'm baking bread (and scrape it off the table after kneading and during clean-up), this is an excellent scraper that is pretty hard to melt (not that I haven't tried) and as an added bonus, uh, a...friend...told me it makes a satisfying \"thwack\" if spanking is your thing (Disclaimer: I mean the kind of spanking that goes on between consenting adults when children are with their non-custodial parent. We do not spank children here), these are great for baking everything from pizza to cookies to oven fries and fish sticks on, and their knives really are all that and a bag of chips (I have a HUGE serrated one that is four years old, no longer appears to be for sale, and cuts tomatoes without denting the skin and hot bread without tearing the loaf apart; it's what I'd use if I ever had to perform a kitchen-table amputation).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 What, you never contemplated what your go-to blade for such things would be? I'm terribly sorry for your lack of imagination then!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 SO! The key points are:\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 MAKE SURE you go to HP and use the link FROM THEIR SITE to make any purchases to make sure they get credit. You'll also need to enter their organization name (\"Hopeful Parents\") in the box for that when you place your order.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Definitely e-mail HP (writehopefulparentsATgmailDOTcom) if you do buy something, and let them know you hear about the fundraiser from me (include my \"name,\" blog URL, and e-mail, which you can c&p above) so that we both get a raffle entry.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The last day to order and have 15% of the proceeds go to HP is December 14th, and FedEx will deliver on December 21st.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I am sick in the head. But if you're reading this, you already knew that.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 If you don't need any kitchen wares and want to purchase an organic, homemade gift for the health-nut or dog-lover in your life, I still have a few jars of MFOrganics sea salt scrub in each scent left and it's not too late to order :) Happy shopping!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/12/7/pampered-chef-giveaway.html", "http://www.pamperedchef.biz/denisemack?page=products-detail&categoryId=99&itemId=1615&productId=186", "http://www.pamperedchef.biz/denisemack?page=products-detail&categoryId=123&itemId=1703&productId=18905", "http://www.pamperedchef.biz/denisemack?page=products-detail&categoryId=9&itemId=1371&productId=16723", "www.mfamama.typepad.com/mforganics"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/12/if-youre-still-looking-for-a-gift-to-support-a-good-cause-but-dont-want-any-salt-scrub.html", "title": "If you're still looking for a gift to support a good cause but don't want any salt scrub..."},
{"date": "December  6, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 So we decorated the tree tonight. I try to avoid saying \"Christmas Tree\" and call it a Hannukah Bush or holiday tree. I encourage the children, if they prefer not to refer directly to Hannukah and \"out\" themselves as Jews to call things holiday decorations, holiday cookies, holiday presents, etc. After dinner, one MFA Child was being a knucklehead about getting his homework done, and we were waiting on that to begin decorating. Hotter (who for the record insists that he is not grouchy) got up from an after-dinner nap, waded into the fray of the other two children who were trying to badger me and get me to call it a Christmas tree like CATHERINE, and promptly tripped over a toy one of them had left on the floor for the umpteenth time this week. A child who was NOT the toy's owner immediately blamed the other non-owner of said toy, who after the actual toy-owner, also the homework-dawdler, came forward and apologized, said \"no that's okay if you're going to kill someone kill me, I'll just go to HEAVEN!\"\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I reminded the children that when they're adults they may believe whatever they want, but they are being raised Jewish, dadgum it, and then we decorated the tree and sent the kids to bed and I went through backpacks. The same child who volunteered to martyr himself (not that anyone was in danger of dying, which makes it that much more aggravating) had brought home some Thanksgiving-themed artwork from school, including a piece of lined paper with a turkey printed on it in which they'd listed things they were thankful for:\r\n Figure One: This is where my eyelid started twitching, for real.\u00a0 Figure Two: It was pretty much like this, except if I also knew how to use Photoshop and could Photoshop Jesus in there throwing lightning at the menorah like the emperor in Return of the Jedi. No, YOU have a blown-glass Yoda, Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and C3PO on YOUR motherfucking HANNUKAH BUSH and are motherfucking outraged!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 So I am going to take the nice gay couple with the Labradoodle from the dog park up on their offer to bring the boys to their Reform temple, because god dammit if people are going to insist on being religious around here they're going to be the religion of their forefathers. And I am not kidding. And I enjoy houses of worship early on a non-school morning about as much as I enjoy family court.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Lest ye think my mood could not get any worse, Hotter (when I told him what I intended to do) asked if he was going. I told him he didn't have to and he said no what I mean is would I be welcome and I said it's a reform temple that's cool with out and proud gay couples so I'm guessing an agnostic of Christian origin would be permitted to observe, although they might want him to wear a yarmulke, or maybe not, it'd been a while since I had dealings with the local Jewish community. He then proceeded to make a bad joke about the hats Orthodox men wear and speculated as to how long it would take him to grow sidelocks, and well lookathere.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I think I will have an adult beverage and watch something mindless on Hulu.

{"date": "December  8, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 When I first because friends with Hotter, I had a blog. I've had a blog for most of the time we've known each other (and we were friends for a couple of years before my separation from the XY, so we go back a ways). Hotter has always, always read my blog. I love that about him; he gets almost as much of a kick out of my blogging as I do. He'll be all \"remember, terri c. said...\" or \"are you facespace friends with the girl with the wonky uterus? Because I picture her a certain way, and...\" He'll torment me over typos, ask if I've checked recently for new comments, etc. and really the ONE thing he'd never done, EVER, is comment on a post via Typepad (he comments plenty on just about everything, mind you, just not online). Not as himself, not as his online alias he was using in the forum where we met, NEVER. And I've always been fine with that. I mean, I enjoy comments as much as the next blogger does, but I'd still write without them. Last night, however? Hotter decided to comment. Oh, Hotter.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 As big a pest as he is with his bat-themed midlife crisis, I still can't say how great Hotter is, y'all. After blowing off two or three colds in a row like a normal person with a hearty immune system (I credit giving up white sugar, going organic, and taking my vitamins and herbal supplement regularly, and also the Neti Pot) I have been felled--FELLED, LIKE A MIGHTY SEQUOIA--by what May would call a Cold of Filth. And it IS! So currently I'm sick, the kind of sick that makes you whimper as a grown-ass adult, and Hotter has tucked me in on the reclining couch with a blanket and a hot Bed Buddy. Everyone should have a Hotter, I tell you.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Isis is always hilarious, but this week she outdid herself. Behold, y'all!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I was just looking on my own blog to click and link that and I am mortified; I recently performed open-heart surgery on my blogroll, and I was a bit vexed at the time and appear to have eliminated Ann from the thing in the process. That was long enough ago though that if I were her and noticed I might've taken it personally. Probably she isn't petty like I am, but I'm sorry, Ann! I'm going to try and put you back in now!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Whee, decongestants. Maybe I'll become the fourth person in the house to convert after seeing Jesus on these things!* I'll keep you posted.\r\n\u00a0\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, I do have a sense of humor about the Jesus thing, finally. Last night Bumpus did a wee on the floor and I told Hotter we ought to wake Big Child up and tell him that since he loves Jesus so much we're sending Him Big Child's dog. *snort*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["www.ps121ismyfriend.blogspot.com", "http://nutsinmay.wordpress.com/", "http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?sku=10573050&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=shopping", "http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/12/four_year_olds_are_assholes.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2Fisis+%28Storytime+with+Dr.+Isis%29&utm_content=Google+Reader", "http://hairyfarmerfamily.co.uk/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/12/god-damn-batman.html", "title": "god damn, batman"},
{"date": "December  7, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 I don't think the MFA Children are the target of any particular evangelist...the older two went (over my objections) to church-based preschool programs (supposedly these were secular programs, but there were Christmas and Easter pageants) and honestly the single biggest thing turning them into little Jesus-puppets is Kennedy. Kennedy is not the real name of the kid who bullied Big Child for two years straight (first and second grades), but it's something equally last-namey and pretentious and KENNEDY wanted everyone to vote for John McCain and KENNEDY said if you don't believe in Jesus you'll go to hell and KENNEDY KENNEDY KENNEDY. I kind of want to track the little shit down and smack him. This started Big Child on the God thing, and Middly picked it up from him, and Little Child parrots everything they do. I've asked all sorts of questions and apparently this is just a) the fact that my kids are followers in general and b) peer pressure (they're in a 95% WASP school district).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Yoda appears to be about as happy with this entire Jesus debacle as I am:\r\n Figure One: So angry is he.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The dogs used a few moments of unattended freedom to eat the offending Jesus-turkey. GOOD DOGS! I didn't even have to smear it with peanut butter...\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter is having the weirdest midlife crisis ever. His reply to pretty much everything on the innernet (as those of you who are friends with him on the facespace will have noticed already) is \"I'm Batman.\" He even changed his facespace avatar to the bat-signal, prompting me to comment and assure everyone he wasn't doing that pointless \"end child abuse by changing your facespace avatar\" thing. No, he's just...very, very special...is all. Not that I can comment on this overly much, since my left lower eyelid has been twitching since the first Jesus-fit.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The Araucanas (well, one of them anyway) produced the first blue egg today!\r\n Figure Two: The egg at the top left (darker brown) is from George the ISA Brown. The other brown egg is from one of the Barred Plymouth Rocks, and the blue one is from one of the Araucanas! Great excitement here today!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I have a cold. Yes, another one. Damn it. I felt fine this morning, mucked the chicken coop and turned the compost this afternoon after rocking Hotter's world, and then all of a sudden right before dinner BOOM! Sick as a dog. My left ear hurts, and...well, damn it all to HELL.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Fortunately no one caused any trouble at the candle-lighting tonight, and with a little luck this should be our last one for the year (tomorrow is the last night of Hannukah, but the boys will be with their father at sunset).

{"date": "September 17, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Last night my ankle was killing me. I distracted myself with The Time Traveler's Wife. \u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, I was one of like, three literate people who hadn't read the book and it goes without saying I haven't seen the movie. Or maybe it doesn't. I don't yawp about it or anything, I'm not an evangelical boycotter of television and film but we don't have or want a t.v. and don't go to movies. We have before, I mean like, once, and once in a great while we'll watch something on DVD but a) I prefer the meaty printed word to the fluffy, non-nourishing cotton candy for the eyeballs that is most commercial news media and sponsored Hollywood films anymore and b) aside from the quality of such endeavors being driven down the long slide by sensationalism and aims toward corporate sponsorship and syndication, advertisements geared toward the general public make me foam at the mouth a LOT so it's just better that I occupy my time in other ways.\u00a0\u00a0 It'd gotten to the point where even though everybody and their dog said I needed to read The Time Traveler's Wife, to the point that I bought it when there was an attractive book sale going online, the combination of genuine busyness and oppositional \"if everyone likes it so much it's going to be crap, CRAP I SAY\" snobbery kept me from reading the bloody thing until finally a night where I was in enough pain that I knew I wouldn't be productive came along and I was badly in need of a mental escape and WOW.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the first time in AGES that I have read a work of fiction and not only been engaged and immersed in the work, but also been able to pick it apart at the seams and study the pattern, the craft, the work of it in a way that left me even more in awe than at first glance, AGES, by which I mean a decade or so. \u00a0\u00a0 It was as close to a religious experience as I get, y'all. And then a combination of FB-stalking a biological relative, ranting about same to Hotter, and a conversation with a new friend who suddenly seems a bit more like a muse made a cast of characters and interwoven plot lines come crashing down around me like cats and dogs in the proverbial rain storm. Ideas were landing on their feet unscathed and jumping at me with muddy paws, or yelping in agony as they hit the ground, a cacaphony of joyful, heart-rending inspiration, and I found myself playing fetch in the yard with the dog, because dogs give you a good beard if you really just want to talk to yourself out loud for a bit, muttering like an idiot until I had to come inside and sketch out a motherfucking outline.\u00a0\u00a0 This is going to be so much work. I'm so excited.\u00a0\u00a0 Now let us speak of it no more except possibly in vaguest terms. I know, I suck, but I'm not going to workshop this via blog. I may not even mention it again anytime in the next several years or possibly ever, but I thought those of you so inclined would prefer to be happy for me in the abstract and those of you who wish me no good might like to suck it because I am so damn happy it's revolting.

{"date": "September  4, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* Remember that ear infection I just got over? Yeah. Not so much, actually. Two weeks off antibiotics and one wretched summer cold courtesy of The XY via Big Child and it's back. Yesterday it would have been silly to go to the doctor because it was Just A Cold. Today? Kill. Me. Now. Earache. Sinus. Fuck.* I got a taste of today's pain and said fuck this action I am going to Patient First because this cannot ride out the holiday weekend. Please someone remind me how I love them next time I'm on the fence about medical treatment on a Friday. In and out in forty minutes with three prescriptions (antibiotic, antifungal for afterward, and Vicodin) and a referral to an adult ENT surgeon because \"it's got so much fluid that it might still burst in there, and it's not even THAT infected yet.\" Which? Boo. But still, pretty much exactly what I expected to hear and I was pleasantly surprised that the doctor referred to my previous chart with them, saw that I had checked \"coagulopathy\" in medical history, and said \"you want a script for pain? I see that you should stay away from NSAIDs but that ear looks excruciatingly painful?\" Also every single doctor at this particular Patient First is distinguished-looking, and reassuringly personable, like someone whose chest you could weep upon, and if I'm honest with you I love that shit when I'm this miserably ill. All for the same co-pay amount as seeing my PCP.* Also that doctor gave me the best advice EVER: he said to go and present my driver's license to get some real pseudoephedrine, get an actual neti pot (I generally just cheap out and use 60-cc syringe barrels and gravity), use it, and then use nasal decongestant in ONE nostril (and alternate them) and OH MY STINKING FUCK Y'ALL the relief, the sweet, sweet relief. It was like an enema for my sinuses and now I can actually BREATHE and I can tell that BOTH ears are now exquisitely painful but thanks to the Vicodin I don't so much CARE and hopefully by tomorrow the antibiotics will have taken effect.* This ear really has jumped the shark. What gives, Lefty? You've been fucked up since I started this blog, turning every virus into an ENT debacle, often involving multiple rounds of antibiotics. In fact, I think this is your eighth course of them in twelve months. Unacceptable!* So now money sucks again because two weeks of Levaquin plus paying toward my deductible for, I am guessing, a myringotomy on at least the left side sometime in the next few weeks equals FML, POVERTY but we've already paid the vet for the dog and we'll manage. It's always something, right? Wow, I am on a LOT of drugs. Haaaaaa...hegh.* At least the day before this virus felled me we took MFA Puppy out to have some real fun. In downtown MFAville there is an island in a river with a walking bridge one may cross with leashed pets to enjoy a large park full of wooded trails, boat ramps and natural and manmade steps to the water for swimming or kayaking, and a lot of historical ruins to explore. I know half of y'all only come here for the puppy, so here ya go... This is MFA Puppy on the bridge:\r\n \u00a0\u00a0 The only bad thing about the outing was that it was in the mid-nineties and MFA Puppy got very, very hot despite our bringing a covered dish to give her drinks out of and was starting to drag along and whine like she wanted to be carried. That would have been hard to do, as she's hit a MAJOR growth spurt since going into treatment for the mange (I think it was stressing her whole system, or maybe the infection was, but either way suddenly she's in MUCH better general health and spirits), so we walked out onto some flat rocks intending to sit down and let her rest. We had to carry her across a deep crevice over some little rapids and figured we'd let her off-leash on the large, flat rock at the other side as several other dog owners there had done with their four-legged friends. We figured she'd be scared of the river, but our panting pup promptly flopped down in the shallow water's edge to get some relief from the heat:\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0 After she'd cooled off a bit, MFA Puppy noticed that there were dogs chasing a stick as a pack, and stood up to watch them intently:\r\n \u00a0\u00a0 This nice man, who was wading and playing with his dogs, called to MFA Puppy and encouraged her to come out into the water, and she'd pretty much crawl through broken glass to greet a new person with licks and total-body wags so she very gingerly waded out further and then back in (you can see one of her new doggie friends keeping an eye on her with his owner):\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0 Once she saw that there were hundreds of tiny minnows darting around her ankles, MFA Puppy got braver and explored the shallows with her new pals (they also did quite a bit of leaping from rock to rock chasing each other and deeper-water swimming, but I was too busy keeping an eye on MFA Puppy and exclaiming over her daredevil plunges and feats of agility with Hotter to take pictures of that):\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0 When MFA Puppy started getting a little too brave for our comfort (she tried to follow some labradors out into the strong current) Hotter and I clipped the leash back on, and finished our walk with her much happier for having cooled off a bit. She got a second wind afterward that lasted until we got into the MFA Minivan, where she used the hiking backpack, which we'd stashed between our seats, as a pillow and napped all the way home:\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0 As you can see, the antibiotics, Ivermectin, and various nutritional supplements we're giving MFA Puppy on top of her high-quality meat-based kibble to help her skin and coat recover and bolster her immune system (Brewer's Yeast and Garlic tabs, Omega-3 rich salmon oil, and Pettabs Plus) are working well and unless I get the \"bad\" side of her profile (or any shot at all of the base of her neck and top of her back) in excellent light like this you can't even see anything wrong with her (and the hairless spots are way better-looking than the swollen abscesses and pustules were!):\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0 Here's a shot of her \"good\" side, that also shows you the super-cool color her eyes are right now. We're rather hoping they'll stay like this (what a pretty girl!):\r\n  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3c4ca2d970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3c4d55f970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013486e71cb0970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3c4ef33970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3c5003b970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3c512d0970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013486e76ccd970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133f3c53b71970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/im-way-sick-and-also-here-are-some-pictures-of-the-dog-from-before-that-happened.html", "title": "I'm way sick and also here are some pictures of the dog from before that happened"},
{"date": "September 16, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Parenting causes you to utter a lot of odd-sounding things in the heat of the moment. For example, I went on a rampage yesterday while the MFA Children were at dinner visitation with their father.\u00a0\u00a0 See, Hotter and I had sent off for Bend it Like Beckham from Netflix (he'd never seen it, and we both have a thing for Parminder Nagra, so...), and planned to watch it on the flatscreen in the family room, but when we went in there there was nowhere to sit. The entire wonderful leather couch was covered with DVDs, video games, Mr. Potato Head parts, army men, dirty socks, missing permission slips, matchbox cars, and Harry Potter books.\u00a0\u00a0 This makes me lose my junk and get the crazy eye. Not only because if this crap punctures my couch I will foam at the mouth, but also because as many times as Hotter and I clean that damned room up, confiscate all games and DVDs and make the children earn them back one by one, make chore charts and award gold stars, and mutter about infanticide, this still keeps happening and DOES NO ONE LISTEN WHEN I TALK???\u00a0\u00a0 So this time rather than cleaning it up for them, I just swept all of the junk onto the floor, where it formed a noble heap. One by one the MFA Children discovered their possessions on the floor upon returning home and lost their junk. Why were their treasured possessions on the FLOOR? Had I been careful not to break x? What about y? WHERE WAS Z??? I explained that if they were going to show so little regard for my couch I was done showing so much regard for their crap.\u00a0\u00a0 All three children gasped and stared at me, jaws agape. See, I don't curse in front of the children (ever) unless it's Festivus, and I count everything from fart on up to fuck as a curse-word, including crap. So that really got their attention. \"THAT'S RIGHT,\" I ranted, \"THERE IS A NEW RULE IN THIS HOUSE! NO CRAP-HEAPS ON THE LEATHER COUCH! NO CRAP-HEAPS, PERIOD. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START PUTTING THEIR CRAP AWAY OR NEXT TIME IT IS GOING IN THE TRASH. I AM GOING TO MAKE A SIGN WITH A DRAWING OF YOUR CRAP AND A RED CIRCLE AROUND IT WITH A LINE THROUGH IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND???\" Four heads nodded (because when I get the Crazy Eye like that Hotter toes the line, too), and Big Child had the presence of mind to stammer \"y-yes, ma'am!\"\u00a0\u00a0 That sterling example of my parenting skills occurred yesterday, and today the MFA Children came home from school and (this is my conjecture; I wasn't actually watching this as I was lying down with a bag of frozen corn on my ankle*) decanted their backpacks onto the couch in the living room (which is not leather but microfiber, but is less than a year old and also emphatically NOT where crap belongs), then garnished it with their hoodies and some random household items, so that when I hobbled out there was nowhere to sit.\u00a0\u00a0 \"EVERYONE GET YOUR CRAP OFF THE COUCH OR IT IS GOING IN THE TRASH! THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING. FROM NOW ON I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS, IF IT'S ON A COUCH IN THIS HOUSE IT GOES IN THE TRASH!\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"You can't frow dose papers away, dose are for school!\" Middle Child protested.\u00a0\u00a0 \"OH YES I CAN! IF IT'S ON THE COUCH, IT GOES IN THE TRASH, EVEN PAPERS, BECAUSE IF IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT IT WOULDN'T BE LYING ON THE COUCH LIKE A PIECE OF CRAP!\"\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child, who has a death wish promising future in litigation or philosophy or something else having to do with ethics or lack thereof, said \"oh really? What if it was the original draft of the Declaration of Independence?\" \u00a0\u00a0 \"IF THE FOUNDING FATHERS CAME TO THIS HOUSE AND LEFT IT ON THAT COUCH, THAT WOULD GO IN THE TRASH, TOO!\" I roared. Hotter did his part (which at times like this is to stand beside me with his arms crossed and nod agreement when the children look to him as if he ought to step in and have me committed, either because he agrees wholeheartedly or because he's just glad it's not him getting the Crazy Eye) and added \"and the consequent lawlessness would be the fault of people not respecting the couch, not your mother!\"*\u00a0\u00a0 If you follow me on the Twitter you're already aware that I sprained my ankle this morning. It still hurts a lot, and did very little to improve my opinion of my childrens' merit as housemates here at Casa MFA.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/24680593235"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/09/and-the-consequent-lawlessness-would-be-the-fault-of-people-not-respecting-the-couch-not-your-mother.html", "title": "and the consequent lawlessness would be the fault of people not respecting the couch, not your mother"},

{"date": "November  6, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to do that thing I do where I talk about pleasant things that aren't necessarily at the very forefront of my mind, but are nicer for me to think about and y'all to hear about than the things that are.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 MFA Puppy continues to do very well, considering what she's been through. She's off the steroids now (after tapering down carefully--I weaned her in smaller increments than the vet had even suggested because I KNOW how awful steroid-withdrawal is for the mind and body) (although to be clear, I ran my plan by the vet first and he was okay with it--I would never just go off half-cocked with prescription medications, even with the dog) and we have to take her for a follow-up skin scraping this coming week. I won't lie, I'm pretty scared that it'll show she's relapsed again (between the stress of her recent immune/autoimmune crisis and the immune-suppression from the steroids). Not only is that not something we're financially prepared for at the moment (thank y'all SO much for your donations--I used them to cover some of the household expenses I had postponed paying/neglected to pay, such as the power bill, in order to get Isis the veterinary treatment she needed emergently; I hope that's okay with everyone who chipped in), but it would also suck in that I'm sure all of these heavy-duty drugs and treatments aren't the best thing for a growing puppy. Like the rest of us here at Casa MFA, Isis could use a break, and it would be so great if she could just be a normal dog without one or more daily prescription medications for a while!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Getting around to the title of the post, for those of you who aren't aware B.A.R.F. is an acronym that stands for \"biologically-appropriate raw foods.\" It's a diet some of the more \"extreme\" dog people (and some cat people, too, apparently) choose for their pets where you try to provide the types of foods they would ingest \"in the wild.\" On one hand, it's supposed to be a lot easier for animals' bodies to digest and healthier for their teeth. On the other hand, it's expensive, messy, and kind of a pain in the arse (plus domestic dogs are man-made creatures who haven't lived \"in the wild\" for maaaany generations). We've heard from many people (including some of y'all) that it's the best thing for dogs with allergies and other health problems, and a lot of pitbull owners really swear by it for helping to prevent a lot of the skin and joint problems the breed (particularly \"bluenose pitbulls\" like Isis) is prone to.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 When we bought a whole deer, we couldn't help but notice, though, that the price of the processed meat (per pound) wasn't that much more than the very high-end dogfood we feed Isis at her vet's recommendation, which got me thinking...the fruit and vegetable components of a typical B.A.R.F. diet can come (at least in part) from what you'd normally throw out in cooking (things like smaller broccoli stalks, eyes of potatoes, soft berries and discolored apple bits), and the meat you feed (including skin, organs, and raw bones from chicken, etc.) is often stuff you'd discard as well (the venison is great but you actually need to provide some bones and fattier meats as part of the diet ideally--we'll probably use a lot of venison but also include other things when they're on sale or going to waste otherwisea). In our house, the fruit and vegetable waste goes to the chickens, but I generally have more than they'll eat since I do a lot of canning and baking, plus eggs (and even egg shells) are included in the B.A.R.F. diet as well (and we have plenty of THOSE--today was our first five-egg day!). So when you look at it that way, the cost of feeding OUR dog the B.A.R.F. diet is about equal with the cost of what we've been feeding her already (maybe a little cheaper, even, given that we grow our own veggies and have eggs from our chickens), and since Hotter is a chef who can't work due to his disabilities and I work from home and don't mind getting my hands dirty it's no real hardship on us to prepare special meals for our dog. If we didn't have chickens, and cook everything from scratch, and have access to affordable venison and plenty of time to kill plus the skills we have, I would NEVER consider feeding Isis the B.A.R.F. diet (and please don't think I'm being all superior and judgy if you don't use it for your pets!), but, well...she's already pretty high maintenance and if it can help her be healthier then Hotter and I decided it's worth a try (we're also going to see if our Mennonite butcher friend might be willing to sell us some deer livers, kidneys, hearts etc. on the cheap). We'll still keep the Blue Buffalo on-hand for convenience if we're really busy and for when we're traveling, but other than that we'll do B.A.R.F. meals for Isis.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Isis had her first B.A.R.F. meal today for lunch. Here's what she ate:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 half a pound of raw ground venison \u00a0\u00a0 about four ounces of chopped apple I pared off the cores from the organic apples I am making into applesauce today\u00a0\u00a0 two large organic raspberries\u00a0\u00a0 two raw egg yolks from the MFA Flock\u00a0\u00a0 one ground eggshell (for calcium)\u00a0\u00a0 a tablespoon of flaxseed meal\u00a0\u00a0 a tablespoon of plain, organic yogurt from the hippie food coop\u00a0\u00a0 two minced cloves of garlic\u00a0\u00a0 a teaspoon of Brewer's Yeast\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I was expecting it to be a lot grosser (totally a word), but honestly after I'd mixed everything up Hotter and I looked into the bowl and agreed that it didn't look half-bad. Isis (who'd been watching me mix the food up and already gotten excited when she saw the meat go into her dish) wolfed it down with evident relish and polished her bowl.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 So yeah, my dog eats B.A.R.F. Heh!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bluebuffalo.com/products/dogs/lp-adult-lamb.shtml"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/11/barf-an-isis-update.html", "title": "B.A.R.F.

{"date": "January  7, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter is tired; we've both been having trouble sleeping and he's been instrumental in getting the boys up and dressed and out the door (I at least manage breakfast, hobbling around like an old lady while my morning stiffness dissipates) so he deserves a rest. In our bed. Where my laptop (which he calls \"the faptop\") also lies, and well, crap.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I know each other's system passwords and have implicit blanket permission to commandeer major technology.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It still feels wrong using his ginormous computer.

Not because I do not love you but because short of photographing the thing myself and adding circles and arrows and explanations...well. Instead please accept by way of explanation this picture of a very fancy vehicle that Hotter and I observed one time on the way to the hippie food coop:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 [COMING SOON: picture of hoopty with obvious after-market modifications--if you'd ever seen his ex-wife's fake tits it would allll make sense]*\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It's like that, y'all.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, he's sleeping, and as I've already timed the heart-shaped quiche to come out of the convection oven five minutes before his meds are due, I'm puttering around on Hotter's computer. I have half a mind to do a weekly \"pinup from Hotter's desktop\" feature, y'all, truly. He has much better taste in porn than I do (technically: see, I do not seek out or particularly find titillating MOST porn at all--he on the other hand seeks out tasteful and artistically meritorious renderings of the female form that...well anyway I have NO taste for or therefore IN porn and he wins).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 You know you're in love, y'all, in this age of social media, when you do this stuff withOUT the ability to show Twitter** or the facespace.

No fever or other symptoms (I'm a little achy in the coughing muscles but it's not like a flu-ish bodyache) but I'm exceedingly annoyed because I don't like to spend this much of my time coughing and my expiratory wheeze/\"squawking\") is keeping me up at night (sweartogawd last night it randomly sounded, at various times, like a ship creaking, someone shouting for help outside, a kazoo, and a newborn crying). I think Hotter thought I was hallucinating or something when I kept tossing and mumbling, then I made him put his ear against my chest and now I think he just thinks my chest is haunted.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Tomorrow it's back to the grind, and while there is SOME excitement involved (I'm changing the formula by which I create copy for my main freelance client to reflect changes in way the industry has started to deliver its main product to end-users, which dear god I just read that back over and could I BE any more vague and boring? Still, it's exciting), overall I'm not ready for the holiday break to be over with. I get to usher in a new level of involvement in social media on behalf of the client and that's kind of...well. Anyway, it's SOMEthing. And by something I mean \"something I'm pretty stoked about overall but would rather not have to do just yet, DAMN IT, because I had planned to return to work HEALTHY and RARING TO GO.\"\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I think Jessica hit the reason I was so flabbergasted about the bagel thing neatly on the head in her comment.  Hotter is TOTALLY your typical, average guy in a lot of ways, including  not knowing that there's a boiling step involved in baking bagels. This  screws with my head because I expect better of him--he's my soulmate! A  chef! He knows the female anatomy better than I do! He's not allowed to  not know things like how you have to BOIL effing bagels. But then, if  not knowing about boiling bagels helps him retain the knowledge of how  to do that thing with his thumb...\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 This coming Tuesday is Hotter's and my first anniversary. Which: already? Really? It both feels like we've always been together and seems like it can't possibly have been a year yet. Aww.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Poe remains at large, and likely we won't know what became of him one way or another until Spring (when we either discover him alive or smell something), if at all. This does make laundry, searching under beds, and \"name that sound in the night\" more stimulating for the entire family but I'd rather we located the fucker.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I have been having a lot more success in being at peace with the XY since I started using Irretrievably Broken's mantra. She should seriously write a book because changing that one thing (thinking of the XY as an au pair rather than the children's other parent) has saved me SO many conniptions since I read her post...). The au pair is late to take the children to\u00a0dinner again, but he also works fulltime and Hotter and I do SO enjoy our date nights...the au pair was humping his girlfriend on the couch and a child walked in, but well, what do you expect...I wouldn't hire this au pair again if I had it all to do over again, but for as long as he's been with my children and as little as I pay him (nothing), well...you get the picture. If you have an ex-spouse whose inability to remember what age of child needs a carseat and who's allergic to what antibiotic makes you killy, I wholeheartedly suggest that you try this.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 No-bake cookies. y'all! I keep ranting on the Twitter and y'all keep asking me for a recipe, but...well, here's how I cook. I started with this and halved it, because damn that's a lot of no-bake cookies (also I skip the boiling part). Then I used dark chocolate peanut butter instead of regular, halved the sugar, omitted the milk, and used a teeeensy extra bit of peanut butter (plus approximately 1.5 times the rolled oats called for). So um, no recipe, really, I guess, just go into your kitchen and start throwing things into a bowl like a maniac. I made more of these last night but cut the sugar by a further half and used vanilla sugar, and subbed\u00a0 sweetened coconut flakes for half the oats and they were delicious.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Ugh.

OH NOES I HOPE TEH SHOTS DON'T GIB DE BABY AUTISM!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 No, the XY's hypothetical imaginary attorney wasn't rushing to Little Child's defense against the school's clearly discriminatory actions toward the poor kid, they were (allegedly) getting ready to have me declared unfit because WHY WOULD THE SCHOOL EVER LIE, YOU ARE JUST NEGLIGENT OR ELSE HONESTLY MISTAKEN BUT HOPELESSLY STUPID. Oh yes. THIS is why acrimonious relations with an ex-spouse are kryptonite to super co-parenting; of course the school isn't going to cop to rounding up the gimps and sending them all home en masse, and even though the relevant (common to both parties) child was ONE of those gimps someone decides to get nasty and side WITH the school because the school sides AGAINST the other ex-spouse and screw the kid's education and feelings. THIS is why you need to grow the hell up in a hurry if you are a parent going through a divorce (assuming you didn't at the appropriate point upon becoming a parent already), people of the innernet. Because if you don't your kid loses, no matter how hard their other parent tries to fight for them. Of course, if you're the type to let school district beaurocracy trample all over the civil rights and fragile self-esteem of a five-year-old with special needs just to be a petty cocknozzle, you probably don't care. BUT I DO.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Good things, good things...OHYES! Guess. WHAT! Little Child is ON THE GROWTH CHARTS FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE BIRTH!!! YEAH BABY!!! Today we savored the heady bouquet of the FIFTH PERCENTILE, PEOPLE! And he's in the fifteenth for weight, and HE'S NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT ANEMIC, HIS H&H WERE TEXTBOOK PICTURE-PERFECT! I...I am all verklempt, y'all, I mean I knew he was doing really well but I didn't realize he'd turned the tide like this, because see, there's something I haven't really been sharing with you because we've been holding our breath about it but Little Child passed dairy and soy challenges with flying colors and has had NO food restrictions since his visit with the GI specialist late this past summer. That was a sign that while he may not (for whatever reason) be able to consume or adequately process a normal diet, perhaps the allergy component of whatever was inflaming his gut had resolved. BUT HE HAS STARTED GROWING ALL BY HIMSELF WITHOUT GROWTH HORMONE SUPPLEMENTATION OR ANY OTHER EXTRAORDINARY EXTERNAL VARIABLES AND HE'S NOT ANEMIC AND OH MAN OH MAN MAYBE HE REALLY WILL STILL OUTGROW WHAT AILS HIM COMPLETELY AND BE OKAY!!! I am not entirely sure I'll believe it just yet but for the first time EVER all signs seem to point toward rather than away from that possible outcome, and for that alone even if it changes I'll always be grateful. I'm so thrilled, and neurotic, and thrilled...there just aren't any words for it. Our pediatrician and I just stood together and exclaimed over how fabulous Little Child was for a solid five minutes saying nothing but \"I mean...LOOK AT HIM!\" and \"I KNOW!!!\" \"This is...\" \"MAYBE! I MEAN WHY NOT! I MEAN...WELL, LOOK AT HIM!\" Then we both pretended we had something in our eye.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I have more to say, but I don't have the heart to follow that up with a boo because really, the bad will work itself out or at least be over at some point.

he isn't aggressive or anything, and I doubt he can even open his mouth wide enough to bite anybody, he's just terrified of pretty much everything.\u00a0 You would be too if you were the size of a #2 pencil and had \"non-functioning eyes.\"\u00a0 I'm just saying, I don't blame him for being afraid but there is one thing he apparently likes: diamonds.\u00a0 See?\r\n\r\n  Figure One: Yeah, I anonymized the ring.\u00a0 It's gorgeous, though.\u00a0 Very flashy.\u00a0\u00a0 This led Hotter to some speculation about Underdog's sexuality (which incidentally we have no idea what sex either of the snakes are, they're just kind of male by default because, well, snakes).\u00a0 Then we got Poe, and then we got Poe Balzac, and the only logical explanation (per Hotter) for a nearly four-foot rat snake allowing a mouse to teabag him repeatedly is that Poe is a little light in the loafers (actually he prefers Mary Janes; when Poe escaped from his feeding cage I found him wrapped around a pair of high-heeled Mary Janes in the front closet, which did absolutely nothing toward ending Hotter's assertions as to Poe's homosexuality).\u00a0\u00a0 Now we've got the chickens, and innernet research leads me to believe that one of them might be a cock.\u00a0 Which would be bad news because you can't have a cock in the suburbs.\u00a0 I mean, I don't think there're any regulations since we're zoned agricultural here but the neighbors would come after us with pitchforks and torches, and anyway we paid for six FEMALE chickens and we want laying hens.\u00a0 We do not want a cock (although this entire chicken-sex debacle will have been worthwhile if even ONE MFA Child goes to school and tells their teacher that Mommy has discovered through looking at pictures online that she has a cock and is very upset about the whole thing).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"It's not a cock,\" Hotter said, after squinting obligingly at the chick in question's leg color and head-spot size.\u00a0 \"Blondie's just maybe a little bit butch is all.*\"\u00a0 Then today our coop arrived via FedEx Ground and Hotter said something about painting a rainbow on the side.\u00a0 \"Why,\" I asked, \"the chickens aren't--oh wait, it is kind of a wee little prison, isn't it?\"\u00a0 \"EXACTLY,\" said Hotter, \"a wee little women's prison.\u00a0 That burly-assed spider you killed last night was probably the last hetero in existence at our house.\u00a0 Way to go.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Except the problem with that is that if the chickens are gay they might all die.\u00a0 Because pardon my bluntness here but I can't imagine anything surviving cunnilingus from a chicken.\u00a0 So yes, we may have a problem.*\u00a0\u00a0 We have names!\u00a0 Because I know you were dying to know, Blondie is the biggest and most aggressive one who has a \"blonde\" head (which the innernet tells me just SCREAMS \"cock\"), Cognito is the other big one, whose name came from jokes about an incognito worm that she found hiding in the bedding, the one with the cross on her head is Donkey (because all donkeys have a cross on their withers and we enjoy Shrek quite a bit here), the one with the stripe on its head is Stripe (who initially appeared to be the leader; we also enjoy Gremlins), the one with the wee little speck on its head is Speck (also the smallest), and the last one is Geronimo (who prefers not to be held, thankyouverymuch, and will leap from great heights if you're not careful).\u00a0 See?\r\n  Figure Two: The pink athletic tape is what I use on my splint-y shins when I run, and is holding a piece of window screen in place through which the heater warms the chicks' Rubbermaid-tub temporary home.\u00a0 Also I'm hoping it reminds them all to be girls.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.debontherocks.com/?page_id=528", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_snake", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133ee2703cf970b-pi", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/14261819258", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/14428763029", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/14428914293", "http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama/status/14428914293", "http://www.markhawthorne.net/CrossDonkey.jpg", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340133ee271c99970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/05/the-mfa-gay-problem.html", "title": "the MFA gay problem"},

My outrage reached such epic proportions that rather than comment I grabbed my car keys and went OUT.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The XY picked that time to call and make it clear that his new leaf turned back over and decomposed into something smelling a lot like the manure tea I used last week on the winter garden.

Stepping into their cheery little facility was like going a hundred years and a thousand miles away from all of the things making me want to stab people. I dare you--I DOUBLE-DOG DARE YOU--to be grouchy when you're surrounded by plump, cheerful teenage girls with braids to their waists gossiping around meat counters while they make summer sausage.

I bought three jars of local wild berry jams and left smiling.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 In the hall on the way out there was a wall of morally-instructive pamphlets. Because no one was looking, I took one of each for the kitsch value (they're FABULOUS--fire and brimstone!).

Either our buck was enormous and had some extra limbs or our butcher threw in some extras. The second option seems more likely and I'm OKAY WITH THAT. All of that meat only set us back eighty dollars for the processing. YES!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I have chili on that smells FANTASTIC and I'll be canning for the rest of the day.

{"date": "May 25, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Getting the older two MFA Children off to the schoolbus stop of a morning is quite the production.\u00a0 Generally they wake up on their own at the arse-crack of dawn, and the rule here is that you may play video games until the parental alarm goes off UNLESS there is a dispute that awakens an adult before the alarm (in which case you are In Trouble).\u00a0 After Hotter and I are up, we throw some breakfast on the table, harangue the older children to EAT EAT EAT, and lay their clothes out.\u00a0 Big Child dresses himself, but Middle Child, who is pushing six...well, he can dress himself, but it's what his IEP terms an \"emerging skill\" and if we're short on time one of us has to help him while the other prepares and packs snack.\u00a0\u00a0 Helping Middle Child get dressed isn't always as simple as holding his pants out for him to step into and plopping a shirt over his head for him to stick his arms into.\u00a0 Some days it's like that, but others he's spacey and weird, stimming and distracted, and he has poor \"motor-planning\" skills and \"executive functioning\" ability on a good day, which means that not only will he not dress himself, if he's in one of his moods, he won't even help.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When I say \"won't even help,\" I mean that he will not pick his foot up to step into a pair of pants, and when you go to lift his foot and guide it into a pants-leg for him, he won't bend his knee (you kind of have to push at the back of his knee as you lift his ankle, and some days he won't compensate by balancing on his other leg or even necessarily reach out and hold onto your shoulder--some days he'll grab your hair or your face, and others he'll just topple over and yell at you afterward) or point his toes to get his foot through the pants-leg either.\u00a0 He won't put his arms into his shirtsleeves or even lift them; you have to reach through the sleeve with one hand, shove his wrist up under the shirt with the other, and pull it through.\u00a0 It's kind of like dressing an alternately rigid and noodle-floppy mannequin when he's spacing like that, and because all of my kids have hypermobile joints you also have to be careful not to hyperextend anything or bend it backward as you manipulate Middly into his clothing if he's having a noodle day; it's like he's neurologically impaired (okay, I guess it's not like that so much as that he is neurologically impaired, except that if he's focusing well he is capable of doing better, so I don't know) or has never worn clothes before.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 And yet comprehensive testing reveals that Middle Child's cognitive abilities are in the gifted range.\u00a0 Bygones.\u00a0 Einstein couldn't tie his own shoes.\u00a0\u00a0 This morning Hotter was struggling to get Middle Child dressed, and Middle Child was being exceedingly unhelpful, and Big Child has standardized testing this week and was perseverating on how much trouble he'd be in if he missed the bus and was late, and after I finished bagging and packing the childrens' snacks I went over to help Hotter, who was clearly growing frustrated, with Middle Child, who was...I don't want to say \"refusing\" because that makes it sound like brattiness as opposed to a feature of a developmental disability, and \"failing\" makes it sound critical, let's just say...\"abstaining from\" participation.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The kid wasn't lifting his feet today and it was one minute until time for him to leave for the bus stop.\u00a0\u00a0 Since Hotter had already gotten the pants into position, I grabbed Middle Child under his arms and lifted him up to allow Hotter to slip the pants over Middly's feet, and Middly had been staring into space and was surprised by this.\u00a0 So he exclaimed what I exclaim when I'm rendered otherwise speechless by something awful or frustrating or awfully frustrating, what slips out of my mouth when one of my children has harmed another, or someone has crapped their pants in public, or blurted out a Very Inappropriate Question in mixed company; in other words, he parroted the absolute worst thing I ever say in front of my children, what he hears me say perhaps once or twice a month when I'm at the very end of my rope:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"JESUS CHRIST!\"\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter gazed first at Middle Child and then at me with something akin to horror (he later told me he thought I'd lose my junk on the kid for busting out with the JC; for all that I talk big smack on the innernets I raise my kids G-rated and they aren't even allowed to say \"fart\" or \"crap\" or \"dang\" unless it's Festivus, and while we are not Christian here, or any other religion, my kids also aren't allowed to use any deity-based expletives because I don't want them offending anyone), then when I collapsed laughing he joined me (so did Middle Child).\u00a0 When I could speak again and was past any danger of peeing myself (three kids, y'all) I informed Middle Child that while we were laughing because we hadn't expected him to say that, it wasn't something he ought to say at school, and then we stuffed him into his pants and sent the children out the door.\u00a0\u00a0 I guess I ought to stop saying Jesus Christ, too, but JESUS CHRIST that was funny!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/05/well-he-could-have-said-worse.html", "title": "well, he could have said worse..."},
{"date": "December  1, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 I read a post by someone extolling the virtues of Swagbucks and decided to give it a try. I'm not like, SUGGESTING it to anyone just yet (although that link would purportedly give me some kind of referral-credit-thingy if you signed up through it, in the name of disclosure) because I don't know if it sucks or not. I'll let y'all know (I'm still in mourning over the demise of Bing; I love me some e-Bates but they don't fill the hole in my heart).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I officially have the cold that's been working its way through the house and am not at all pleased with it. Hotter's getting better though, so that's a relief (even though he annoying shakes these things faster than anyone else in the house, technically there IS the whole organ transplant recipient thing, and so I worry, although if this is him with a weakened immune system then probably he could eat the flu and crap a cure before his transplants, just sayin).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Once again all hail the g-tube. Little Child was snoring so loudly last night that Hotter and I bounded out of bed and ran to check on the dogs in their crate, convinced that someone was either puking or gnawing their way out. No, it was the five-year-old. SNORING. He's already had his adenoids out and this is probably just a cold, so I gave him some OTC decongestant (cheap store-brand, with dye in--this \"no dietary restrictions, passed all food challenges, gastroparesis less severe than in previous winters\" thing NEVER GETS OLD) and didn't have to wake him up to do it. Not that I'm suggesting you demand a g-tube for your perfectly healthy child or anything, but since my kid needs one anyway this is a definite perk.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Today I'm supposed to find out just how badly Things Unbloggable will suck in the months to come. One benefit of being on my deathbed with this wretched cold is that I keep forgetting to worry about that. Win?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm choosing to be grateful to our frienemy Stalky McPsychopants for reminding me that the walllls have eaarrrrs. Because I might have been tempted to share some of The Unbloggable above with y'all without Stalky's reminder that despite the innernet being filled with more good than bad, especially in MY opinion (I mean, I met Hotter via the innernet, after all), there's still the odd wackaloon out there squeezing their poodle, eating their Lean Cuisine, stroking their sense of superiority through their panties with the salad tongs and fantasizing about a Mommyblogger suit made of REAL MOMMYBLOGGERS. The Unbloggable isn't even all that interesting, so don't feel like you're missing out or anything.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Temerity Jane is always funny, but this? Specifically the third item on her list? YES! I'd even go so far as to say that, as with masturbation, there are generally two kinds of people in regards to drama: those who love it and those who lie about loving it. Case in point, Sitemeter says you're ALL going to the hot place (I got more unique visitors yesterday than I generally do in a week, which was part of why I took that shit down; I don't want anyone's first impression of me to be the worst I've probably put out here in a year).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Have y'all seen this dude's blog? Charlie's pretty awesome. Y'all know I'm a sucker for a man who cooks, but he's also hilarious. Plus I hear his girlfriend's kind of a big deal, although being half-dead and on a lot of cold medicine, I was halfway through his archives before I connected the dots. Hotter and I both got some good laughs out of the way he turns a phrase in describing certain aspects of cooking, plus he mentioned by name the big, canonical, pretentious French cookbook that lives on Hotter's desk so I think my personal chef has a little mancrush. Hee!\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 I just discovered that my oldest? Is freaking hilarious. I mean, I kind of knew this, but...he wrote this Thanksgiving survival guide geared toward a target audience of TURKEYS...Hotter and I were crying, we were laughing so hard. I need to either figure out how to connect my old print/copy/scan/fax doohickey to the laptop or take pictures. It's THAT FUNNY.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of funny, I have some HILARIOUS friends, particularly him and her.

Not that any of y'all who are likely reading this asked, but if the \"anonymous\" stalker would kindly post their name and address in the comments I will happily send them the following to prove I'm legit (the rest of you may take my word for it, or not--up to you):\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of my Middle Child's IEP, since they (disturbingly) know my kid's name and where he goes to school anyway. The official conditions listed as the reason for the IEP are PDD-NOS (one of the five pervasive developmental delays collectively referred to by most folks as autism), ADHD, and a connective tissue disease under \"other, medical.\" Yes, he's mainstreamed, and I'm proud as hell of that. Did you honestly think they still just chucked all of the kids with special needs in a \"resource-room\" holding tank together?\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of my W-2's, with my employers' information redacted to prevent further harassment (yes, Virginia, I have a job/jobs, but I'm deliberately vague about what I do and for whom online because a very few people on the innernet are assholes who like to try and screw with my life).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of my final decree of divorce to prove that my child support amount has remained unchanged since the date of my separation from my ex-husband (Stalky McPsychopants WAS correct in that my income from the XY has changed, because I stopped receiving spousal support when I remarried, as is pretty much standard--as with a lot of things they've said about me they clearly know more about me than anyone that insane really ought to, and are sorta-almost-if-you-squint right, but not quite, I mean they got my NAME 1/3 wrong, FFS, and know jack-all about my life from the date I cut them out of the e-mail updates I used to send to a few friends before reopening this blog) (also, wow, what a crappy former friend--all that time you seriously didn't know my full NAME?).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of the letter I got from my psychiatrist in preparation for a court date refuting the XY's claims that I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (since I'm sharing, my offical diagnosis from him reads something along the lines of \"dysphoria without associated mania indicative of bipolar disorder, situational anxiety, and adult ADD [...] NO evidence of borderline personality\" although I haven't looked at that letter in over a year so don't quote me on the exact wording) (further psychobabble mumbo-jumbo further down the page, loosely paraphrased, indicates that since my lifetime total sexual partners could fit in my minivan with seatbelts to spare, I don't cut or otherwise self-harm, and I don't steal or exhibit other signs of flexible morals I don't fit the criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder, unless the latest revision of the DSM has changed to expand the diagnostic criteria to include \"intensely disliked by her ex-husband and a handful of innernet whack-jobs\").\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Stalky? Wanna take me up on it? Or are you too chicken to \"out\" yourself to me since I believe you've moved a time or two in the years since I've had any truck with you? Since I moderate comments, I hereby pledge that if you DO take me up on it, I won't even show the whole wide innernet YOUR address (although you've threatened to show them mine; guess this is the one place where having a stable enough life that I don't move at least every year makes me the loser of the two of us).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Non-stalkies? I also wanted to say that while yes, the innernet has helped me out financially, if you donated to Isis's veterinary treatment fund and would like a no-questions-asked refund, please send me an e-mail from the address associated with your PayPal account and let me know, and rest assured that I won't call you out publicly or anything like that. I think 99.9% of the small population likely to read said whack-job's rantings who knows me at all, or even anyone who doesn't know me but has half a brain can recognize them as bullshit (I mean really? They claim to have been privy to the thoughts of the police officers who came to my house on my wedding night as a result of unbloggability? WOW, one of y'all whose guts they don't hate should ask them for some winning lottery numbers since they're all-knowing like that, or maybe they're just full of shit and their story wouldn't survive an undergraduate fiction workshop...also see \"blacklisted by all junior colleges in the state\" because REALLY? You think the community college system here has the funding to maintain a universal blacklist based on...well I don't know, the accusations from your Twitter-stream? HAHAHAHAHA!), and I did my best to be transparent by posting pictures of vet bills, prescriptions, and even my poor dog's mangy arse, but still. I don't want anyone who extended a helping hand my way to feel like they were ripped off or lose trust in the innernet as a whole as a result, because that was some damned beautiful goodwill and I wouldn't want to ruin it for the next person who needs a hand (also, just to be clear, I was not hinting in this post about Christmas presents for the kids, I will handle that because I am a big girl and nobody ever died of not getting a fucking Christmas present, so really, I've got that in case any of you thought I was asking for anything; sometimes I just need to vent okay?) (and Stalky is correct, we don't truly celebrate Christmas here in that we're not Christian, but my kids go to public school in America and therefore want to celebrate the retail holiday like everyone else: we exchange gifts and put up a goddamn tree, yes we do: SUE ME).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I took my Twitter-stream private for a while so that I can vent, but as I did so noticed the following on my homepage there (here is where I end this on a bright note and go to bed):\r\n Figure One: Fuck the haters, I think this means I win the entire innernet.

Shut up, I said \"if this was an \r\ninspirational Lifetime Movie,\" which totes leaves a loophole so that if I\r\n win the real-life contest I can be all \"yeah, well, but mama really \r\nneeded some liposuction quick before NYC.\" I named the cookies, \r\nincidentally, after an earlier, inferior batch that caused our neighbor \r\nto get googly eyes and fall in loooooove with me. Which is all you need \r\nto know about that fool. I mean, the cookies didn't even have coconut in\r\n them at that point and it was during the semi-sweet chocolate \r\nexperimentation, and so it wasn't even a complement so much as a cry for\r\n help. Poor neighbor dude.*\u00a0\u00a0 I was going to say how this is the kind of thing that would ONLY ever happen to me, but the Bloggess tells us this (the belief we are leading an extraordinary life) makes shrinks check off the cray-cray box on their clipboards and...well yeah, I still like to pretend it's not obvious.

Some of you regular readers might find this kind of hard to believe, because I do rant a bit now and then, but...okay hold the phone, I just went archive-surfing for examples of rants and angry tirades on here and...wow. Maybe pharmacists just make me hostile? \u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, it happened again and ExpressScripts? MORONS. I am required by my insurance plan to fill maintenance prescriptions through them, and not only do they invariably screw up, but they also have THE most BYZANTINE phone tree, and if you get through that (plan for at least twenty minutes there) you get to talk to a bunch of rude, intellectually-deficient mouthbreathers who are more interested in telling you how whatever they've screwed up is all your fault (NO, NOT THIS TIME, NOT EVEN LAST TIME ASSHOLES) than in righting things. Customer service: ur doin it rong.\u00a0\u00a0 So yesterday I was on the phone with them trying to find out just where the fuck mah crazy pills were; I take four prescriptions per day and while one of them is a synthetic replacement of a very vital hormone that like, makes your metabolism function and shit, it's the crazy pills I worry most about running out of. Because nobody likes teh crazy and also because if you stop taking this particular kind of crazy pill cold turkey you'll get a wicked blinding headache and (according to the on-call doctor I spoke with one time when my luggage got lost and I had to get things replaced) HAVE A SEIZURE.\u00a0\u00a0 I have no interest in experiencing a seizure. I've seen those and they look unfun.\u00a0\u00a0 So I placed an order two weeks before I was due to run out of meds, and called yesterday after taking my last crazy pill to find that these idiots had apparently run the wrong card number or something (my best guess since I KNOW that account had money in it, and also that if it did not the bank would have covered the charge and assessed me a hefty fee) and...canceled my order. Which they would now have to re-enter, with the six-day processing time and shipping and...unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable, not my fault, and I don't have a sense of humor about the seizure thing at ALL, let alone the whole \"now you must call eleventy doctors and deal with THEIR phone trees and get a replacement script to purchase out of pocket\" angle...which led to my saying to a customer \"service\" representative yesterday (with my family in the minivan with me, although I was parked, not driving, while having this conversation) \"NONONO, STOP TALKING AND GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR, I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO DESERVES TO HAVE A HEAD!\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"MOMMY! Are you okay? That's pretty...dark...for you!\" Big Child exclaimed, clearly trying not to laugh. Hotter just went ahead and busted out laughing.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, honey. I'll be poorer after this is all sorted out, and have the Crazy Eye for the rest of the day, but I'm okay. And for the record?

{"date": "July  1, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*   This morning I spent eighty minutes trapped in the exam room of a pediatric endocrinologist with my ex-husband and a very bored Little Child. The XY finally made that appointment to have Little Child's growth evaluated, and I wanted to make sure he didn't try to railroad the doctor into skipping any steps in the evaluation (you might think that's paranoid of me, but you haven't seen the XY in action--when he runs out of his ADD meds I've watched him convince doctors who have never met him to prescribe them without even seeing medical records, which is supposed to be impossible because they're amphetamines, but he's REALLY CHARMING and VERY PERSUASIVE and DOES NOT HANDLE \"NO\" WELL AT ALL and nine times out of ten he gets his way), give the wrong kid's medical history, or lie about anything to try and get Little Child on growth hormones. It turns out he tried to do all three of those things, so it's a good thing I went, but good LORD I hate that motherfucker! I forgot how he puts me down and attempts to discredit me in public. This is the first time he's had the chance to do it without a cop or a judge present (he won't do it in front of Hotter, either, because he still has that \"must be liked\" thing going on with Hotter and doesn't WANT anything from Hotter, and I just refuse to be alone with him) since the divorce, and I set a new precedent of pausing the conversation, turning to him with a confused expression, and asking him what on Earth he's talking about then pointing out how inappropriate it is for him to correct me on, say, my own medical history. This embarrassed him (and that is about the worst thing you can do to the XY, embarrass him IN FRONT OF SOMEONE) enough that he shut his fool hole, but I got an earful as soon as all medical providers left the room again, in front of Little Child. That sucked. Did I mention I hate the XY? Okay then. The long and short (no pun intended) of it is that the doctor feels like something MAY be up with Little Child's growth, and took blood for labwork and a bone-age x-ray today, and we'll follow up in five months to see how Little Child is growing according to the same equipment to rule out human error/equipment differences, and go from there. By that time school will be back in session, and Hotter plans to come along for backup, and hopefully I'll be doing well enough at the new job to afford a lawyer if I need one, because at that point if the XY wants to try and force growth hormones on Little Child for non medically-necessary reasons we will end up back in court over it.\r\n* \u00a0 So this morning was just a real mood-ruiner for me, and the cherry on top is that the hospital where the endocrinologist's office was located is in the neighborhood where I grew up, which I avoid going near if at all possible. The XY knows that, and there ARE other office locations (I checked online), so fuck him, again, some more, because I think he was hoping I would chicken out of going along (typically if he is willing to take one of the children to the doctor I just remove myself from he equation to avoid unpleasantness, but this is the first specialist appointment he's been willing to cover and he knew I wanted to be present). I am kind of a mess now, honestly, from the residual feelings brought up by the recent drama with The Narcissist, her family doing a drive-by on my blog, and that bullshit obituary, and the last thing I really needed was to spend eighty minutes in a room with ANOTHER narcissist in the neighborhood of my hellish childhood. As soon as I finish catching up on my work for Temp Agency #2 I plan to hit the fitness machines at the YMCA with my guided meditations playlist and try to exercise (spelling and, therefore, pun INTENDED) my demons.\r\n* \u00a0 Why do things I want always have to go on clearance when I'm broke? That is a fucking fantastic price on a vented beesuit, but by the time I get paid by The New Job and catch our bills up I'm sure they'll all be gone.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I have a few other things I would like to complain about, too, but need to get back to work and would probably feel like a whiner after I've gotten my head straight again. \r\n* \u00a0 I really need to get my head straight, because I have orienation tomorrow at The New Job and want to be my most fabulous self for that.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mannlakeltd.com/vs.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/07/grahhhh.html", "title": "grahhhh!"},

But now that I have seen \"behind the scenes\" I am even more impressed with my new employer and their level of organization than I already was (and I was pretty impressed with them--they're kind of a local legend--so that's saying something). These people know what they are doing! And ownership takes pride in the property and makes sure that the facility itself is beautiful and the employees have what they need to do their jobs. And the customers are consistently happy as a result. Also, I had failed to account for the fact that street-parking is free on weekends, and I will be working most weekends, so it's $15/week (vs. the $25/week I was thinking it would be) for parking, which is not as bad. I'm excited to get started! My first real shift is Saturday.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0While my job function is very similar to what I was doing at The Hotel California, I'll ultimately (most likely) be making more money in fewer hours, and while I'll have to start getting up earlier than I am accustomed to and learning to be a morning person (!!!), it will be worth it. Because I'll be getting home before the children get home from school most days, and having dinnerwith my family every night.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It feels good to have a real job again.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/07/oriented.html", "title": "oriented"},
{"date": "July 26, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I want MFA Puppy to be a friendly, social critter, especially since my kids are dead-set on training her to be a therapy dog when she grows up (and I support this: if they want to help I will pay for the obedience classes because it beats video games and I like that they came up with the idea all on their own based on how much they've enjoyed the therapy dogs in their hematologist's waiting room). Socializing the dog responsibly (i.e. watching her like a hawk to discourage jumping, mouthing, and other undesirable behaviors and make sure other people's kids don't maul her) is hard to do while also keeping tabs on three kids who are apt to do a lot of the same undesirable things, and so we decided to start out by taking her out in public without the children. Eventually we'd like to take her to some dog parks, but since she hasn't had all of her shots and is still pretty small we decided that a (dog-friendly) local outdoor shopping center was a better idea for right now; that way she could meet and greet new people and see other (leashed) dogs too. The shopping center in question also has a fountain consisting of jets embedded flush to the ground in the junction of several brick walkways that they allow children and dogs to play in as long as they're supervised and playing safely, so it seemed like an ideal destination on a day when the weather was like this:\r\n Figure One: Fuck you, nature.\u00a0\u00a0 This was our first time taking the puppy out in public, and while I've heard other folks who own pitbulls refer to the \"pitbull stigma\" before, I had never encountered it myself (Hotter grew up with a pitbull but MFA Puppy is my first) and (being as prone to thinking others feel the same way I do about things as the next idiot) didn't think it would be an issue. Personally I've worked with domesticated animals (mostly horses) enough to know that barring some sort of organic illness (like rabies or encephalitis) or logical, situational factor (being territorial over food or young, or just scared silly) they just aren't inherently vicious or aggressive toward people. Domesticated animals who aren't used to being handled (such as the two PMU foals I raised and trained while I lived on a small farm) can be dangerous in that they might hurt you if you corner them or they're frightened, but that's because they're trying to escape from you or defend themselves against a perceived attack (and they often don't know their own strength!). So while I'm not much of a dog person and had never owned a pitbull, my reaction when I moved into this house and met my neighbor's dogs was the same as if they'd been any other kind of dog: I just hoped they were used to children and weren't howlers. I knew that dogs were good therapy for sad kids, and after seeing my kids with the therapy dogs at Local Teaching Hospital and reading about how useful companion/therapy dogs can be in helping kids on the autism spectrum overcome sensory and social aversions, I knew I wanted to get my kids a dog someday. They (and Hotter) had been begging for ages, but Middle Child's depression since the Unbloggable Horrors of January came to a head a couple of months ago and convinced me it was time to put \"Operation Family Dog\" on project status.\u00a0\u00a0 As I've mentioned before, bringing a dog into our household wasn't as simple as deciding it was time and loading everyone up to go to the pound, though. With Hotter being on immunosuppressants and Little Child's native immune system being rather puny, I wouldn't feel good about bringing a dog into our home unless I knew it was healthy and not carrying anything that could infect people (such as parvovirus or c. diff), particularly those with weakened immune systems (and any group housing environment with a lot of turnover, from a nursing home to a dogpound, is bound to be a hotbed of contagion). So while I would have preferred to rescue a shelter dog, I was too worried about germs to go that route. I also wanted to get as young a puppy as possible, simply because the younger the animal the blanker the slate, and developmentally-delayed kids (and kids in general, for that matter) aren't great at impulse-control and remembering rules; that could be a recipe for disaster with a dog who'd been traumatized or mistreated by people outside my household and had \"triggers\" (bad associations to do with things like swinging stick-like objects such as Nerf swords, for example, that might cause them to feel like they needed to behave aggressively in order to protect themselves). If it weren't for the fact that relative amicability with the XY is a recent development and he has a history of trying to take my children from me entirely through false allegations as to their safety (or lack thereof) under my care, I might have been a little less adamant, but that took the whole \"blank slate\" thing from \"probably for the best\" to \"absolutely mandatory.\" I couldn't take the risk of having an already sad situation with a scared dog and an injured child cost me several thousand dollars in legal fees and possibly custody of my children (I like to think that a judge would understand that shit happens and trust me to keep it from happening again, but in my experiences family court decisions often have less to do with reality or justice and more to do with who can produce or fabricate the most \"evidence\" and afford the attorney who will put on the better show in the half-hour the judge spends learning about the situation so I don't assume a danged thing or take any chances). \u00a0\u00a0 So I wasn't just looking for a dog, I was looking for a puppy whose history I knew as much as possible about, and preferably of a breed that would be sturdy enough that I wouldn't have to worry too much about the kids accidentally hurting the dog (dachshunds, for example, have very delicate backs and a child leaning on one the wrong way could be expensive at best or tragic at worst). When our neighbor mentioned casually several months ago that he was planning to breed one of his females (a dog I'd met and knew to be friendly and gentle with my children) it was the ideal opportunity for our family. He just happened to breed pitbulls and so that is what we ended up with.\u00a0\u00a0 Honestly I didn't even think about \"the pitbull thing\" when Hotter and I took our puppy to the shopping center; MFA Puppy is MAH BAYBEE (don't tell Hotter I said that; he teases me enough given that I didn't like dogs AT ALL until we got this one \"for the kids\" -- air quotes because she has decided to be My Dog and I'm secretly thrilled) and who wouldn't love this adorable little biscuit face?\r\n Figure Two: Doesn't *actually* want to eat your children.\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of people, apparently!\u00a0\u00a0 The reactions we got tended to be either:\u00a0\u00a0 A. \"AWWWWS! What kind of dog is she?\" and then\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. \"Oh I couldn't tell because of the ears\" followed by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. \"She's gorgeous! What an unusual color!\" or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. \"But she seems so friendly!/I hope you don't also have CHILDREN!/She'll turn on you eventually!\"\u00a0\u00a0 B. \"Is that a pit(bull)?\" and then\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. \"They're such great dogs/I love pitbulls!\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. \"I wasn't sure because of the ears\" and then (A.1.a. or b. or B.1., above)\u00a0\u00a0 C. \"Ohhh, a pit(bull)!\" and then\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. (B.1., above)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. \"I have/had a pit(bull)/s,\" then \"how old is she/can I pet her/(inarticulate babytalk)\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. (A.1.b., above)\u00a0\u00a0 or\u00a0\u00a0 D. \"OMG A BLUE PIT, WOW, SHE'S GORGEOUS!\" and then\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. (C.2., above) \u00a0\u00a0 Hotter even had a little old lady come up to him while he and MFA Puppy were sitting outside of P.F. Chang's (where I was getting takeout for our dinner) and ask about the dog, then turn very chilly when her companion noted how friendly the puppy was and say \"Sure, for NOW!\" Hotter took umbrage at that, but said he refrained from comment because the companion immediately said what I usually say (\"They act how you treat 'em\") and looked ashamed. I'm kind of glad I wasn't there for that because I might not have had his restraint!\u00a0\u00a0 All in all it was an eye-opening experience, and I guess \"the pitbull issue\" will only get worse as MFA Puppy gets bigger and less adorable in the eyes of the general public. I was interested to note that the uncropped ears totally threw most people who were anti-pitbull (some were already cooing and fawning over the puppy when they asked what kind of dog she was and seemed rather nonplussed to find that they were patting an OMGPITBULL, and I like that some of them recovered from their shock to say that they didn't know pitbulls could be so SWEET or ask questions that showed genuine interest in learning more about them) or just unfamiliar with the breed. I also found it interesting (and sadly, not surprising) that it was mostly white people who were clueless as to what sort of dog we had and/or anti-pitbull (the shopping center is located in an affluent part of town and the shops are pretty upscale for the most part, so there were more WASPS than we usually run across in our neighborhood, where we are one of only two white families). The whole experience made me both sad and COMPLETELY FARKING DETERMINED that MY pitbull? Will be THE BESTEST DOG EVAR. The \"therapy dog\" thing is no longer something I might do for the kids' sake, it's something I'm DAMNED WELL GOING TO DO to help show people that pitbulls are, like any other dog, very pleasant to be around when they're well-trained.\u00a0\u00a0 Because, you know, I didn't have enough things in my life (autism spectrum disorders, adaptive medical equipment, blended families) to feel passionate about demystifying in the eyes of strangers (so that they'll quit being afraid of/ignorant about them and acting like assholes). \u00a0\u00a0 Just for the heck of it, if you wouldn't mind, could you leave me a comment and let me know whether you a) would be more cautious around a pitbull than another breed of dog (and if so, why) or b) wouldn't be any more or less cautious around a pitbull than any other breed of dog?

{"date": "July 31, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDear [redacted - I know your names but have more class than to publish them],\u00a0\u00a0 Long time no see! I was beginning to feel unloved, but thankfully you knew that filtering your last e-mail address in G-mail, reporting your activities to the IC3 (report #I0911242345379791 from November of last year and #I1007312129083222 from today), and sending your blog comments to spam was really just my way of playing hard to get. Now that you've proven you're truly my NUMBER ONE FAN I'm going to go and carve our initials into a special tree out back!\u00a0\u00a0 I could point out the ridiculousness of accusing someone of having an obsessive and disordered personality via \"anonymous\" harassment coming from a webmail address consisting of their maiden name, current last name, and blog names strung together, but it would probably go right over your head. I hear you when you say I use too many words, and I don't want to confuse you, so I'll say this very simply:Get a life, and get over your unhealthy fixation surrounding me and mine.\u00a0\u00a0 There, you can stop reading now if you want (well, you don't need my permission; like everyone else reading this you have the option to simply close the window and rather than say I'm writing the rest of this for me I'll just point out that, duh, I'm writing this whole blog for me, obviously).\u00a0\u00a0 All kidding aside, I know you like to troll my blog and e-mail me before major events (everything from holidays \r\nto my wedding day to BlogHer) and wasn't really surprised to hear from \r\nyou. You've made me take a long, hard look at a lot of the things that I\r\n do, a lot of the relationships I've had, and what I choose to share \r\nabout my life online, and for that I should probably thank you. You've \r\nhelped me learn to spot and avoid toxic personalities and risky \r\nsituations, and recognize dysfunctional behaviors (in myself as well as \r\nothers, contrary to your repeated claims to the contrary I'm not \r\nlaboring under the delusion that I'm perfect), and kept me from posting \r\nenough to let unsavory types who'd do more than just harass me via blog \r\ncomments and anonymous e-mails know how to find me and my family. So in a\r\n way you've helped me to become a safer, more compassionate, and savvier\r\n individual, and I honestly can't say I regret knowing you.\u00a0\u00a0 I can, however, say that it's time for both of us to stop thinking about this. I'm not going to stop enjoying the holidays, forging and maintaining relationships with other mentally stable adults who share my interests, attending social gatherings, or blogging here, and I'm also not going to turn my blog into an ongoing dialog with you. I'm sorry things between us didn't go as you hoped they would; I'm not thrilled with how it went down either but you don't see me devoting years of my life to dwelling on it. I've reported your most recent communications to the IC3, Google (since as I said, your new G-mail address, which I've set a new filter for, consists of my rather unique maiden, married, and blog names combined), and BlogHer (since the organizers of the conference deserve to know that someone is threatening criminal acts at their event), and I'm done. I wish you luck in finding the peace that will allow you to move on from this someday as well, because that's so much nicer than trying to fan life back into the ashes of what was, trust me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ruefully, MFA Mama\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/07/an-open-letter-to-my-stalkers.html", "title": "an open letter to my stalkers"},

{"date": "May  8, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child knew the entire alphabet by the time he was eleven \r\nmonths old.\u00a0 I didn't even think about it much one way or the other \r\nuntil Hotter was asking me why Big Child is such a mama's boy and the \r\nother two are such alpha males and I said I'd stayed home with baby Big \r\nChild just to supervise his emotional and intellectual development \r\nbecause he was Big-brain Superchild, truly something special.\u00a0 We'd been\r\n talking (okay, I'd been waxing emo while he patiently listened) about \r\nthe boys as babies, and things I hoped to show him if the XY does in \r\nfact return my family pictures as has recently been proposed via Mr. \r\nFamily Therapist.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I had kind of just given up on ever seeing \r\nmyself or either of my older children as babies ever again because \r\nbelieve it or not I was slow to embrace digital and well, as my attorney\r\n growled, rolling his eyes and chortling a bit when I told him the XY \r\nhad snatched those from the marital home during a police-supervised \r\nbreak-in of sorts, \"oh atta boy!\u00a0 That's really nice.\"\u00a0 \r\nLately I've allowed myself to imagine the hilarity I might show Hotter \r\nin MFA Historical Occasions (such as an incredibly intricate Hannukah \r\ncake I made one year that no one ate because they were all burying a dog\r\n outside in stormy weather under a big oak tree in the middle of wooded \r\nor enclosed for livestock nowhere and damn that was a nice cake \r\nbut did anyone appreciate my efforts?\u00a0 Pfft) that I attempted to \r\ndocument only the good snippets from and well, anyway, I can laugh now.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n There's also the possibility of saying, offhand, to my gawking husband,\r\n \"Oh yes Big Child was really something else as a baby and toddler,\" in \r\nremembering the wall with Big Child's heights marked off in the former \r\nfamily home of many year, our grudging little farm, on the pantry door \r\njust visible in the pictures of that masterpiece of a cake.\u00a0 The true \r\nmindfuck of particular subtypes I won't name of some specific autism\r\n spectrum disorders is that your child develops just fine up to a \r\npoint, and often better than fine, but then they just, well, don't \r\nanymore.\u00a0 Hotter, being an honest, average member of the community who \r\nis not intolerant of little boys with issues but uneducated in many of \r\nthe specifics of those issues because he doesn't know anyone affected, \r\nat least as far as he knows, exclaimed with obvious confusion and \r\nconcern, \"what happened?\"\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child is a good kid, a \r\nreal sweetheart.\u00a0 All of my boys are.\u00a0 I may occasionally refer to us going to family therapy, and even of one \r\nchild particular making a nonspecified bad choice, possibly with a soup\u00e7on\r\n of exasperation if I'm really het up, but they're good kids.\u00a0 I was\r\n just marveling at the fact that I now have a nine-year-old and I have \r\nnot yet had anyone get a black eye from a playmate, get in trouble at \r\nschool, light anything on fire, swear out loud (except on Festivus) or \r\nperform any acts of intersibling heinousness necessitating medical \r\nintervention.\u00a0 I talk to other people about their kids (many of whom are\r\n also really good kids, I am not saying a kid isn't if they've done any \r\nor all of the things I mentioned, just trying to convey a mental picture\r\n for y'all of what my particular good kids are like and not like) and \r\nused to find myself saying \"I hope none of mine will do that when they \r\nget older,\" but now my oldest and middle children are actually older \r\nthan the children from a lot of these anecdotes, especially now that Big\r\n Child is now nine.\u00a0 I was a good kid at the same age but, well.\u00a0\r\n My own nine-year-old has never (at least as far as I know from my \r\ncustodial time of him) operated a lighter or book of matches, fetched a \r\nbeer or rolled a joint for a parent, or had unsupervised access to a \r\nremote control and a TV where Cinemax will pop up and I count myself \r\nlucky that I as their mother and Hotter as their stepfather are on the \r\nsame page in wanting to raise these boys better than either of us were \r\nraised ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know that the above paragraph \r\ncontributes to what I'm trying to tell y'all except to perhaps indicate \r\nhow defensive and guilty I feel about some of the disabling conditions \r\nthat affect my children.\u00a0 This isn't because any of those conditions are\r\n the result of wrongdoing or lack of medical diligence on my part, but \r\nsimply because I guess I don't want anyone to see my child as less-than,\r\n or if they do, to think that I agree with them in any way, shape or \r\nform.\u00a0 Big Child now struggles with things he seemed proficient at early\r\n in life.\u00a0 When there's nothing but a syndrome or phrase of latinate \r\nobfuscation to offer yourself or anyone else by way of explanation for \r\nsomething about your child that clearly deviates quite a lot from the \r\nnorm, a lot of folks look at you the same way you yourself looked at \r\nsome of the professionals who educated you on the same things: like \r\nyou're saying Harry Potter himself put several curses on the kid and \r\nyou're waiting for Hermione Granger to figure out how to undo them.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n So anyway yes, all of my children have difficulties that I've had to \r\nlearn about in order to be a good advocate and caregiver, and in the \r\nabsence of any family members I've had to explain my kids' conditions to\r\n I haven't discussed many of them out loud with anyone I cared deeply \r\nfor (I mean, I love some of my kids' doctors, nurses, therapists and \r\nteachers, don't get me wrong, but just not like that) since the MFA \r\nStarter Marriage fell apart, and in discussing a lot of this stuff with \r\nHotter I've relived a lot of unpleasant memories and had to look closely\r\n at some ongoing worries, and I'm halfway tempted to tell the XY he can \r\nkeep the bloody pictures.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I try to do a good job of talking about the happy and the silly \r\nand the deadpan-serious on here, and want to also tell you how Ourtown \r\ngot a new and rather kickass radio station that has this vintage \r\nhistorical name and awesome streaming radio, and get my crackberry back \r\nup and running so that I can show you some true garden porn, but right \r\nbefore I mowed the front yard yesterday that is the conversation I had \r\nwith my beloved about one of my sweet boys and it wasn't the type I'd \r\ntypically share.\u00a0 Too close to home.\u00a0 But yeah, this too.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 They're growing up fast.\u00a0 Which is what I should have said at HP this month but tempus fugit whether you have any fun or not, like procreative sex or zeroes in attorneys' fees, yes it do, and sometimes it's downright rude about it.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "May 17, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 It stormed off and on all weekend here.\u00a0 In between storms it was hot like the wrath of an angry Old Testament god, which I said and Hotter, who was raised with the New Testament only was all \"why, is the Old Testament god of the Hebrews kind of harsh?\" and HAHAHAHAHA!\u00a0 I told him \"mmmmyeah y'know how Jesus was all healing little birds and doing parlor tricks at weddings?\u00a0 Well, Yahweh was like \"wander in the desert for forty years and make your camp under this motherfucking pillar of fire at night or else I will SMITE YOU!\"\u00a0 Ha!\u00a0 So yeah the weather was more like that.*\u00a0\u00a0 This has evidently become A Cursing Blog.\u00a0 I kept meaning to go all meta about that but tell me, what do you think?\u00a0 I suck with polls and the like but do you a) not notice, b) notice but not care, c) notice and care in a good or bad way, d) pretty much hate it and think I need to shut my Playboy mouth again?\u00a0 I suppose if any of you are fellow pedants you could also e) feel that it represents a blight upon my etymological creativity that indicates bad things or f) find it heartening in that apparently my heart and mind are more connected given that my lexicon has shaken its hair down out of the bun and undone a button at the top of its blouse.\u00a0 Personally I just kind of felt like I had Hit a Limit after Hotter's acute attack of surgi-ma-callititis and our visit to That Awful Hospital.*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter had another big attack on Thursday, and a smallish one yesterday, and oh I cannot WAIT for him to Have His Procedures.\u00a0 Oh yes, we have Been To The Doctor and I didn't say much about it but they pretty much said \"this doesn't present like textbook surgi-ma-callititis\" and I pretty much went \"but his abdominal architecture has been so remodeled at this point and blah blah referred pain when the radiologist [...]\" and they were like \"but people can live with that for xx years and never--\" and I reminded them that Hotter is immunosuppressed and opined that it might be preferable for them to do this NOW instead of when he goes SEPTIC and they conceded that I had a good point and planned an open, non-laparoscopic procedure for that surgi-ma-callititis but were still concerned about strictures or adhesions on the small bowel being The Root of What Ails Him and Medicare not liking \"exploratory surgery\" and I very sweetly suggested that they could declare this Surgi-ma-callitits Proper seeing as it met the criteria for atypical cases, perform the appropriate -ectomy, and then \"run the bowel\" while they're in there and have a look at that as well, since I was sure NONE of us wanted to submit his kidney to CT contrast and they had SUCH good eyes and hands I was sure...so yes, reason prevailed and the current plans are to open him up, treat this as surgi-ma-callititis, examine two hernias from within (both from major surgeries, not the uh, turn-your-head-and-cough kind, I feel I should specify for the sake of Hotter's Manliness On Record) and repair at least one, and run the bowel as best they can since part of it is attached to a graft that nobody wants to disturb.*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I are pleased with this decision.\u00a0 Neither of us are fully convinced that this is Surgi-ma-callititis Proper but both of us are convinced that this is A Surgical Issue and that the transplant surgeons need to Exorcise The Demon.\u00a0 Because no one is at their best when they're in abdominal agony but that gets old for the spouse almost as quickly as it gets old for the sufferer, particularly if the non-suffering spouse is really quite fond of the affected spouse and shares their distress even before the affected party begins expressing any...feelings.*\u00a0\u00a0 Family therapy, y'all.\u00a0 Oh man.\u00a0 It continues to be a motherfucker.*\u00a0\u00a0 Had a bit of a breakthrough (breakdown, same diff) as to Why All The\r\n Angry Feelings of Anger and Angry-ness and fear of same, and it made me sad.\u00a0 It's good I\r\n know where my pique is coming from now, and I'm working on learning to \r\nexpress it.\u00a0 This weekend, in the heat of the moment, I deliberately \r\nwatered Hotter's (actual, literal) shoes with my soaker-can.\u00a0 So I'm uh,\r\n still working on the whole \"appropriate expression of\" thing and it's \r\nfortunate that Hotter just cracked up laughing and was like \"you watered\r\n my shoes, is someone feeling some anger, maybe?\"\u00a0 I replied that \r\nperhaps I was, and watered his shoes again.*\u00a0\u00a0 I continue to garden out my Anger Shoes.\u00a0 This weekend saw the relocation of a grave-sized strip of sod (which became a bed for sweet corn and peas, yes, more, and some intercropped carrots and iceberg lettuce), the ruthless pruning of pretty much every big, thorny, spiky, or just all-around bushy bush surrounding our little house (surprisingly many), thinning, weeding and spraying of all existing plants (with paraffin against mites and fungus, bloom-boosting hormone, and Sevin on non-leaf crops without any seed or fruit forming if they're getting demolished--judge away but while I prefer organic methods, in the end I'm going with What Will Make Us Lots of Food), and lots of raking up and watering.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 This purging of undergrowth did not stop my nemesis from paying me a visit one evening on the front porch while I was a little bit inebriated.\u00a0 It was so...well, anyway...that I'm holding the story back for a proper post of its own (do any of you know how to make a GIF like the Hillary Duff BJ one?\u00a0 Don't act like you haven't seen it, unless you really haven't in which case go and ask YouTube, but if you know how to do that could you educate me please?\u00a0 Thanks).*\u00a0\u00a0 Oh and that Levaquin I'm taking for my Clusterfuck-itis of the Upper Respiratory/ENT virus of filth and secondary infections?\u00a0 Those big warning labels all over the bottle about sun exposure?\u00a0 SO NOT KIDDING.\u00a0 I'm awfully prone to heatstroke anyway and even with SPF 60 and a bandanna, etc. I got a case of true heatstroke (the kind where you stop sweating), which I've had before, and had the sense to down a bottle of water then heave myself into the tub and turn the cold tap on with the shower running before I passed out.\u00a0 When I came to I knew I'd be okay because I started realizing how it would look to paramedics and sheepishly shucked off my clothes, washed my hair, and eventually stood up and went about my business all casual-like (Hotter was recovering from an attack and some residual feeeeelings and unaware why I charged into the house; he's used to my zipping around in and out banging the door like an obnoxious kid when the MFA Children are away).\u00a0 Also I do not have a burn, per se, thanks to excellent sunblock, but my skin does have that tight \"eh, too much sun\" feeling, which I hate.*\u00a0\u00a0 The pet snakes are ridiculous.\u00a0 The worm snake is great but the rat snake is a wimp and I had to force-feed him for the SECOND time (he's doing SO much better now though), plus now we have a mouse that was supposed to be for the rat snake but it made friends with the stupid thing and then Hotter named it.\u00a0 Bah, grumble.\u00a0 I should've known the moment I said I didn't care whether they gave me a male or a female one at the pet shop and watched them drop a smelly male mouse into the cardboard box that it would live to stink up my house for years to come.\u00a0 Grr...*\u00a0\u00a0 Also?\u00a0 Chickens.\u00a0 We're getting some.\u00a0 I know!\u00a0 I owe you garden porn and you'll see why this is not at all over the top...also I grew up with chickens that laid excellent brown eggs and want my boys to experience that, too.\u00a0 Plus apparently I've lost my mind.\u00a0 Still, look.\u00a0 Awww...we're getting some of these because as I recall they're very sweet if you handle them a lot as chicks and lay well.*\u00a0\u00a0 We picked up our second AngelFoodMinistries order this weekend too, and it's fabulous.\u00a0 We've eaten well; I swear it feels like we lived a whole week just this one weekend, good and bad and everything in between.\u00a0 Maybe it's the fever?*\u00a0\u00a0 And how are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n

{"date": "July 15, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I are totally becoming creepy dog-lover people. I guess it means we're too old for babies and not old enough for grandbabies? He calls me \"Mommy\" when he talks to the dog. As in \"there's Mommy, stop crying, she is so bonded to you, gawd.\"*\u00a0\u00a0 Isis the dog may be bonded to me but she also big-puffy-hearts Middle Child. It is so cute. He is so proud. *\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of Middle Child, I gave him a mohawk today. See, I told him he could let his hair grow if he wanted, and he did, and it was gnarly, so I convinced him a mohawk would be OMGAWESOME and he would be ZOMGSOCOOL and one thing led to another and Hotter's father's day gift (a beard trimmer) was in my hand and...yeah.*\u00a0\u00a0 I'd show y'all a picture but...too identifying. Let's just say it's not the same mohawk every boy under the age of ten in the blogosphere has had. My kid is hard-core buzzed to the skin except for a 1/2-inch wide strip of three-inch spiked BADASSERY. And his head doesn't smell worse than his dog.*\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child told Middle Child he looked crazy, and \"bald, hahaha\" so I shaved his head. Big Child's. And Middle Child laughed, HAHAHAHAHAHA, and Big Child whimpered but his stanky head will smell better now.*\u00a0\u00a0 As I told the XY when I took the kids back after his dinner visit, Little Child didn't get buzzed because I scrub his little head and keep it clean and sweet-smelling, and the other two need to start over. It'll grow out by the time school starts. Heh.*\u00a0\u00a0 Quote of The Day (year, really): I'm walking my dog with my mohawk, Big Child is crying because he's so jealous of my dog and my mohawk. I know it's horrible that I didn't squash it, but he was very discreet and no one else heard. So I had him go and quietly repeat himself to Hotter and then we both died. *\u00a0\u00a0 It's so good to see Middly so happy and proud of himself. This puppy has changed his entire demeanor.\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know how the mama dog and Isis Puppy's littermates are faring. I hope they're doing okay. We got Isis handed over the fence by the scruff of her lethargic little neck just in the nick of time for her recover physically. If the breeder had to treat all of those dogs as we had Isis treated it was cost him around $3k and...well, sadly he gave us our pup early to get his hands on cash for dogfood. Sigh. I wish I was rich and could have them all treated but we have done what we could by our one and that is all we can do.*\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter is way better by the way. His surgeons cleared him for um, light exercise and while the MFA Children were at dinner visitation we MAY have crated the pitifulbull and gone on an ADULTS ONLY garbage run and then to the grocery store. I may have splurged on Starbucks for us, and we got our favorite kind of deli sandwich (smoked turkey, spicy pepper jack, southwestern mayo on twelve-grain bread with crisp lettuce and OM NOM NOM) and came home to find that the puppy didn't die and wasn't still howling like a tiny wolf, so we did things that might not even be legal in this state some stuff we couldn't do with the dog in our bed.*\u00a0\u00a0 I could have been talking about lying in our new fan's path and sighing happily--that upright fan we bought with bing.com cashback and picked up locally is BOMB given that our central air doesn't quite reach the dinky room at the end of the hall (ours). Little Child's room is smaller but cools well and the older MFA Childrens' room has multiple vents. Ours is bigger than Little Child's and smaller than the big boys' and the one vent doesn't quite cut it. This fan is awesome. I thought I was going through early menopause until we got it but no, I was just hot.*\u00a0\u00a0 I totally have a head and chest cold but am doing this feed a fever thing. Would any of you like a recipe I free-handed together for peanut-butter macadamia-nut cookies of sinful yumness? I won't be all pushy but if anyone WANTS it...*\u00a0\u00a0 The dog is lucky she's on a speshul diet or I woulda peanut-buttered the roof of her mouth but good, and LOLed at her for ages. *\u00a0\u00a0 I also, at Hotter's request, made some blueberry muffins. He is starting to get a tiny bit of junk in his trunk. Shh, if you ever meet him play it cool and don't stare but his leg-spine junction is coming along nicely and almost a butt.*\u00a0\u00a0 I ran today. A lot. But not in my tutu and not in a straight line. This puppy sucks at running. She'll heel along nicely at a trot then sit suddenly on her bum and bite leaves or blades of grass. She was so much more likable when she was lethargic. SRSLY.*\u00a0\u00a0 I mowed a swath just for the diva, and mulched up all of the leaves, HAHAHAHAHA and sticks HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA and keep the bug population down.*\u00a0\u00a0 Middle Child is great about scooping the poop. We use this (I am not being compensated by them but Swoop? If y'all wanna drop me some free poobags hit me up, g-mail style) and the XY saw it and was impressed. Heh. It's great and we want to keep there from being anywhere for worms to breed or whatever, because let's just say the third time worming Isis was the charm and leave it at that. You're welcome (hrnk).*\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of gaggy things, the pup still doesn't drink enough because she was weaned too early and grr so I still have to syringe pedialyte into her, and the apple flavor is all she'll voluntarily drink. PitbullFAIL. She's not allowed to dehydrate again though, because we want her to qualify for the well-puppy plan when the vet sees her for follow-up next Monday.*\u00a0\u00a0 The XY met the puppy, as in saw her moving under her own steam and TOUCHED HER even though I told him not to. I was all \"YOU'RE NOT IN THE PACK\" but he was googly-eyed and cooing at the stupid dog and she frisked right up to him. We told him how she'd been more likable when she was lethargic and he was like \"oh so now she's acting like a puppy?\" Pretty much, yeah.*\u00a0\u00a0 It's nice interacting with the pleasant husk the aliens left when they abducted the father of my children; he's actually likable, as Hotter said, making a face like the one I'm making as I type this. What happened to him not deserving to have a head (as MissGrace would say, which I <3 her for)? *hums Twilight themesong**\u00a0\u00a0 My prize from Niobe arrived today and I like it. Hotter thinks it's revolting. More for me. WHEEE!!!*\u00a0\u00a0 You guys. This dog sleeps on her back and runs all night long. *\u00a0\u00a0 The chickens love the leftover dogchow. We figure for $50 a bag (of thirty pounds of delicious, delicious nutrition) SOME critter will eat any bit before we waste the stuff. They now cluck when they see Middle Child putting his dog's food dish down. I think they're disappointed that she doesn't leave much anymore. Poor chickens.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/IsisTheDogSays", "http://www.smarthome.com/61011/Swoop-Pooper-Scooper-for-Large-Dogs/p.aspx", "http://deadbabyjokes.blogspot.com/2010/07/focus.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/07/so-the-dogs-add-and-mine-feed-off-each-other-go-figure.html", "title": "so the dog's ADD and mine feed off each other, go figure"},

{"date": "May  1, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I have been working in the yard a lot, planting vegetables and landscaping and pruning the overgrown trees and shrubbery into some semblance of order and generally enjoying the outdoors and each other's company.\u00a0 We had big plans for this weekend (the MFA Children are Away this weekend) including some bedroom acts illegal in our state and much sleeping in and cleaning house, but instead we're camped out at the local major teaching hospital.\u00a0\u00a0 I have no earthly idea what happened yesterday (and so far neither do any of the doctors here) but yesterday afternoon Hotter doubled over in pain, pain bad enough that he was whimpering, and my husband is a very stoic man.\u00a0 We were both worried enough that I called Dr. Kidney's on-call transplant coordinator, who said that maybe he was just a bit dehydrated and overheated, and to give him a cool drink and an icepack on his neck and wait an hour, then if the pain hadn't gone away to go to the ER since their office was closing within the hour.\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter did his \"I don't want to go to the hospital\" thing and said the pain was not as bad, and we dropped the MFA Children off at the police station and headed home.\u00a0 I went to pick up dinner and came home to find Hotter facedown on the living room floor gasping and pale from pain.\u00a0 I quickly gathered our pills, my computer, and an emesis basin and frog-marched Hotter to the MFA Minivan.\u00a0\u00a0 The drive to the hospital was hell.\u00a0 Sheer hell.\u00a0 Hotter began to vomit from the pain on the way, and I'd pull over and have him empty the basin and go back to speeding like a demon, because by this point Hotter was screaming that he couldn't take it.\u00a0 By the time we got off the expressway (where I blew through every toll because I didn't have change and didn't give a rat's arse for their video enforcement; by this time I was rather HOPING to pick up a police escort) he was talking about wanting to die and saying he was sorry and...I was scared, y'all.\u00a0 I roared into the ambulance bay, ran into the ER and snatched a wheelchair informing them that my double-organ transplant husband was violently ill and they were treating him IMMEDIATELY, and handed Hotter (who was begging me not to leave him and looked almost as terrified as I was) over to the triage nurse.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I swear I came thisclose to just abandoning the MFA Minivan to the tender mercies of the local police department and figuring out what to do about it later.\u00a0 When I got back from parking I found that they had indeed found \"screaming, vomit-covered double transplant recipient\" to be a compelling enough reason for immediate treatment (this would seem like a no-brainer, but I have NO EXAGGERATION seen people with knives sticking out of them sitting in chairs waiting to be triaged in this ER before).\u00a0\u00a0 After twelve hours in the ER during which Hotter felt much better and was halfway through discharge, but then failed the portion of the discharge where he had to prove he could eat and drink without the pain returning or any vomiting (epic fail there) and now we're in the \"Critical Care Hospital\" on the bone-marrow transplant ward thanks to my \"he is immunosuppressed and we are NOT catching anything while in-patient\" speech trying to figure out what Hotter's deal is (aside from having been severely dehydrated when we got here).\u00a0 He woke up this morning pain-free and cracking jokes, but they've discovered something irregular about his heartbeat and want to do an abdominal ultrasound to check the bloodflow to his grafts, and he still hasn't eaten any actual food (just a liquid breakfast, although yesterday even a sip of water would set him off with the pain and vomiting).\u00a0 I'm hopeful that this was just a particularly vicious GI bug but it would be nice if they could make a definitive diagnosis and tell us whether it'll happen again or what to avoid to prevent it, because DAMN.\u00a0\u00a0 And here is a doctor to talk to us.ETA: Very nice, very knowledgeable doctor pulled up a chair and sat and talked us through the differential diagnosis (which included some scary things that are unlikely and furthermore very difficult to test for in someone with Hotter's after-market anatomical layout) and Hotter's labs (which are excellent--potassium is nice and low and his creatinine is now the best I've ever seen it after being high last night from the dehydration) but said that in the end he thought my suggestion was the way to go.\u00a0 I suggested that if the abdominal ultrasound and EKG are clear and Hotter can eat a solid lunch without the pain returning, they send us home with a bottle of very strong painkillers because we can just as easily scratch our heads and watch and wait from there.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/05/live-from-the-local-teaching-hospital.html", "title": "live from the local teaching hospital"},

the XY said something about it when we were exchanging \r\nchildren at the police station and I was all \"your MOM smells like \r\nantifreeze\" because the temperature gauge was fluctuating appropriately \r\nbut no the vehicle was overheating AND the in-dash computer needed a \r\nre-build and I may have owned a vibrator AND a jar-opener but the \r\nminivan made me feel lonely for not knowing the smell of antifreeze.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n I used to carry a jug of inexpensive premixed \r\ncoolant everywhere, even after MFA Mechanic and Son fixed the leak, but \r\nstopped when Hotter moved in because I try to \r\nrein the crazy in for his sake and be graceful in accepting feedback on \r\nwhat's good planning versus clinical neurosis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It's a true \r\ntestament to my marriage that I didn't go at anyone wielding a dipstick \r\nlike a rapier last Saturday when a chime went off at the exact moment \r\nthat Hotter said he smelled antifreeze and I pulled over to find that \r\nthe coolant level was dangerously low.\u00a0 Not because he had convinced me \r\nto leave the coolant \r\nbehind just recently; coincidences happen all the time and correlation \r\nand causation are two things I keep separated in my head with a fair \r\ndegree of success.\u00a0 I am not superstitious or narcissistic enough to \r\nthink my preparation or lack thereof can affect the outcome.\u00a0 No, I was \r\nannoyed with myself, because the minivan overheating is a pretty good \r\nexample of the way in which \r\nmany of the \r\nthings Not To Be Mentioned On The Innernet have been going down: \r\nsomething will happen that I was prepared for at one point in time but \r\nstopped being prepared for or wanted to prepare for but didn't because I\r\n or someone else whose input I value\r\n thought I was being neurotic, and I am unprepared, and it sucks.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n What really gets my goat are the things I see\r\n coming that are so far-fetched as to make me look both neurotic AND \r\nparanoid when I prepare for them anyway but then happen as predicted.\u00a0 I\r\n enjoy being right as much as the next person, but these things \r\nfreak me out because I can't explain them.\u00a0\u00a0 The day after the \r\nminivan overheated, I had a familiar Very Bad Feeling.\u00a0 After some hemming and\r\n hawing I decided it was better to say something about it and then have \r\nnothing happen and look insane than to say nothing and have something \r\nhappen and feel like a jerk, so I said something.\u00a0 Even now I am kicking\r\n myself, because while I doubt my saying \"I feel like you're going to \r\nhave a seizure\" can make even the most obliging of husbands proceed to \r\ndo just that, the observer effect is real and I was NOT following the \r\nscientific method.\u00a0 I maybe should have written the date and \"totally \r\nsaw this coming\" on a slip of paper and tucked it into the vial of \r\nValium instead.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Hotter said \"okay\" and made sure he knew \r\nwhere the Valium was, and then we proceeded to bicker over my failure to\r\n buy an outdoor faucet handle and his taking that personally.\u00a0 I was \r\nlying on the bed working on the laptop and he was looking for something \r\nhe thought had fallen between the bed and the wall hovering kind of \r\nhalf-overtop of me.\u00a0 He made a snide comment about my ADD and I said \r\n\"well you know how Mr. Therapist says I need to work on being less afraid to \r\nexpress anger normally?\u00a0 HERE GOES!\" and told him what I thought of \r\nthat, and then he busted me in the face.\u00a0\u00a0 At least, that's what \r\nit seemed like, but actually he had had the seizure I had predicted.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n I'm not sure what the take-home message from this is, other than that \r\nour family therapist needs to give up on me ever doing much aside from nodding and smiling when I'm truly furious because \r\nthat fear that my displaying actual discernible anger would result in my\r\n (second) husband hitting me?\u00a0 NOW IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY!\u00a0 Well-played, \r\nuniverse.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am not a believer in psychic phenomena, Hotter \r\ndoesn't have any behavioral \"tells\" that either of us are aware of when \r\nhe's getting ready to have a seizure, and things that I can't come up \r\nwith a logical explanation for confound me utterly.\u00a0 I don't like this.\u00a0\r\n It makes my brain hurt and I think it's contributed in part to my \r\nrecent loss of equilibrium, although I think that's mostly due to the \r\nfact that my gut telling me to be very afraid for valid reasons and \r\nfears borne of neuroses/past traumas feels EXACTLY THE SAME. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 This is complicated by the fact that my gut is often right in \r\nways that might be neurotic for someone else with a very different life \r\nfrom mine, but are good sense if you're MFA Mama and have an elderly \r\nvehicle and a medically interesting husband you share a brain with, but I\r\n also have some fears that are just, well, fears.\u00a0 Last weekend's \r\nanger/seizure clusterf*ck aside, Hotter has never hit a woman, and I \r\nknow intellectually that he would rather chop off his arm than harm me, \r\nbut man, what a disaster that was!\u00a0\u00a0 I'm having a hard time \r\ntrying to learn to trust my gut on inexplicable matters that defy all \r\nlogic but ignore it when it shrieks about ducking and covering in a \r\nmarital disagreement when based on personal statistics, anyone I am as \r\nclose to as I am to Hotter (family members and lovers included; \r\nbasically any adult person I share a roof with) has about a seventy-five\r\n percent chance of beating me until I need medical attention.\u00a0 I'm good \r\nat logic, but it's no use around here lately, and I suck at trusting \r\nmyself or anyone else, which seems to be the only way to get through all\r\n of this.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hence my recent quiet and overabundance of angst.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 I had my quarterly appointment with my psychiatrist today \r\n(generally this is when he asks me if the Ritalin is still working for \r\nme, I say yes, and he writes for another 90-day fill of that), and I \r\ntold him what's been going on (and also the things that are Not To Be \r\nMentioned On The Innernet).\u00a0 He laughed ruefully and said that I \r\ncontinue to have the absolute worst luck of anyone he's ever seen and \r\nit's amazing I'm not insane, but that he still doesn't think I'm even \r\nclose.\u00a0 He agreed to up the antidepressant I've been taking for years in\r\n case that will help me cope, but deemed my recent issues with anxiety \r\nto be situational and appropriate under the circumstances.\u00a0 Which \r\ndoesn't make it any more enjoyable.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mercury had better get its arse out of retrograde or whatever the \r\ncrap is going on around here, because April is kicking the MFA Household\r\n in our collective junk with steel-toed shoes and I'm ready for a break.\u00a0\u00a0 And how are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/04/in-which-i-am-schooled-by-life-and-do-not-enjoy-it-an-explanation-of-sorts.html", "title": "in which I am schooled by life and do not enjoy it: an explanation of sorts"},

ask Dr. Shrink to replace a lost prescription for, and maybe the mail-order pharmacy is a bad idea for Ritalin, which is a very cheap drug, come to think of it), but what I haven't shared with y'all is the very real impact this is having on my ability not only to punctuate but also to hold a grudge.\u00a0\u00a0 Shut up.\u00a0 Seriously, that's important, because grudge-holding serves to help you communicate better with the offending party.\u00a0 Savoring your own fury indefinitely like an everlasting gobstopper may be a character flaw, but holding onto it long enough to package your dismay into a \"I feel x when you do y\" statement at least gives someone in your life the chance to stop being an asshole.\u00a0 And I?\u00a0 Can't stay pissed long enough to articulate it, and people continue being asinine, and not until they've sinned again and I'm overcome with white-hot d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu do I remember that this has Become A Problem, Crap.\u00a0\u00a0 I might think about it again, but not until after I've seen the offender again and greeted them like I'm their dog and they just came home from work, and then I look like I'm the one with the problem if halfway through kissing them hello I'm all \"Oh that's right--YOU FUCKING SHITHEAD!\"\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not saying I've never gone that route, just that it's a horrible idea, because if the other person is a man and they find my fury hilarious then suddenly I might break my perfectly good \"Patriarchy Be Cool!\" stick over their fool head and have to go out in the yard and find a new one to brandish when people are wrong on the Twitter.\u00a0\u00a0 Like last night, my nemesis ambushed me on the front porch and threatened to fling his vile little pod-body at my bare feet as I was coming into the house from slug-patrol (what, you don't round them up and flush them?\u00a0 Well then I'm sorry to tell you that you are not living), and I was afraid that if I opened the door enough to go inside the damn thing would GET INTO THE HOUSE, and that is uncool because we already have (in addition to the flock of chickens, food-dish-humping cockatiel, two rescued snakes and pair of small brown mice going by Thelma and Louise in case the big snake is hungry that we ALLOW in here because we're sick in the head) at least one skink (again) and a \"visitor mouse,\" as Hotter calls it, that I think is drawn to either the peanut butter or the lady mice in Poe's cage.\u00a0 We keep finding it on or around the cages, and I refuse to accept Hotter's explanation that Thelma and Louise are now charging locals out the arse to come teabag a real, live snake a la Balzac, but anyway yes, LOL VERMIN and FUCK NO, TOAD so I opened the door a tiny crack and yelled for my husband, who...didn't show up.\u00a0 Fortunately I do yoga and so I was able to contort myself in a manner that allowed me to grab a nearby broom without moving my feet (and thus provoking The Undertoad, as we've started to call him) and fend off my wretched foe, and once I was was armed and had hollered \"HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW?!?\" and brandished my weapon I was tickled enough that I called for Hotter AGAIN thinking he'd get a kick out this, since he likes The Undertoad and secretly roots for the damned thing and HE DID NOT ANSWER AGAIN.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, I'm not an unreasonable person, so when I did go inside I looked to see if Hotter was wearing his headphones, but y'all he wasn't, he was just playing his stupid computer game and ignoring me so yes, this was righteous fury, and I was all set to smite him when the toaster went off and I was like \"OH: bagels!\" and forgot to kill him and later when we were talking and I remembered and was like \"heeeey why didn't you answer me, earlier?\"\u00a0\u00a0 If he'd copped to just being really caught up in something I think I might've been able to resist the call of the Crazy, but no he denied hearing me either time, which was clearly bogus, so then I was like \"suuuure so basically I could have been eaten by a bear and you would have just let it happen.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Of course not, you wouldn't get eaten by a bear in the first place,\" he said, all patronizing, and it was on.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I could SO have been eaten by a bear!\u00a0 There was a bear sighting in this area a couple of years ago!\u00a0 A black bear, but still--\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Aww a black bear.\u00a0 If you'd said a brown bear I could maybe see it, but--\"\u00a0\u00a0 And see, then I felt like I had to stand up for the bears, because he was being patronizing toward them too, and I was all \"Black bears can fuck you up, y'know.\u00a0 Just because they're like the black labs of the bear scene doesn't mean they want to fetch you your slippers and snuggle by the fire.\u00a0 I read one time where one mauled somebody so badly they had to have a glass eye and a prosthetic face, okay?\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"They'd be afraid of you, though, you'd just have to make yourself look big and scary and yell at them, they'd back down.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"BULLSHIT!\u00a0 What if I didn't see it coming because hello, it's night-time, they're black bears!\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"I don't think they're nocturnal.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Yeah well, if it came to attack me during the day I might not necessarily notice in time to be scary, I could be out there spending quality time with Belleruth* all in the zone, mentally summoning the presence of everyone who's ever supported and cared for me, calling every good wish home, every positive thought and--RAWR!--EATEN BY A BEAR!\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Maybe they are nocturnal.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Okay, so if it's out during the day it's rabid, way to make me feel better, then it doesn't even have to eat my face because it's infectious!\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Your mom is infectious.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"PROBABLY!\"\u00a0\u00a0 So yeah, now I'm starting to wonder whether he really lost the thing at all; maybe it was premeditated because he planned to be a jerk until after his surgery?\u00a0 I don't know.\u00a0 And now I'm kind of depressed, but not suicidal or anything, or even if I was, I'd never get around to doing anything about it.\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 I wasn't really worried about the black bears though, or at least I wasn't until I started defending them, but now I don't know, I mean they are still bears.\u00a0 Maybe I should start playing Bingo just to be on the safe side.\u00a0\u00a0 Also those little cilantro and chicken mini-wontons from Trader Joe's are amazing.\u00a0 That is all.*\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, that's right.\u00a0 I listen to guided imagery (specifically the album for transforming anxiety) on my iPod at full-blast while I mow and that is why I love the mowing so--because it's what I do when I am about to come unhinged.\u00a0 I stop, take a deep breath, and go fill the mower with gas and I tell myself that if I still need to cut a bitch after I've burned a gallon with Belleruth, the good kitchen knives will be right where I left them.\u00a0 I even named the lawnmower Belleruth.\u00a0 Shut up, plenty of perfectly sane people name their lawnmowers after famous psychotherapists and everything is normal here.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n

{"date": "June  9, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 The chickens are now three weeks old, and good lord they grow fast.\u00a0 Look at Speck!\r\n  Figure One: Looks pretty much like a chicken now, doesn't she (a chicken wearing a ratty maribou boa, but still, totally a chicken))?\u00a0 I found Little Child squatting over the chickens' box yesterday and asked him what he was doing, and he very earnestly informed me that \"I was jus' telling the chickens IT LAYS THE EGGS OR IT GETS THE HOSE, Mommy, that's all.\"*\u00a0\u00a0 Gender relations are a hot-button issue here lately at Casa MFA.\u00a0 Not only has the ongoing chicken-sexing debacle been at the forefront of dinner conversation (out of six supposedly female chickens, two are definitely cocks and one is a maybe, which is either a 33% or 50% rate of inaccuracy--well above the \"industry standard\" margin of error mypetchicken.com claims, which is 10%, and while they'll refund the difference in price for the incorrectly-sexed birds, that's only $0.50 per bird and their offer to throw in a free chick on my next order doesn't help me find homes for two or three cocks and I still have to pay the shipping, which is the expensive part, plus they won't do anything for thirteen to fifteen weeks by which point introducing new babies to the flock would be...fraught), but Big Child uttered some words that will live in infamy last night, words that have gotten under Mama's skin.\u00a0\u00a0 Do you want to know what that child said?\u00a0\u00a0 See, I debated whether or not to even share this, but we were talking about balls last night after dinner here, because Little Child was darting back and forth while animatedly telling us a story about something I've already forgotten, and as he darted back and forth he was whacking Hotter with his outstretched arm on each pass to and fro, and Little Child's arm outstretched at the shoulder is about an inch below The Danger Zone on your average adult male.\u00a0 Hotter was caught up in how cute the story was and trying manfully not to laugh (and also assuming a more guarded stance), but I decided that this was a teachable moment.\u00a0 Because see, Little Child gets away with a lot of really obnoxious crap by virtue of being little and adorable and medically-fragile, but the fact of the matter is that he is going to kindergarten next year and I feel we owe it to society to turn him into a human being before that occurs, which means less eating with his hands, finding his Inside Voice, wiping his own arse, and not running back and forth whacking people in their junk while he's telling a story.\u00a0 So I said \"Little Child, stop hitting Hotter please, you're about to hit him in his junk and that will NOT be funny.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"What, you mean his balls,\" Little Child asked.\u00a0 Big Child, who was sitting on the couch, leaned forward expectantly and Middly's eyes lit up with Bad Fun.\u00a0\u00a0 \"That's right, you don't hit Hotter in his balls.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Little Child stamped his tiny foot.\u00a0 \"But I hit Daddy in his balls ALL THE TIME,\" he pouted, and y'all, he does.\u00a0 I've seen it.\u00a0 Little Child tends to greet his father by running up to him like a tiny linebacker and BLAM!\u00a0 Right in the junk.\u00a0 And his father wheezes and clutches himself and goes \"NOT IN THE PEE-PEE LITTLE CHILD, NOT IN THE PEE-PEE, OH GOD\" but doesn't put a hand out and stop the kid or enact a predictable consequence or anything, and if it was anyone else I would step in but I have decided that this falls squarely into the category of \"not my problem.\"\u00a0 Plus it's hilarious.\u00a0 The XY's balls are expendable.\u00a0 I would, however, prefer that the children not maul their step-father's balls, because it makes him sad and could potentially result in Mama not getting laid should the great GI Debacle of 2010 ever fuck on off the way it ought to before Hotter's surgery.\u00a0\u00a0 So I said \"well, if your father lets you hit him in the balls then those are Daddy's Rules and that's all fine and good, but Daddy's Rules stay at Daddy's House, and in our house we have Mommy and Hotter's rules, which include not hitting Hotter in the balls because it could really hurt him and that's not nice.\"\u00a0 Yes, I seriously had this conversation!\u00a0 I know, I'm still reeling myself; I did not at any time during my graduate studies at a top-five school in my field picture myself unpublished and lecturing my third (!!!) child about about hitting his stepfather in the junk at this point in my life, but it happens, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0 Big Child, who has a fine future ahead of him in litigation (if no one kills him first), swooped in and said \"wait, Mommy, I thought hitting was never okay, and if he shouldn't hit Hotter in the...private...then he shouldn't do it to Daddy either.\u00a0 I think you should punish him.\"\u00a0 Big Child is possessed of a rather Victorian sensibility and also apparently a death wish.\u00a0\u00a0 I looked at Hotter and then very deliberately did not look at Hotter, because he was crying silent tears of mirth behind his hand and that was Not Helpful, and said \"well, Big Child, as we have discussed I have no control over Daddy's Rules and I don't punish y'all for things you do at his house because I'm not there to see it happen and my rules are different anyway.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Well still!\u00a0 It looks like you're trying not to laugh, which means you think Daddy getting hit in his...man area...is funny, and you shouldn't think that's funny, it's MEAN, what if Little Child really hurts Daddy's...\" and he gesticulated in front of his pelvis.\u00a0\u00a0 I did laugh a little bit then, because I challenge you to keep a straight face in a situation like that, and said \"well buddy that's kind of the way it goes in a divorce.\u00a0 The ex-wife wants bad things to happen to the ex-husband's genitals and if your father is letting Little Child hit him in his balls then I might go ahead and laugh, and yes, it's mean, but you'd laugh too if it wasn't your father and Daddy is no longer part of my family.\u00a0 Plus if it's hurting him he should make Little Child cut it out.\u00a0 Until he does, I'm sorry son but I find this hilarious.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Three quarters of the people who were not me did exactly what I wanted them to at this point and cracked up laughing and yelling out various names for male genitalia and were generally ripe for a Changing Of The Subject.\u00a0 Big Child, however, said \"MOMMY!\u00a0 Shame on you, you need to STOP saying balls and STOP talking about balls!\u00a0 It's...inappropriate...for a woman to discuss these things!\"\u00a0\u00a0 What?\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter and I both stopped laughing and gawked at Big Child.\u00a0 \"You just messed up,\" said Hotter.\u00a0 \"In fact, I'm going to move over here to where I am not between you and your mother...\" and he did, too.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Why,\" Big Child demanded belligerently.\u00a0 He could tell he'd stepped in it, I think, but apparently decided to go down with his ship (he gets that from his father).\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone looked at me and I was still speechless.\u00a0 \"Be...cause you just made a sweeping generalization, and those are always offensive to someone, plus they're faulty logic,\" Hotter finally said, \"and the one you made was a really bad choice on top of that in that you were talking about women, and your mother is a feminist who yells about faulty logic in her sleep.\u00a0 Big mistake.\u00a0 Huge.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"WELL IT'S THE TRUTH, WOMEN SHOULDN'T--\"\u00a0\u00a0 At that point I regained the ability to speak and asked what women shouldn't do.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Talk about...nasty things...like...\"\u00a0 Big Child trailed off and looked at me like I was some kind of idiot.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Like balls?\u00a0 Why shouldn't women talk about balls?\u00a0 Because they don't have them?\u00a0 Because that's nasty and women should only talk about nice things?\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"YES,\" said Big Child.\u00a0 \"Suitable things.\u00a0 Balls are not suitable for women to discuss, especially mothers.\"\u00a0\u00a0 At that point Hotter really did cover his balls, and Middly even stopped chanting \"BALLSballsballsballsBALLS!\" and, when he saw the look on my face, looked over at Big Child as if he was waiting to see him vaporize on the spot.\u00a0\u00a0 \"So by having a child, a woman gives up her right to discuss certain topics?\u00a0 Is that what you're saying,\" I asked pleasantly (as I've mentioned before, I get extremely pleasant when I'm furious, more so than if I'm actually in a congenial mood, and it freaks people out and I am working on expressing anger in ways that others can more easily recognize).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"Well no, it's just that women who are mothers shouldn't--\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"STOP generalizing!\u00a0 Do you really feel like you are at a point in your education where you can take and defend the position that all women or all mothers or all any group should or shouldn't do or say anything?\u00a0 YOU ARE NINE, you don't get to say what anyone should or shouldn't, you get to say how YOU feel and ask grown-ups questions, and learn about things, and that is pretty much it,\" I reminded him.\u00a0 \"Make I statements.\u00a0 What is this really about?\u00a0 Tell me how YOU feel, and leave society and all women as a sex and all women who are mothers out of this.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"I...don't feel like y-y-youImeanMY mother, who is a woman, should talk about balls in front of me.\u00a0 It makes me uncomfortable,\" Big Child said, looking rather deflated.\u00a0 And yes, actually I did feel like an asshole, a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Okay, that's better.\u00a0 That's helping ME understand how YOU feel about a SPECIFIC situation, and I'm sorry that makes you uncomfortable.\u00a0 I don't really enjoy discussing your father's junk either, and I hope it...the subject...doesn't come up again.\u00a0 As your parent, though, and yes, your mother who is a woman, it is my job to say something if your four-year-old brother is getting ready to hit someone in their balls or anywhere else in my house whether either one of us like that or not.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"And I am happy to discuss anything with you, at any time, if you're uncomfortable talking about it with your mother, but that's not because I'm any better at explaining stuff than she is, that has to do with your level of comfort, not her level of knowledge about whatever it is or whether it is a suitable topic for her to discuss.\u00a0 Period,\" Hotter chimed in (have I mentioned that I love him and plan to keep him?).\u00a0 \"Now who wants DESSERT?\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 That was the end of the discussion, thankfully.\u00a0 I was very relieved, and I'll admit that I felt a little...not out of my depth but...tenuous.\u00a0 We were on new ground with that discussion, and honestly y'all you're prepared to hear \"I hate you\" and \"you embarrass me\" from your kids, and when there's a divorce involved you're even prepared (if you go to family therapy regularly) to confront qualities of your former spouse's in your children that may trigger you and not snap and do anything that rends the fabric of human decency, but...what I was not prepared for was for the raw, primordial components of a little baby misogynist to come together before my very eyes and rise up from the swamp to hiss at me.\u00a0\u00a0 This is troubling to me, y'all.\u00a0 It isn't Big Child's fault that whatever he's exposed to when he is at his father's house or at school is causing him to flirt with fallacious reasoning and even outright chauvenism, nor is it mine, but it IS my job to Fix This Mess and raise him to be a more educated, rational, morally upright man than his father is and I plan to ask our family therapist for some pointers here before I go off half-cocked (ha!\u00a0 I said cock!) and start reading him Betty Friedman and Sharon Olds at bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0 So.\u00a0 Back to actual cocks and what to do about them in the avian context.\u00a0 Not only do I have at least two cocks...\r\n Figure Two: Not a hen.\u00a0\u00a0 ...but I also have to figure out something to do with them, and now I'm worried about the message this is sending to the boys.\u00a0 Because chickens aren't very good examples of gender relations as is appropriate in human society.\u00a0 The hens really do pretty much sit around eating bon-bons and cranking out offspring:\r\n  Figure Three: Speck really has gotten full of herself.\u00a0 Also, chocolate is actually toxic to birds.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 And the cocks...well, all they do is scream their fool heads off, fight, and fornicate, and then you have to either lock them up or send them away because they beat the hens up and the neighbors get tired of the ruckus and...okay, fine, chickens are a perfect example of gender relations circa my first marriage. \u00a0\u00a0 Balls.\u00a0\u00a0 Well anyway, here's what the chickens look like now:\r\n  Figure Four: The one on the left is a hen.\u00a0 The one on the right is...most likely not a hen...and today I feel perfectly capable of wringing its neck for that alone.\u00a0\u00a0 And how are all of YOU?*\u00a0\u00a0 No, my four-year-old has not seen The Silence of The Lambs, at least not at my house.\u00a0 Hotter and I like to say \"or it gets the hose\" and he was probably copying that, although his father has seen fit to let him watch R-rated movies in the past, so who knows.\u00a0 I seriously doubt he knew he was quoting anyone but Hotter.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "June 16, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 This morning I took Hotter to see his new neurologist.\u00a0 It takes a while to get in with them, see, and this was his first time seeing neurology since moving here.\u00a0 This involved getting up heinously early and dropping the older two MFA Children at a neighbor's house to wait for it to be schoolbus time, going downtown, and dealing with the Major Teaching Hospital valets (remind me to tell you sometime about my ongoing jihad against the entire hospital parking system).*\u00a0\u00a0 I big-puffy-heart Hotter's new neurologist, who we'll call Dr. Brain.\u00a0 Not only is he clearly excellent at what he does (he took a comprehensive history and discussed all the ways that Hotter's various health concerns could affect his seizure threshold, risk of another stroke, etc. and stopped in his exam to explain things to his resident then to us in layperson-friendly terms), but he's also a really nice guy (the first neurologist I've ever met who wasn't a flaming arsehole, actually) and rather amusing in that he clearly suffers from raging ADD.\u00a0 After asking where Hotter was from he exclaimed \"______ Park!\u00a0 They have that crazy wooden roller-coaster there, I went with my summer-camp group when I was eleven, that thing is SCARY, what was it called, oh, heck, GOOGLE can tell us,\" and then proceeded to Google the amusement park in question muttering \"c'mooooon, take me back, YES!\"*\u00a0\u00a0 The only part of the appointment I didn't love was the part where Dr. Brain used an ultra-sensitive electronic stethoscope to listen to the blood flow in some major arteries having to do with Hotter's brain and then suddenly paused like a setter pointing at a game bird, yanked the earpieces out while holding the end of the stethoscope in place, handed them to his resident, and said \"listen to this!\"\u00a0 It's never a good sign when they use you or your loved one as a teaching case.*\u00a0\u00a0 The long and short of it is that Hotter may need neurosurgery on a rather emergent basis, as in I am taking him back to Major Teaching Hospital tonight for an MRI/MRA and we may be doing this either instead of or in addition to the planned surgeries on Friday.\u00a0 As Dr. Brain said, \"SCREW the surgi-ma-callit-itis, the brain always takes priority and anesthesia won't put you to sleep for anything else until this is fixed anyway.\"*\u00a0\u00a0 There's still a chance that this isn't a majorly big deal, because while there is definitely Something Very Wrong, the problem is in one of two arteries, and if it's one then yes, immediate neurosurgery, but if it's the other the worst-case scenario is facial paralysis (and nobody wants to operate in this area over possible facial paralysis).\u00a0 That would be a bummer, but not as much as another paralytic stroke would.*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm really glad, in retrospect, that we got bumped on Monday even though it sucked mightily at the time; if it's the one of the two arteries that would necessitate surgery then general anesthesia on Monday without knowing about this could have been catastrophic.\u00a0 I am not, however, amused by these shenanigans in the least and would really like for the Universe to stop kicking my family in our collective junk.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/06/in-which-this-isnt-all-that-funny-anymore.html", "title": "in which this isn't all that funny anymore"},

I couldn't approve them.*\u00a0\u00a0 Also when I tried to update the billing information I kept getting a message that what I'd been trying to do had failed for unknown reasons, and then Typepad was all \"yeah, you have to switch to the NEW Typepad to make that change.\"\u00a0 Which, well, why not just say so in the error message instead of \"unknown reasons\" if you know that's what it is?\u00a0 So I switched to the new Typepad and added my billing information and then switched back, because I hate the new Typepad with a white-hot passion.\u00a0 It's not better than old Typepad, just different and, in my humble opinion, not as intuitive or user-friendly.\u00a0 Ptooey, ptooey, ptooey!*\u00a0\u00a0 At some point we need to talk about the personality transplant The XY has apparently received courtesy of benevolent aliens, because not only did he take the MFA Children for Hotter's surgery and keep them longer than planned due to Hotter trying to up and die on me, but he also VOLUNTARILY kept them an extra night just because (which was more than fine with me because I got a total of maybe thirteen hours' sleep in seventy-two hours and was a wreck last night when they were supposed to come home) and hasn't yelled at me or called me names in WEEKS.\u00a0 At first it was super-nice and I guess it still is, but it's also more than a little bit creepy.\u00a0 I'm not complaining, exactly, it's just very unsettling to have him be polite, reasonable, and interested in being a father after a solid decade of pleas to abort, domestic abuse, and legal/financial murder/suicide on his part.\u00a0 Now I'm the arsehole if I question his motivation and don't relax certain boundaries given his new attitude, so I'm playing along, but I also don't trust the SOB and keep waiting for the boom to drop.*\u00a0\u00a0 Motherfucking Poe BIT ME.\u00a0 I guess it's my fault for not handling him much as we prepared for Hotter's surgery (and we were gone for a couple of days) but damn, yo, I saved your life!\u00a0 I mean yeah, I knew damn well he was a snake, but...as terri c. noted, it's like Poe is holding the XY's personality for him.\u00a0 Which he can keep doing, since Poe is easier to contain than the XY, but I miss the nice, latent homosexual creature I rescued from the mean streets and...OMG it is JUST LIKE my first marriage!\u00a0 I'm wondering if this means that I should get rid of Poe, or whether I'm reading too much into this, or...gah!\u00a0 Anyway it TOTALLY broke the skin but I've kept Mupirocin on it and that stuff kills everything so hopefully it won't get infected.\u00a0 That would really suck.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Middle Child has had a birthday (his sixth), and was very depressed and saying he was a bad boy, didn't deserve to have a birthday, and would give away any presents he received to his brothers or Hotter because Middly = bad.\u00a0 Which is just so VERY untrue; Middly is the best-behaved MFA Child most days.\u00a0 The XY has even noticed this and mentioned it to me, and Hotter and I are addressing it with the family therapist, but this is almost as awkward as it is sad because I think most of Middly's ennui is him feeling \"guilty\" for telling on the XY for doing some heinous things that other grownups ABSOLUTELY needed to know about during the ugly days of the divorce.\u00a0 Which I can't exactly say to the XY, who sees himSELF as the victim in all of this (or seemed to last time we spoke of that hot mess, by which I mean the last time he screamed at me about it in a police station parking lot).\u00a0 Gah!\u00a0 Anyway clinically depressed six-year-olds are really heartbreaking, desperate times call for desperate measures, and we got Middly a puppy for his birthday.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Puppies always win; Middle Child decided right there on the spot that he would keep at least this one gift.\u00a0 Hotter and I have been planning this since before the mama dog was even bred (our next-door neighbor is the breeder) and I've wanted to get the boys (especially Middle Child, given that kids with developmental delays can really benefit from animal companions) a dog for a while, it was just never a good time what with my traveling back and forth to see Hotter before we got married and me working and probably it'll never be a \"good\" time but on July 12th Casa MFA will get that much crazier (that's when MFA Puppy \r\nwill be seven weeks old and ready to come home).\u00a0 Plus look, aww:\r\n  Figure One: No really, AWW!\u00a0 Yes, she is a pitbull.\u00a0 Try not to be terrified, I realize she is very fierce-looking.\u00a0 They're wonderful family dogs if you treat them well and this breeder raises show dogs, not fighters.\u00a0 I know some of you are probably wondering why I didn't get a pound puppy or rescue dog, and under different circumstances I absolutely would, but with an organ-transplant recipient on immunosuppressive drugs, two children with developmental delays, and one child with a weak native immune system in the house, it was absolutely necessary to not only know our prospective dog's entire social history but also their medical history from day one in order to have this be safe for the entire family.\u00a0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/MFA_Mama", "http://www.winecat.typepad.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFQ6zZ5aID4", "http://www.ps121ismyfriend.blogspot.com/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834013484b100fd970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/06/catchup-and-a-new-family-member.html", "title": "catch-up and a new family member"},

They seem pretty impressed with my brainstorming/problem-solving abilities, too:\r\nCo-worker #1: Hey MFA Mama, could you call the maintenance guy on duty to lift this giant suitcase full of books over the hallway to the carpet on the other side for me, please? If I drag it I'm afraid it'll scratch the hallway floor and The Boss will kill me.\r\nCo-worker #2: He's REALLY busy. He says he's gonna throw something at the next person to ask him to do ANYTHING. Have fun with that!MFA Mama: How about you just drag it REALLY FAST and if anybody asks we'll all say we have NO idea who did it?Co-worker #2: MUCH better plan!Co-worker #1: Ummmyeah except there's probably a camera that would capture my face.Co-worker #2: Riiiight. Crap.MFA Mama: You both give up too easily. Here's what you do, Co-worker #1, for occasions such as this. You carry a ketchup packet on your person at all times, and if you absolutely MUST drag something heavy across a freshly-polished floor on camera you squirt a little behind each ear and under your chin, make sure the camera gets a GOOD look, and then you call in and you have to sound really BEAT UP and you tell The Boss a masked assailant hit you over the head and STOLE YOUR FACE like in The Silence of The Lambs, and because he has that sense of context he'll believe you. But then you have to disappear for a few weeks, and you can pretty much only use this once.\r\nCo-worker #1: Wow. I... *wanders off looking dazed*\r\nCo-worker #2: You? Are brilliant.

I work seven days a week when I can get the hours, and spent Saturday and Sunday both at Weekend Warrior Job, so I find all the OMG Monday-ing on everyone's part to be just a little precious. But because I'm a receptionist during the week, I have to make sympathetic noises to over a thousand employees and visitors here at PseudoCorp when they point out that it's OMG Monday and sounds of agreement over the need for more coffee in everyone's life.* \u00a0 I do very much like PseudoCorp as an entity, and everyone here seems very nice, but running the front desk here must be what it's like to be an air traffic controller. In between all of the good-morninging and OMG-Mondaying I have to check visitors and contractors in, answer several lines at once, accept small deliveries for everyone who forgot their lunch or their phone at home, call people taxis, take delivery of their rental cars, coordinate with security and the visitor center on meetings and their guest lists, and smile the whole goddamn time.\r\n* \u00a0 I don't love corporate culture.\r\n* \u00a0 I might have a new stress fracture despite all my precautions (I'm hoping I'm wrong and it's just...I don't know, something ELSE), and if it's any worse after tonight's run it'll be walking only for a month or so.

So that was fun.\r\n* \u00a0 I found the PERFECT holiday gift for Middle Child! He's been begging and begging for a laptop, and I've been telling him and telling him that second graders do not NEED laptops and the only reason Big Child got one was that it had been mine and he was older, but Middly's really been pining and today 1SaleADay had little seven-inch Android netbooks (factory refurbished, but still!) for $59.99 (the deal is good for another two hours after I post this if any of y'all are interested...I don't get any kind of referral bonus or anything but occasionally you can get really cool stuff on the cheap and it's worth signing up for 1SaleADay to see if anything strikes your fancy in my humble opinion, especially if you're trying to do the holidays on a budget). He's going to shit himself, y'all!\r\n* \u00a0 Tonight when I got home I actually had a GOOD run for the first time in a WHILE and that was awesome. I'm still a little sore, but not to the point where I didn't enjoy myself; Bumpus and I covered a respectable 1.86 miles and I don't know about HIM but I totally got a runner's high, which is one of my favorite feelings. I skipped running yesterday because it was raining mixed with some actual SNOW (what the actual FUCK, Nature? It is OCTOBER and this is the SOUTH!), and while I don't mind running in a light rain, I'm not THAT hardcore and was worried about taking my lungs out running in upper 30s/lower 40s (I have ordered a mask that's supposed to allow asthmatics to enjoy all sorts of cold-weather activities, but it hasn't yet arrived). Tonight it's not precipitating although it's even COLDER, so I wrapped a scarf around my face and secured it with a hooded sweatshirt layer, and that worked pretty well.\r\n* \u00a0 I got a very sweet card today from k.

{"date": "September 21, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Ooookay, so back a couple of days ago before my own eye-doctor dropped the boom on me about my vision, I was bouncing-off-the-walls kind of happy because I had arranged to bring you a truly awesome giveaway.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As y'all know, I had to let some things slide due to finances...things like prescription eyeglasses\u00a0(and of course the tooth, which is getting permanently fixed TOMORROW thanks to the wonderful people over at Brighter and my friend Morgan), and I know a lot of y'all are probably struggling, too. So when Eye Buy Direct asked me if I wanted to do a review and giveaway where I would get a free pair of eyeglasses for myself and one for a reader I was allll over that!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was a little curious how it would all work, but it was surprisingly simple. I got my vision checked (well okay, there was nothing simple about that for ME but chance are YOU will have better results), and had my doctor give me a copy of my prescription (which was greek to me, but I just made sure I could read all of the letters and numbers). She mentioned that when you buy eyeglasses online you often need to know your PD (pupillary distance) and had me go and get that measured by a nice lady who gave me two different numbers, but also explained that if the website I was using asked for one number I could get that by adding the two. With my prescription in-hand I went home to look at some glasses!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The selection on the website was pretty extensive, but my biggest reservation had to do with how I would tell what would look good on my face. I've been wearing glasses since I was two, and have therefore picked out enough pairs to know that what looks good on the shelf doesn't necessarily look good on your face (in fact, sometimes it will make you look like a bug-eyed stick insect...or worse, your own elderly grandmother). This is where it got SUPER-cool, though--YOU CAN TRY THE GLASSES ON ONLINE by either capturing a picture with your webcam or uploading one that you have in digital format! I decided to use my webcam since I was already wearing glasses in all of the pictures I already had of me, and GET THIS: the website estimated my pupillary distance from the webcam capture! It wasn't exactly what the optometrist who took mine in-person got with her machine, but it was very, very close and I was impressed that the website was able to do that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Y'all know how I am about maintaining my pseudonymity, so I can't show you a picture of my new glasses on MY face. I did, however, find a member of the MFA Family who didn't mind modeling them:\r\n Figure One: I thought models weren't supposed to eat??? She snarfed a TON of liversnacks during our photo-shoot. Also, apparently we have the same pupillary distance? Or else possibly the dogface threw off the program. Which means that if you're ordering glasses online for your dog you may want to have someone check that in person.\u00a0Oh, god, nobody is ever going to work with me on a giveaway again, are they?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was going to wait until my glasses arrived to actually post this, but then I decided to see if Eye Buy Direct participated in eBates and LO! When you go on eBates' site and search for the company you can not only get 7% cashback (not that it's much, because these are incredibly cheap eyeglasses, but every little bit, right?) but ALSO 20% off your order with an eBates-only coupon code through the end of the month, and I didn't want those of y'all who don't win to miss out on that deal if you really need some new glasses! It almost made me sad that my pair was free...almost.\r\nTo enter to win a $30 gift voucher to use toward your own pair of prescription eyeglasses from Eye Buy Direct (designer eyewear and sunglasses excluded):\u00a0Go and pick out a pair of frames, and EITHER visit\u00a0EyeBuyDirect.com on Facebook\u00a0and \"like\" those frames OR tweet \"I love (frame name) @EyeBuyDirect.com\" on the Twitter, then leave me a comment on this post saying which of those two things you did.\u00a0\r\nExtra entries (for each extra entry, please leave me a SEPARATE comment telling me what you did):\r\n1.\u00a0\u2018Like\u2019\u00a0EyeBuyDirect.com\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook, become a fan.\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Follow\u00a0EyeBuyDirect\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter (leave your Twitter handle in your comment).\r\n3.\u00a0 Post your\u00a0\"Eye Try\"\u00a0photo with your favorite frame to the\u00a0Wall of Frame.\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Post a comment\u00a0to the\u00a0Wall of Frame\u00a0- Help other visitors choose which frames suit them best!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'll choose a winner via random.org the evening of Wednesday, September 28th and e-mail them (so make sure you leave me a good e-mail address with your comment, because if I don't hear back from the winner within 48 hours I'll let random.org pick again).

I have truly never worked with such a nice group of people though, to the point that it's almost creepy. I haven't seen anyone get angry or visibly frustrated, heard one word of ill out of anyone's mouth about a fellow employee, caught the rough side of anybody's temper...and that's everyone on up the foodchain, too (part of my job is to run the mailroom and deliver messages and documents, so I see everybody daily). The company even stocks a sweet basket (Tootsie Pops and miniature candybars and full-size cereal bars as well as mints and gum and jawbreakers), a salty basket (bags of various chips, packets off peanut-butter crackers, etc.), a fruit basket, and a single-dose over-the-counter medication basket for the employees! There are complimentary Torani syrups by the coffee machine in the break room and bottles of water in the fridge...hell, today someone gifted me with a large basket of fresh-dug sweet potatoes, for crying out loud. They're generous with office supplies, eager to know whether your chair is comfortable enough, nobody minds if you take your iPhone everywhere with you and listen to Pandora while you work as long as you use earbuds...I am getting a cold and three different higher-ups noticed me sniffling and urged me to take the day of tomorrow if I'm not feeling 100%. Seriously, where is the catch? And when the mothership comes to beam these benevolent aliens back up and take them back to their home planet, can I go with them?\r\n* \u00a0 I haven't heard anything from CATHERINE! today (she was supposed to be e-mailing me some pictures of the destroyed vehicle and the XY's head; the boys are anxious to see the damage) and I'm actually a little worried since she said the doctors told her the XY's concussion would get worse before it got better. Hopefully he's making a speedy recovery and has merely forbidden her to speak to me, and he'll soon be back at work earning child support money and oozing his misleading charm all over anyone who doesn't run away fast enough. I keep having to remind myself not to feel too sorry for the SOB; just because he almost succeeded in killing his damnfool self doesn't mean he isn't as evil as ever.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter and I got to giggling last night when I said CATHERINE! sounded like she was kind of hoping we'd offer to babysit her concussed adult toddler (and his elderly and very ill father, who he's apparently been taking care of)...he was like \"hey, if somebody'd pay me I'd take 'em, I've already got the boys and the dogs and the chickens, what's two more? I'd have 'em in bed by eight-thirty, too! You'd call home to check on us and I'd be like 'Hi honey, we're good LITTLE CHILD DON'T HIT YOUR GRANDFATHER! Everybody had their gruel and I'm about to turn them out into the yard for a b--XY, that's two and if you get to three your Blackberry will go in the no-no bag!'\" Maybe you had to be there but I seriously about died laughing.\r\n* \u00a0 I really hope I don't wake up sick as a dog.

The XY nodded off behind the wheel of her truck this afternoon and flipped it five times a few hundred yards from her house; she was pretty convinced he was going to die.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I told CATHERINE! not to worry, that the XY is basically a human cockroach and you can't kill the arsehole with a meat cleaver, gave her his blood type and SSN just in case and tried to get back into my data-entry groove. But I kept getting texts asking for his mother's phone number, etc. (which I couldn't look up at work because using the office computers for anything but business is a big no-no and I have all of those people blocked on the facespace), and after I spent fifteen minutes in the hallway bellowing at my ex-father-in-law (for whom English is not his first, or even his second or third language and who also sufffers from dementia) to get him to have the XY's mother (who is evil personified and still, as of this afternoon, a huge bitch) call me so that I could get her number for CATHERINE! (I didn't have it in me to give her CATHERINE'S number and therefore unleash her on the poor woman, and I know from experience that the Local Teaching Hospital ED has shitty reception anyway), I finally gave in to my coworkers' entreaties that I take the rest of the day off and went home in high dudgeon.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The XY is going to be fine; he apparently has a huge laceration up the back of his head (which sucks for him since he rocks the totally bald look and couldn't grow enough hair to cover it if he tried), diminished breath sounds (so possible pneumo/hemothorax, I'm guessing), and a probable broken shoulder. Wah.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Lest you think me entirely heartless, I surprised myself by actually feeling sorry for the XY, because apparently he and CATHERINE! are on the rocks and as of the last time I spoke to her, she was disgusted with him for flipping her truck and then crying about it like a big bitch-baby. I was actually kind of appalled to hear that she was leaving him in the hospital by himself because \"if I keep looking at that head-wound I will THROW UP, I've already reassured him that he isn't dying, GAWD!\" I mean, I know what it's like to be in the hospital alone and scared and afraid you're dying, mostly because the XY left ME in those very circumstances on several occasions (at one point actually bitching that I hadn't arranged childcare, necessitating his early departure from his workplace, and informing me that he was \"out of sympathy\" -- that was actually the exact moment when I stopped loving him), but still. The poor asshole's never spent the night in Club Med or even had an IV and is usually pretty much impervious to pain (physical or emotional). It made me feel bad to hear that he was crying.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Just not bad enough to actually drive downtown and fuss over him.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm really hoping that tomorrow * will represent time spent fapping or having a quickie with my husband. Or at least something that doesn't involve someone else's medical emergency. A girl can dream, right?\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. The MFA Children are fine. I brought a box of doughnuts home from work (a co-worker brought them in for everyone and there were extras that they sent me home with) and they were pretty much like \"he's not dead? Okay, may we please have our doughnuts now?\" They're mostly just bummed that the truck didn't burst into flames, and that they won't get their weekly fast-food fix at Daddy Dinner Visitation (I dunno if the XY will even be out of the hospital by Wednesday, much less up to taking three children anywhere).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834015391de6735970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/09/twenty-four-hour-again-spoiler-yesterday-was-better.html", "title": "twenty-four hour, again (spoiler: yesterday was better)"},

I think I'm going to try and go for something new(ish) so it won't be obsolete and hard to buy ink/toner for, but I'm still pondering. I'm about 90% sure I want a laser printer seeing as how ink cartridges are so expensive and tetchy. Please continue to leave me tips and printer anecdotes in the comments of this post, particularly if you have a printer you love and would recommend or that you hate(d) and found to be Of The Devil.\r\n* \u00a0 I totally scored yesterday; Hotter is always cold and already starting to suffer now that night-time temperatures are dropping, so I decided to at least price silk longjohns (expecting them to be way out of my price-range), but lo! I found them online for a very good sale price, searched and found a coupon for a further 20% off, and got cash back with eBates besides! In the end, including shipping, I paid just under $28 for a set. WHOO TITS! Y'all should totally join eBates if you haven't already (in the name of disclosure, that link gives me a $5 referral bonus and YOU GET $5 TOO!).\r\n* \u00a0 My back is aching a lot recently, perhaps because of the chilly weather? I'm not enjoying it one little bit.\r\n* \u00a0 Thursday I go back to the dentist to get the permanent crown installed on That Tooth, and I still can't thank Brighter.com enough!\r\n* \u00a0 If any of you would like a follow on Twitter, please do let me know in the comments section of this post if I'm not following you already! I love connecting with blog-readers on there and promise not to put you on the \"meh\" list.\r\n* \u00a0 Big Child got his second tick on his private manly area in a week while at his father's, and the XY scolded me about it like it was MY doing, and I told him that if I had a dollar for every time I've bellowed at people in this house that they need to stop doing whatever it is they're doing with their units to get ticks on them he wouldn't even NEED to pay child support and then told Big Child one more time for good measure, adding that if I never had to discuss anyone's penis with the XY again it would be too soon, and he totally laughed in my face, the little butthead. Seriously though, I'm starting to consider buckling a flea and tick collar somewhere that would probably get me arrested if the guidance counselor heard about it. BOYS!\r\n* \u00a0 My Klout score is making me seasick with all the bobbing up and down. Klout is kind of a cool idea, but I think it fails in that people mostly just give +Ks to their friends or people who have +Ked THEM, and tend to just click on the first topic they see (or one of the top three) rather than putting thought into it. After weeks of my griping about it on the Twitter Klout finally listed \"poultry\" as one of the topics I am influential in, but it's fallen down the list, which makes me sad. I seriously doubt there will be a poultry-themed Klout-perk any time soon but I'd love to be a top influencer in poultry!\r\n* \u00a0 So yeah, I'm kind of boring and all over the place today, and I still don't know what the men of my household keep doing with their genitalia that they're getting ticks THERE, but it needs to end.

(meaning too many breaks to my TWO arms; I do not have any extra ones, dammit), but usually I'm pretty good about the metaphorical kind and so I'm trying. I'm really, really trying with the help of family, friends, and retail therapy. I'm just not having a ton of success.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm still pretty damn lucky. I crawled into bed and had a good cry, and then when the MFA Children got home from school Big Child knew I needed a hug (suddenly it's like hugging a PERSON--no stooping! THE HELL?) and asked me what was wrong. I explained the bare bones of the situation and my kids set about cheering me up. Big Child reminded me that I wouldn't have to see his ugly Bumpus-hound anymore if I go blind. Middle Child said he'd take care of me--\"I'll stay wiv you ALL your life until you die, Mommy, and I'll do everything except wipe your butt!\" And Little Child reminded me that sometimes the blind develop super powers (\"YOU CAN BE LIKE DAREDEVIL!\"). Friends loved all over my comments and Twitter feed. Dr. Anon dragged clinical details out of me via the Facespace and located a clinical trial for treating the second eye condition that came up today that seems pretty promising (and really, that is huge because while the first eye condition is definite and bad and can make you go blind, there are some non-surgical treatments...the second one there was nothing as of when my father was diagnosed ages ago and I was under the impression that that was still the case). And Hotter...well, Hotter did what one of us always does when the other one receives some devastating medical news and reminded me not to be a pussy all my life, and it did in fact make me giggle as did his suggestion that I use Loud and Crazy the turkey as a service animal. Even I with my stupid brokedick eyes can see how loved I am, and that is a beautiful thing.\r\n* \u00a0 As far as retail therapy, I did in fact choose and order those new glasses, and while it's not much consolation for the prospect of losing my eyesight, the iPhone is still pretty badass. Plus I hit Goodwill to pick up some work clothes (the new, obscenely high-paying job requires business attire and I am sick and tired of popping out of my shirts and wearing Hotter's khakis) and the thrift-shopping gods smiled on me: two pairs of Talbot's slacks with stretch in my size that looked brand new, a very cute dress that WAS brand new (tag and all), and a button-down that ought to contain my rack. Whoo tits!\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Tomorrow I start the new job, and it's twelve-hour days six days a week so I might be a sucky blogger for the next month or so (yes, it's a MONTH instead of just three weeks, which means that in addition to making one-third of last year's earned income in one month I'll be eligible for unemployment should I need it after it's over, although I doubt that I will because there'll be a bunch of holiday parties and such needing banquet servers and I've got clients at two of the three temp agencies now who specifically request me when they need a worker). Someone should probably tell my feelings that this full box of Triscuits they're making me eat are going to cause me to crap a two-by-four tomorrow at the office; I've tried but they just gave me a withering look.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm still so damn sad, and the distractingly compromised vision in my left eye (which I was able to ignore previously because I was certain I just needed new glasses) isn't helping matters.

Even though Casa MFA is zoned agricultural, they still prosecute if you have chickens or other \"farm animals\" on a plot under three acres (I thought it was under ONE). Ours is 2.7 and therefore barring a very slim chance that we can get grandfathered all of the poultry have to go pretty much immediately. They can't reveal the identity of the complainer but the (shockingly nice and very apologetic) zoning guy said the complainer was really weird in the way they made the complaint and refused to give their name or callback number and he got the impression they weren't from around here. Oh, Stalky, that was so mean of you!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Plenty of other things went wrong today, including something someone did absentmindedly that caused a chain-reaction of bank fees that will be one costly clusterfuck, my locking myself out of the MFA Minivan on my lunchbreak (with my wallet inside so that I could neither hire a locksmith nor prove ownership of the vehicle in order to get the police to help me out)\u00a0while shocked by the awful poultry and financial news, which arrived together while I was in the ATM line, work announcing that while they want to try and keep me on until late November they'll be cutting my hours starting next week, and BUMPITY BUMPITY OUCH OH GOD DAMN IT ALL RIGHT STRAIGHT TO HELL SUDDENLY EVERY ANXIOUS THOUGHT I HAVE EVER HAD HAS COME HOME TO ROOST.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was literally scared to drive home from work because I was certain that between the way today was going and the rain I'd wreck the damn minivan; a coworker literally had to shoo me from my seat at my desk with assurances that whatever I was working on (which unbeknownst to them was pretty much JUST a small nervous breakdown at that point) could wait until tomorrow, and when the XY was late returning the MFA Children from dinner visitation I was certain he'd managed to wreck again with them in his car.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Obviously I made it home safely, and so did the MFA Children or I would be in no fit state to post a thing, but it sure does feel like nothing will ever been good again. Hotter and I are both really upset (as are the children, but honestly I think the grownups are taking it harder) about our birds, and hating that we can't move to his hometown with them (my mother in law, who is a saint, is bringing a truck from several states away and taking the MFA Flock to her farm), and wondering if we'll ever stop getting nasty surprises from Stalky, whose ability to screw with my life I thought I'd eliminated by changing career fields. Now I wonder if I don't also need to change my damn name and move, and oh yeah maybe just get the hell off of the innernet permanently and stop sharing any little goddamn thing at all about my life with the general public (I hesitated even to talk about the poultry thing at all to try and avoid giving Stalky the satisfaction, but I think y'all would notice if I never mentioned the birds again).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I doubt I'll do that, and I'm sure tomorrow will be better (although I will not tempt fate by doubting that it could possibly be worse), and I'll be fine because I always am, but...today can pretty much fuck right on off and die in a tire fire.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/10/bumpity-bumpity.html", "title": "bumpity bumpity"},

I can't do it justice right now so I won't even try, but look for that post soon and the upshot for me PERSONALLY is that I get a free pair of prescription glasses (my first in nearly six years--yes I have had these frames AND these lenses for that long)!\r\n* \u00a0 I just got a job offer from Temp Agency #1 in which I will make as much money per week as I usually do in a month of working fulltime for the next three weeks. Obviously that is a wonderful thing.\r\n* \u00a0 Then after work today, which finished early, I went to the eye doctor to get my prescription checked (I was pretty sure it had changed a lot, since my vision has started to suck pretty badly) and found out I'm going blind. Yeah. BLIND. Not maybe, and not even from ONE progressive eye disease, OH NO, but TWO of them. The first one was not a surprise, since I have it on both sides of my family, but the youngest person on either side to need treatment was in their late forties so I wasn't expecting to hear at thirty-three that the eye doctor was just SO terribly sorry my corneal issues rule me out as a candidate for any type of eye surgery and I needed to start medication for it immediately like RIGHTNOW. The second one she was more like \"I...yeah...I don't even have the EQUIPMENT to tell you what kind of ____ it is, you'll need laser retinal mapping for that, but it's DEFINITELY ____\" and when my face fell because I had heard of _____ before she consolingly said \"well, but...in RARE cases it's JUST A CATARACT!\" in a \"hey, maybe you won the lottery, wouldn't THAT be exciting!\" kind of tone and I looked at her and said \"wouldn't a cataract need--\" and her face fell. \"Surgery. I...I'm very sorry. The good news is that treatment won't change you prescription, so you can go ahead and order those free glasses,\" she finished lamely. \"I just don't have the machine in my office to measure your pupils, so you'll have to go inside to the optical shop\" (this was the eye doctor at the local Big Box Store). I took my prescription and left, feeling numb, and the numbness lasted until I couldn't find my membership card and went to get a new one. \"No problem,\" said the clerk, \"I just need to see your driver's license and I'll give you a new card.\" I went to get that and there was the membership card (which I'd searched my wallet for three times already) and I started to say \"oh, whoops, I guess maybe I'm just--\" and I was going to say \"blind\" and instead kind of sobbed in her face. \"It's okay! That happens to a lot of people, I see it at least once a day...?\" said the membership clerk, before she realized that clearly I wasn't really beating myself up about the card and was instead in the midst of an acute mental health challenge. I didn't even try to explain myself, just walked away.\r\n* \u00a0 So I bought myself an iPhone. As a consolation present.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 It didn't work.

It turns out that we just have to file some paperwork and pay a $75 filing fee to have domestic fowl on less than three acres on an agricultural-zoned property in our locale. We'll be limited to a dozen birds, so we're still sending some to the Arctic Tundra with The Wrath (who is coming early next week to fetch them). The ones who go will include both roosters and the loudest cacklers among the hens, and hopefully that will pacify the neighbors (if in fact it was a neighbor and not Stalky who complained). With the number we keep we'll have plenty of eggs for our family (although we will have to stop giving dozens away to neighbors, which under the circumstances given that maybe it WAS one of them I will not feel bad about). Y'all, I did not want to admit how upset I would have been if we'd had to get rid of all of the birds; they're a large part of why we love living where we do and more than just a source of eggs, meat and feathers.

I have weekend work lined up for two coming weekends through Temp Agencies 2 and 3, which will be good as we're trying to save for an inexpensive second vehicle I can drive to and from work and such when we don't need the passenger capacity of the MFA Minivan to save on gas. Also, the day job through Temp Agency #1 lasting as long as it is means I'll be eligible for unemployment when it's over should I need it (I hope not to need it, but better to have it as an option and not need it than need it and not have it as an option, right?).\r\n* \u00a0 A fabulous reader informed me that I could change my signature in the iPhone so that now instead of \"sent from my iPhone\" it says \"sent from The Precious.\" This tickles me to no end!\r\n* \u00a0 I do NOT have anything lined up through any temp agencies for THIS weekend, which means that I get to spend it entirely with my husband.

{"date": "October 16, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 My friend lives! I hadn't exactly planned to update the blog but I know y'all worry. She's feeling rather sluggish and \"blah\" but her gums aren't pale, her heartrate is within normal limits, and she isn't short of breath so while her H&H probably took a hit based on what she's seen, there's no reason to think she's in any great danger. Best of all, she's having less pain with swallowing than yesterday, so things appear to be healing in there. She's hoping she's dodged the bullet and that this will heal up nicely and not need any sort of intervention at all, but just getting through the weekend without an emergency is a wonderful thing in and of itself and she's grateful for that.\r\n* \u00a0 The poultry drama continues as Hotter and I make some tough calls on who stays and who goes. We're going to be limited to twelve birds, total, which means that Hotter's and my differences in how we view livestock (namely that they're more pets and individuals to him and more mouths to feed/utility critters to me) have gone from \"amusing\" to \"causing some friction.\" The ducks in particular have become a bone of contention, in that I think keeping the pair that's bonded and sending the two extra girlducks (who seem to have more a relationship of necessity than a true pair bond, like prison-spouses) to The Wrath is reasonable and Hotter wants to keep them all. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it weren't for the twelve-bird limit, but we really don't use that many duck eggs, so...yeah. We're already keeping a lot of non-laying birds because of the turkeys and Hotter's beloved silver-laced Wyandottes (who don't yet lay). Ugh!\r\n* \u00a0 I read something on a blog the other day that really rankled me. I'm not going to say whose or give a link because I refuse to propagate blog-drama, but the general gist of it was that someone was blagging (using their blog to brag about their life) and, along with a lot of uber-materialistic hokum that didn't bother me a bit (I'm not a particularly covetous person when it comes to Things Material, although I do envy those of you who have Kitchen Aid mixers) they blagged at length about their children. The way they're able to afford to give their kids lots of things I can't give mine did smart a tiny bit, but the line that really stuck in my craw (ha! Like that pill! Oh haha!) was something to the effect of \"my kids don't have special needs!\" I'm kind of conflicted about getting my hackles up there, because if none of my children had any special needs I guess I might privately include that in the things about my life I was grateful for, but...well, I don't know that I'd blag about it openly. If your children don't have any special needs then hey, that's great for them and for you, but...it's not like that's a measure of your success in life. With the exception of things like FAS and prenatal drug exposure, a child's having special needs isn't usually indicative of their parents' mistakes or misdeeds. It just...is what it is. I'm not sure exactly why it bothered me so much to read that line in a blog that's in the \"trainwrecks\" section of my reader anyway (oh don't act like you don't have blogs you read solely because they make you feel better about your own life...I at least own my schadenfreude), and I certainly don't wish any special needs upon the blaggart-in-question's children or anything mean like that. But that line has stayed with me. I guess maybe I ought to take that one out of my reader...\r\n* \u00a0 This certainly has turned into a mishmash of pissing and moaning, hasn't it?

Hotter is not taking it well, but I'm fairly philosophical as long as there's electricity and running water to be had, and took a cold washcloth-scrub and shower-rinse after my run today (it was very invigorating, thanks!) and heated water on the stove to wash up the necessary dishes to bottle tonight's batch of water kefir and get tomorrow's going in new room-temperature sugar-water. The landlord wasn't able to get a repairperson out today but a truly obnoxious one is coming tomorrow. I know he is obnoxious because I spoke to him over the phone, and in the space of a five-minute conversation he asked for my phone number in an innuendo-laden tone followed by \"honey,\" also called me \"baby,\" \"sweetheart\" and \"dear,\" and then after I mentioned a morning appointment being no good tomorrow due to my HUSBAND having a doctor's appointment he started calling me \"ma'am\" and signed off with \"God bless you!\" Clearly someone has some Madonna/whore issues toward women and/or has seen too many pornos and I am not only offended on MANY levels but also skeeved out enough that if I was not married I'd probably ask the XY to come over rather than be alone with this asshole. Blech!\r\n* \u00a0 I went running again today, and did not die, which is pretty much the only criterion by which I judge a run a success or failure. I have this weird love/hate relationship with running; I love it but it hates me. Between the connective tissue disease, the exercise-triggered asthma, the deformed feet (nothing anyone would pay to see, they're just not quite right), and probably at least two other things I'm forgetting at the moment I have to be rather careful with running, but I'm trying to work on improving my general health and stress levels with the idea that blood pressure and blood sugar both influence glaucoma and obviously I want to do everything possible to save my eyesight and there's an app, so: RUNNING! WHOO! The main things I do to avoid hurting myself are mostly geared toward SLOWING THE EFF DOWN. That seems to be the number one piece of advice I get in life, be it from a family therapist, an academic advisor, teachers and coaches in everything from piano to public speaking...I seem to have two speeds, fast and off and neither of those serves me well in running without hurting myself, so here is what works for me in case you have this problem too:\r\n1. Use something to keep time and alternate running and walking.\u00a0RunKeeper is perfect for this because I don't have to watch a clock. It frustrates me, because the run intervals always end just as I'm hitting my stride, but it also keeps me from outrunning my lungs and/or joints.\r\n2. Breath-counting. I breath in through my nose for a count of eight and out through my mouth for a count of eight. Each number is a footfall, and if I am struggling to get the full count of eight in then I know I'm going too damn fast and/or headed toward trouble with the lungs.\r\n3. Listen to slow stuff. This is counterintuitive, because what is more fun than pounding around the track to some Guns N Roses? Very few things! But what is less fun than a stress fracture? EVEN FEWER! I run to chanting Benedictine monks a lot. If I'm in no mood for the monks then I try to stick to songs like At Last by Etta James or Satellite by DMB. Nothing any faster than that, which is a buzzkill but also keeps my legs in no more pieces than they should be.\r\n4. Think about posture as you run. Keep your shoulders back and your chest open, hold your head up and make sure you're centered over your feet. If you're leaning forward? You're going too fast.\r\n* \u00a0 I was not my most fabulous self today. I was impatient with my children this morning and irritated with my husband right up until he sensibly threw me a make-up bang. I wasn't in a very good headspace due to being laid off; I had grown complacent with the idea of staying at that job for another month and building up a little nestegg \"just in case.\" Fortunately it has stopped hurting to swallow unless it's a very large gulp and I'm hoping this means I've avoided the possibility of surgical intervention being necessary, but our minivan still isn't getting any younger and now I've got it in the back of my mind that I need to be ready to re-litigate custody and well, OY. I'm going to try not to be an angst-ridden shrew tomorrow but can't make any promises, because we're spending the morning at Local Teaching Hospital for Hotter's yearly Big Checkup with Transplant and, well. Y'all know how I feel about that place. But I'm still going to try to \"go quietly amid the noise and haste,\" and we'll see what happens.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of you?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://runkeeper.com/home"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/10/assorted-items.html", "title": "assorted items"},

Said friend has seen evidence of considerable upper GI bleeding (having been schooled by various GI doctors on how to tell the difference between upper and lower GI bleeding for someone else she was caring for at some point, and therefore being certain that that's what this is) but can't go to a doctor on a weekend without totally upsetting the delicate financial balance in her household and isn't really sure that's warranted at this point, anyway. A doctor would no doubt send my friend to the emergency room, where she would probably end up getting, at the very least, a 23-hour observation admit to let her stomach empty and then an EGD that would probably show the source of the bleeding, and then my friend would probably be sent home with some Nexium and orders to stick to a soft diet for a bit. My friend doesn't feel as though she's lost enough blood to be dangerously anemic (and she is well aware what THAT feels like), her gums aren't pale, and the pain in the area that said bleeding is most likely coming from is not getting any worse. So probably nothing needs to be cauterized and the only purpose in my friend spending the weekend and every penny to her family's name in the hospital would be in going \"huh, yep, look at THAT!\" when a) that wouldn't actually HELP my friend right now given that she already has access to Nexium and a soft diet and b) it would eat up all of the funds she may need to save against a LATER date in case strictures develop as this heals, at which point surgical intervention of some kind WOULD be necessary.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I don't think my friend is in any mortal danger or anything, but all of that said, she feels like crap and I'm worried about her.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/10/the-one-where-im-worried-about-a-friend.html", "title": "the one where I'm worried about a friend"},

Instead I did what I do when I'm furious or overwhelmed, which is become eerily (according to people who know me well) calm and pleasant (people who don't know me well are often soothed into stepping even FURTHER into it, which is...often problematic). \"He does?\" I asked, calmly.\"THAT'S WHAT HE SAID!\" It turned out that yes, that is what Big Child SAID, but what Big Child MEANT, and CLARIFIED to Hotter immediately afterward, was \"now we can stay at CATHERINE!'s house on Daddy weekends.\" But Hotter...well, let's just say he needed some prompting even then to drop his FUNNY, FUNNY JOKE because OMG HOW FUNNY?**\r\n* \u00a0 Show of hands: who thinks that was funny?\r\n* \u00a0 I started running again. I had actually planned to start running again before getting The Text Of Doom, because I found a really cool app that had inspired me. Good timing! I can now tell you that I ran exactly 1.8 miles and did not die. Win!\r\n* \u00a0 As I was doing that thing I do where I attempt to explain after a cooling-off period of several hours just how badly awry the joke had gone and Hotter was doing that thing where the nascient awareness of just how badly he's screwed up turns him surly and prone to accusing me of overreaction, my in-laws rolled up. My stepson, who had ALLEGEDLY been told how conservative I am about what I allow my children to be exposed to, was sporting some truly epic body piercings, a giant new tattoo, and a hickey. I'm sure my ex's lawyers will be TERRIBLY AMUSED.\r\n* \u00a0 Then my water heater exploded.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I quit life.\r\n\u00a0\r\n** \u00a0 This is the brain damage. It makes him sometimes lose track entirely of what is/isn't appropriate, funny, or hell, MINIMALLY ACCEPTABLE. I don't hold it against him because then I might as well get pissed at him for having a seizure, but I also don't particularly ENJOY it when Hotter stabs me in the heart with the edge of his brokenness. My marriage is not in trouble or anything. I just needed to vent.\r\n****************************************EDITED TO ADD******************************************\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, here is the thing with the piercings/tattoos and me going all finger-wagging grandma on you. I have nothing against piercings or tattoos or people who have them. Hell, back in the day when I was a whippersnapper I had some unconventional piercings of my own (okay, nothing THAT exciting, just a bunch of cartilage piercings in my ears) and if it weren't for my connective tissue disease and my shitty, MRSA-prone immune system I'd have my nose pierced . But the state I live in is SUPER-conservative. This is the bible belt, and statistically speaking there's a very good chance the judge who presides over custody decisions involving my family is a biblical literalist. People in this state, I am sad to say, have lost their kids PERMANENTLY just for being gay. My custody order has a MORALITY CLAUSE, for fuck's sake. And on the very day I found out the XY was marrying money the very last thing I needed was to have someone whose appearance would doubtless make our custody judge shit a brick, an anvil, and then an entire litter of kittens show up on my doorstep.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://runkeeper.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/10/the-one-with-neither-a-wedding-nor-a-funeral-but-the-potential-for-both.html", "title": "the one with neither a wedding nor a funeral, but the potential for both (ETA further clarification)"},

And I found myself on the receiving end of many profane diatribes about how Loud and Crazy was going to wake up with a dead chicken under his pillow and no eyes to see it with via Facebook chat courtesy of Big and Scary, which amused me greatly.\u00a0 I'd log in and ask how the \"livestock\" was doing, and he'd rant and curse, and I'd read it aloud to Hotter, and we'd laugh our arses off.\u00a0\u00a0 Until a hawk swooped into the deluxe accommodations Big and Scary had fashioned in his back yard, and carried Patches off in plain view of the little girl via the kitchen window.\u00a0 At which point you couldn't so much as IMPLY to Big and Scary that Patches had been any less than a cherished member of the Big and Scary family; he was outraged, and grief-stricken, and so was his daughter, until he bought her her own small flock of chickens and installed a roof on their enclosure, at which point he began cursing and complaining about the new chickens, and plotting revenge on Loud and Crazy once more.\u00a0\u00a0 Big and Scary might sound rather, well, big and scary, and perhaps a tetch crazy as well, and he is all of those things, but the guy loves the hell out of his little brother, and during Hotter's worst night in the hospital of struggling to breathe, when I stayed up all night slapping him awake and reminding him to do that, Big and Scary kept me company on the facespace via hospital wireless.\u00a0 He fretted and brainstormed, and consulted Dr. Google, and generally helped make the night more bearable, and when my mother-in-law was being...difficult...about coming down here to see her ill son he helped convince her that keeping her word was important.\u00a0 It was good old Big and Scary who let me know, via the facespace, that the Wrath and Loud and Crazy were finally on their way.\u00a0 \"You owe me,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0 And I did.\u00a0 So when the in-laws got here I reminded them that they'd told Hotter he could bring at least one non-hen up there to their place if we did in fact have one, months earlier.\u00a0 See, Hotter's family all suffer from an inability to say no, that leads them to agree to things they have no intention of actually doing, and the Wrath had answered the question without consulting Loud and Crazy, who didn't want an extra cock at all, but I had a hen-detta to carry out.\u00a0 I waited until Loud and Crazy was using the restroom prior to driving the Wrath home again, and cornered the old lady, and said I'd just get her a box for that cock she'd promised Hotter she'd take off our hands.\u00a0 \"I said if it didn't work OUT, I didn't--\" she said, but I cheerfully ignored her and fetched the box.\u00a0 Loud and Crazy came out and was not pleased at all to see that his mother had given up protesting when I ignored her and effectively agreed to take Blondie off our hands, but they eventually got on the road for the six-hour drive home with a box containing a cock.\u00a0 As they pulled out of the driveway Loud and Crazy was ranting and the Wrath was reassuring him that if the other chickens didn't accept Blondie they could always give him to Big and Scary.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2010/07/hendetta-or-three-brothers-one-cock.html", "title": "hen-detta, or \"three brothers, one cock\""},

As does the fact that the XY will be in attendance.\r\n* \u00a0 WHAT? Yeah, I don't entirely know how that happened either; yesterday I spoke with him for the first time since his accident and he not only didn't thank me for handling his shit for him (you know, providing the hospital with his SSN and blood type, tracking down and notifying his family members, and making sure his elderly and very ill father had his meds straight) but also went so far as to scold me for telling CATHERINE! that he'd walk away from it without so much as a broken bone (which? He did). He felt like that was insensitive of me and added to her trauma. Uhhh...yeah. So I thought about it, and ranted on the facespace, and called Dr. Redzils and shrieked at her (in typical Dr. Redzils, PhD style she pointed out that I had been a nice person about the whole thing and the XY was having a hard time wrapping his injured head around that and responding appropriately because he is NOT a nice person), and talked it over with Hotter, and finally ended up calling the XY and telling him how I felt about things (nobody thought that was a good idea, but I needed to get it off my chest for my own sake so I did it anyway). And he...apologized. And was nice. And get very emotional when (after he said he was going to try and take his weekend despite his not yet being medically cleared to drive again) I said NO WEEKEND VISITATION UNTIL THE DOCTOR SAYS IT IS OKAY (and I mean VERY emotional; I guess the concussion really did ring his bell), and the next thing I knew I'd told him he could tag along on the family outing if he promised to nice and thereby spend some time with the kids in a way that would be safe for everyone concerned.\r\n* \u00a0 I blame the cold medicine.\r\n* \u00a0 Hopefully the XY a) behaves himself as promised and b) doesn't think this means we're friends or anything, because he and CATHERINE! are NOT invited for Thanksgiving and I'm not loaning him any money or electronics or the MFA Minivan or even allowing him into my house. His behavioral history makes certain precautions to keep him out of my home and away from my stuff the only sane way of handling him no matter HOW nice he is with a head injury and on painkillers. He's excellent at hiding it but deep down at his core he is a narcissistic, amoral, reprehensible little man and not to be trusted. Honestly, I'm worried that any gestures of goodwill on my part will only lead to him overstepping, me setting limits, and him then getting pissy and causing trouble.

He doesn't think any oral antibiotics would help me at this time, but sent me home with some steroids and says that's my best bet right now for staying comfortable and upright, but that he really thinks I need ear and possibly sinus surgery.\r\n* \u00a0 We came home to find that the refrigerator AND freezer had quit, and all of the food has to be tossed. Naturally we'd just been shopping.\r\n* \u00a0 I...don't even know what to do with this. Apparently I am seriously ill and there's no fixing it without money I don't have, and if I can't work I can't make any more money, and I don't even know what we're going to EAT when all the nonperishable stuff is gone because I had shopped to stock the pantry in advance of spending all the money on Hotter's teeth, and now that is gone. I appreciate the suggestions to try and talk to a social worker, but the thing is, we're not poor enough yet that Social Services would step in. If we get that poor, I will absolutely talk to a social worker. But first I'd have to lose my job due to being too sick to work, so...I guess give it time? Fuck me.\r\n* \u00a0 I seriously think I am losing my shit, y'all. The nurse came to give me the steroid shot and I bent over the exam table and she did her thing and then I stood up and she saw my face and was like \"oh my, are you OKAY it's OVER NOW\" and I was like \"lady my behind is the least of my problems\" and then on the way home we saw a truck with one of those metal cage-boxes in the bed full of hunting dogs and I burst into loud, open-mouthed sobs and came undone entirely. \"WHY THE HELL DO PEOPLE DO THAT TO DOGS,\" I shrieked at the top of my lungs. \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?\" I don't think it was about the dogs, obviously. I think maybe until I am at least a little bit more sane or end up hospital-sick and out of work and can get some government healthcare to straighten my ass out I should get off the innernet and tend to other things. The kitchen floor, for example, is covered in blood that leaked out of the defunct freezer from all the thawed venison, and my landlord is apparently on a plane to Japan and unreachable until tomorrow. Fuck. Me.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/03/people-in-hell-just-want-a-cold-drink.html", "title": "people in hell just want a cold drink"},
{"date": "December 14, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThank you to\u00a02nd.MD\u00a0for providing me with a $200 stipend to test-drive this revolutionary online medical service.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I saw that Clever Girls Collective had a sponsored post opportunity that involved trying out a \u00a0revolutionary new way to get in touch with a top specialist from home, I was really excited, for obvious reasons. I mean hello, every single person in my household has complex medical issues necessitating entire TEAMS of specialists, who aren't always all that available for questions that aren't life-or-death. When I found out I was selected for this opportunity I thought long and hard about which specialty to consult with. I don't think there's any specialty we HAVEN'T had dealings with, after all, so I was a little bewildered in the face of SO. MANY. OPTIONS. And the combination of medicine and social media was RIGHT UP MY ALLEY, OH MAH GAH.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I finally decided to narrow it down by ruling out specialties we were already happy with (like I hate the eye doctor LIKE POISON, but that said mine is one of the best in the nation so I don't really need a second opinion there), ones with a heavy hands-on clinical aspect (for example, to effectively address specifics of the connective tissue disease my children and I all have, a geneticist would want to move our joints around, feel our skin, have us do various physical things not easily captured on webcam...), and specialties where prescriptions are heavily involved (for example, I need to get back on ADD meds but while a psychiatrist-inside-the-computer might be able to make recommendations for specific drugs, they obviously can't prescribe that way and I don't know how well it would go over if I went to see MY psychiatrist and told him I wanted to try X controlled substance because Dr. Y from-the-innernet told me I should...).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I finally decided I wanted to go with a sports medicine doc; many of the sports medicine specialists on 2nd.MD have SUPER-impressive credentials and I'm not realistically going to shell out a co-payment and day off to see one on my own. Plus the reason I wanted to see one (namely to get some tips on exercises, specific taping techniques/compression garments, etc. that might help me avoid the recurrent injuries I am so prone to when I run) was something I felt could be effectively addressed in a videoconference. Yay!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0My enthusiasm started to fizzle around the time the second specialist declined to take me on. I get why they have this option; obviously not everyone is very medically savvy and some people might select specialties that are wildly inappropriate or doctors within a specialty who don't often handle their particular issue, but...any able-bodied person can run and women in particular are prone to stress fractures. I didn't feel like mine was such a crazy concern. Finally I found a doctor who was willing to talk to me: WHOO!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately he didn't show up for our \"appointment.\" Booo...here is where I have to say that 2nd.MD's customer service is AMAZING. If a doctor doesn't show up for your appointment (which given that doctors have, um, emergencies and stuff, isn't such a far-fetched idea) you automatically get a refund from 2nd.MD, but what the fine print doesn't say is that when that happens they go ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure you don't give up on the service itself. The rep's exact words when I contacted him, frantic, at COB on a Friday when my post was due no later than TODAY, were \"you go and have a good weekend and let me work some magic.\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I won't lie. Initially I was not impressed with the magic. Because it took the form of a rush-appointment with...drumroll...a rheumatologist. Yeah, 2nd.MD's sports docs unanimously wanted nothing to do with me because of the rare and freaky connective tissue thing, and I was...pretty offended, honestly. Because what the heck was a rheumatologist going to know about this (I mean yeah, technically I have an autoimmune disease that falls under their specialty AS WELL, but it has no impact on my running and all symptoms that have majorly impacted my life have been effectively addressed through drugs and surgery)?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At this point, I think if I'd been a regular paying customer I might've given up on 2nd.MD. Since I wasn't actually paying for the service out of my own pocket, though (and uh, wanted the income from this sponsored post opportunity), I decided I had nothing to lose by going into my appointment with Dr. Kirkwood Johnston with an open mind.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Y'all, I am so glad I did that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Dr. Johnston isn't just a rheumatologist, he's also an avid runner and something of a rare disease afficionado. Instead of one of the two usual reactions medical professionals tend to have when I tell them about my specific connective tissue disease (either \"umm...how do you spell that? I've never heard of it!\" or \"HOLY CRAP YOU POOR THING, YOU SHOULD TALK TO A GENETICIST OR PRETTY MUCH ANYONE WHO ISN'T ME!\"), Dr. Johnston said \"tell me about your [insert condition name here; it's rare enough to be potentially identifying so I'm not putting it up on my personal blog], what subtype is it and how severely affected are you?\" He went on to explain, laughing, after I told him how the sports docs had all shied away from seeing me, that a lot of the time people's reaction to rare stuff that can impact mobility is one of \"CALL A RHEUMATOLOGIST!\" and this was actually right up his alley.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'd love to show you a screenshot of my consultation with Dr. Johnston, but apparently Awesome Screenshot and the 2nd.MD chat interface don't play well together because when I took one I ended up with this:\r\nFigure One: Not-so-awesome screen shot.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So you'll kind of have to use your imaginations a little. Here is what Dr. Johnston looks like. And here is what I looked like during our consultation, modeling my anti-asthma attack running mask for running in cold weather (taken with my iPhone during the actual consultation, which you can sort of see in the reflection off my glasses) (last time I EVER don't shell out for the anti-glare coating on lenses, incidentally):\r\nFigure Two: You didn't really think I'd out myself for this post, did you? Also? Funny story: I thought Dr. Johnston would be in on the whole \"you are talking to a blogger who is being paid to review your services\" angle, because COME ON, but apparently he was NOT in on the joke and when I said, apropos nothing, that I blogged anonymously and whipped out the mask in the middle of a chat about joint and muscle health I think the poor guy thought he was about to become an unwitting participant in some kind of fetish porn. But he was a good sport about it!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So, my actual, honest-to-goodness opinion is that this is an amazing service. I got some truly excellent advice on how to minimize the risk of further injury (although Dr. Johnston was careful to stress that this would only REDUCE the risk, because \"as you know you're going to hurt yourself a lot no matter WHAT you do,\" which shows he knows the condition I have pretty well, actually), from an unexpected source, and aside from the technology failing me when it came to the screen shot (AHEM, AWESOME SCREENSHOT) I have no complaints at all despite the false start. I was actually really impressed, not least in that after I caused a super-awkward moment by whipping out that mask it was SUPER-easy to exit the appointment with the remaining shreds of my dignity. Because it's easy to trip over your own feet on the way out a physical door (um, not that *I* ever did that while beating a hasty retreat from a horrified medical professional, hoooo no), but even I can't manage to hurt myself clicking the x at the top right of a screen.\r\nThank you again to 2nd.MD for sponsoring this blog post.

{"date": "September  7, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Forgive me for this post; it's not very amusing but I need y'all's expertise.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I texted Hotter from work to ask how the MFA Childrens' first day of the schoolyear went, having decided that asking for the day off was probably silly given that my current job is VERY easy money that we sorely need and Hotter was capable of handling things. His reply gutted me and I spent nearly an hour bawling at my current workplace (fortunately this job is VERY easy and provides me with lots of downtime alone, which allowed for me to compose myself before anyone needed me to DO anything): Middle Child had a horrible first day of school because Tuesday is library day for his class and he was only permitted to choose from a very small pile of damaged books at the kindergarten level because of the library situation of last year.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I forget if I wrote about it on here or just on the Twitter, but in essence Middly was not permitted to borrow books for the latter part of his kindergarten year due to an overdue book, which I found while cleaning out the older boys' room and returned when I went to the school to register Little Child for kindergarten, but which the school librarian CLAIMED was still missing, resulting in his not being permitted to borrow books for most of his first-grade year (largely because we were very poor that year and I couldn't afford the exhorbitant price the librarian alleged it would cost to replace the book, which was some three times what said book would likely garner on the open market). That year (last year) I called the vice principal and raised hell, and she promised me she would Handle The Situation.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Apparently either a) the bitchy school librarian went rogue, because she's obsessed with the notion that that book wasn't returned EVEN THOUGH IT WAS or because I embarrassed her at this year's open house by dragging my terrified kid in and making her promise she'd be nice to him this year (Middly is now afraid of libraries and especially this school librarian, who I would give the benefit of the doubt and maybe say that she just LOST the returned book or reshelved it somewhere it wasn't immediately findable, except that she evidently yelled at my kid AND BOTH HIS BROTHERS and therefore doesn't particularly deserve a head on top of her fat shoulders as far as I'm concerned) or b) the vice principal's idea of Handling The Situation included treating a seven-year-old like a second-class citizen, and since neither of those options is acceptable to me I need y'all's help.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Do any of you know whose call it is to hire/fire school librarians and/or vice principals? What is the smartest way to approach this (my mind is only yielding things like \"ASK THE LIBRARIAN IF SHE WAS DROPPED ON HER HEAD AS A CHILD,\" \"pull everyone out of this GODDAMN school and homeschool them,\" \"pick Middly up every Tuesday and take him to the public library next to the school,\" etc. and therefore I have reason to suspect I am not being very logical about this whole debacle)? Please bear in mind that I can't afford a lawyer. Who do I talk to next, and what do I say?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I kind of doubt at this point that even paying the ridiculous sum the librarian asked me for in order to replace the book would get her off my kid's back, even if I HADN'T already returned the FUCKING book. Which isn't to say that I won't pawn something and TRY throwing money at the situation; I'm not ruling that out. I've decided to sleep on it before doing ANYthing, though.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What would YOU do? Are any of you lawyers, or librarians, or even teachers or schoolboard members who could maybe clue me in on who's in charge of this nasty woman's job? I intend to first ensure that it was the librarian's call and THEN take action of SOME sort. If it wasn't her call (and I'm betting it was, but I want to make SURE), then she's off the hook and I need to know what to do if the vice principal is behind this.\u00a0I wouldn't be so upset, except that DAMN IT my poor Middle Child can't catch a break. I got him out of a bad situation with his father, bad things happened to him that necessitated CPS involvement (CPS did SQUAT, incidentally), he already HAS an inferiority complex fer fuck's sake...I just can't deal with the fact that someone at that school (which is rated #1 in the district) \u00a0is crushing his spirit over a BOOK. Especially when it's a freaking miracle he's learned how to read in the first place given all that he's had to overcome to get to where he is. Maybe the school just sees this as another Special Ed. student being a space cadet and the parent failing to let their special precious snowflake be held accountable, or maybe because Middly can mostly \"pass\" and is mainstreamed they just think he's a naughty little boy who needs to learn a lesson, hell, I don't know, but I need to fix this.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Your thoughts?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/09/the-one-where-i-crowdsource-my-outrage.html", "title": "the one where I crowdsource my outrage"},

I know, I'm shocked too! The key to handling the XY, maddeningly enough, was for me to remove myself from the communication process and have Hotter be the MFA Mouthpiece. See, the XY is one of those narcissists who have a desperate need to be widely-liked, and only shits on people who know him intimately, and while I no longer think that applies to me, apparently I've been grandfathered or something because he will still nut up and scream at me and be utterly horrid. With Hotter, however, he's still trying to do that thing he often did with great success during our marriage, namely to convince the third party he's just the nicest guy alive and I am some kind of crazypants whackjob for thinking ill of him because LOOK HOW NICE, SEE HIM SMILING AND OFFERING TO HELP YOU MOVE? Of course Hotter knows this is bullshit, and dislikes the XY thoroughly, but if HE flat-out asks the XY to do something like pay the child support, or make a pharmacy run for a sick child while I am at work, or keep his word on the extra $50 a month to let us stay in this house, it's all \"of COURSE! GLADLY!

I ALMOST bought seeds and stuff the day before Leasegate 2012 erupted, and am kind of glad I didn't because I don't just want to grow whatever is the seed catalog with the best sale. I want to grow FABULOUS THINGS! To that end, if you grow vegetables, what are your favorite varieties and why? What is a fabulous producer/super-cool looking/damn-near-impossible-to-kill?

WIN! I will ingratiate myself to them until they make me an offer, SO HELP ME GODIVA.\r\n* \u00a0 Oh, right. TOWDM is on vacation for a while. A good long stretch free of One Who Dislikes Me-ness! Not that she's ugly to me, really, anymore. She's as pleasant to me as she is to anyone since I made my peace offering, but she \"doesn't like to converse\" and it's weird when we work side-by-side for eight hours with ZERO SMALLTALK. I don't even try anymore, since it pisses her off. The day before she left for vacation, though, PseudoCorp had VIP visitors and The One Who Dislikes Me was wretched enough to those of us below her station in general that I don't think anyone will miss her; there's a much different feel to my job without her around. More people stopping at my desk to chat, more friendly banter, etc. It's nice.\r\n* \u00a0 PseudoCorp = corporate FEEDER. Holiday lunch. Holiday dinner for lunch in the cafeteria.

I've still continued to lose weight overall, however, as the ticker reflects.\r\n* \u00a0 The power company let us get back on budget billing. As you may recall, they booted us off for no apparent reason, and I'd been worrying about the upcoming very-cold months (Casa MFA has electric heat) resulting in monster bills despite our efforts to be energy-conscious, because that's just how it is when the furnace has to run around the clock to maintain a remotely livable temperature for weeks at a time. We'll still have the monster bills, but we'll pay a fixed amount that is doable. YAY! I have also ordered some window insulation film kits to install next week, and am eager to see what kind of results we get from those.\r\n* \u00a0 The holiday shopping is ALL DONE and the stuff has ALL ARRIVED. This is huge, because I wasn't sure if I'd even be able to GET holiday gifts this year (I only bought stuff for the kids, really, as Hotter asked if he could subscribe to something for recreation purposes as his gift...I was kind of pissed because I'd picked out something for him and gotten excited about the idea, but he's a big boy and can pick his own gift if he wants to and this way I know he's happy with what he got, but I think they will be happy). I actually got everyone really NICE gifts, even, in part by starting months ahead and doing my bargain-hunter thing and in part thanks to readers Becca and Devivo and the ever-fabulous Dr. Anon, the self-appointed elves who helped me take care of the final touches after things went to hell. I still need to wrap everything, but Hotter and I are practically giddy in anticipation of watching the MFA Children's reactions to their loot.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm not working AT ALL this weekend, nor am I taking on any work if any of the temp agencies call me.

There was the fountain in which I frolicked nude with the family rabbi, the quadrangle where the piece of paper vital to my graduation kept blowing out of my hands, the soccer field where I was chased by wolves, the Student Commons Building where I showed every person my right nipple, one by one...my subconscious mind used to be a real one-trick pony.\n\n   About six years ago, my anxiety dreams began to alternate between Dream University mishaps and dental catastrophes. The ringing crack of a veneer breaking loose, the jarring blow that breaks a tooth, the feeling of sand on the tongue one gets from an incisor shattering.\n\n   Just recently, for the past...oh, three or so years?...a new type of anxiety dream reared its head. One in which I urgently need to communicate something to someone (a loved one's symptoms to paramedics, my antibiotic allergies to a surgeon standing over me, scalpel in-hand, the location of the bomb to co-workers after I hang up the phone from talking to the terrorists), but there's a problem with my throat, or maybe it's my breathing, or both. I have to exert maximum effort to make any sound at all, and can only get out one or two words per breath, and it's awful.\n\n   Today at my temp job minding an empty office I sat and thought about this. I was a career student for eight years, so it would make sense for my mind to torment me with higher education debacles. Dental catastrophe? Fairly self-explanatory. But I've never had extended troubles making myself heard. Occasional asthma flares, the odd winter laryngitis, sure, but the agonizing inability to speak, like THAT? No.\n\n   I'd gone so far as to think about my grandfather's death from esophageal cancer and muse that perhaps these were not anxiety dreams but some sort of premonition before it struck me: I stayed silent when Stalky really stepped up her efforts and told no one of the terror that at times nearly incapacitated me right around the time the dreams started. I'd blog around it, say something vague about depression, a bad day, and ignore it, fearing all along that the unchallenged lies might begin to be accepted as truth. It ate at me.

{"date": "August 19, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 I encountered two things this weekend.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One was a family of five, out to Sunday brunch. Two parents and three people in their early twenties who were obviously the couple's children. The parents and two of the children were of average stature. The remaining kid (I feel weird calling him that, as he had stubble on his face) was...well, he was little. Not so little as to likely be affected by any sort of achondroplasia (I studied those and other genetic conditions affecting stature when Little Child was a sick little baby, so I feel pretty confident in saying that), and his body and features appeared to be perfectly proportionate, he just...wasn't very big. I was both trying not to stare and desperately trying to figure out how tall the guy was; I hope he didn't notice. I just...well. It made me think about Little Child, and wonder if he'll be THAT little when he's that age. I don't ever want anyone, no matter how well-meaning, to stare at my baby ever again (we got plenty of that when he had a tube taped to his face and later snaking out of his clothes and running into a backpack), and yet that's exactly what I ended up doing to the young man I saw today. For the first time ever I questioned my opposition of the notion of growth hormones for Little Child except in the case of an actual deficiency; I still think we should give him a minute to get used to not having a G-tube. I still don't like the idea of meddling with his endocrine system. He's not even seven and I think we have time to leave the kid the hell alone for a bit and see what his body does on its own. But...well, if he really isn't even going to hit five feet, and he's still healthy in a couple of years...MAYBE.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We'll see I guess.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The other thing was a trio of wee little dogs belonging to another large-ish family I encountered in a business context. They were mini-pinschers (the dogs, not the family, although one of the kids was chatty and informed me the dogs were also related), a breed of dog I've long admired, and they were ferociously opposed to my encroachment into what they obviously considered to be their territory. \"Would you like to pet one,\" the chatty tween boy asked, having noticed how taken I was with the dogs, \"the mom might nip you but the babies won't.\" And he proffered one of his dogs, which he held out easily with one hand under its chest, while his father was signing some paperwork. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I never really considered myself a \"big-dog person,\" having grown up with small dogs, but reader, I had no idea how to even go about petting a dog so tiny! I finally ended up stroking the little beast's head with one finger, chortling in utter glee. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And now I'd really like to get a mini-pinscher when Isis goes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter says no, but hopefully I've got at least a decade to work on him.

{"date": "November 22, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So I know today is the thankful day, and I *am* thankful, overall, despite an epically crappy morning involving carmelized sugar spilling EVERYFUCKINGWHERE (don't even ask, I am ashamed of the wasted ingredients), but...well.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not happy with the way our turkey was butchered.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That is not a complaint I ever would have thought I'd make. I mean, the thing is dead and the head and feet are gone. A couple of years ago that would have been enough and I wouldn't have looked any further (in fact, I wouldn't have TOUCHED the thing--believe it or not I used to be the girl who made her husband place the carcass in the roasting pan because I was so squeamish of raw poultry in general). Now, though, knowing what I know of butchering poultry, I noticed the following about our bird:\r\n* \u00a0 There was a single, HUGE pinfeather in one of the drumsticks. One isn't a huge deal, but this was one of the bigger feathers and shouldn't have been missed.\r\n* \u00a0 This is a biggie: the neck was cut and not twisted off. This means that our turkey has several inches of neck-stump protruding from between the shoulders, and that is kind of gross (not to mention a waste--if the neck had been twisted free Isis could have eaten the entire thing, rather than a third of it getting roasted and subsequently discarded).* \u00a0 About a quarter of the lungs were still inside the bird and firmly attached when I investigated the cavity. Removing the lungs is one of the more difficult parts of butchering a bird, but given that we bought this thing from a farm that raises and butchers turkeys PROFESSIONALLY I expected better.\r\n* \u00a0 One of the legs is broken (the bone--all of the meat is there). This makes me wonder whether that happened before or after the bird's death. If I cut into that drumstick and find evidence of a hemmorhage it'll mean that happened before the bird died, and not only will no one want to eat that portion of the meat, resulting in further waste (well, SOMEthing will eat it anyway, be it a dog or the chickens, but STILL), but it'd also mean the bird suffered unnecessarily.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0None of these things add up to \"ZOMG THE HOLIDAY IS RUINED\" or anything, but it does give me pause. I wasn't going to go into the origins of our holiday bird, given that I know there are those who like to criticize my spending decisions, but we went to great lengths to procure an ethically-raised, pastured turkey. We do this every year because Big Child has an affinity for turkeys that began three years ago when he found out how commercial turkey farms treat their birds in general, and will FREAK THE EFF OUT and cry at the Thanksgiving dinner table if I tell him we bought a mass-produced bird from a supermarket. The year before last, his first year of turkeyvism, we got our turkey from the Hippie Food Coop, and last year we raised (and butchered) our own. This year, due to our having to get rid of the MFA Flock (and the fact that I secured Squatter Workshop as an alternate location for hens, rabbits, and the like AFTER our \"window\" for buying turkey poults), we went through Hippie Food Coop again. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0An aside: Did I purchase the organic, grass-fed yuppie-bird with funds donated by readers to help us out during Carmageddon? NO. I put down a deposit BEFORE all of that noise went down (oh yes, there is a WAITING LIST if you do not plan your purchase of a fancy-pants turkey months in advance), and paid the remainder when I picked the bird up after my most recent paychecks came in using money I earned at my various jobs, just as I paid for the MFA Bees and beekeeping classes in advance of the financial woes that immediately preceded our picking up the NUC. That is what some vocally critical people don't seem to realize about folks who have nice things (like, say, an iPhone or a beehive) despite being flat-ass broke: you don't always see it coming when your life falls apart, and have sometimes done things like sign a wireless contract or put down a deposit/paid in advance on a colony of bees or a fancy-pants turkey, that mean you end up walking to the bus stop with a smartphone in your pocket when your car dies, or having a fancy-pants turkey for Thanksgiving mere weeks after being so broke your family is food-insecure. If you judged me for not \"hocking\" The Precious when the MFA Minivan dropped dead, then a) you're an asshole, b) you're shockingly ignorant to think that the proceeds of selling a year-old used iPhone 4 on eBay would even cover the cost of breaking my wireless contract, let alone put a dent in the cost of a replacement vehicle, and c) if I was to do away with the iPhone in a burst of self-flagellating appeasement of innernet assholes, how would all of our various doctors, my kids' schools, and my three employers get in touch with me, given that I don't have a replacement phone lying around anywhere? Smoke signals?\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Aaaaanyway, back to the bird: this kind of highlights everything I take issue with in the meat industry, bleeding-heart organic farms included. Am I going to turn vegetarian? No. I'm lazy, I'm anemic, and I like meat. But it's certainly given me something to think about today, other than where I last saw the eight-year-old maternity yoga-pants I like to wear for such occasions and how the hell I'm going to get melted sugar out of the burner plates and inner workings of my stove.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/11/a-complaint-i-never-thought-id-have.html", "title": "a complaint I never thought I'd have"},

(my old Freecycle bike needs two new wheels, which since it is a classic would have cost more than the new bike)\r\n* Out of nowhere, Hotter just turned to me and said \"I thought about it, and I don't want you to do a domino operation for me.

And she's right, there's really nothing else for it and I am somehow going to have to make this all happen, because losing my main job, which provides me and Hotter with health insurance, is NOT AN OPTION. I can't function without my meds and Hotter would hit the gap in January and...no. Just no.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The one part of this that isn't in line yet is money. This is my bank account right now:\r\n\r\nFigure One: This is better than the $3 I originally had after paying for the repairs to the MFA Minivan (Rest In Pieces, bitch) thanks to some tips from work, but still not good.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Cabs here are $2.50/mile, and I live fifteen miles and some change from where I work. I figure I can walk a few miles to save money, but I typically get off work around 11 p.m. and I work in a sketchy part of town. My current plan is to walk the last four miles wearing a reflective vest (four miles twice a day is probably the absolute most I can do without crippling myself) (I have to walk four miles to the bus stop in the mornings, which will still leave me five or six hours early to work, but it is what it is).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The bike arrives Wednesday, and I'm going to see if I can ride both ways (weather permitting) until payday at least, since I'll need paystubs to show to the \"no credit, no problem\" ass-rapist car dealers.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So the main obstacle right now is money for bus- and cab-fare, and I hate asking y'all for help but I don't really have anyone else to ask. If Stalky wants to raise hell, she is more than welcome to use the Google machine to look up bus service to my house and she'll see the public notice about the bus route closest to me, so she can't say I'm lying. She can say I'm a loser who is panhandling on the innernet if she wants to, which I guess is true, but...well. My family needs me to be able to earn a living and if the worst I have to do is give Stalky a thrill in her no-no place by admitting that I'm totally desperate, I can live with that. Go ahead and rub one out on me, S.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for the rest of you, if there is any way you can chip in and help me out with this without putting yourself in a place of hardship, I'd really appreciate it.

{"date": "October 23, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Thank you to those who have donated to the transportation fund. I've e-mailed everyone, but it bears saying again: thank you not only for the helping hand, but also for reminding me that just because I lack family with the means to help (and family period--Only Living Relative is half a world away and doesn't always know who I am when we talk) doesn't mean that Hotter, the boys and I are alone against the world. Because a lot of the time it feels that way, and as the breadwinner I feel guilty when my best isn't enough to keep all of the metaphorical plates spinning on top of the twirly sticks, in addition to worried as hell. I didn't see any way around this transportation crisis being the end of my full-time job with the wonderful benefits, and the part-time job that does not suck, and the third-wheel occasional job working for someone I like very much, and everything that those jobs enable me to do for my family. I hated asking y'all for help. I feel like I shouldn't NEED any help. But I do and it means the world to my little family what y'all are doing, and to me that the willingness is there.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I walked over ten miles today (home to bus stop, bus stop to work, work to bus stop, bus stop to home). My feet are KILLING ME. But I'm pretty proud of myself for toughing it out! Honestly, this sounds cheesy as hell, but when I woke up already sore and didn't want to get out of bed and get dressed and start walking, I told the whiney part of myself that wanted very much to call in sick to suck it up, buttercup, because people believe in my drive to put money they've donated to use to GET THE FUCK TO WORK. When I got off the bus toward home and still had to walk another four miles and change, and my feet hurt, and my knees hurt, and I was tired because I'd already walked six miles and worked (and today at work we were MOVING FURNITURE because OF COURSE WE WERE), and I wanted very much to call a damn cab, I told myself \"no way are you doing that. People trust you to be judicious with the money they've given toward your solving this problem and you need to make every dime COUNT so get to walking.\" Yes, sometimes I kind of give myself pep-talks. Don't you?\r\n* \u00a0 For some reason, I saved a little garter snake from slithering into traffic on the way home today. I guess it was only fair, since I was walking beside a busy street where there are usually not pedestrians and startled it (I think maybe it was hanging out on the asphalt of the pedestrian lane because the asphalt heated up in the sun?). I was dog-tired and on my way home, and had to wait for a break in the traffic to go and chase the wee snake out of harm's way, and I kind of wonder why I even bothered, except that I like non-venomous snakes and there's not enough mercy in the world.\r\n* \u00a0 A customer who is one of my very least-favorite people to work with today was, well, someone I worked with today. They're elderly, and overly chatty, and very particular, and they have the habit of using workers' names TO DEATH. I don't know why it annoys me so much when someone begins or ends EVERY DAGGONE SENTENCE with my name, but I don't know, I'm an asshole or something. Anyway, I was attempting to get a big job done as quickly as humanly possible so that I could leave in time to catch the last bus toward home, which my boss had said I could IF I got everything done, and this customer was pretty much standing around watching me work and chattering at me. \"You sure are working hard, MFA Mama\" they observed, \"do you get to go home when you're done?\" Yes, I said, I did. \"I didn't see you until __ o'clock, and usually if you-all come in then you stay longer. Are you going home early?\" I said yes, a little, but I had a bus to catch. \"Well you be careful when you get off the bus, MFA Mama, because (neighborhood I work in) is dangerous at night.\" I said I was catching the bus to MFA County, so no worries (MFA County is fairly tranquil, especially compared to Downtown MFAville). \"Oh my! There's only one bus that even GOES out there, and it's a big county. I didn't think the end of the bus line was even IN a residential area!\" I said it wasn't, that I was a few miles away in (neighborhood where I live). The customer's eyes widened. \"You walk from (neighborhood where I live) to (location of the bus stop) in the morning, come to work, work like this, and then you still have to catch a bus and walk HOME?\" I said it wasn't THAT bad, that I'd only had to do it a couple of times since I'd had some car trouble and hopefully wouldn't need to after today, because tomorrow I was buying a new-to-me vehicle. \"They couldn't fix your old one?\" No, she was old and tired, I said, and I should've let her die sooner really but had hoped she'd last a little longer. \"Oh, MFA Mama, I just hate cars. They're so expensive.\" I laughed and said didn't I know it, and listened to some anecdotes from the customer's personal experience with car troubles as I finished my task. I was really glad when they got ready to leave, and wished them a good day and turned to move another piece of furniture. \"MFA Mama! Wait!\" I forced myself to look not-impatient and turned back. \"I know they already pay you, but you always just do such a WONDERFUL job. Here.\" And they gave me a dollar. And then I felt like a HUGE asshole, because for all that that particular customer runs everyone to death and gets on my nerves they seem to have a kind heart (and are old enough that tipping a service-person a buck is probably a big deal in their mind). Probably a lot of annoying people do, they just aren't very good at expressing it, and I need remember that and not think badly of them.\r\n* \u00a0 What's that you say? New-to-me vehicle tomorrow? Yes! I don't have all of the money together, but when I told him that MFA Mechanic said that since he's known me for so long and I've had such shitty automotive luck he'd be willing to let me make payments, so I am taking possession of a working vehicle TOMORROW! I'll be able to drive it to work tomorrow night! It's old, and wasn't fancy even when it was new, and has a lot of miles on it, and some cosmetic issues, but it runs and therefore I will love it and hug it and squeeze it and get its oil changed every three thousand miles and call it...whatever Becca The Commenter decides it ought to be named, since I said she could christen the thing. Becca, I will e-mail you the details of color and whatnot so that you can decide what to name the thing.\r\n* \u00a0 I am going to go and soak in the bath until I either hurt less or run out of hot water.

Because not only did I sink every cent we had into her yesterday, only to be left stranded downtown yesterday in rush-hour traffic, but it also looks like she's shuffling off this mortal coil with our nest-egg under her hood. I just spoke to MFA Mechanic, and he's found that one of the cylinders in the engine is not getting any compression. He's going to tear down that cylinder on Monday and see if maybe there's something fixably wrong, but all in all it looks like this is It, and even if it's something fixable Monday we don't have a way of paying for any more car repairs before the end of the month.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I have a ride to work tonight, so I'm going to go ahead and go, but I am not on a bus line or anything, or even within five miles of one.

{"date": "October 25, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So Isis has this skin-thing going on that started after her albuterol-amp snack experience, and I kind of think it's just a touch of the mange.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0God dammit!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I guess it's not really surprising, since the vet did warn us that any extreme physical or even emotional stress/suffering could trigger a relapse, and Isis was about as sick as a dog can possibly get and not die. That one night I was sure she'd be gone before morning with the way she was breathing. But she's still here and now seems totally healthy except for some thinning of her fur.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Since it's obviously out of the question to embark on a course of Ivermectin and Mitaban dips right now, with finances being what they are, and Isis doesn't seem miserable (she's scratching behind her ears a little more than usual, but not chewing herself to death or going completely bald like she did the last time this was an issue), we've kind of been watching and waiting. Today I decided to read up on demodicosis and see if there were any natural home-remedy type things we could try, and here is what we ended up doing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Disclaimer: I am not a veterinarian, this does not constitute legitimate veterinary advice, everything I am about to tell you is the result of consulting with Dr. Google, DVM and I don't have any idea whether it will even actually help at all.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0First, I gave Isis a good scrubby bath, then applied the monthly spot-treatment we use to prevent fleas, ticks, and lice (the one that also claims to repel mosquitoes) and gave her a dose of monthly heartworm preventative (which does contain Ivermectin). I then emptied several echinacea capsules into a little water and heated that up on the stove in a small saucepan. When it reached a simmer I added a couple of tablespoons of coconut oil (which is a natural antimicrobial) as a carrier oil, the contents of several vitamin E gelcaps (that stuff is great for skin), a few drops of tea tree oil (ditto), a drop of citronella (which insects hate, so I figure mites might, too), a drop of clove bud oil (a natural antimicrobial and topical anesthetic), and a few shakes of lavender oil (which was recommended on several sites for use in discouraging mange--dunno if it works but it smells good). I then stirred in a handful of organic, food-grade diatomaceous earth, which is non-toxic and kills some types of insect (dunno if it'll bother mites at all, but I figured it couldn't hurt) and about a half a tablespoon of organic emulsifying wax, and poured the resulting olive-drab mixture into a four-ounce Mason jar to cool.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When the mixture was cool, it had the consistency of putty (I think maybe I used a bit much emulsifying wax, or else possibly the diatomaceous earth thickened it further), but softened when I rubbed it between my hands. I massaged that into all of Isis's fur-free skin (belly, undersides of ear-flaps, etc.) and all of the areas where her fur is thinning (mostly her haunches, behind her ears, and the insides of her legs/between her toes). I'm kind of dubious as to whether this will help with the mange, but if nothing else it should provide some topical relief from the itching and discourage infection.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The other thing I'm going to try is some dietary modification. Isis is already on a raw, grain-free diet, but in my reading several sources insisted that it was important to feed meat and bones ONLY while trying to help a dog through a bout of demodicosis, and avoid all forms of yeast (including Brewer's, which we usually give our dogs in their food). Small amounts of leafy greens are supposedly okay. Apples, carrots, potatoes, etc. are not. Antioxidant supplements are recommended, however, as is echinacea (to boost the immune system). Both our dogs get a daily Pet Tabs Plus already, but I'm thinking I'll add extra Vitamin E and a bit of echinacea for Isis, as well as extra fish oil (Isis already gets this for her skin and coat, but it's supposed to help so I'm going to double her dose).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hopefully this will work, or at least help keep things from getting any worse until we're in a position to afford some Western medicine for the situation. It'd be nice if we could avoid that, though, as the Mitaban in particular seemed really hard on Isis (she would retain a lot of water, swell up, get unusually thirsty, pee in the house, and act generally drunk and out of it for about twenty-four hours after each treatment). I'll keep y'all posted.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/10/the-maybe-mange.html", "title": "the maybe mange"},

I have located the title to the MFA Minivan and Googled \"how to drive a stick shift,\" so I'm ready when he is (I *do* know HOW to drive a stick--every vehicle I owned prior to marrying the XY was a stick--YAY, STICK!--but then he had that machismo-related condition of being unable to tolerate riding in a car unless he was driving, and the XY can NOT drive stick, and was killing my poor Honda Civic, and that was the end of sticks for me...so it's been like, twelve years and I wanted to brush up).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, we're starting to mentally move into the \"aftermath\" portion of this most recent catastrophe, namely the part where Hotter tells me \"hey, we need ___, ___, and ___ from the store\" and I say \"no money for that, CAR, remember?\" and he gets snappish and asks me just what the hell he is supposed to feed the children.

Ugh...\r\n* \u00a0 I am LOVING the MFA Beater! I took possession of it with an empty gas tank, then put ten bucks into it and drove it to work four times. Today I took it to the gas station and filled it up all the way. Total cost? $26. SO ADORABLE! I also checked the oil, and not only was it not low, but this thing has the cleanest-looking engine oil I have ever seen in a vehicle, even immediately after an oil change. LOVE!\r\n* \u00a0 Hurricane Sandy. Oof. I'm not liking this storm, particularly since losing our fridge and freezer right now would be nothing short of catastrophic for my little family. We're prepared, in that we have some bottled water and cans of Sterno, and some canned and non-perishable foodstuffs on-hand. Also, I ordered this for $9.99 from Groupalicious weeks ago before Carmageddon took place, and it came in the mail yesterday, so that's good. I'm irrationally terrified that the hurricane will drop a giant tree right on top of the MFA Beater, because wouldn't that be just the kind of thing the universe likes to do to me? On a plus note, \"Sandy\" is the name my ex-MIL, who had a not-insignificant hand in poisoning my first marriage and is all-around fucking evil, prefers to go by. So I am taking great pleasure in mentioning to the XY that Sandy is looking to be a real cunt but yes, we are prepared, when he asks me if we've done anything to ready our household for the storm.\r\n* \u00a0 I may or may not update the blog as events unfold, but for those of you worried about the MFAmily, the Twitter is the best place to keep up with me in real-time. If you don't follow me there and would like to, don't be shy! Go ahead and send a request! As long as you're not a tweetless egg or a Friend of Stalky I'll approve you.\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU? Are you in the storm's path? Have you gotten bottled water, canned goods, and whatnot, and made sure you know where your can-opener, flashlight, etc. are? Are you good to go on prescriptions? Don't forget to have supplies ready for your pets! If you have horses or other outside animals, remember: it's safest not to confine them. Their instincts will offer them better protection than anything short of a concrete bunker, and if you box them up in a stall they'll probably either injure themselves or destroy your building trying to get out when the storm hits. I had horses during the last storm this major that came through MFAville, and they did just fine. If you're really worried, a lot of racetracks and police stables with sturdy facilities will let you bring your horse to them for the duration. Good luck!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://store.ichameleons.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=AB1000MAH.6.3-PP", "https://twitter.com/MFAMama"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/10/updates-and-hurricane-sandy.html", "title": "updates and Hurricane Sandy"},
{"date": "July 15, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0At least, that's what I keep telling myself right now, because I'm cracked like whoa.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The current issues:\r\n* \u00a0 Lungs - still crappy, although on the mend. When I say crappy, I mean that I still have an reedy, vibratory wheeze with each exhale, but no longer with every inhale. The cough is just as productive, but less frequent. I ditched the generic female incontinence panties. PROGRESS!\r\n* \u00a0 Mouth - last night the stitches in my jaw unraveled (or okay fine, I think I actually untied them with my tongue), and the hole goes clear to China. I stuck a chlorhexidine mouthwash-soaked cotton swab in there experimentally, and it would have kept going but I quit when all of the cotton on the end of the swab had disappeared because GROSS, VOMIT, NO. It's pretty painful, but not unbearable and I think it would hurt more if there was an active infection. I'm using a pointy-tipped syringe loaded with chlorhexidine mouthwash to blast the hole out twice a day, which feels exactly as amazing as it sounds it might, but I am VERY interested in not needing another course of Levaquin any time soon, because I don't think my bone marrow could take it.\r\n* \u00a0 Hematology - right. I shared this with the facespace but not on here: we figured out What Ails Me from a hematological standpoint. And by \"we\" I mean Hotter, who remembered that Levaquin shuts down my bone marrow temporarily every time I take it.\u00a0Since the hysterectomy, my H&H can generally afford to take the hit, and since I don't have many antibiotic options, we all just try not to think about it. Two dental surgeries and a car wreck, apparently, was pushing it, blood-volume-wise and stress-wise, and stress triggers the ITP-type**\u00a0mishegas I am prone to. Durr. I actually said to him, while filling the Levaquin, that I refused to even think about what it'd do to my plans for my yearly \"happy birthday, America\" blood donation (I have a rare blood type and aim for 7/4 and my birthday, which are six months apart). Apparently I kept my word. Here is what I am talking about with the bruising:\r\nFigure One: This is a mosquito bite on my upper thigh. I scratched it, with such restraint that I did not even break my incredibly-fragile skin (I think the steroids I am currently on helped minimize the reaction to the bite, at least). That light scratching caused this huge bruise.\r\n Figure Two: This is what a single-attempt, painless, successful IV placement looks like on me after a few days.\r\n Figure Three: Look, kids! Purpura!\r\n Figure Four: This is my right knee. It IS bruised, because of COURSE it is, it's MINE! But the angry-looking red-purple stuff is scar tissue. That is the color a seven-month-old scar is on me.\r\n Figure Five: This is my left knee. The right one LOOKS worse, but at least the skin is closed. Both knees ate the same curb in mid-December and this whole purple area would slide right off if I scrubbed it with a rough cloth and bleed like a sumbitch. Collagen defects, man. Such assholes! And yes, my legs are mad hairy--would YOU pick up a razor in my shoes?\r\n* \u00a0 General - Generally, I think I am on the mend. We figured out a way to keep my BP up high enough that I don't gray out (it involves off-label use of other people's prescriptions, so I won't go into specifics, except to say that this is a medication I have my own prescription for but just can't afford to fill so it's Not That Evil), which is good, because I have to work tonight. I am still having a lot of symptoms of low Potassium despite supplements and crazy Potassium-rich foods. Not really sure what more I can do about that besides wait it out.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Other than that, Hotter and the boys are good, work is okay, and I am concerned about my ability to get through tonight but we really need the money (we're overdrawn, again, ALREADY, and the back-rent is late and so is the child support). Tonight I'll be filling in in an area of work that isn't usually My Thing, but comes with the potential to earn tips, and THAT is very exciting. Some cash money could at least keep us in milk, bread, and rabbit chow (all of which we are very nearly out of) until...god. I have no idea how we're going to make it through to the next payday. I rearranged my sidebars some and am still selling ads, so if you have something you'd like to promote, now would be a great time to speak up. And if any of you are secretly Bill Gates, then by all means show the Donate button some love. I CAN UNTIE SUTURES IN MY GUMS WITH MY TONGUE, BILL. CAN MELINDA DO THAT? CALL ME.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n** \u00a0 I say \"ITP-type\" because what I have isn't actually idiopathic. There's a name for it, something to do with fibrinogen and protein activity levels, but I do not fully understand that and also the fibrinogen protein whatchamacallit doesn't explain why my platelets take the odd nosedive, resulting in purpura (among other nasty things). So probably ITP would be a pretty good handle for What Ails Me, hematology-wise, but an actual MDeity has never written that on a chart of mine that I know of and I don't like to self-diagnose.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401774360340c970d-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834017743604383970d-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340176167a317e970c-pi", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016768856481970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340176167a49a7970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/07/whole-lotta-love.html", "title": "whole lotta love"},

AT LEAST. And they all had the same tooth-with-roots cutout on the side of their building, and the same three signs reading \"ORAL SURGEON,\" \"DENTIST,\" and \"MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEON.\" And the same color and font used to paint their names on their office doors (the only variation in these offices was the names--I didn't even see any damn address numbers). After I found the office I was meant to go to I got out of the MFA Minivan and kissed the ground on my hands and knees, giving thanks for small favors like only seeing THIS place once in my life to date. Although I am sure it will be appearing in my anxiety dreams FROM NOW ON.\r\n* \u00a0 The oral surgeon seemed very smart and was quite engaging, which...well. I instantly wonder about him, because men who are people-persons usually lead me to make stupid decisions. Be that as it may, since he did have an advanced degree and years of surgical experience, plus the personal recommendation of Dr. JewishName, I heard him out on his interpretation of my Jank Jaw.\r\n* \u00a0 Jank jaw is jank, y'all.\r\n* \u00a0 Dr. PlasticFantastic thinks the next (and also, in my case, the LAST, on which more in a moment) step would be arthrocentesis of the temporomandibular joint.\r\n* \u00a0 Arthrocentesis (go ahead, Google Image that shit, I'll wait) may or may not work. My insurance company may or may not agree to cover it. It may or may not be a good idea for various reasons inherent to both general risks and specific physical oddities of mine. If it doesn't work, though, I either have to figure out how to live with the symptoms (which currently I do) or pursue pain management as an ongoing part of my permanent medical \"team.\" Which? Barf. But my connective tissue disease (which I had stupidly neglected to put on my intake paperwork because seriously what would that have to do with my clenching and grinding my jaw? OH EVERYTHING APPARENTLY IN THAT AN ENTRAPPED PIECE OF DETACHED CARTILAGE IS BEHIND THIS BULLSHIT) makes any kind of open joint surgery (YES HE MENTIONED THAT) dumb(er even than for the general population--joints are like engine cases, people, you open them and it voids the warranty no matter how skillful you are about it). Bottom line is, my body is going to do what it's going to do, and any attempts to stop it will be temporary at best and crippling at worst.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 So I have to decide whether I want to pursue arthrocentesis (in theory--in reality I don't know for certain how I will feed everyone for the next six days and surgery? OH HAHA, YOU SILLY GOOSE!), which may relieve current symptoms, most likely on a temporary basis, or just shrug and choose to live with this evenifIcouldaffordtofixit.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter's computer is totally dead. Like, giant lovingly hand-built paperweight attached to desk-sized monitor dead. He is very sad about that. And bitter. By which I mean prone to sniping at loved ones. But he's so upset I don't even really want to call him on much, so I'm gardening tons. \"That's fine for you,\" he groused at me yesterday, \"but what about MY rage and anxiety?\" Implication being that I should come the fuck inside and keep him company. \"I can't address YOUR rage and anxiety,\" I said, \"I can barely handle my own.\" And I kept on digging, so. Yeah.\r\n* \u00a0 My health, aside from the various ongoing TMJ/ENT/Asthma clusterfucks and despite my major \"diet/lifestyle/headspace adjustment,\" is not what I would like for it to be. I am retaining a TON of water right now (by which I mean more than ten pounds' worth that appeared literally overnight), which is uncomfortable, unsightly, and unsettling. I am starting to fear that my autoimmune bullshit is waking and stretching preparatory to looking for a nice snack. I don't want to talk about my health. If you asked me to describe it in one word I'd hiss at you like a cat.\r\n* \u00a0 So things are...not good here. At all.

It was one of only a handful of times in my marriage where I genuinely wished Hotter didn't read my blog, not because there is anything scandalous or that I am forbidden to tell the innernet to dish but because I was really bunched up about this. I was forced to vent to close friends like it was the fucking nineties or something! I didn't want to Mention This to Hotter until I was off the prednisone and well cleared of the stuff, because I pretty much asked him to cut back on something I'd told him was fine by me if it only cost us his time and not any of mine, and didn't cost us money, and was kept two full degrees AWAY from the children.

Also dizziness, balance issues, outrageous bruising, low hemoglobin (and remember: I do not have a Lady Cycle to contend with and eat tons of leafy greens, so I should not be even a little bit anemic), and now my hair is thinning drastically. I'm also doing that dark-red adrenal-failure scarring thing. It's super-sexy.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The thing is, I have had all of these exact same symptoms before, a few times in my life. I've pursued them with various specialists, and heard various theories from \"bitch is crazy\" to \"sero-negative autoimmune disease\" to \"your marriage is killing you.\" Last time, divorcing the XY turned me right around. Oddly, the diagnosis that made the most sense to me came from my therapist of many years, who said \"I think you are just so afraid of negative emotion that when your life goes sideways on you you self-destruct physically rather than ruffle anyone's feathers.\" Whether that's actually possible or total woo, I do not know, although stress certainly triggers Things Autoimmune so maybe it's as good as guess as any.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Since this has always reversed itself with, without, due to, or despite various attempts at treatment in the past, I am clinging to the firm belief that that is what will happen again this time, and this too shall pass. Slow and painful, with a ton of medical bills, like a kidney stone, but...this too shall pass.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 When I told the last ER nurse that I was quite sure I ate plenty of potassium-rich foods, she said \"well it can be tricky, maybe you should talk to a dietician to make sure\" and I was all \"no, I am married to a renal patient and eat all of the things he is supposed to avoid like potatoes, tomatoes, legumes, nuts, dried apricots--\" and she was like \"oh okay, then there is just something really wrong with you.\" I felt...validated?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/07/the-state-of-the-mfa-mama.html", "title": "the state of the MFA Mama"},

I'm actually less sick than I thought I would be when I took stock after the alarm went off and kind of regretting staying home, because I *probably* could have at least APPEARED to keep it together at work today, but...meh. Probably I could use the rest. I've developed a whole new fear of what my body will unleash on me if I don't listen to it lately...\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of which, yesterday was a horrible day with Jank Jaw; Hotter reported that the night before last it sounded like I was chewing rocks in my sleep, which I guess accounts for the ringing earache and splitting headache that lasted ALL DAY. Eff me. I am starting to think the grisly procedure the oral surgeon suggested might be warranted, after all (although there is a huge difference between \"warranted\" and \"going to happen\" because of \"money\").\r\n* \u00a0 The above might have SEEMED like I was just whining, but apparently calling my body out on stuff shames it into toeing the line. Remember the weight issue? Well, now look:\r\nFigure One: Yeah, I dunno either, but I'll take it! Five weeks into the diet, and I am down by 0.2 pounds. Still, things are heading in the right direction! I was seriously considering calling my endocrinologist and asking him to weigh in (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?) on this, because while on one hand going to the doctor for anything short of \"arterial spurting\" at this point goes against every frugal little fiber of my being, on the other hand gaining a significant amount of weight while active and on a reduced-calorie diet is potentially a sign of Things Going Awry that ought to be addressed. For now I'm just going to keep watching this and blame the steroids.\r\n* \u00a0 I feel like all I talk about anymore on here is my stupid health, which is not what I want this blog to turn into AT ALL. What would y'all like to hear about next? Possible topics include DIY drip irrigation, how I haven't used shampoo in over a month and don't miss it a bit, homemade dishwasher detergent, and what's growing in the garden. Also I read the Fifty Shades of Grey\u00a0trilogy if anyone wants to talk about that.

{"date": "April 14, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t...the story of how I gave up shampoo, probably forever!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Going no-shampoo is apparently quite A Thing lately. Like as in all the cool kids are trying it! When I decided to give it a whirl I wasn't thinking \"trendy\" though so much as \"green\" and more importantly \"cheap.\" We already make our own laundry detergent, and have even started making our own automatic dishwasher detergent (I'm still tweaking the recipe on that), but in my quest to shrink our household's carbon footprint (and hopefully grow our bank account), one of the very LAST things I considered going dirty-hippie with was hair product. Because, see, here is the thing: I am super-vain about my hair. It's stupid-long, and I love it, and my husband loves it, and I am guilty of spending upward of twenty bucks per bottle on things to wash, condition, and gloss it with, but clearly that had to stop with our finances being what they are.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I Googled around, and landed on A Sonoma Garden, and pretty much did exactly what she said. A tablespoon of baking soda to a cup of water, and let it age a bit before using (two weeks seems to be the magic number--I put a batch of baking soda and water in a Mason jar to sit while I finished the shampoo I was using, then rinsed the bottle out and poured my baking soda-water into that) (and once I saw the kind of results I get from this stuff I refilled the Mason jar so I'd have more when I finished what was in the bottle). After I've wet my hair through I shake the bottle vigorously and squeeze a generous amount onto the top of my head, then massage it in really well, using my fingertips to scrub my scalp. Then I rinse, use a TINY bit of conditioner (seriously, the baking soda mixture doesn't strip your hair the way shampoo does so you don't need as much), rinse again, and dry (by which I mean towel-turban that shit up, then use a little glossing cream and a wide-toothed comb and let it air-dry the rest of the way, although if you want to fry your hair with a blowdryer then by all means). That's it, y'all.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As to the results...well. Hotter read on here that I was going to give the shampoo-free thing a whirl and tried to dissuade me. \"I don't like the smell of dirty hairrrr...\" he whined. Hotter is very sensitive to smells. He's like a hormonal pregnant woman, except his belly is from peritoneal dialysis instead of a baby and he has boy-junk. But other than that EXACTLY THE SAME. \"Okay honey,\" I said, \"I don't have to give up shampoo.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then I did it anyway and just didn't tell him. I think it helped that I kept my mixture in a shampoo bottle (Hotter uses manly shampoo from a different bottle). In any case, I never had a \"greasy phase\" or anything; the mixture worked like a charm and my hair actually looks BETTER than it did when I was paying through the nose to strip it with toxic chemicals. I finally fessed up a couple of weeks into the experiment after Hotter complimented me on my hair looking especially nice (which? It really really does--it's soft and shiny and has more body than it did before!), and he laughed and said he hadn't noticed anything amiss. WIN!\r\nFigure One: Do not adjust your monitors; I actually *am* that pale. But look how shiny my hair is! Incidentally if you ever want to a) look absolutely douche-tastic and b) reduce yourself to tears over the wrinkled state of your forehead, try taking a picture of your hair without any of the rest of your face in it sometime and have a gander at the outtakes. You see what I put myself through for you people?!?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://thelittlehenhouse.com/2012/04/12/addicted-to-poo-2/", "http://asonomagarden.wordpress.com", "http://asonomagarden.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/my-no-shampoo-hair-saga/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340168ea173343970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/04/by-popular-demand.html", "title": "by popular demand..."},

He's only managed a little Jello and a couple of popsicles, though, and that won't cut it hydration-wise so we may be stuck here another night...I'm hoping the XY can take over tonight so I can go to work tomorrow if Middly has to stay.

{"date": "April 14, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAfter staying up until four this morning with a puking, feverish Hotter, I was pretty sure I'd end up seeing the inside of an ER this weekend. What I didn't expect was a frantic phone call from the XY with a screaming Middle Child in the background asking me to meet him at the hospital.\n\n   Several x-rays and ultrasounds, and a transfer by ambulance to a facility with pediatric ORs later, we don't know what's wrong, although we've ruled out a ton of stuff. Middly is vomiting and in severe pain WITH IV morphine and Zofran, and as you can't have those at home, they've admitted him for observation and pain management.\n\n   Since Hotter isn't up to watching the other two MFA Children (although he seems to be on the mend), the XY took them back to his place and I'm writing this from a pull-out recliner by Middly's hospital bed.\n\n   I already missed more work last week being sick myself (a stomach bug passed through Casa MFA and felled us all one by one, although Middly was the vector and had fully recovered by Thursday when I dropped) than we can afford, so let's hope the ER doc who said this \"looks surgical\" was wrong, mmmkay?\n\n   On a personal note, this is the same hospital where Little Child and I lived for several chunks of his infancy, and I was fine until a nurse brought me some baby wipes to clean Middly up after a puke. Then I smelled the godawful cloying hospital-wipes perfume and came down with a serious case of tsuris. I hate this place, and while I have a \"Calm\" herbal teabag and am about to venture out to the \"nourishment room\" for hot water, I'd kind of rather run screaming to the nearest liquor store, or maybe take the elevator up to the psych ward and holler for some haldol.\n\n   Oooof.\n\nSent from The Precious\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/04/hospital-dammit.html", "title": "hospital, dammit"},
{"date": "April 17, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* Middly is home from the hospital! He came home last night after dinner; it was kind of touch and go whether they'd really let him out and he did come home still sick (he still has a low-grade fever and a bellyache), but he is eating and drinking, and Tylenol is enough to manage his symptoms so we all agreed he'd be better off recuperating at home. The official diagnosis is \"gastroenteritis that was getting better at home with a bland diet but was exacerbated by Daddy feeding him fast food.\" I have railed about my ex's refusal to feed the children anything that doesn't come in a decorated paper bag or box with a toy until I am blue in the face, and now he has put one of my kids in the hospital with that crap! Just not the one I always thought it'd be (Little Child's digestion is still not that of a normal kid and feeding him a greasy fast food meal is like setting off a bomb in your bathroom, the poor kid--this isn't much of an issue at home, but...). I don't think I even need to tell you how caps-lock filled with mothereffing RAGE I was over this for about five entire minutes...that's all I really had the energy for. It's been at least a week since I got even six hours of sleep in a night between the children being ill, Hotter being ill, Middly being in the hospital, and my trying to catch up on everything at home. RAGE! Ooh look, a shiny object...  * Please do not, any of you, suggest that I take this up with Social Services. Social Services doesn't care that my ex feeds my kids crap, and the doctors who treated Middly probably wouldn't be willing to testify in court that Middly ended up in Club Med due to Death By Supersizing, and even if they were a) there is no HARD EVIDENCE that that is what did it and b) I have no money for lawyers, especially for a lost cause like trying to amend custody and/or visitation over something like this. Yes, Little Child is medically fragile and I could MAYBE, if I could afford to bring his out-of-town GI specialist to court with my imaginary lottery winnings, MAYBE get a judge to ORDER the XY to stop feeding him crap, but y'know what? Even in this little fantasy all that would accomplish would be to make everyone miss work to go to court because civil court orders are only enforceable with a) evidence that they've been broken, like photos from a PI or something and b) time and money to go BACK TO COURT. And all of that is if I even thought it was for the Greater Good to take away the XY's visitation, which I do not. For all that he is a shitty father and human being, he IS the MFA Children's father and they are going to have to draw their own conclusions about him. If I force the issue they are going to end up lionizing the fucker and demonizing me for taking him out of their lives. They already pretty much know he's a tool, but he's a charming tool who buys them things I can't afford to give them and they do love him (which is more than he deserves, but then Life Is Not Fair).  * Don't worry, karma put on her shit-kickers and ran roughshod over the XY. I very nearly had to go and pick Middly up from the hospital (where the XY stayed with him from Sunday night until he was discharged) because the XY couldn't go more than five minutes without puking. HAHAHAHAHA! Rad.  * Last night I made dandelion chips! They're like kale chips, but wilder--I got the idea from the Pinterest but you make them the exact same way as you make kale chips. Most people's first reaction on hearing \"dandelion\" is something along the lines of \"OMG BITTER!?!\" The trick is to pick the leaves from dandelions that have NOT flowered yet. Once they flower they're gonna be gross. Also, you obviously don't want to pick your dandelions from somewhere that's been treated with any kind of herbicide, pesticide, or chemical fertilizer, or an area where they're likely to have been walked on by people or pooped on by animals. I pick mine from fairly \"wild\" areas of the yard (we've been living in our current home for upward of three years and I know the lawn hasn't been treated during that time) like around the compost pile and the edges of my garden, and go for new growth that's unlikely to have been walked on. I also soak my dandelion greens in cold water with a little vinegar in to kill any soil-cooties prior to oiling them up and baking them. Why dandelions? Well, for one if correctly gathered and prepared they carmelize in the oven to a delicious, almost nutty flavor and are quite tasty in addition to FREE! Plus they're loaded (and I mean LOADED) with Vitamins A and especially K, which are safest to get from dietary sources. They've also got a decent amount of Vitamin C and Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. I don't much care for boiled or fresh dandelion greens, but I love me some kale chips and now dandelion chips as well; I've gathered the fuzzy seedheads from a dozen or so dandelions and plan to try and grow them in a large pot for guaranteed-clean snacking.  * I freaking hate it when work computers force me to change my password. I understand the reasoning behind this, and should probably change my personal computer and various account passwords more often, but...it's put a kink in my happy little morning work-routine of \"arrive, drop lunch off in kitchen fridge, get coffee, log into computer.\" It's like when you're walking up or down stairs and you think there's one more but there's not. ANNOYING!  * Since my body apparently reads my blog and responds to written complaints (I am now TEN ENTIRE POUNDS lighter than when I posted my whine about the water weight last week, which I would link to except that I am posting this via e-mail from The Precious because HOTTER HAS STOLEN MY COMPUTER) (the part he ordered to fix his was the wrong one, grr), I would like to hereby go on record and say that it wouldn't hurt my feelings any if my tits crept a couple of inches back up my chest. Please and thank you.  * I saw a recipe for HONEYSUCKLE JELLY on the Pinterest and now it is pretty much all I can think about when I have the free time to consider such things. Honey. Suckle. Jelly. You'd best believe I'll be trying THAT out! We have a nice patch of honeysuckle around the blackberry patch at the back of our yard where I can get clean, pesticide-free honeysuckle blossoms.  * Speaking of food from the yard, we are now getting mixed baby greens aplenty. We had salad made of them with dinner last night and I packed a big Tupperware container of them and a four-ounce Mason jar with some home-made dressing to have with my lunch. I love me some salad! I can't wait for the tomatoes and cucumbers to start coming in!  * How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/04/bits-and-scrids.html", "title": "bits and scrids"},

{"date": "July 16, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Tonight was another one of those nights that I wish I could be less closed-mouthed about what I do for a living these days and share some hilarious anecdotes, because for all the initial confusion and drama about hours and fulltime status I genuinely do love my job itself (as in what I do when I am on the clock) and like my co-workers. We have FUN at work, and as part of our job we get to do little things to pamper people that make them happy, and customers write Management nice letters about it, and that? Kicks all kinds of ass.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I will share that tonight a much-younger co-worker who is working toward an advanced degree at a university that happens to be my undergraduate alma mater and I got to talking about higher education in general while we sat together and performed a tedious task. They expressed some ambivalence about finishing the degree, and asked me what I thought. My answer, after I considered the question for a moment, kind of surprised me, because it's a very different one from the one I would have given the same co-worker ten years ago. Before, I would have said \"you started it, so of COURSE you need to finish it plus DEGREES ARE GOOD TO HAVE!\" Tonight I told my co-worker that it depended on why they were pursuing the degree. \"If it's because you think you SHOULD, or that it'll necessarily offer you much of an edge in today's job market,* or that teaching would be nice to have as an option to fall back on, fuck it. If, on the other hand, you are studying what you are studying because you love learning about it, and it fills you up more than it empties you out, keep on plugging,\" I advised. I told them that in my experience UNLESS you wanted to teach or work in a technical field where a degree is a necessity to advance in your career of choice, a degree is more of a hindrance than a help in getting hired anywhere BUT your degree field (true story--I finally found my current job, a \"real,\" permanent job that pays more than minimum wage and comes with benefits, only AFTER I started leaving the MFA off my resume). \"And teaching,\" I told them, with a rueful grin...\"Well. If you are one of the very best and most prolific in your field and can publish and get tenure, that's one thing, but teaching as an adjunct pays a LOT less than what you and I are doing right now, and doesn't come with benefits.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy shit, really,\" my co-worker asked, saucer-eyed. \"I was wondering why you'd do this if you could teach instead...a couple of us were talking about that and thinking you had to be crazy!\" I said there was more to it than the money, but certainly that was part of it, and then I changed the subject.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I decided to walk away from teaching (after yes, technically I got fired for blowing a deadline that, under the circumstances I would blow again in a heartbeat--since there is Stalky out there reading avidly and dampening her desk chair any time she thinks I'm not being entirely transparent I don't want to make it seem like I am glossing over that), I had two main feelings: relief (because gawd, I hated it by the time I decided not to do it anymore, and if you go back and read the post I linked to about the getting fired you'll see that I had been planning to stop teaching anyway, just not quite that abruptly) and shame. Not because I feel like I failed as a teacher (I actually think I was pretty damned good at the actual teaching part, although the administrative \"no I will not NOT fail you for plagiarism even if your daddy DOES call the dean and haul me into campus for your grievance hearing\" part was not my favorite by a long shot and probably I could have put off or avoided getting so burnt out had I let go of caring so much about trying to teach my students not only about writing but also The Importance Of Doing Right In General), but because...seriously? I spent years and years (not to mention a kajillion dollars) working toward a terminal degree to work in a blue-collar industry? How embarrassing! Who DOES that?!?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Well, you know what, fuck it. I guess I am who does that, and I'm a much happier person because of it, not to mention making better money. I did the math one time, and what with teaching paying per credit hour, not per how-many-students-you-have or how-many-hours-you-spend-on-administrative-crap and busting plagiarists I was teaching for LESS than minimum wage. That? Was pretty freaking disheartening. I haven't worked for minimum wage, let alone LESS than minimum wage, since I stopped teaching. Plus my current (blue-collar) job comes with benefits. I'm doing what makes the best sense for my mental health and the needs of my family, I'm enjoying life a lot more as a result, and? I'm READING and WRITING again (no, I don't mean blogs, although I read those too and obviously I write this one). Teaching writing and literature appreciation turned it from something I loved enough to study it at an advanced level for eight years to something that I hated to even think about, and that? THAT, my friends, was a shame.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The funny part is that if all of this extra-curricular reading and writing I do continues in the direction it's going, I'll eventually be in a position where I might actually HAVE a snowball's chance in hell at pursuing tenure somewhere, and if that does happen? I'll take great satisfaction in my accomplishments in my degree field and keep right on working in the service industry. I like getting paid to do little kind things that make people happy, and working with people who don't judge me for being broke because THEY GET IT, and not having to worry about what I'll wear to work (because I have a uniform), and I really, REALLY like that once I've been at this job past the initial waiting period, doing all of these things that I like will not only result in my getting paid but also in my securing medical, dental, and vision benefits for myself and my husband. Once the benefits kick in and I can stop paying through the nose for medical insurance we'll be far better off than we were when I was teaching (and than we are right now, ugh**). Where is the shame in that? I'm having a hard time finding any.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Are there people who will judge me for this choice? Yep, probably plenty of 'em. Do I actually give a solitary fuck if someone ignorant to the facts in re: what teaching pays vs. working in the service industry (or who maybe just looks down on those who work in fields that support and care for others) thinks I'm a nutter for choosing the way I did? Nope. Do I regret going for the MFA? Nah, I freaking LOVED grad school and learned a lot of amazing things from some very cool people. Do I feel like a failure for not using the MFA at work? I did at first, but now that I'm actually able to CREATE again in my degree field, I actually feel like LESS of a failure on a day-to-day basis than I did while I was teaching.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Go figure.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I won't say what my co-worker is majoring in, but I will say that, like English, it's one of those majors that is all about the study of ideas and subjective discourse, rather than, say, specialized technical skills one might use in earn a living in a specific career field.\r\n** \u00a0 You know, barring weeks where there's a tornado, a car wreck, multiple ER visits and an emergency surgery to contend with.

{"date": "April  9, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I'm still around, y'all. I'm just kind of laying low waiting for things to suck a little less so this isn't one big whiny depress-o-rama (I know, I know, FEW YEARS TOO LATE, HA!). Plus, lacking the funds to replace the video card on his computer, Hotter's solution was to plunk my laptop down on his desk, run the monitor cable to his Giant For The Blind Man Monitor into the side of it, move the charger to the outlet under his desk, and...yeah. I'm like a fourth-world nation over here, wandering around with my iPhone bundled up in a spotted handkerchief tied to the stick slung over my shoulder. It's super-tragic.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, life goes on. I've added to the garden and there are now five twenty-foot rows and a 3x12-ft bed at the end of those in the back yard in addition to the six original beds out front and two new raised beds in the side yard. I DIG WHEN I HAVE FEELINGS, OKAY? As far as my feelings...eh. I'm still utterly panic-stricken about money, unsure of how long my job will last, and not feeling entirely fabulous, although (knock wood) Bad Ear is no longer painful and Jank Jaw seems to be subsiding somewhat as well. I am hopeful at this point that Bad Ear was the reason for Jank Jaw acting up, and maybe now that I'm not in pain from the ear the jaw will settle the eff down and revert to its' pre-ENT Clusterfuck of 2012 level of brokenness (status: effed up but nothing a $500 mouthguard and daily PT exercises at home doesn't keep to a dull roar). Bum Leg is doing better since I quit running (again), the Mystery Surgical Situation I mentioned before is no worse, and my lungs are behaving. I am quietly optimistic; maybe this won't be the bump that upsets the whole goddamn applecart of my health after all, and wouldn't that be nice? Most of what still ails me is, I think, the lingering effect of all the stress on my body (my adrenal glands, judging by the dark purple scarring I tend to do lately, are struggling more than usual, which makes sense given all the stress and steroids of the past couple of months and I'm bone-tired in a way that I was no longer accustomed to being on a daily basis--today, for example, it was utterly gorgeous and I came home from work, changed into gardening clothes, applied bug spray, and then crawled into bed and took a nap).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter's next dental appointment is in two weeks and I still have no idea how we're going to pay for that. Dammit, we really need to win the lottery over here (not that we play it, which might be why).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I...still have nothing to say, really, unless you want to hear about how pissed I am that in over a month of religiously tracking my caloric intake and exercise using MyFitnessPal I have managed to...wait for it...gain eight pounds.\u00a0\r\nFigure One: Weight loss. UR DOIN IT RONG! Center number redacted because my husband reads my blog and my weight is the one secret I have from that nosy, nosy man. If it weren't for him I'd tell the rest of y'all, if only as a PSA of sorts, because the number is one that commands some motherfucking attention and yet I don't look all that bad. Society is so stupid about womens' weight :(\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So either I have some kind of infection brewing, or I'm just legitimately gaining weight on 1200 or fewer net calories per day, and neither option makes my heart sing, but oh well. On the bright side my clothes still fit about the same (yes, I know that muscle weighs more than fat and I get a TON of exercise in the garden, but I still think this is a little absurd), so if I hadn't bought a scale in order to become healthier I'd never even know to be worried (no joke, I am thinking of just getting rid of the scale and going back to eating what I want as long as my clothes fit--I felt a lot better about myself when that was my system).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And that is all the non-news that's fit to commit to rambling pixelated print. Except that via TFLN I learned today of a sex act called The Pterodactyl and I haven't stopped giggling since (especially after Hotter attempted to pantomime how one might go about doing such a thing).

I went to Job #1 but got sent immediately home for being mostly-unconscious while upright, and called out of Job #2 yesterday, and now here I am getting ready to go to work a very short and forgiving shift, but still, after two days' rest, sick and filled with The Rage over my ex (who called twice this morning before the first alarm), my husband, (who somehow dropped furniture in the way of our bedroom door from OUTSIDE THE ROOM and required me to get up and lift it clear at the very most achy time of day for me), and two of three children who have learned that \"queasy\" = no school given that I've recently had to do The Drive Of Shame and fetch pukers but are perfectly fine (and LOUD).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yes, it's me and the Earl against my achy, congested, bad-attitude-having demeanor, and I think we're fighting a losing battle because at the moment I hate everything but the Earl.

I think that'd be a capital idea if not for a) hens being accomplished shitters who would laugh at newspaper and b) our hens being cagey enough to probably realize the pantry moths are the benevolent deities that have gifted them with an entire box of organic quinoa and half a box of orzo just today and worship them instead of eating the fuckers.\r\n* \u00a0 The tomato stew was delicious with just some feta crumbled in, and I probably didn't need the carbs anyway. Grumble, grumble.\r\n* \u00a0 Someone popular at one of my jobs is being kind of a bully, in a \"pick on MFA Mama and call her an airhead and ridicule her intellect\" kind of way, and it sucks. I think I'm just going to try calling them out with honesty and maybe saying something like \"hey I've noticed our exchanges have taken on kind of an unpleasant mocking undertone lately, and I'm not really that nasty of a person and you aren't either so can we maybe try and be a little more positive with each other?\" The problem with that though is that it kind of makes me want to steal my OWN lunch money and call myself a hippie. We'll see I guess. At least this year it's someone being mean with their words and not actually threatening to cut me, so, you know. Better off, indeed! And yes, this person is aware that I have Actual ADD, but the problem with ADD is that it's kind of like telling people you have an automatic whoopie cushion built into your ass. Sure, they might ACT understanding, and eventually you'll sit down and they'll snicker, and hell, you might too, because fart-sounds are funny.

Guess I'd better quit blowing off my OB/GYN, who I haven't seen since my hysterectomy (I still have a partial cervix, yes, but I've never had a questionable PAP smear and haven't had any new sexual partners since then, so didn't feel it was irresponsible to skip the co-pay. A close relative with breast cancer is a game-changer though, obviously).\r\nLove: That, as several of you who know the sordid details have reminded me, Stalky is pretty much impotent these days. Back when custody of my children was not yet settled and Stalky knew where I worked she scared the shit out of me. Now the worst she can do* is tell lies about me on the innernet to strangers who, if they're listening to her, I probably wouldn't want to be friends with anyway. SO WHAT.Hate: That I still get that visceral jolt of adrenaline when I find out she's still out there beating her crazy drum...IT HAS BEEN YEARS, S. MOVE ON ALREADY. SHEESH.\u00a0\r\nLove: That Hotter and I have brick-and-mortar friends who do things like come over with vodka the night this happened (yeah I never did spell it out on here, but I wasn't with Hotter in the hospital that time because HE DIDN'T WANT ME THERE...that is how the neurological event in question initially affected him; he didn't want a damn thing to do with me for a few hours until successful treatment began, and while I did spend nearly ten years in a marriage with a man who seemed to hate my guts most of the time, to the point that I was used to it, I have since lost that particular callous; that was the first time Hotter has EVER not treated me with love and kindness...and hopefully the last, because it GUTTED ME) (also relax, Stalky, the boys were with their father, I would never get drunk while solely in charge of my children), drive us to the oral surgeon (who, bizarrely, required my next-of-kin to be ON PREMISES to put me to sleep), lend me the money to get the general anesthesia, and come and take my sorry arse to the ER when I'm in no shape to drive and too cheap to call an ambulance. And those were four DIFFERENT friends! We are so lucky.Hate: That none of those friends (except one, who I met VIA my blog six years ago, pre-Stalky) know about the blog, and I don't feel like I can discuss them here (such. good. stories.). Past bad experience with mixing blog-land and \"real life\" makes me verrrrry leery of doing so ever again (with certain notable exceptions such as the afore-mentioned k and Dr. Anon).\r\nLove: That I am finally, FINALLY starting to feel normal-ish again (okay, so my jaw is still fairly sore, but that is to be expected, and I still have a productive cough and a husky voice but I'm not winded by a single flight of stairs...at least my blood pressure is out of the \"corpse\" range, and judging by how I feel, my Potassium level is, too).Hate: That the coming work-a-thon will probably knock me back on my ass.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What are you loving and hating right now?\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Well, obviously she could do worse than that, seeing as how she knows where I live.

Like you know how if you give a cat a big ole pile of catnip, they do that thing where they take a bite, fling themselves down on their backs, and twist around with a look on their face like \"yes, I know, I'm ridiculous but this is just SO GREAT?\" That.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Sometimes a good distraction is the most wonderful thing in the world, and for as long as I was buried in the books, novellas, and short stories, my tooth didn't hurt and my head didn't hurt and I wasn't worrying about money or anyone's health or the fact that someone done lost their mind at one of my jobs (yes, again, no, not the same person, a different one--we're an unstable lot in the service industry, what can I say).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It was grand.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Especially when I found that the author has a website where she not only publishes the odd freebie, but also does nice things like auction signed copies of her work (including a chapter of her not-yet-released next book) and a phone call from her to benefit those affected by Hurricane Sandy via the American Red Cross. I'd totally bid on that if I had money to burn, purely because PREVIEW CHAPTER (not so much the signed books, as I have an enire shelf full of those from the many amazing writers I met during my MFA program years and I kind of feel like signed books are overrated, in a don't-touch-those-maybe-someone-will-die-scandalously-and-make-us-rich-on-eBay kind of way, or the phone call because I hate the phone, but I suppose I'd suck it up and talk to my new favorite author for a bit, you know, to be polite).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If kinky sex is not your thing then a) I'm terribly sorry for you and b) probably you won't enjoy Tiffany Reisz's work but if it is (or even if it's not ACTUALLY your thing but something you like to read about OTHER people doing) you should absolutely check out the books and the website, and if kinky sex and CHARITY are both things you like and you're filthy rich you should go and bid in that auction.

Remember how my front tooth fell out (NOT the one that was an issue all LAST year, but the OTHER one--I KNOW), and I was all \"GAHHH!\" over it? Well, I didn't want to say anything while The Powers That Be were ruminating, and still don't want to go into any specifics, because Stalky, but the long and short of it is that the reason the thing fell out was the post to the crown got broken as a result of an injury (no, you didn't miss anything--I didn't blog about this but I kind of got whacked in the face) (I won't say how except to specify that it was NOT an act of violence on anyone's part) that was NOT my fault in any way, shape, or form, and the party at fault has accepted liability.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In plain English, this means that I am in talks with my dentist (we've yet to determine whether he accepts the type of compensation offered in this sort of situation--worst-case scenario I'd have to find another dentist who would for this one piece of work and hopefully it doesn't come to that, but if it does I'll deal) about a PERMANENT FIX for the glued-together front crown. Hopefully there is enough tooth left to anchor another crown. If not, I'll get an implant. Either way it won't cost me a dime! YAAAAY!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Of course, because I'm an ungrateful wretch, I will admit to not being entirely 100% thrilled, because I don't know how the hell my dentist will get the glued-on crown OFF in order to do whatever has to be done to the poor beleaguered tooth next but I have a feeling it will involve him up in my grille with sterile pliers and that godawful wrenching CRACK! that features prominently in all of my very worst nightmares. I mean, it's either that or I start eating apples and cross my fingers?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps I'll ask for some pre-appointment Valium or something. That's a thing, right?

{"date": "August 22, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSo I got an e-mail from Dell today stating that my laptop had been repaired and was on the way back. Yay! I still haven't seen the $160 I was quoted for the new battery come out of my account, though, so I hit the link to chat with an agent about that. I have an auditory processing defect that makes understanding foreign-to-me accents very difficult for me, so I LOVE that Dell has the live-chat option, as most of their CSRs are based in India.\r\n\r\n   Today's representative was no exception. I get the impression she didn't understand most of what I typed. I asked whether the battery was shipping with the laptop or separately, and she informed me the laptop would arrive tomorrow. I rephrased my question and she listed the parts that Dell had replaced. The battery was on the list, but the hard drive was NOT. This was counter to what the last representative had told me (they'd said the hard drive was damaged and all of my data lost, and I had a long and frustrating exchange with a different agent about whether or not I could get them to send me the bad part so a techie friend could try to recover my data). I informed today's representative of that and she said not to worry, that the computer had been tested and was now in working order. I point-blank asked if my hard drive was replaced. She said no. Okay! Great! Then I asked about the cost of the battery and she said there was no charge because it was covered by the warranty. If that is the case it's terrific news, but two different reps had previously told me that was NOT the case.\r\n\r\n   I am very confused. I don't know whether I should add that $160 back to my checkbook or not, I'm not sure if my data is lost or not, I don't understand what is going on with the battery/warranty situation (and if the battery IS covered I'm going to be annoyed because this is my third battery; when the first one died I paid for the second one out of pocket because, again, I was told batteries aren't covered by the warranty)...and after switching from live chat to telephone conversation I am unconvinced the representative really understood what I was even asking!\r\n\r\n   I think I'm just going to have to see what's in the box when the MFA Laptop gets home and go from there. Which is frustrating. I could rant about the outsourcing of call-center work, which in and of itself is a real negative when so many Americans need jobs, but my real issue here is that the reps I keep speaking with, while obviously knowledgable and almost excruciatingly polite, don't have an adequate grasp of the English language to help me. And that's bad all around; not only is it as useless to customers as no service at all, but I'm sure it's frustrating for the reps as well.\r\n\r\n   Bottom line? I'll be so glad when my laptop is home!\r\n\r\n   How are all of YOU?\r\n\r\nSent from The Precious\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/08/communication-dell-emma.html", "title": "communication Dell-emma"},

The line of work I am in waxes and wanes to a certain extent, and can swing even further in either direction than usual due to a plethora of factors, from The Economy to Current Events to Management Problems and Administrative Dustups. We're in the slim season right now, and there have also been Extenuating Circumstances, and there just aren't enough hours to be had to make a living even with Tightening Our Belts. I won't lie, I am Very Concerned, which is part of why I don't have tons to say lately. There are only so many ways to say \"it's like The Grapes of Wrath, but in a minivan.\" Thanks to my garden and the critters of Squatter Workshop, we have enough to eat, so there's that (and I'm very thankful). I'm playing chicken with school supplies and the first day of school, but I think it'll be okay (I'll be stuck elbowing last-minute shoppers in the teeth for the last zippered pencil case, but it's all good! I'm scrappy!). Still sucks though, and makes me feel antsy when things are this tight.\n\n* Item: Due to the above, I went for a job interview Friday, and today I found out I got the job! It'll be a new Weekend Warrior job, in addition to my fulltime-but-currently-part-time gig, and hopefully THIS one won't go bankrupt...LOL, J/K!!! No but really, it would totally screw with my head...I start this weekend and I think it'll be fun. I'm working for someone who was my boss at the ORIGINAL Weekend Warrior Job, who I like very much. So that's good.\n\n* Dell on wheels? As I type this (with my lightning-fast index finger), a new laptop should be on its' way. SHOULD being the operative word, as I never got any dispatch information from Dell. This makes me nervous, and I e-mailed them yesterday, and will call tomorrow. Sigh.\n\n* And finally...today I took a co-worker a rabbit as a gift. She perked up when she heard that I raise them, and offered to buy one from me, but I like her very much (she was one of MANY people I work with who were exceptionally kind during Hotter's neurological mishegas) and told her I'd just give her one. So I took it in today, but wanted to be discreet, because while gifting co-workers with smallstock isn't expressly forbidden in the Employee Handbook, I kind of doubt the answer would have been yes had I asked The Powers That Be. So I went up to my co-worker friend and said \"I brought you a present!\" quietly, and she muttered \"rabbit?\" and I nodded, and she pumped her fist excitedly. Another co-worker, who knew nothing of our agreement but had overheard, gave me a dirty look and stalked off muttering in her first language (which is not English, so I don't know what she was actually saying, just that it didn't sound good). Second Coworker continued glaring at me and muttering until I finally just asked her point-blank if I'd done something to upset her. \"As a matter of fact, yes!\" she snapped. \"You could have asked me if I wanted a rabbit if you have a connection! I'm old but I'm not dead!\" I was a little confused by the second part of her statement, but eager to make peace, and said I hadn't known she wanted a rabbit too, but I had plenty more if she did, since they breed like, well, rabbits. \"BREED?!?\" She looked at me like one of us was insane.

{"date": "September 18, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 I took Hotter to his Transplant checkup today; the GOOD news is that he's gained five pounds. This means that \"Operation Foie Gras\" (in which I bake All The Things and stuff Hotter like a goose) is working! The bad news, which isn't really THAT bad (at least by MFA standards), is that his Prograf level was too high, which in turn bumped his creatinine level up higher than they like to see it. This didn't surprise me, as he has lost over thirty pounds since his last checkup and medication dosages are based on weight. It didn't surprise the transplant folks either, because apparently the type of GI issues Hotter is having tend to jack Prograf levels UP (which is counterintuitive--you'd THINK this sort of thing would bring all levels DOWN). Either way, they're having him take less Prograf and that should take care of the issue (and, to clarify, his creatinine is only up from his baseline by 0.17, which is not a huge scary jump), and Dr. Kidney is going to pull some strings to get him seen by a GI doctor to address the GI/weight thing.\r\n* \u00a0 Dr. Kidney came into the room and asked Hotter to tell her why he was in the ER. \"I WAS CURSED BY GYPSIES,\" he replied. She raised an eyebrow and fired back with \"tell me something I DON'T know!\" Heh.\r\n* \u00a0Dell's screwing continues: UPS has effing LOST the package containing the battery. I just...so. Much. Rage. I can't even.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter's been goofier than usual lately; his recent reign of terror includes giving the battery package to the wrong UPS man, breaking the LAST CHARGING CABLE IN THE HOUSE for The Precious (this means that I can only charge it in the MFA Minivan until payday, which is really cutting into my Words With Friends time--MY FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS, LET ME TELL YOU THEM), and, tonight, ruining a pot of macaroni noodles. I am having a harder time than usual being patient with him. Today he wanted to talk something that was stressing me out TO DEATH, and was DETERMINED to tell me the extended version of his (incorrect) recollection of it as we were driving home from Dr. Kidney's office, and I was cranky and hormonal and hadn't had breakfast (because Hotter has to be fasting for his labs and I didn't want to eat in front of him), and finally lost it and was a bit of an ass. He's over it (short-term memory loss FTW?) but I kind of feel like a weasel.\r\n* \u00a0 Politics. Oy vey ismir! I'll be so glad when this election is over with. Now everyone is all het up because apparently Mitt Romney has nothing but contempt for 47% of the American people. People, people--NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THAT! Heck, I probably have nothing but contempt for a much GREATER percentage of us; I just happen to believe that we all still deserve food, shelter, healthcare, and autonomy over our bodies regardless of gender. Mittens, on the other hand, apparently thinks everyone who wasn't born into privilege should just fuck off and die in a tire-fire if they're cold, hungry, sick, or faced with an unwanted pregnancy. Which is his right, but makes him wrong for the job of President in my humble opinion.\r\n* \u00a0 The lovefest in the comments section of this post is making my black little heart grow three sizes.

It was a lot of late nights helping pamper and clean after OTHER families and overtime, and I could've addressed some more pressing moneysinks but YOLO. Of course our spotty innernet went down as he was installing it and then he was all \"this is worse than when the Hebrews had to make bricks without straw\" or somesuch and the flames that shot out of my eyes burned dinner.

I am fresh from a post-ER Silkwood Shower, and have now been diagnosed with bronchitis, thinner blood than usual, stress-induced hypertension, and a bad attitude. Also the nearest ER apparently thinks I am trying to conceal a miracle pregnancy, because they wanted a urine sample to test for HCG and I said I'd pee in the cup if they needed urine for medical reasons but was surgically sterile, and they told me I couldn't actually KNOW that. OH YES ACTUALLY I CAN. I confined my remarks to a factoid about sans-uterine pregnancy statistics and an expression of the earnest desire not to have that PARTICULAR lab applied against my deductible, and they told me I'd be amazed (no, actually I would be ON TELEVISION and RICH).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm on Levaquin and albuterol for the lungs, sharp-object precautions for the blood, nothing for the BP since it bottomed out moments later (178/75-120/60 in less than ten minutes MAY BE MY NEXT TATTOO*), and probably some kind of \"beware\" list with mugshots in Admissions because right after I made the nurse get the rx for a z-pack (REALLY? Enter that into the search box to the right if you're not already shaking your head) changed to Levaquin she told me to enjoy the raging yeast infection I was sure to get by insisting on such a big-gun drug and I licked my lips, gave a full-body shudder, rolled my eyes and said \"OH I WILL!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I should have asked her if that would be dangerous to the baby.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I got outside the hospital valets had left the MFA Minivan exactly where I exited it and cordoned it off with construction cones rather than drive the thing.

Therefore you've missed a few events, photos, and explanations. Here they are in no particular order, because I'm le tired and the power might go out again at any moment:\r\n* \u00a0 The tattoo: is something I'd been mulling for about five years, did not cost me any money out of pocket, and is based on an original design you can buy from these guys and hang on YOUR wall if you want, TOO. I already knew I wanted a hamsa and liked the Mikes' design a lot, so I traced it, lined the inside of the handprint a little more simply, made the eye look a little different, and added three dots to represent my boys. I promised myself I'd get the ink if I survived Wednesday, and got it done Thursday afternoon right after the root canal sans-local. Yes, it hurt, no, I didn't cry/flinch/take any breaks/care, and yes, I went to a reputable artist who I've known for nearly twenty years and I can still donate blood and tissue if my health allows it. ALSO yes to infection precautions beforehand; I am cleaning it with chlorhexidine, have the artist's personal cell number in my phone JUST IN CASE, and will probably end up taking a course of Levaquin for unrelated reasons in the super-near future anyway so yeah. Not worried.\r\nFigure One: The first mark ever to go on my body on MY effing terms. Love it SO MUCH!\r\n* \u00a0 Oh, right, the antibiotics? Would not be related to dental work. My sinuses are draining every color on an American stoplight, though, and I have this juicy cough that's not going anywhere. It's like, I know I probably SHOULD see a doctor, but because I'm afebrile and my bad ear doesn't hurt I keep not finding the time. Tomorrow I already have the dentist (AGAIN), the insurance adjuster, and the boys coming home.\r\n* \u00a0 My ex is back to being The Lord of The Douche. I mean, his actions are sterling (this week). His words, on the other hand...well. I'll put it this way: when I spoke to him today and he got nasty, I said \"whoa, oh no you don't, not today with THAT!\" He then attempted to call me out for attitude so I told him \"THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING. NOT. TODAY.\" At which point he asked me what was wrong and I told him about wrecking the van and he chilled out somewhat. So he gets a B+ right now. WAY above average, but not excellent.\r\n* \u00a0 I had a chat with Trashcan Neighbor today; I filled her in on my past week and told her that while I realized there was a lot of debris on the ground at my house (and even some straight-up junk I pitched out of the MFA Minivan while clearing it of cargo and seats in order to fit cages, crates, and hutches containing the dogs, the cockatiel, and all of the denizens of Squatter Workshop before our power came back on, in order to use the vehicle's AC to keep them all alive), it WOULD be cleaned up within an objectively reasonable length of time UNLESS the health department, Animal Control, or any other county agencies showed up in response to a neighbor complaint, in which case I would open an illegal waste-processing plant in my back yard and give them something to call a county agenccy ABOUT. \"And when you tell every single neighbor, because I know you will, tell them this,\" and I pointed to my face, \"was my face. This is my I DON'T CARE face.\" She blanched and stammered and claimed never to have called the county on me, and I held up my hand. \"I am not asking you if you did or didn't, and I won't even believe you if you tell me. Just remember: week from HELL, illegal waste-processing plant, don't-care face.\"\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Totally unrelated to any of the above, I had to call 911 today. There was a shooting in my neighborhood; it definitely was NOT fireworks and it pissed me off. The ONE time I go outside without The Precious some motherfucker has to go and break the peace? SERIOUSLY? I booked it back to the house, called the police, and convinced Hotter to put clothes on (harder than it sounded) (not like THAT, god) (I mean not right that...you know what? NEVERMIND). Three squad cars, an ambulance, and a boom-truck rolled up. The officer who responded called me to let me know they were pretty sure it was Sketchy Neighbor, who appeared to be On Something, but there was nothing they could do under the law at this time.

{"date": "October  4, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Y'all are adorable.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0No, Ze Brain is not supposed to look like that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm pretty sure I've mentioned Hotter having had a stroke at some point before, but yeah. After his organ transplants, he ended up with a condition called polycythemia, in which too much of one's blood-volume is comprised of red blood cells. Polycythemia can be caused by lots of scary-assed things, but in Hotter's case seems to have been related to the transplants, or at least his transplant team sees it a lot. Something about erythropoietin (the hormone that spurrs one's bone marrow to produce erythrocytes, i.e. red blood cells) being produced by the kidneys and him having more of those than the average bear (counting native ones and the donor one he has three, although if his native kidneys wanted to get off their asses and DO something, it'd be nice if they'd, oh, LOWER HIS CREATININE instead of perform some kind of blood-doping black magic that almost killed him--this just goes to show you that Hotter is perverse to the very CORE).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So anyway, if you've ever roasted a turkey CORRECTLY, i.e. in broth into which you've chopped a lot of carrots, celery, onion, and garlic, you'll know that when you go to baste the bird it can be tricky because of all the lumps that'll block the flow of broth into the baster, and Hotter's brain did one of THOSE numbers, and whereas this situation is a pain in the ass around Thanksgiving when it happens in the roasting pan, when it happens in the major arteries of the brain that's a stroke, and the brain doesn't like oxygen deprivation so the hunk of Hotter's brain that didn't have blood flow while there was a clot just upped and died and was replaced by fluid (the black part of the scan), and the part that had blood in it where blood didn't belong after the clot BLEW and the hemmorhaging began got scarred (the white part of the scan), and the brain doesn't like scarring either so now dude has complex focal seizures from time to time, which are not awesome.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0To stop the seizures, Hotter takes a hefty dose of an anticonvulsant drug, which is monitored by his neurologist. Anticonvulsants are less a cure for seizures and more a pharmaceutical game of \"would you rather,\" especially when someone has as many OTHER things wrong with them as Hotter does and as many OTHER drugs at play for those. Would you rather...have grand mal seizures during which you lose consciousness and stop breathing...or run a small risk of ALL OF YOUR SKIN FALLING OFF, have lots of wee LITTLE seizures (myoclonic jerks) instead, and also have eleventy-seven OTHER unpleasant side effects if your levels are too high, including things like dizziness, loss of balance, confusion, memory and cognitive problems, mood swings, and apparently some bad things that can happen to your vagina if you have one, which fortunately for MANY reasons, Hotter does not. Apparently if the levels get TOO high the drug he's on can even CAUSE seizures of the sort Hotter is taking it to prevent. Anticonvulsants are actually pretty shitty drugs, and it's better to just not need them in the first place.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Those of you who have been playing along at home will recall that a couple of years ago Hotter started having breakthrough seizures, so they upped his seizure meds at that time, since his levels were on the lower side and there was room to go up. Since then, though, Hotter's renal function has taken a (small) hit, which alters your metabolism of...things...and also he has developed some pretty major GI issues and lost thirty pounds. Which brought his anticonvulsant levels from \"on the higher side, but well-tolerated and no seizures so WIN\" into the \"here is where you have every known symptom of another pending major stroke and/or a couple of degenerative neurological things that end in death\" range. I did consider that perhaps Hotter's altered bodyweight had resulted in minor toxicity of one of his bazillion or so medications, but given that none of them are NEW and it was ONLY thirty pounds, major badness seemed a lot more likely, hence the Unbloggability.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So the current plan is the drop the anticonvulsant dosage, give things a week or two, and reassess. If there are no breakthrough seizures and the scary symptoms go away, we declare victory and erect a small, tasteful shrine to Hotter's neurologist in the living room, just some oranges and incense, nothing too crazy. If there are breakthrough seizures or the scary symptoms stay the same or get worse, we go back to the neurologist for a drug change and possibly some more testing. And either way, we both take a moment to remember how very precious it is that Hotter is even alive to HAVE problems like unpleasant side effects and a wife who devoutly wishes he'd not be an occasional arsehole and also put the GOT-DAMN butter back into the refrigerator after he's done with it, which was a lot of what motivated the neurologist to show us both the scans yesterday. Because he's really \"quite remarkable,\" as the neurologist gushed several times during the appointment yesterday, and \"it's a wonderful world we live in.\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. Hotter no longer has polycythemia. For a while he had to go and get bled periodically, while he waited for a drug that artificially induces anemia to take effect, and then it did, and then it started working TOO well so they stopped it and the polycythemia never came back. Whether this indicates that his native kidneys finally fucked off and died the REST of the way, or is just a stroke of luck...is kind of anyone's guess. But they check his H&H every time they check any of the other umpteen levels and measures of function, so if it comes back it'll hopefully be caught before it causes anything ELSE bad to happen.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/10/braaaaaains.html", "title": "braaaaaains"},

I already made the toaster pastries on the cover and Hotter and the boys went NUTS over them.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Ordinarily I'm not much for cookbooks; my dad was, among many other things including a shrink, a sheet metal worker, and an acid test-subject, a chef. I grew up learning to judge dishes by color, smell, consistency, and taste, and that Joy of Cooking was the only cookbook any household needed, for times when you needed to know how to make something obscure by special request. I didn't own my first non-JOC cookbook until I was an adult, and tend not to follow instructions well in the kitchen because I usually know better on my own (sounds conceited, but it's true). This book, however? Not only is it well-written and beautifully illustrated, but you get the feeling you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with the author and have a good time. Plus if The Zany Housewife endorses it, I take her word as law. After all, her White Bean and Sausage Stew is still something Hotter talks about in reverential tones. The woman knows her food, is what I'm saying.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0A couple of days ago, in the midst of The Badness, Hotter and I got lost, and I spotted a \"sweet potato plants for sale\" sign and pulled over. It turned out that behind some woods and a tumble-down house were fields of active farmland, and the old fellow selling sweet potato plants also had a wide variety of beautiful organic (!!!) veggies for sale. We spent $15 and got ten pounds each of Yukon Gold and baby red potatoes, several obscenely-large cucumbers, a number of excellent yellow squash, and a thirteen-pound head of cabbage (also a baker's dozen sweet potato slips, which the proprietor refused to charge me for, stating that that wasn't enough to even involve money over).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Last night, recalling that my new cookbook contained a recipe for sauerkraut, I cut up and macerated half the head of cabbage, salting and squishing and salting some more, then mixed in about half a cup of water kefir and packed it all into a half-gallon jar:\r\nFigure Two: MFAKraut!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The instructions warned me to put the jar or crock on a folded towel, because it would overflow, but I am hardheaded and didn't see how that would happen. I mean, isn't \"matter cannot be created nor destroyed\" one of the laws of the freaking universe or something? Well, tell that to my pantry shelves, all of which now smell vaguely kraut-y. Usually it takes at least three days and up to ten to have edible kraut, but I think that little bit of water kefir accelerated the fermentation process and I? Am just tickled to death. IT SMELLS LIKE SAUERKRAUT! I MADE SAUERKRAUT OUT OF CABBAGE AND SALT AND KEFIR WATER! I AM MAGIC!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Life still sucks over here, but ordinary miracles like pickling will never cease to amuse me.*\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 And okay fiiiine, I went to the dentist after the ER and he took one look at my face and said \"YOU NEED SO MUCH VALIUM!\" and then I slept for twelve hours and am coping with things a lot better.

He was a total asshole. That's right about the time my mother started cheating on him, which, when I confronted her about it, she said was her right because he wasn't the man she'd married anymore.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Even at twelve I knew that was bullshit. And I vowed to myself that in similar circumstances I would never do the same.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Relax, I'm not about to tell you I've cheated on Hotter or anything. And his stroke happened years before we even met.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But this recent neurological...something...that he's got going on. I don't know, y'all. He's short-tempered. He hurts my feelings a lot, and when I try to talk to him about he immediately goes on the offensive. He doesn't exactly tell me I have it coming, because I think even he knows that's not true, he'll just pick some negative trait of mine and stomp all over it, ferment the juices with the purulence of his wrath into liquor, distill and drink that, and go on a drunken rampage until I give up on trying to get anywhere by talking to him and either go to work or go and hide out at Squatter Workshop.\r\nFigure One: Oh come on, you know that even liquor made from my NEGATIVE traits is going to be organic! I saw this at the ABC store while shopping for vodka to make homemade extracts with and had to take a picture.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I've often mused that my marriage to Hotter might ultimately help me empathize somewhat with my ex-husband, whose main reasons for resenting me during our marriage were my poor health and what he perceived as my refusal to do the things I COULD do in lieu of doing things that made me happy (and sometimes he was right, sometimes I'd choose to use what little energy I had to talk to a friend instead of do the dishes). Now I'm married to someone who is in poor health and is almost ALWAYS utterly exhausted when something needs DOING but can stay up until four a.m. playing online video games if there's a beta version out. The XY and I fought over the house a lot. Hotter and I don't tend to fight over the house, because while it's filthy and he's typically pretty unconcerned, I feel like an asshole if I ask him to do things because most of the mess is made by MY kids so usually I just don't bring it up.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I still think The Narcissist and the XY are shitty people who handled adversity poorly, and I did learn a lot from both of them about how NOT to handle the situation I now find myself in. But this recent stuff...well. Instead of making me empathize with them, it makes me hate them more, because there's no instruction manual for these things, and I could really fucking use one, or at least a positive example to refer to. I don't want to screw this up, or I feel like I'll lose the right to hate the people I despise most on the planet (and okay, fine, because failing others on that level of magnitude is one of the worst sins in existence, but I'm ALSO petty enough to want to keep my raging hate-ons for certain parties).

WHYYYY?).\n\n* $500 dollars worth of tests later, we a) are Officially Poor again b) knew she'd die without immediate surgery.\n\n* By that time the discount veterinary surgeon who cut the thorns out of Isis's belly a few months ago was closed.\n\n* I wrote Banfield a check intending to hock my rings and get a payday loan in the morning, but they draft it on the spot and I did not have $2,700 in the bank so surgery was out.\n\n* Banfield's quack of a vet then REFUSED TO EUTHANIZE MY DOG. She kept repeating that immediate surgery, not euthanasia, was in my dog's best interests. I told her I understood that but didn't have the money and didn't want the dog to suffer. I've had peritonitis. It's horrible. I LITERALLY would not, and DO not, wish that on a dog.\n\n* The vet then said she could give us antibiotics and narcotics for the dog and she MIGHT make it until morning, although probably her intestines would burst and surgery would be riskier and more expensive. I explained that I would be lucky if I could raise the \"less expensive\" amount in the morning and didn't think that was fair to the dog.\n\n* The vet offered to keep Isis at their office on an IV. I asked if that would cure the dog. She said of course not. I said then just put her down, please. The vet refused, stating that she \"couldn't bear to do that.\" WHAT THE FUCK, THAT IS YOUR JOB?!?\n\n* So we paid all of our disposible income ($500) and brought our miserable, quivering, panting-in-pain dog home with the understanding that she will absolutely die, most likely before morning. The pain medicine doesn't seem to help much. I posted a video clip on Twitter of the way she's breathing; I'm pretty sure she's in shock now. We're just holding her. If she lives until morning we'll take her to the SPCA.\n\n* The real kick in the teeth? I checked their rate sheet, and the discount vet surgeon would do the surgery for a flat rate of $855, which we juuuust could've swung BEFORE paying Banfield $500 to send us home to watch our dog die. I kind of hope she goes before that place opens.\n\n* I get that Banfield has the right to earn a living, and charge whatever they want for their services. In an ideal world they'd maybe have some fucking compassion for a lifelong client whose care to date has put several thousand dollars in their pockets, but I get that they are a chain and have to answer to their corporate overlords. Whatever. The part that makes me FURIOUS, and what is absolutely inexcusable, is sending an animal they give pretty much NO chance of not dying in misery home to expire slowly in front of the people who love it.

{"date": "August 17, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYou may have noticed that I've been blogging less.\r\n\r\nPart of that is that I'm juggling two full-time jobs for a few days (on a VERY temporary basis--my primary fulltime job isn't going anywhere, especially since today I got a RAISE) (nothing huge, but still welcome in that it's a recognition of my value to The Company, and enough to buy me and Hotter dinner and a movie once per pay period) (at Taco Bell and Redbox, haha!) (I kid--we eat in and don't rent movies, even cheap ones--LET'S NOT GET CRAZY). Part of it is that I am still sans computer.\r\n\r\nMost of it, though, is that it's hard to find my stride again after tripping over a reminder that a couple of undermedicated psychopaths on the innernet really, really have strong feelings about me. To the point of e-mailing me to let me know that they've spent days of hours picking over screenshots of everything I've ever published or unpublished, online or offline, as far back as my MFA thesis, cross-referencing rumors and misdiagnoses, incorrect albeit educated guesses on the parts of various medical, legal, and other professionals about my life and life circumstances, the crazed rantings of biological family members I have no contact with and things my ex claimed to try and deprive me of my children, what was, many years ago, \"our\" money, and the respect of all and sundry in the heat of a very ugly divorce...jaysus, it really is almost flattering if one can overlook the astronomical creepy-factor, no? These people (it's mostly one person, but she's got a toadie or two who've fed her information here and there in fits of pique--I'm sure we've all ended friendships before, out of spite or simple misunderstanding, but if you're me your unauthorized revisionist biographer will be ALL OVER the other party pumping them for information and doing all she can to fan and feed the ire) just. Won't. Quit me. And while the number one rule of writing about your life (especially online) is to remember that the very LAST person you want to read it almost inevitably will, the hypothetical scenario of some brat stealing your diary or some person from your life randomly stumbling across your pseudonymous blog is very different from the ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY that across the country in another timezone, someone who cunningly wormed their way through your defenses and into your offline life, someone who proudly proclaims that you wouldn't recognize them on the street but knows what you look like, where you live, and what your childrens' names are, is getting a Google Alert every time you hit \"publish\" and adding what you write to their file on you. Searching medical journals for indications that you or your doctor are mistaken (or just lying) about any ailment you might mention. Taking to various forums to debate the likelihood of every goddamn aspect of your life. Doing things like e-mail you on the eve of your WEDDING to tell you your bringing \"another disabled person\" into your household WILL cause you to lose custody of your children if the judge who handles your custody matters pays ANY attention to the letter they've just sent him. Doing things like e-mail you a Trojan that wrecks your system embedded in a photo attachment of your sleeping child.\r\n\r\nOh yes, Stalky has done all of that and more. I've changed URLs, changed careers, hell I've considered moving and changing my NAME, but the fact is, every time I change my life to try and thwart Stalky (with the exception of the career change, which has been fabulous all-around), I lose (friends, readers, credibility for running as if I'VE done something wrong, a yard with soil I'm just getting to a good nutrient balance). So fuck running. I'm not going anywhere, censoring myself any more than I already do, uprooting a damn thing in my life, or closing my blog.\r\n\r\nI am, however, a) struggling to move forward and b) enforcing whatever boundaries I can without causing myself undue hardship. And as of today that includes un-friending and -following, via all social media, anyone who has any dealings with Stalky and her crew. It wasn't an easy decision. I've purposefully cut myself off from (and even blocked) people I genuinely like, enjoy, respect, and in some cases even admire, on the innernet. If you are one of them and it bothered you, I'm sorry. It's not your fault; Stalky got close enough to cause me harm because she's likeable and comes across as sincere, sympathetic, and long-suffering in every way imaginable. I just can't deal with logging onto the facespace or Twitter to check on my online friends and seeing any reference to Stalky or her ilk after what these people have done to my view of humankind. Asking people to choose would be lame and juvenile, and cutting people off without an explanation would have been too callous. So here it is: I am doing my best to distance myself from the entire situation, because it's scary and ugly and sad, and because if I dwell on it it will consume me. And I have a family, and a job, and real friends both online and off who deserve more from me than the kind of paranoid, despairing fury this whole clusterfuck tends to drive me to. I'd like to move forward, as I always have over the years when there's a lull between reprehensible actions, and recapture my serenity. And in order to do that I need to at least maintain the ILLUSION that the unguarded, spontaneous vignettes and observations I share on the spur of the moment via media other than this blog aren't feeding into anyone's fixations. And that something someone I interact with innocently posts doesn't trigger my own. Because man, I've run the gamut from obsessive counterstalking to saber-rattling and ranting to self-pity and cutting off the entire damn innernet, but the fact is, things being what they are, the only power Stalky really has left is that which I give her by continuing to interact with a handful of people whose timelines put her name in front of me and give me that unpleasant frisson of gut-dropping terror my body reverts to before I remember the facts. Like a childhood bully, this person might always symbolize the ugliest humanity is capable of to me in my anxiety dreams and nightmares, but she belongs firmly in the past, and today's unfollowing spree was the final step, to me, of putting her truly behind me.\r\n\r\nSo.

It's not any worse, so I'm thinking it's some type of subluxation/pinched nerve/stress thing/chakra being thrown out of whack by the dental work on the same side\u00a0(kidding on the last one, mostly). I dunno. It's not bad enough that I feel like putting my brand-new insurance through its' paces to see a doctor, given that that costs money, I already know what PT exercises to do for a borked neck, and I already have narcotics on hand\u00a0should I decide the situation warrants them.

All in all, though, I still feel like crap. I can't seem to get enough sleep, even when I sleep for eleven hours straight, and caffeine fails to deliver the kick in the pants I hope for when I have a cup of coffee to try and perk me up (in fact, it tends to make me more tired, which I guess fits with the whole ADD thing but is VERY EFFING INCONVENIENT). Also, my feet are constantly cold and clammy and I'm paler than my usual.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think I'm probably pretty anemic. I've taken two courses of Levaquin virtually back-to-back, and in the past that's been shown, when we've tracked it through labs, to drop my hemoglobin down as low as nine (the normal range for an adult female is twelve to sixteen). I know what to do for this, and will be taking steps to correct it (by consuming lots of leafy greens and red meat, and making sure to get plenty of vitamin C with those), but in the meantime it sucks! I have too many jobs to be dragging ass, and we're getting into the busy season at Job #2 (Job #1 is slow-ish right now, but I am a fulltime employee there and they will find SOME way to put me to work for a certain number of hours per week regardless of how dismal business might be so it's not like I won't have work to do there) (and I totally WANT there to be work to do, I just wish I felt better!).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yes, if I don't feel better in a couple of weeks, or start feeling markedly worse I will make an appointment to have my doctor run some tests. I just think that given the lack of any acute symptoms and my history it's reasonable to assume this is anemia and/or me just being run-the-fuck-DOWN. I don't see much point in taking the time and expense to reduce my blood volume further by a few test tubes' worth to confirm my suspicions when getting plenty of rest and taking in extra iron and vitamin C won't do me any harm and will probably fix me.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Hopefully Thanksgiving will perk me up some, too.

I really do make a concerted effort not to blog about work beyond the occasional hilarious anecdote that has nothing to do with Actual Business or Things Controversial. And so that said: WORK STUFF. OMG. GAHHHH! It'll all work out in the end I am sure, but there is some serious scheduling fuckery going on right now at my main job, and it is giving me agida.

Overall, it was freaking HILARIOUS. I was, however, disappointed to find that the r-word made a couple of appearances, and there was a specific dig at people with Down Syndrome, which is never okay in my book. I'm kind of torn, because other than that I really enjoyed the movie, and honestly it was an accurate depiction of the demographic the main characters are a part of (I hear the r-word at work on the regular, and call people on it as often as I can without being a total dick, but that doesn't seem to have discouraged any of the usual culprits).

Plus, because I am poor but also mildly insane, I got a THIRD (mercifully PART-time) job. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So...yeah. I worked until eleven last night at one job, had to be at a second at 6:30 a.m. withOUT spending the night downtown again, and worked fourteen hours straight, roughly half of which I spent running from place to place delivering things to various concession stands.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And here, because I am just bowled over by this and also STILL unmedicated for the raging ADD (now that I can finally AFFORD to pay attention, in that I have insurance that will cover both my shrink and my meds without breaking the bank, I do not have TIME to go to the doctor, nor do any of my jobs command enough brainpower to make that a priority), a brief digression into a tale about popcorn:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0You know that utterly delicious, yellow-fake-buttery popcorn you buy at theaters, concerts, circuses, and sporting events? You know how sometimes you get a bucket of it that TASTES fine and doesn't seem stale in the least but just kind of sticks to your teeth, in a mysterious and aggravating fashion? Do you know why that is? I WILL TELL YOU WHY THAT IS. It's because most large venues actually truck the stuff in (or, more likely, have it trucked in by the promoters of a large-scale event, then freeze the extra) a couple of times per month, and fill their walk-in freezer with bags of it when they do. That popcorn freezes just fine, and defrosts and you would never know the difference, unless the venue had it frozen TOO long, in which case it sticks to everyone's teeth. BUT MFA MAMA, you say, I SEE THEM POPPING THAT CORN IN THE LOBBY. No, actually you do not. You see and smell them popping corn in the lobby for a) the illusion that the popcorn is fresh and b) the smell, because that makes everyone want popcorn.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Are you as grossed out by that as I am? Probably more so, since I still ate roughly my bodyweight in that nasty-assed, hydrogenated palm-kernel-oiled, frozen GMO popcorn today, but now we ALL know how ashamed I should be!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Aaaaanyway, you may or may not notice that there is a new advertiser on the blog. Lijit, a member of the Federated Media Publishing family, has partnered with the Clever Girls Collective and offered members (including yours truly) access to their kickass array of services including paid advertising (obvs), real-time analytics, fast payments, and what they claim is the \"best human support in the business.\" Which honestly? I think they're right. I filled out a quick form expressing my interest, and almost immediately heard back from Farid in Publisher Development, who personally walked me through the process with a series of e-mails and seems like a good egg all-around. I don't gain anything by talking Lijit up, not even any kind of referral credit, I'm just explaining the new left sidebar content and letting y'all know that so far I'm really impressed with the company and as of yet they haven't blacklisted me for talking about cocks of any color or made me want to take a flamethrower to my own blog, so, you know: YAY.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And with that, I am off to try and finish The Apothecary's Daughter before my nighty-night pills kick in and it's a new day and I start a new job, AGAIN. Because despite all of the working, when I stop for a minute, the worry is still there, and I am trying to drown it out with historical fiction (and drugs of the legal variety).

We're not the only ones, either. A lot of folks are struggling right now and currently something like half the children in America (my own included) have received Food Stamps at some point in their lives (we do not currently qualify because I \"make too much money,\" although \"too much money\" evaporates with a quickness when you're buying transplant meds and trying to get dental work done on your transplant-recipient spouse to keep him from developing a life-threatening infection before Something Happens to your job). Nobody talks about it, because it's Not Nice, but you know what? Maybe more of us should.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I stood up straight, looked her in the eye, and said \"Mrs. Neighbor, we are out of bread, milk, and butter, we have $0.21 in the bank right now, and I don't get paid until Tuesday.

I plan to turn the oil into lotion for Hotter to massage into my achy back, and since homemade lotion breaks down after about three weeks (because organic emulsifying wax does not work as well over time as petroleum products), when the lotion breaks down I will know it's time to lay off the stuff.

{"date": "November  1, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Someone commented on my last post asking what Bumpus is up to lately. I also had people ask about him within the past week on the Twitter and the Facespace, independent of each other. I think that since I don't write much about him, folks assume he's quietly slipped out of the picture or is wasting away from neglect?\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Not hardly :)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Bumpus just doesn't make it onto the blog very often because unlike Isis, he is not My Dog. Bumpus is very much Big Child's Dog, and is politely affectionate to other members of the household, but that's it. He has absolutely no regard for strangers; he is a true hound to the bone (which isn't far, haha).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0During the worst of Hurricane Sandy's LIMITED impact here, the MFA Children were with their father and CATHERINE! (they have a generator and we do not, so I let them choose where they wanted to ride out the storm and once they found out we might lose power they chose there) and Hotter and I were home with the animals. More specifically, we were lounging in bed in our jammies with Isis at our feet. \"I think we should let Bumpus in here with us,\" I said, finally. \"He might be scared all alone in Big Child's room.\" So Hotter grumbled a little and went and tried to get Bumpus. Who thumped his tail but snuggled more deeply and stubbornly into Big Child's pillow, which he was curled around huffing the scent of Big Child's head. \"No thank-you,\" he said quite plainly in Hound, \"this is where I belong.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I got kinda sentimental about the Bumpus-hound after that comment came in earlier and went into Big Child's room to pat him, and found him ecstatically chewing Skittles. He didn't touch any of the chocolate, but demolished the fruity types of candy from Big Child's trick-or-treat pumpkin. So he won't die unless Big Child strangles him when he gets home from school (he totally knew he'd done wrong, too--as soon as he saw me notice what he was eating he dove under Big Child's bed in a painful-sounding clatter of bones, I didn't even say anything, haha).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/11/the-bumpus-hound.html", "title": "the Bumpus hound"},

Started going bald, in double-time, and got bumpy and welty and infected all over. She is now on amoxicillin and ivermectin, and after two doses of each is a new dog. Still itchy and balding, but no longer red-spotted and miserable. So here we go again...she's lucky she's cute.\r\n* \u00a0 I went back and forth, and finally today while at work decided that Pfeffer ought to come back from Squatter Workshop into the house to have her babies. So naturally she had them today before I got home. Seven squirmy pink kits, and they were nice and toasty-warm when we discovered them but I did some reading that confirmed that they'd be better off indoors with the temperature going down so low overnight. So I deposited my body-warmed sweatshirt, with the arms tied in a knot to form a pouch, on a dismayed Hotter's chest full of baby bunnies to keep warm while I moved Pfeffer into our living room. The babies are nestled into a dryer-shrunken angora sweater of mine, inside a box of hay under a layer of Pfeffer-fur and seem none the worse for wear.\r\n* \u00a0 I had a wretched hangover today, because yesterday was kind of ridiculous and I ended up dislocating my thumb. Which sucks as much as you'd think, and I ended up shotgunning a bottle of wine and popping it back into place myself. No, that's not ideal. But it's faster, cheaper, and more badass than going to the ER. Then Hotter took out the entirety of the shitty situation on me in juvenile form and berated me for not going to the store and buying him some fucking milk BEFORE getting inebriated and fixing my thumb. Mind you, I'd bought milk the day before. But he is \"on a milk kick.\" And I am an inconsiderate wife. And once he finished telling me just what a selfish twat I'd been not to check whether he needed anything from me before attending to my dislocated appendage and rendering myself unfit to run errands I decided \"BOGO wine\" meant \"drink the other bottle too.\"\r\n* \u00a0 I kind of think the medication adjustment didn't work, and don't really have anything to say about that at the moment, except: DAMN (Hotter's neurological mishegas manifests in a collection of ways, most dramatic of which is an uncharacteristic and yelly complete disregard for the comfort and feelings of others, mostly yours truly).

{"date": "April 23, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI. \u00a0 So I think maybe I'm still a little raw from the incident with the Old Biddy Neighbor. Today I am off work, because I had to go to traffic court over one of the expired registration tickets I got when I couldn't afford to update the MFA Minivan's registration and got ticketed (the case was dismissed when I showed the judge my registration and I was out the door in ten minutes), and also Hotter had oral surgery (which I scheduled for a day I knew I'd have to miss work anyway, because I am efficient like that) and I had to drive him to and from that and take care of him afterward. I was also thinking that maybe if Hotter was feeling up to it, we could use a movie ticket voucher I've had kicking around for a while and go to see The Hunger Games. Here is an update I wrote on the Facespace earlier today:\r\nFigure One: Yeah, I didn't match the shade on the name-text very well, but use your imaginations.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Here is the comment addendum I added to the first status (I had already covered this on the Twitter, then forgot I hadn't told the facespace about the ticket voucher and panicked a little), and what a couple of friends had to say about it:\r\nFigure Two: This time I didn't even try. Y'all can tell which one I am, right?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And now it is kind of bothering me because I wonder if I'm not being a jerk here. My friends are easier on me than I am about pretty much everything, I think out of affection, but...am I being a jerk? Goodness knows I am against poverty-shaming. Poor folks have enough to worry about without judgment from others, and I hate to read about this kind of thing, because I've been judged in the grocery line before and it doesn't feel good (like okay, with Food Stamps? They give you WAY MORE to spend on food each month than I do when I am buying our groceries out of pocket, and when my family received Food Stamps I often used to buy fresh organic berries with them because fresh berries used to be one of the only things Little Child would eat by mouth and with the way he used to be allergic to so many things I wanted to make sure he didn't react to some pesticide or herbicide on the berries and cause us to think he couldn't have the berries themSELVES...more than once I had a cashier look at me like \"SERIOUSLY?\" and it's not like the g-tube showed when Little Child had clothes on)...but then I see some folks talking about how poor they are but going out to eat frequently, going on vacations where they spend a lot on travel costs and hotel rooms, seeing movies several times per month, and it irks me. Because while I don't doubt that those people FEEL like they're poor, in my reality if I did those things we'd have to go without something really important, like my health insurance coverage (the MFA Children are on the XY's policy), or car insurance (which we did go without for a while, and which I got roasted for openly in the comments one time and remedied as soon as I was able to), or, you know, FOOD or MEDICINE or something. It's been over a year since I saw a movie in the theater. The last time I went on vacation was BlogHer '10 and we've NEVER been on a family vacation. We don't eat out, PERIOD (I think the last time we ate out as a family was Big Child's birthday last year, and when we did that it was because a generous friend had given us a gift card to Red Robin...and Big Child's birthday is coming up AGAIN in a week and a half,* so...yeah. It's been a while. The last time before THAT was over a year previous, too.). Maybe our definition of \"poor\" and other people's definition of \"poor\" differ? Or maybe I should feel badly for the folks who are crying poor and still doing all of those things, because maybe it indicates an inability to be realistic about their situation and make smart choices? I don't know. I might be wired a little different in that I've NEVER really had the money to do those kinds of things, and therefore don't miss them--maybe some folks really DO feel like life isn't worth living without seeing movies, eating out, and going on trips (although personally I think if I was feeling that way I'd be more tempted to break the bank on a co-payment to talk to my psychiatrist about it, if anything)? Something about this whole thing isn't sitting right with me, and I can't quite put my finger on it. Ideas?\r\nII. I mentioned on the Twitter that I'd made myself a 261-calorie lunch and it was delicious and filled my belly, and someone asked me to blog about it, so here goes. You will need:\r\na pat of buttera splash of milkfive eggs1 ounce Trader Joe's light feta cheese (most \"light\" cheese isn't worth eating, but this stuff is a delightful exception--I actually prefer it to the regular variety taste-wise!)\u00a02 cups baby spinacha slice of onionTexas Petesalt and pepper to taste\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Dice the onion up and saute it in the butter. Break the eggs into a bowl, separating out all but one of the yolks (discard the four other yolks, or feed them to your pets, or whatever), then add the splash of milk, a few sprinkles of Texas Pete (which adds an excellent flavor and also colors the egg so that it doesn't have that unappetizing white-y look you get when using just or mostly eggwhites), and your spices. Whisk it together. When the onions have clarified, add the spinach, and when the spinach has wilted, add the egg mixture to the pan. Cook until the eggs are the way you like them (I like mine hard-cooked, because runny eggs squick me out). Dish that up, crumble the feta on top, and enjoy. According to Myfitnesspal this has 261 calories.\r\nIII. Hotter had oral surgery today. Our dentist did it in his office, but it was kind of gory (Hotter had a tooth that was broken off below the gumline except for one lone splinter that stuck up a little...I couldn't even look at it without gagging and don't know how he stood it, although he said it didn't really bother him). While we were there I went ahead and scheduled the next round of work for the end of May (when my NEXT traffic court date for the expired registration is) (that's the last one though!)...it will be $360. I don't know how I am going to pay for that, but I said that about this month's work and last month's, and I guess I'll think of something. I will be SO GLAD when every month doesn't include a bunch of dental work for Hotter, y'all, you don't even KNOW. In the post-op instructions they said Hotter wasn't allowed to suck on anything because it could cause dry sockets. I turned to him and said \"WELL THAT IS JUST GREAT, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE THE MONEY TO PAY ME BACK NOW?\" because I am awesome like that. Also, here are some things I tweeted while I was waiting that people seemed to find amusing:\r\nFigure Three: He doesn't actually have a third nipple. But then I DO NOT ACTUALLY FART IN MY SLEEP, so we're even!\r\n\r\n* \u00a0 And I don't EVEN want to think about it, because a) I haven't gotten him anything and b) he has mentioned several times that he wants to go to Red Robin again this year because he enjoyed it so much last year, but um, NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

{"date": "April 24, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So on Friday Middle Child's class went on a field trip to a local nature center. Among other things, they learned how to identify poisonous vs. non-poisonous snakes. I thought that was fabulous and took a moment to go over the ways to spot a poisonous snake with all three MFA Children (fat body, triangular head, patterns, etc.). Hotter thought I was being over-cautious given that we live in the suburbs, but there are woods behind our house and I am a big fan of safety.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Flash forward to today after work, when I was clearing an overgrown patch of grass where the chicken pen used to be (I am digging trenches there and plan to plant corn in the extremely fertile soil the MFA Flock left behind). This is an area I'd allowed to go wild, because wild strawberries grow there and the bunnies like to eat those. There were also a lot of nice dandelions that I'd been picking (bare-handed) to make dandelion chips. I pulled up an old piece of tarp, and there underneath it was a tiny little coiled up baby snake. Oh! Another worm snake! Cute! But when I bent down for a closer look, I noticed a pattern. Oh. OH!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So naturally I grabbed the little sumbitch (chill, y'all, I was wearing thick leather gardening gloves--there is no way in hell that little baby cottonmouth could've nailed me through those, and I grabbed it right behind the head), because mama loves a visual aid (and if I'd struck at it in tall grass with a shovel I might've missed and it could've escaped and grown up to bite one of my kids):\r\nFigure One: Look, kids! A Water Moccasin!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We all studied the snake, which I have since ID'd as a Water Moccasin, and then I grabbed my trusty sledgehammer, The Fraulein, and took the pretzel jar containing the snake to the driveway. I felt kind of weird about the whole thing. I mean, killing a chicken because we're hungry and planning to eat it is one thing, but we didn't stand to gain anything from this snake's death and it hadn't actually hurt anyone. I dumped it out of the pretzel jar, and immediately it assumed a belligerent, coiled-up stance as if to strike. ALRIGHTY THEN!\r\nFigure Two: The Fraulein: 1, Water Moccasin: 0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, I didn't relish dispatching that little snake, but I also didn't like the idea of having it for a neighbor, and gas prices being what they are the thing had to go (in the past I've been known to relocate unwanted snakes, but this week our finances don't have room for mercy toward venomous reptiles). And then I went and put my adrenaline rush to use digging a trench to plant some corn in.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And how was YOUR day?\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nETA: I forgot to mention that yes, I mowed the wild strawberries and dandelions in the area in case there were more...I didn't see any, and there was only the one scrap of cut-up tarp there that would've been a good place to hide so I think we're good. But I'll keep my eyes open!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340168eaaa9a17970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016765a8ef54970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/04/cottonmouth.html", "title": "cottonmouth [ETA]"},

It's not QUITE that bad. But no matter how carefully I tried to explain it he would most likely internalize it as \"Red Robin is where one goes for birthdays and we are not going this year because I HAVE DONE SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG\" and start washing his hands raw again and making us repeat everything we say until we hit the magic number of repetitions, so: yeah), and the only thing Big Child has mentioned really wanting lately (my kids don't ask for much...they know we're poor and don't ask unless they're really, REALLY jonesing for something special) is a Hunger Games t-shirt that one of his friends has that he is convinced is ONLY sold at the very mall where the local Red Robin is located. So if I tell Big Child we have to wait until a non-schoolnight then I will have gotten paid and will be able to get him the t-shirt while we're there for dinner next Friday night.

Part of that is out of respect for their privacy and dignity as small people, and part of that is a nod to my ex-husband's (ex- and largely imaginary) lawyers.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That said, sometimes a mama just has to brag.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0My boys have had a banner year. Middly went from \"probably going to fail first grade\" to \"nothing below a B in any subject within his control* in the second grade,\" and Little Child as y'all are aware ditched the g-tube and has continued to not just eat by mouth but GROW and TRY NEW TEXTURES AND FLAVORS. Those are goals I personally set for them at the beginning of the year, and I promised them that if they met those goals they could do ANYTHING THEY WANTED with their hair when school was out. Sometimes when one of them was really struggling, he'd try and think of a way to get me to back out first (\"what if I want a mohawk that's TWO DIFFERENT COLORS?\") (to which I would say \"you do your end, and I'll find out where to buy the dye for it and charge up the clippers\"). Therefore:\r\nFigure One: Devastatingly handsome smiles of sheer unbridled glee not pictured to preserve anonymity. Your loss.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for Big Child, this year he won the President's Award for Educational Excellence, but I am no more permitted to touch his hair any longer than I am the totally sweet Presidential Seal pin that came with that. Every six weeks his father takes him to a barbershop for \"The Ivy League\" of \"Official Hair Styles for Men and Boys\" fame, and that is that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I suppose there's always got to be one.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 He does still have an \"M\" (stands for \"Minimal Progress\"--it's what they give the lower grades instead of an F here) in Handwriting, which I think is an awfully able-ist subject to even grade students on. HOWEVER! Just last week the school FINALLY listened to me and had him assessed by an OT, who determined that he DOES need help and modified his IEP accordingly, and therefore I do not give two shits for the \"M\" in Handwriting. My kid has a documented genetic condition that causes both hypotonia and hyperflexibility, as well as a learning disability that makes it very difficult for him to concentrate on complex tasks, and therefore grading his ability to control a pencil and form letters is about on par with grading a visually-impaired student's ability to recognize colors. SCREW your M, MFA Elementary School! Someday I will be able to buy that kid an iPad and he'll blow ALL of you away with it, and in the meantime YES YOU WILL provide him with services to make the best of his bendy little fingers' writing (dis)ability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016306b83a80970d-pi", "http://boingboing.net/2010/05/18/official-haircuts-fo.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/06/theres-always-got-to-be-one.html", "title": "there's always got to be one"},

This changes nothing about my plans to get a large tattoo of Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes peeing on the Dell logo.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Just kidding.

Someday. When we have the money. So like, the twelfth of never, but THE INTENT IS THERE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of money, do you want to hear my ex-husband's brilliant shot at discrediting my claim to not have the money to buy things he thinks I should (namely new clothes for the children, because while they have clothes that fit and are clean and free of holes and stains, they aren't NEW and HIS kids shouldn't have to wear HAND-ME-DOWNS,* and wouldn't if I didn't squander his child support money on things like MY RENT) (yes, he actually said \"YOUR RENT,\" all accusing like one would say \"HOOKERS AND BLOW,\" because goodness knows I'd still totally have a three-bedroom house in the city's best and therefore most expensive school district if I didn't have children--MY LIFESTYLE IS JUST THAT ROCK 'N ROLL)?

Don't get me wrong, that shit would still be funny seeing as how he's shorter than I am, but...I digress.\r\nETA: For those of you who asked after Hotter...he is about the same. The only difference is that we now know he's not in status epilepticus (which: duh, but still good to hear), or suffering from reduced bloodflow to his brain due to blocked carotids, or a new stroke. So we actually know nothing more than we did BEFORE he went into the hospital about why he Just Ain't Right, but whatever is causing this isn't immediately life-threatening. Sigh. Apparently (and I say this because when he mentioned it offhandedly today) the neurologist he saw is fairly convinced based on his account of what happens during his \"spells\" that he IS having a new type of seizure, but he didn't have one while hooked up to the EEG so they can't be SURE. Either way he's supposed to follow up with his own neurologist, which I'd already planned to have him do, because I'd still like to know what the eff is going on.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/09/inaugural.html", "title": "inaugural [ETA]"},

{"date": "June 22, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Believe it or not, generally when I communicate with my ex-husband I am a paragon of diplomacy. This is partly because \"killing 'em with kindness\" is my M.O., and partly because I only communicate with him in writing (because otherwise he screams at me, and that is no good for the boys plus I don't much care for it myself). Today, however, that all went out the window. He texted me to cancel his weekend visitation. I am used to that, and because he cited a family emergency that (if it is true) sounds pretty dire, was prepared to be somewhat sympathetic and leave the position this puts me in (namely that of probably going without eating much this weekend myself, because we're already eating the pantry and two extra days of feeding three growing boys is...problematic) out of it, but then...well. You know how there are some things you JUST DON'T DO? Like talk about a tough guy's mama or yell \"FIRE!\" in a crowded theatre or engage in any manner of hate-speech that we all know about and I won't name here? The XY crossed a line like that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0He instructed me to carry out plans HE had made with the children, and when I said I couldn't afford to do so, he gave me grief about not having any money, stating that he pays child support and therefore I am practically rich.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And I? WENT OFF. I told him to go fuck himself. I told him he had a lot of nerve to give ME grief about being poor when HE was the one who put me in this position (fun fact: by the time we finalized our divorce the XY knew I planned to spend the rest of my life with Hotter, and because Hotter had been my best friend for several years, he knew Hotter's medical situation and that to marry me, he'd have to give up a lot of government assistance that was the only way he could get by. The XY knew that, and THAT is why he insisted on the \"no overnights\" clause. He did it out of pure spite, to try and keep us apart, just to be an asshole). I told him to go fuck himself again. I told him he barely PAYS child support, and told him to fuck off some more. I pointed out that child support is supposed to go UP as children get older and their needs more complex, and that his has stayed the same since 2008 because HE escalated our divorce and all matters pertaining to it (including custody) to a higher court that, in our state, requires you to have a lawyer to even bring anything before it. I told him to go fuck himself. And then I pointed out that he wasn't man enough to do right by his children without a judge forcing his hand, which made him pretty fucking pathetic, and told him to go fuck himself AGAIN. Finally, I told him that I was driving around on two unsafe tires with a toothache because I can't afford to fill a cavity, and had just gotten off of work, so now wasn't really a good time for poverty shaming, and told him to fuck off again.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then I told him to go fuck himself a couple more times (I went back and counted--it was eight \"fuck yous\" altogether), and that he owed me one HELL of an apology. Which he finally gave, and I did not accept.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As I told him next, \"wow, you hit me below the belt and then grudgingly gave me a half-assed apology that demonstrated no actual understanding...it's like we're still married!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0WOW.

{"date": "June 24, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's like a dead bride. I don't know if I feel more like I'm heading toward a wedding or a funeral,\" I said, hitching up the cardboard female torso I carried awkwardly in front of me so I wouldn't trip on the bag zipped around the gathered train. \"Isn't the groom supposed to carry the bride? We're going about this bass ackwards.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not funny at all. You weren\"t funny the first time you said it, and the closer we get to LA the less funny you get.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I carried that dead bride all the way across the continental United States one airport at a time, and after the final flight we rented a car, driving all night through the desert, arriving in Vegas just as the sun rose. The welcome sign was both more and less impressive than I'd expected, although the diner where we had breakfast had a brand-new PT Cruiser on a stage surrounded by flashing neon slot-machines where I won fifteen quarters. I fed them back in, losing eight, winning three, then losing ten times in a row. \"I should have quit while I was ahead,\" I sighed, sitting back down, and the man I'd met six weeks previous to the day when my dog, a miniature dachschund, launched itself at his mastiff's throat handed me the check.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Elvis who officiated over the mockery of a union asked us to vow that we'd adopt each other's hound dogs. The XY cheered up a moment and said maybe it was fate.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Figure One: Yep, that's me. I don't feel like this photo of a photo really counts as outing myself, as I'm no longer this young, this blonde, this thin, or this stupid.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Back at the hotel we went for a gondola ride before taking the marriage license, which he'd forgotten to bring to the wedding, back to the chapel and making it legal. Our gondolier poled us under a replica of the bridge where lovers kissed, and lamented that nobody ever kissed him. Laughing, I tipped my head back and playfully offered up my face, and he leaned down. I thought he'd buss my cheek but instead he planted a resounding smack right on my lips.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Afterward, the man who later legally became my husband in a thirty-second ceremony read auctioneer-fast by a non-Elvis clergyman whose name I don't remember screamed at me: \"We're married less than an hour and already you cheat on me!\" It didn't calm him down any when I pointed out we hadn't technically been married yet. \"Let's get this over with, and then I'm going to go get drunk and gamble,\" he said theatrically, and stalked out the door without me. And reader, I married him anyway. Afterward, I pulled the pins from my hair, stripped off the fitted tee and hotpants I'd worn to my second wedding of the day, and went to bed alone.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I still don't believe in omens twelve years later. But never say in front of me that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, because it's baloney, plain and simple. Sometimes what happens in Vegas calls you a whore, follows you home, knocks you up three times, and then knocks you down. Sometimes it's not until it cheats on you while your third child is in his third hospital ward that you realize you should have cut and run before the auctioneer drew up your bill of sale.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0People ask me sometimes if I regret the lack of fanfare that characterized my second wedding\u00a0and I have to laugh. I wore a sarong instead of a silk gown, and instead of a fake Elvis we had my children singing Weezer out of tune. Unlike the first time my groom found me hilarious, the food was home-cooked, the ceremony included poetry, and the only tears anyone shed that day were happy ones. As for the do-over wedding night, well...let's just say nobody went to bed mad or alone.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, I'm a big fan of the do-over. Just not when I'm washing dishes.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Frigidaire Gallery\u2122Dishwasher gets dishes fully cleaned the first time, so there are no dish do-overs. Nearly half of adults admit to re-washing and/or re-drying dishes after the dishwasher cycle has been completed. To prevent dishwasher do-overs, Frigidaire\u00ae is stepping in with its new Gallery\u00ae Dishwasher featuring the OrbitCleanTM Wash Arm, ensuring dishes are cleaned right the first time.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thanks for reading about my do-over moment.

So I'll say this much, and then comment no more on the entire thing...I get that my life to date has been implausibly filled with \"drama\" and misfortune. Really, I do.

But also consider that maybe second-hand information from a faceless innernet person might not be all that reliable a source of all-true information on my life, either. Nobody likes feeling like they've Been Had, whether it's for money, goods, or emotional energy. I've been there.

And gone on to be approved for the adoption of eleventy-five children and live HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!1!eleven!? Then probably they are full of shit. Or maybe not. Maybe they're telling the truth but they're still a royal asshole and will go on to spend countless hours twisting an amalgamation of public records searches, fallacious reasoning, and personal conjecture into THE ONE REAL TRUTH and subsequently telling everyone that YOU are a lying jerkface. Or maybe they're lying AND they do that. Not everyone is a good candidate for \"friend-inside-the-computer\" for everyone else, is the bottom line I guess. You can Be Had (or just THINK you have) and sigh and move on with your life, or you can do the social-media equivalent of taking your toys and going home by shutting down your blog and Twitter and boycotting Facebook. I choose the former, and if the fact that I haven't disappeared from the face of the innernet is keeping you up at night? There is medicine for that. The end.\r\n* \u00a0 There was fuckery involving work-hours today, and I was moderately annoyed over it. That'll all I'll say about THAT in a public forum.\r\n* \u00a0 It is SO. DAMN. HOT.\r\n* \u00a0 The XY is undergoing a time of intense personal stress due to some things that are actually legit and Not My Story To Tell. The part that I feel okay in griping about online is that he's taken to catastrophizing about non-emergent things to my voicemail, and gahhhh. The main non-emergent thing is Little Child's height. The only time Little Child has ever been on any of the growth charts for height was at birth, when he was, I believe, in the 25th percentile (I'd have to look it up to be absolutely certain, it may have even been lower). He fell off the charts for height AND weight initially due to his feeding difficulties (which turned out to be related to multiple protein allergies), but even after starting an elemental diet via feeding tube and getting back onto the (lower end of) the chart for weight, he's never since infancy been on the chart for height. He HAS followed a consistent growth curve, and every doctor I've ever asked about it has said that this is most likely due to the fact that the XY, at 5'6\" (in shoes) is the tallest person in his family tree by several inches. Yes, the two older children are in the topmost 10% of the growth chart for height, but that is probably because I have some frigging giants on MY side of the biological family (as in 6'6\" and up). Human genetics is funny like that. The XY, however, feels that his entire life would be better if he was even a couple of inches taller, and is freaking the fuck out. He wants Little Child on growth hormone shots PDQ. I am not a fan of a) projecting one's own insecurities onto children or b) the idea of manipulating the endocrine system of a medically fragile child who is currently the healthiest he has EVER BEEN for cosmetic reasons (especially since I have discussed this all in age-appropriate language with the kid, and the kid says he doesn't mind being short and does NOT want any more appointments or needles in his life, even if it would potentially make him grow bigger). If Little Child has an inborn deficiency of human growth hormone, that is different. Which is why I've told the XY I have no objection to taking the kid for an endocrine work-up. Our pediatrician has said that he sees no reason why this would be medically NECESSARY, especially given that Genetics already tested most of the things that Endocrinology would check and found them to be A-OK, but doesn't MIND providing a referral if we are concerned. Since the XY is concerned and I am not I have suggested that he take the lead on setting this up, and told him I will let him take Little Child during what is not \"his\" custodial time to attend said appointment if it falls on a day that I have to work (although I would prefer to be there as well, as I do not trust the XY not to put words in the specialists' mouths and you'd best believe I'll be asking to see a copy of the Endocrinologist's report before even considering subjecting my unwilling kid to frequent injections that I would end up being the one to give him if the XY takes Little Child to the appointment and brings him back with a prescription in-hand). Rather than setting that up and moving forward with it, however, the XY likes to yell at my voicemail. It's getting old.\r\n* \u00a0 Did I mention that it's hotter than Satan's sun-room here? Okay then.\r\n* \u00a0 What's getting on YOUR nerves today?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/about.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/07/gripes-assorted.html", "title": "gripes, assorted"},

I plan to do another inspection on my next day off (Wednesday), and know to look for larvae and use \"bee math,\" and be on the lookout for overmany drone cells, but other than that how do I tell if the MFA Honeybees are without a queen?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/07/so-anyway-bees.html", "title": "so anyway: bees!"},

God don't like ugly.** He got this, you're a good girl and he loves ya whether ya like it or not\" (yes, she's almost thirty years older than I am). I wish I had her faith; it must be really nice to believe in a big daddy in the sky who'll take the stick to the bad guys. Her absolute conviction that there's no more to it, however, was somehow reassuring to me, and by the end of the conversation she had me laughing to the point of tears and had gotten me to agree to go out with her and a current co-worker to shoot pool. Which I suck at, but that's okay. I'm sure we'll have a good time.\r\n* \u00a0 @MrsDAngelo and @twoadults on the Twitter.

He has his windows discs, but his DVD drive is broken. He's not too happy about that. This is why I love my piece-of-craptop. It is from a big company and has a warranty.

SERIOUSLY, CRAZY TRASHCAN NEIGHBOR???

I briefly considered who else in my family I might currently resemble...my father, for all that he has ninety-nine problems (of which a solid half-a-dozen involve bitches), never had a bad back. And while The Narcissist frequently SAID she had a bad back, that was usually a euphemism for GOT NEW TITS AGAIN and she never cared about the power bill anyway and I DON'T KNOW, OKAY, I AM LIMPING AROUND LIKE SOME WHOLLY NEW INDIVIDUAL RISEN FROM THE GODDAMN SEAFOAM, OR MAYBE AN AMALGAM MY BRAIN COBBLED TOGETHER FROM STOCK CHARACTERS ON NICK AT NITE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0My back hurts and my kids will. not. stop. going. in. and. out. of. the. front. door.

{"date": "July 29, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So remember when I said I'd comment no more on the Stalky scenario?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Well, I lied.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0See, I was trying to take the high road. \"Don't feed the trolls,\" as the saying goes. I wasn't naming any names, I wanted that shit to go AWAY, I mean c'mon, it's been YEARS and sooner or later they'd find a new hobby, right? Well, apparently not, and since they've gone and outed themSELVES I might as well address the issue. I mean, none of these people have had any conversations with me since long about 2008ish, I think? I know I've moved WAY on with life since then, ended one marriage, began another, changed careers...but apparently some people have very unexciting lives, or are just obsessed. I don't know.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So here's the background. Around 2006-2008 I was really sick. We still don't fully know what ailed me, which is scary as hell because that means it might be something that'll come BACK (gawd I hope not), but the best guesses among the many doctors I saw during that time period were that it was a combination of post-staph rheumatoid phenomenon (I had MRSA septicemia right before the downward spiral, which was treated initially with IV Vancomycin and then, after I left the hospital, with oral Zyvox, which unfortunately interacted with the Cymbalta I'd been taking and gave me Seratonin Syndrome, a.k.a. the temporary, iatrogenic crazies--it sucked a lot), three different strains of Epstein-Barre (because why just have one or stop at two?), and \"adrenal fatigue\" (I kind of like my endocrinologist's theory, which he very bluntly stated to my ex-husband: \"you are killing her with the stress, cut it out!\"*). I spent the better part of two years flat on my back on high doses of time-released morphine, unable to walk except with the aid of a walker and unable to drive. I had to have a lot of hired help with the kids, and to drive us to their various medical appointments, and I didn't have much of a life during naptime and after they were in bed except online, because my ex-husband was in and out of the marital home, and when he was living with us, he and I didn't have much to say to each other. I made friends with people online, blogged, and played a game called Second Life, which is actually where I first \"met\" Hotter, as I've already alluded.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0There are two kinds of people who will be your friend when your life sucks as much as mine did back then (and while I may bitch about my life now, THIS IS NOTHING). The first type is those who are just really amazing people with the patience of Job, and the second is people who just want the inside track on the tragedy porn, either because they have similarly shitty lives and want to commiserate or because they are twisted in some way and get off on it. Those two types can be amazingly difficult to tell apart, especially if you're desperate for adult interaction and hopped up on lots and lots of painkillers (and okay, maybe kind of naive and bad at \"reading\" people, I'll cop to that).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Of the second type, there was one local friend with a similarly shitty life who I met through my blog, and there were two online friends of the twisted variety (one of whom I met and one of whom I spoke to over the phone a few times). In late 2008, when I initiated the dissolution of my marriage, I took my blog down but continued keeping up with a circle of trusted confidantes via group e-mails. Local Friend and the more innernet-famous of the two online friends were on the list, but apparently the other online friend, who just stopped wanting anything to do with me one day, had decided we were now mortal enemies and started reaching out to anyone she thought was friendly with me, whether because I commented on their blogs or they mentioned me or whatever. I know this because a couple of people straight up reached out and said hey, what is up with this person? They e-mailed me and said you're a horrible human being but I've known you for years and told them to fuck off/ignored them because clearly they are on some crazy drugs/forwarded the e-mail, here it is.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Haters gonna hate.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As a matter of fact, sometimes they're even going to go on a forum dedicated to discussing the shortcomings of bloggers and keep on talking smack about you three, four, five years after you stopped being friends with them and out themSELVES, so I don't feel like I'm telling any secrets by introducing you to \"Sam\" (her real first name is on her blog, but I'm hoping we can all at least agree to not provide non-public information about each other, since we all have spouses and children who have nothing to do with any of this bullshit, and so I've used the name she most commonly uses online):\r\nFigure One: \"Sam,\" ever-eager to keep stirring the shit, identifies herself, invites anyone and everyone to come to her for all the TRUEFACTS, AND points the finger at \"Stalky.\" If you Google her screen-name from here, you will find that she has a blog, which I link to below, although if asked I will remove the link and image. Oh, wait. I didn't know enough about GOMI to have known what the little world-symbol under someone's avatar meant, but she linked to her blog on THERE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is the post she's talking about on Cecily's blog, and is where the peril of going with a mob mentality comes to light: I am pretty sure I'm the online person Shan believes made the false report she mentions. Except...I didn't. Is Shannon the main member of the collective I refer to as \"Stalky?\" Yep. Do I pretty much wish she'd go ahead and drop dead of all she claims ails her, then proceed straight to rotting in the hell I don't even believe in for all the grief she has caused me? You betcha. Would I go so far as to try and bring that about by phoning in a false report of child abuse, or even have the identifying information to give, were I inclined to do so? Nope. All I ever had was a first name and a phone number. I commented on that post, as me, and I also sent Shan an e-mail:\r\nFigure Two: Click to embiggen.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am in NO way condoning false reports to CPS, but if you Google around you'll see that Shannon is someone who likes to squeeze into her judgey-pants and weigh in on lots of online controversies, and I guess that's the kind of shit you risk when you make a hobby of a) mixing with that sort of element and b) pissing all over others on the innernet. I believe she is the \"Miss Shannon\" who commented all over the GOMI thread about me, but that is just my personal conjecture and I could be wrong. I do know that her last public post on her own blog (now defunct, it was called Charming Bitch) seemed to be geared toward me, and included information (such as the exact date of my divorce hearing, and the state where I live--I considered sharing a screen shot but seeing as how those are not my words and she's removed her site from the Wayback Machine, which leads me to believe she doesn't want to share it, I won't) she'd gleaned from the group e-mails I'd included her on to the very end of them, after the Stalky e-mails started back up, and after making several rounds of cuts as a result. I really trusted this person, is what I'm saying, and obviously that wasn't very smart of me, because apparently she started a group blog, along with Local Friend, and \"Sam,\" and a couple of other former friends of mine, all about how I'm just the worst person EVAH!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Live and learn.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Why am I sharing all of this now, and why am I not naming the Local Friend? Well, I was hoping that if I kept ignoring this and taking the high road, eventually these gals would find other hobbies, or get busy with the numerous small children they all claim** to have, but apparently that's not going to happen and now they've \"outed\" themSELVES so I might as well weigh in. I think Local Friend has moved on. Does she have an online presence? Yes, but it doesn't appear to have anything to do with me, and she hasn't \"outed\" herself as being involved in this mess (nor has \"Sam\" gone and done it for her). I'm not interested in dragging anyone into this who isn't publicly in it already, or has Let It Go.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The last time I spoke to \"Sam\" except via saber-rattling e-mails was April of 2008. I haven't seen her face-to-face since March of that year. She hasn't been in any home of mine since December of 2007, when she came and visited me, and had the following to say about it\u00a0(I am the one she refers to as \"Eliza\" and assures you isn't, in fact, batshit crazy and making her life up--oh how times and her tune have changed!):\r\nFigure Three:\u00a0Apparently all of this is now a lie, because revisionist history FTW. Since Sam has since taken her entire blog down, you can use Ctrl+ the + sign to magnify or just take my word for it that the pertinent excerpt reads \"If any of you read Eliza\u2019s blog and think 'This girl is batshit crazy AND making shit up because no one has so much shitty shitness in their lives' you would be very wrong.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So, yeah. For all of you who've asked, and who I've given vague answers to or none at all, THAT is the drama, that's who Stalky is, yes, I used to blog as Eliza Doolittle, yes, I used to play Second Life (although not nearly as much as some people apparently believe and I haven't even logged on in several years because HELLO, I HAVE A REAL LIFE NOW) and met my husband there, and yeah, my first marriage was obviously pretty messed up but We Are Not Discussing That. Apparently if you contact \"Sam\" she'll be glad to give you some years-and-years old gossip on me, and if you have any questions for me that you'd like answered straight from the horse's mouth, you can leave a comment on this post and as long as you aren't asking for information I'm not comfortable divulging on the innernet I'll help you connect the dots. And THEN hopefully this can be over, and I can go back to writing about my family and garden and animals, or bitching about my grammar-related pet peeves, or how I worked myself to death or think I have a cold or, YOU KNOW, my day-to-day life circa NOW. I really hate that I've felt compelled to Go There in the first place, but you know what? It sucks to feel like you need to defend the veracity of the very worst aspects of your life. Do I wish I had a perfectly healthy body, and family, and dog, and minivan, and bank account, and no worse problem than a little habit of lying, as seems to be the current Stalky Party Line, despite their having clearly seen first-hand evidence to the contrary in the past? ABSOLUTELY, FUCK YES, SIGN ME UP! Am I making it all up? No (dammit). Am I going to continue to sit here silently while these people keep doing shitty things like starting Twitter accounts to do nothing but @ people I know that I'm a big lying liar and broadcast my full legal name, kids' names, current address, and phone number, and commenting on hate forums about what a faker I am, hoping it'll go away? NOPE.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I thought about this. I really did. I talked it over with my husband, and told him what I planned to say. \"What's the worst that could happen,\" I asked him, \"they continue to not drop this?\" He pointed out that they know our childrens' names and where we live, and might post that for all to see or try and rile The XY up and get him to take me back to court over custody. I pointed out that they've already done most of that, The XY is legally bankrupt and can't afford to sue me for at least another several years or his creditors will want to know where he got the money to do it, and barely even takes his visitation, plus all their juiciest gossip is so many years old that it'd be useless to any impartial, rational judge (literally! A literal judge! HA!). So, yeah. This is me turning the lights on, and hoping the cockroaches scuttle away.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 The ex-husband stuff is the only part of this whole hot mess I'm not going to clarify, out of respect for the fact that he's my childrens' father and we need to do our best to co-parent peacefully. Was he a shitty husband? Yes. Was I a shitty wife? Toward the end there, YOU BETCHA. We clearly were a bad match and brought out the worst in each other. In my opinion his worst was worse than my worst, and I did in fact instigate the final parting of ways for that very reason, but it's blood under the bridge. I'm not going to demonize him on here. He knows what he did, and I know what he did, and a few lawyers and other key players have a pretty good idea of what happened, and no one else needs the gory details.\r\n** \u00a0 Am I saying they don't actually have little kids? In the case of \"Sam,\" no. In the case of Shan...well. I just don't know, have no way of actually finding out, and don't particularly care. I've personally gotten to the point of questioning everything she ever said, because who ever survives ovarian cancer TWICE (with bonus systemic MRSA and heart surgery AND AND AND) and goes on to be (allegedly) happy and healthy and have the time to nurse multi-year vendettas like this?

But if there's one thing I've learned from all of this, besides to pick my friends CAREFULLY, it's how much it hurts to have the darkest aspects of your personal life picked apart by people who really have no clue, so I'll just leave it at \"I have my doubts but cannot verify.\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://uppercasewoman.com/2010/08/09/guest-post-charming-bitch/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834017743bda8d1970d-pi", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130423182637/http://doolittle.typepad.com/doolittle/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/07/i-lied.html", "title": "I lied"},

PLUS I HAVE TOLD THEM ALL THAT I PREFER MS., OMG WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO PRINT IT ON A SHIRT? I got out of the tub, ranting to Hotter about the inherent misogyny of the English language. He unhelpfully pointed out that there are words like Madame and Senora and such and therefore it's not JUST the English language. I peevishly pointed out that I only speak and hold an advanced degree in ENGLISH and so I therefore do not give two fucks about the others (not actually 100% true, but I was not my most all-inclusively fabulous self, okay?).

XY-ING!\" I ranted. \"Then they'd prolly call you Ms. Hotter,\" Hotter pointed out.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the school, I sent Hotter in. Then he came out alone. \"I don't have my driver's license,\" he said, \"and they said they don't recognize me.\" Hotter is on the list of people approved to pick my children up from school, and I am quite sure Middly greeted him happily by name. I realize these policies are in place for a reason, but this morning I am NOT REASONABLE.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I stalked into the school, coughing and wearing a wet cowgirl-flipping-the-double-screaming-eagle t-shirt. \"Hi there Mrs. XY, we just need to see ID from anyone picking up a child,\" said the front desk lady. I slapped my license down on the counter. The clinician came over and glared at me.

The XY owes me $40.

Eat it even though you know it's going to be sour.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If you're me, you'll have a good-sized stalk of rhubarb kicking around from the farmer's market that's maybe gotten a little bendy, and you'll decide to throw that in there, too, so it doesn't go to waste.\r\nFigure Two: When the youngest asks to taste the rhubarb, tell him it's too sour by itself and he won't like it. If he takes that as a challenge, go ahead and let him taste it anyway. Laugh. A LOT.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Whip up a batch of pie crust. Nothing too fancy, just two cups of unbleached all-purpose flour sifted with a teaspoon of salt, two-thirds of a cup of the butter of your choice (I'm a grassfed cultured kind of girl, but whatever cranks your tractor), and five tablespoons of water. Cut the butter into the flour/salt mixture until the largest chunks are the size of baby peas, sprinkle the water over that, knead briskly, just until you've got a cohesive ball of dough, and divide into two parts. Roll one out for the bottom of your pie, fold in half, then in half again, and position the corner at the center of your pie pan/dish/Pyrex thingy. Unfold--voila!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Put a cup and a half of the sugar of your choice (we're an organic evaporated cane juice household) mixed with a quarter cup of flour within reach, and decide at the last minute to pave the bottom of your bottom crust with thin slices of unpeeled apple in the hope that the pectin will keep the berries from getting too runny. By now you'll be running behind, covered in flour, peevish, and too sticky to take a picture. That's okay. We've all see apples before.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Layer half the berries and rhubarb over the apple slices, sprinkling with the sugar/flour mixture as you go. Add another layer of apple slices, more berries and rhubarb, more sugar/flour mixture, until you run out. Sprinkle with about a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, and dot with a tablespoon or two of butter. Roll out your second ball of pie crust dough, cover the fruit, and pinch the edges of the two crusts together. If you didn't end up with a perfect circle, patch it with a piece of extra dough. Nobody's perfect.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Pierce your crust to vent, brush with milk to make it shiny, and sprinkle some vanilla sugar on top. Bake in an oven preheated to 450 for ten minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 and bake until the crust is golden-brown (about another forty minutes).\r\nFigure Three: Yeah, the pie is a little cosmetically-challenged. But hey, it's homemade and delicious!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Let your pie cool while you make dinner and a tub of COOL WHIP Whipped Topping thaws. Eat dinner. Bargain with your kids over bites of chicken. Tell them to sit up. Tell them to sit down. Tell them to put their legs down and use their fork and OH MY GOD CAN'T YOU JUST SIT LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING? Avoid eye contact with your spouse lest one of you laugh and ruin the ferocity of your disapproval.\r\n\u00a0 Get everyone another fork and plate and cut the pie. If it's runny, shrug and switch to bowls and spoons, then cover the unsightly mess with COOL WHIP and dig in. It'll be delicious either way.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I make everyday desserts like \"Roadside Attraction Pie\" up on the fly on my days off to give my family a tangible reminder that I love them even when they're acting like total savages (and to use up bendy rhubarb). Plus fruit pie is ALMOST a balanced breakfast.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Almost.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSponsored posts are purely editorial content that we are pleased to have presented by a participating sponsor.

After losing my teaching job of nearly a decade when Middle Child was admitted to the hospital the day before a key deadline, I temped and held various \"weekend warrior jobs\" to make ends meet. It hasn't always been pretty. Heck, I don't think it's EVER really been pretty. But you know what? I made it work, and pulled us through it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I haven't wanted to say too much about what's been going on at my new job, but now that the crisis is over I feel like I can talk about it. About a\u00a0week ago, when things were looking so very grim, I was informed that the person who'd hired me on as \"fulltime with benefits\" had overstepped in doing so, and that I was (and would remain) a part-time employee (sans benefits). This really took the wind out of my sails, because it meant not only that I'd left my temp job at PseudoCorp for a job that paid $3 LESS per hour (but was supposed to come with benefits), but also that I'd have to go back on the job-hunt, because Hotter needs benefits through me before January rolls around and the Medicare \"donut hole\"\u00a0becomes an issue. Today, though, after much complaining to HR and Management on my part and the serendipitous (for me and mine, anyway) firing of a former co-worker, I was informed that I'd been changed over to \"full-time\" in the system and would be eligible for benefits once my ninety-day probation was over with.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The news couldn't have come at a better time. Today was not an easy day. Due to the afore-mentioned termination I was the only person waiting on a banquet room of seventy people tonight. I pretty much had to be like an octopus busing those tables, but you know what? I pulled it off, the guests were happy, and I wish the couple whose wedding rehearsal this dinner was a part of all the best.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If that's not an everyday victory, I don't know what is.\r\n****************************************************************************************************************************\r\nHurry in to Kroger and Kroger Banner Stores for P&G\u2019s big sale event, June 10\u201323!\r\nAt Kroger and its banner stores, more than 30 of your favorite P&G brands are at HOT sale prices through June 23, including Tide, Charmin, Cascade, Pampers, Crest and Olay.

Then I'll go home, sleep, send the MFA Children off to the first day of school, come back and work an extra shift I picked up and hopefully make some MORE cash tips (also possible and SLIGHTLY more likely), and maybe--MAYBE--if I then raid everyone's piggybanks I can drop the rent off a few days late and claim to the landlord that we were on vacation (ha.

I don't know if it was because it was just me and the person I click least with running admin (which isn't to say we DON'T click--EVERYone at this job continues to be beyond lovely--just that he's the only BOY on the team plus a generation removed) with another temp who's only there once a week and a skeleton crew of non-admin workers, or because it was the ninth day straight that I'd been working and I'd just mentally and physically HAD IT or what, but...yeah.

I'm not sure what happened to him, because he didn't show up and left me a cryptic voicemail, then when I called him back I couldn't really hear him over the unholy din around me. Fortunately I know him better than to have told the children to expect him, so the only ones disappointed by his no-show were Hotter and I (we were both looking forward to checking out his staples).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Honestly, I was rather disappointed in the fair. It was quite a bit smaller and less impressive than I'd been expecting, especially considering the price of admission. It was too chilly for half the animals on display to be out in the elements, which made me sad. And fried Oreos? Are GROSS. Plus Hotter wanted to go to the freak show, and got the children going on about it, and I had a small nervous breakdown in the middle of the midway and was apparently a total buzzkill railing against the gawking at of people whose bodies are different and reminding three-fifths of the people present that four-fifths of us present suffered from a genetic condition that many \"freak show\" performers have and that is NOT FUNNY...but I stand by that rant. The MFA Children, however, had a wonderful time, which is all that really mattered to me. Plus this:\r\n Figure One: Fancy pigeon! Hahaha, look at him! I took a lot of photos in the small animal tent, but it wasn't so much the animals I was interested in as their cage tags...\r\n  Figure Three: \"Hey Mommy, are you taking ANOTHER picture of that pigeon?\" \"Yep, he sure is cool-looking!\" Snicker snicker.

We're still overdrawn, and I don't much care for the pesticidal ways of most \"pick-your-own\" places anyway, so we went first to a nearby roadside I've had my eye on and then to a clear-cut then overgrown access path through the woods under some power lines. Blackberries were plentiful in both places, although the season is just getting started here, and the sun was shining.\u00a0 \u00a0About a quarter-mile into the woods we came across a muddy washout in the path, teeming with tadpoles--when I scouted this location out a few days ago by myself I saw lots of little adult frogs, too, although Isis scared them all away today. We let her offleash while I picked (Hotter doesn't see color or perceive depth well enough to pick safely or effectively, but came along to keep me company and wrangle the dog) and she went nuts! I have rarely seen her so rampantly joyous--she ran through the foot-deep water as fast as she could, snapping at tadpoles as she ran. When she came to the end of the water she'd go just far enough to get a good running start, turn around, and do it again; she did this over and over, getting filthy and soaked, tongue streaming. She had a blast! We all did. At home, I picked the blackberries from our backyard, and that gave us slightly more than eight cups of berries. I made them into seven eight-ounce jars of seedless jam.

{"date": "October  5, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Last night my right fuck-you finger started hurting; it felt like maybe I had a splinter but the skin was intact, there was no redness or anything, and even checking it out with a bright light and the iPhone's zoom (which is damn-near as good as a microscope) showed nothing so I shrugged it off and went to bed. This morning I woke feeling rested, albeit extraordinarily achy, and for the first time in ages my teeth didn't hurt (I squeezed in a trip to the dentist before the fair and he fixed my nightguard, which hadn't wanted to play well with the new front tooth). My co-workers were happy to see me and said they'd missed me on my day off (seriously LOVE those people!), and I was fully prepared to call today a good day except that my finger now felt like I'd burned it. Around nine in the morning I posted the following photo and caption on the facespace:\r\n Okay Dr. Facebook, let's play \"Spider Bite or Burgeoning MRSA,\" the home game! Sudden onset yesterday, stupidly painful, no visible break in the skin, hot to the touch: go!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0My friends had variously helpful things to say, and it was kind of funny in that the people who only know me offline (yeah, I'm not \"out\" as a blogger on the facespace) were all \"what is MRSA? Why would it be MRSA? Don't be a pessimist!\" and the people who have known me online for years were all \"it's MRSA cellulitis, go to the doctor, do not pass GO, do not collect $200.\" I was disinclined to do that, because I am currently making a REDONKULOUS sum per hour and while it hurt quite a bit, on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is a papercut and 10 is a gallstone I would only have given it a 4-5 at that point.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0A couple of hours later it started swelling:\r\n Oh goody, it's getting bigger!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I still wouldn't have rated the pain as greater than five, although it was sobering when one facespace friend cut and pasted the symptoms of cellulitis per the NIH and I had all of them except for fever (which I pointed out, upon which said friend provided anecdotal experience wherein a family member of hers had cellulitis withOUT the fever). People started trying to reason with me all sneaky-like, as in \"oh just go to the doctor, it might not be MRSA!\" I pointed out that while the rule on House is \"it's never Lupus,\" the rule of MFA Mama is \"it's always MRSA,\" but at that point I was still hoping it was a spider bite. Dr. Anon flat-out stated that unless I was allergic to spider venom she really thought I ought to seek medical attention. I am allergic to spider venom, though, so I continued to hold out hope this would be nothing requiring antibiotics but compromised with my friends list: I would draw a line around the margins of the thing and if it crossed it by four o'clock I'd leave early and go to Urgent Care in time to get a script filled.\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly after that, the finger started to itch a bit and I happily declared it to be a spider bite after all and left work at the usual time, stopped at Target to get a pair of dice and a bag of Smarties, both of which various MFA Children needed for homework assignments (the hell?), came home and ate dinner with the family (they'd already eaten since I work 7-7, but they all sat with me bickering for my undivided attention anyway), and then went and took a shower.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Something about the hot water seemed to aggravate things, because the finger then increased in size by another 20% or so and turned black in the center, with some other SLIGHTLY less-alarming colors in various other spots, none of which were the color a finger ought to be.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter took one look and pointed sternly at the door saying \"GO!\" and I realized I was being an asshole about it and went.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At Urgent Care the doctor poked and pressed on my poor sad finger, looked at it up close with bright lights, and had me move it in various ways, then pronounced it to DEFINITELY be infected with \"what looks to me exactly like MRSA, although with your history of MRSA septicemia after an aggressive culture you couldn't pay me to lance that thing, so we're just going to assume the worst and treat you for MRSA.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Ugh. Also? How sad is it when the local Urgent Care doc knows your medical history?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 So I went and filled my five (yes, FIVE antibiotics, antifungals for after the antibiotics, antiemetics to keep the antibiotics down, and something for pain since at this point that was creeping up the scale toward a six) prescriptions at the all-night pharmacy and headed home, but you know what?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I feel really freaking fortunate. Don't get me wrong, cellulitis sucks and MRSA scares the pants off me, but all day long I was enveloped with the concern of friends and coworkers and lovingly nagged as needed by various parties to do what I needed to do about the situation, I went home to a husband who was concerned and didn't complain about doing the bedtime routine alone so I could get to Urgent Care before they closed, I got prompt and compassionate medical care, and then I didn't have to prioritize which prescriptions to fill based on cost and necessity but just sighed ruefully and filled them all.

SO lame, that.\r\n* \u00a0 That said, I am feeling much better than I was last time I posted. I did in fact feel like utter crap on a cracker last night at the banquet, but as it was another Republican Party shindig (the second I've worked for Temp Agency #2 in the past month!) I didn't waste any time feeling guilty about going to work sick, and it was so incredibly fast-paced that I didn't have time to feel overly sorry for myself (we had a NAPKIN EMERGENCY in that they were folded in thirds and artfully draped over the edge of the table at each place-setting and then with only an hour until guests started to arrive management decided they all needed to look like this instead, which is problematic when you've got 1,200 napkins to refold, place and fluff and you also still need to drop cream-pitchers, salad-dressing boats, salads, desserts, waters, and iced teas at each of 120 tables and yes, believe it or not the twenty of us did somehow get it all done with the help of some of the kitchen staff) (after that there were salad plates to clear, entrees to serve, coffee to fetch, and the room to break down afterward). Between being crazy-busy and a kind co-worker's suggestion to keep sucking bits of ice \"to bring down yo culluh en hep yo throat\" I got through it rather more easily than I would have predicted.\r\n* \u00a0 The virus is responding well to Dr. Anon and dulcian's advice in the comments section to drink, drink, and DRINK SOME MORE. I was trotting back and forth to the bathroom ALL DAY LONG at my six-day-a-week job today, but that's okay because there was NOTHING to do. Seriously, Sundays are dead there; on-site middle management let us leave an hour and a half early and in the nine hours\u00a0and forty-five minutes I was on the clock (I take a forty-five minute lunch) I read one and a half books on The Precious with a Kindle app, played Words With Friends, shopped online, ate lots of snacks...and trotted back and forth to the bathroom a lot. So it's all good.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm even starting to deflate some, bloat-wise, which is a relief because a) I was on the verge of needing to bust out the maternity yoga pants I still have for such occasions, which is always particularly soul-crushing but particularly since my last baby is now in elementary school and I don't even have a UTERUS anymore and b) I was worried my body might just be a TOTAL asshole and hold onto the extra fluids I'm forcing down to flush out the virus. As the finger is now 95% improved in size and color I think the bacteria triggering that whole hot mess are mostly (if not completely) dead at this point, and hopefully you won't be able to see each stitch of the socks I wore in bas relief when I take them off for the day by the middle of this coming week.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I seriously want to marry the iPhone and have its' user-friendly little babies, especially since Twitter told me how to disable autocorrect (on an iPhone 4 it's settings>general>keyboard>autocorrection - YOU'RE WELCOME!).

Which would make me furious if they weren't also helping my finger, although since they are I guess I can put up with them. I'm still feeling pretty damned grateful; I have had MRSA septicemia before and therefore know that this could all have been a LOT worse had I waited to see a doctor and ended up with something systemic.\r\n Figure One: This is the shape of the stricken finger compared to the same finger on the other hand.

Also, hoes shaped like squids. You know I got that one, because come on: SQUID!\r\n* \u00a0 Also ordered today? Hotter's Valentine's Day gift. He's going to love it.

One of her ears is kind of messed up (the one with the rabbitry tattoo on it--the tattoo goes ALL THE WAY THROUGH HER EAR which I don't think it is supposed to do), and I guess maybe she was struggling when the guy did the tattooing and injured the cartilage or something? She doesn't seem to be in any pain from it, but the one ear is permanently at a rakish angle. It makes her look cranky. Pfeffer doesn't care if you pet her. She don't give a shit!

I had to \"sell\" a group of people on the importance of proper document formatting in relation to end-user absorption of written technical material, which is a nit-picky thing that not everyone can appreciate, and to make this extra-hard I was addressing a group of people who are about as far removed from the language arts discipline as you can get.

Well okay, not technically robbed, but apparently Temp Agency #1 reset everyone's W-4 status to \"single, no exemptions\" as of Valentine's Day for who-knows-what-reason and I was supposed to know to refile my tax forms? I don't know. What I do know is that my paycheck this week was light by about 20%, which? UNACCEPTABLE.\r\n* \u00a0 Don't tell me I'll get it back next April, because I won't. The Department of Education will get it next April. I think this is part of why I was so deeply unhappy about the whole thing (aside from the whole \"money snatched from my pocket while attempting to save up for badly-needed medical care for my husband\" bit); it reminded me that I suck and am a loser.\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of things that suck, why the buggery FUCK doesn't Medicare cover preventive dental care for transplant recipients, anyway? I get that a lot of dental work can be considered cosmetic, and that technically one can get by without teeth, but here's the thing: in an immunocompromised person a dental infection can kill. There is nothing optional about getting the very worst of what's wrong with Hotter's mouth fixed, and Medicare isn't even saving Uncle Sam any money by not covering this stuff, because I'm guessing not a lot of single transplant recipients go on to marry people who are willing to work their ass off and handle this shit. Which means that some of those who are even more fucked than Hotter is end up getting infections, which if they are too poor to have broken teeth extracted and cavities filled and already scrambling to cover their 20% of the medications they need to take every day to not DIE they probably aren't going to go in for right away. When they end up septic Medicare then covers their ambulance trip, their ER bed, their emergency oral surgery and week of IV antibiotics, their echocardiogram to see if they have vegetation on their heart valves, their maintenance meds and ICU bed, and whatever else they need while they're in-patient (and taking a transplant patient to the hospital is like taking a teenaged car to the mechanic--you may go in with a specific goal in mind but they WILL find more work to do while you're there). And all of that for the unfortunate few? Costs a HELL of a lot more than two cleanings and a set of x-rays every year for everybody, even if those DO reveal the need for a few fillings and maybe an extraction or two. /soapbox\r\n* \u00a0 So I had kind of a crappy day, but it wasn't entirely without merit. For one thing, today I wore a new scarf (this scarf was the last frivolous thing I bought before money went utterly to hell again) that thrills me to the very core for two reasons. First, it's a fabulous scarf (half silk, half pashmina, butter-soft and utterly gorgeous). And second, it was an AMAZING deal ($9.99, free shipping, 1% cash back).\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of deals, this free app gave me a sick little thrill earlier today. It's designed to help you find the cheapest gas around, but that's not what I use it for. I already know that Big Box Membership Store will have the cheapest gas around and so unless I have some fuel points from Local Grocery Store to use elsewhere I just buy gas there. No, I use GasBuddy to GLOAT. Yesterday I paid $3.36/gallon for gas at Big Box Membership Store and today that same gas (from the same place) is $3.42/gallon!!! So I saved a little over a dollar by filling the MFA Minivan up yesterday on my way home instead of waiting until today. WHOO TITS!\r\n* \u00a0 Also my dog is crazy-cute:\r\nFigure One: Of *course* I mean Isis. Bumpus? IS NO DOG OF MINE! He's on his second psych med now; the first one didn't work and while on it he ate a door. I love how Isis does the homie lean, or maybe she's just trying to get AWAY from Bumpus (actually they are the best of friends, which is one of the only two reasons Bumpus still draws breath under my roof, the other one being that so far the cost of the therapy Big Child would need if I got rid of the stupid dog still outweighs what we'll lose of our security deposit thanks to his crazypants antics).\r\n* \u00a0 And then a sweet friend did something incredibly kind that really raised my spirits. I don't know if she'd be okay with my saying what she did, exactly, or naming her, but I really needed something to cheer my sorry ass up, and this did the job.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I am off to bed, because tomorrow is a seventeen-hour day. Ooof.

{"date": "January 28, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0SO! I felt like my dirty hippie-cred was somewhat diminished after a conversation that happened on my wall over at the Facespace (basically I admitted that while I knew good and well Splenda was already showing up in our waterways and having unknown effects on the feeding pattern of key bottom-of-the-foodchain small critters, I found powdered Stevia in coffee to be utterly repulsive and resorted to some sweet, sweet molecularly-muddled sugar product instead like a damn ecoterrorist and then a bunch of friends weighed in until finally a friend of mine from a third-world country pointed out that were were all a bunch of overly-precious assholes, although not in so many words), plus we were almost out of laundry detergent. So today I followed some instructions I found in several spots around the innernet, added my own little twist, and made us some at home.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHomemade Laundry Detergent\r\n\u00a0 You will need Ivory soap:\u00a0\r\n\r\nwashing soda:\r\n\r\nborax:\r\n\r\nand (optional) an essential oil of your choice to scent your detergent (I used lavender):\r\n\r\n\r\nStep One: gather your ingredients. You will also need a large pan or mixing bowl, a grater, and a whisk, as well as something to put your detergent in (I re-used a laundry detergent box that already had a scoop of the right size--you're supposed to use two to four tablespoons of this stuff per load of wash).\r\n \r\nStep Two: grate one bar of Ivory per \"batch\" of detergent that you are making. I found that five \"batches\" filled our detergent box to about the same level as its' original contents, which was important since I wanted to do a price comparison. Use the fine side of the grater; the soap is very easy to grate and ends up looking a lot like something you'd want to put on top of spaghetti.\r\n\r\nStep Three: add one cup per \"batch\" apiece of the washing soda and borax, blend with the whisk until you reach a nice \"scoopable\" texture. Then add a few sprinkles of essential oil and blend some more.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And there you have it: homemade laundry detergent. Here is my box with four of five \"batches\" in it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I did a test load of wash, and in my opinion the homemade detergent works at least as well as what I had been using before (in fact, I think it works BETTER for removing odors--included in the test load were some hand-me-down sweaters my co-worker/friend at PseudoCorp gave me, and she is a smoker so to me they kind of reeked going in but smelled nice and clean coming out). But does this actually save any money? Here are the prices I paid for the ingredients.\r\nIvory: $18.06 for 32 bars = $0.56 per barWashing Soda: $5.97 for 55 oz = $0.87 per cupBorax: $7.88 for 76 oz = $0.83 per cupLavender Oil: $8.75 for 0.5 oz* = I figure I used about $0.10 worth of this per batch\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So one \"batch\" of homemade detergent costs $2.36, and it took five batches to fill my detergent box. Therefore, the per-box cost of the homemade stuff is $11.80. How does that measure up against the retail equivalent (green-friendly, scented)?\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0VICTORY! I saved $2.25, plus there's the intangible value of being insufferable and saying I make my own laundry detergent any chance I get, which you really can't put a price on. Probably I could get the cost down a little further if I bought my ingredients from an actual store (with the exception of the Ivory I ordered mine from Drugstore.com in order to use eBates and get cash back\u00a0at the rate of 12% as of when I made my purchases, plus \"Drugstore dollars\" [5%] and accounted for my savings in the prices I listed), but I prefer shopping online, and pretty much ONLY do so when I can score free shipping. This saves me time and schlepping. Plus to really save I'd most likely have to patronize a Soulless Corporate Megalith store, and I don't like to do that; I don't know for a fact that Amazon and Drugstore.com treat their workers well, but I DO know for a fact that Soulless Corporate Megalith treats their workers like SHIT, and that's to say nothing of what they do to small businesses when one comes to town. So I'll take saving the $2.25 and earning bragging rights and call it a day.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And how are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0If you're looking at what I paid for lavender oil vs. the price listed on the Amazon Affiliates widget and wondering if I be cray, the answer is yes and no. The lavender oil I used was what I had on-hand, which was organic and therefore kind of pricey, but I prefer to use organic essential oils since I mostly use them for bath and body products and other things, like detergent, that will come into contact with human skin. We have sensitive skin here. So I didn't overpay, but I did consciously choose a more expensive product.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340167613cb2b5970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340167613cba50970b-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016300474e78970d-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340168e63e2de3970c-pi", "http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=tk4AR6w6UXfc7TGQISHHqQ%3D%3D"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/upping-my-dirty-hippie-cred.html", "title": "upping my dirty hippie-cred"},

I doubt it's malignant, but it probably ought to come out. Not that I have the money for a surgery, or could afford to take time off, or hell even get home after any such thing since Hotter can't drive...damn, damn, DAMN.

{"date": "February 24, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0This week wins. I got up after less than five hours' sleep and dragged my sorry ass into the office, but something wasn't right. I felt like I'd been hit by a bus and my sinuses were draining a lot, but I didn't really feel all that sick, and believe you me I was on symptom-watch after last night:\r\nFigure One: I really wanted to be wrong, but I knew what this meant.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Usually when I get an ear infection, I spend a couple of days dithering over whether or not this is an actual thing and whether or not I want to cave and get medical attention; the ear that always gets infected is also the one that hurts like hell if I'm about to get a migraine or sometimes even when there's a storm coming, so wretched ear pain isn't always indicative of infection plus I hate hate HATE taking antibiotics.\u00a0Today we've had rain, thunder, and even a tornado warning, so when my ear started to hurt around nine this morning I kind of shrugged and kept working. I had some emergency NSAIDs (I know, I know, I shouldn't be taking those but my H&H are pretty respectable since the hysterectomy so I use them sparingly during autoimmune clusterfucks and migraines) in the pill-fob on my keychain and took those in case it was an impending migraine (and also because my SI joint is KILLING ME), but I wasn't terribly concerned at that point. I was doing some field-work today, running around talking to people with my uber-sexy fits-over-eyeglasses safety goggles on, so I was pretty distracted although I did notice that where the goggles rested against the top of my cheekbone on the left side it kind of felt like a brick was sitting on my face.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At eleven I thanked the folks helping me and headed back to my desk, and pretty much the moment I sat still I realized that I had A Problem. I messaged Hotter on gchat and told him I didn't want to lose any hours in light of our current financial clusterfuck, but didn't think I'd make it all the way through the workday. He suggested that I hang in until my usual quitting time (I'd planned to work two hours past that), then swing by Urgent Care on the way home. I agreed, then yawned and OH MY FUCK, HELL NO, OWWW. I shot my boss a quick e-mail letting him know that I wasn't feeling well and asking if I could take my laptop home to finish what I was doing and go ahead and leave to go see a doctor. My boss, who is one of the nicest people I have ever met, came over to my cube and said he'd thought I looked a little unwell, and to absolutely go and get that checked out and not worry about working from home, just rest over the weekend and try to feel better. I knew I'd made the right call when that brought tears to my eyes; I am NOT usually a Weepy Willie, as k calls it, unless I am hella sick or have missed a Synthroid or something.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0By the time I got to Urgent Care I was absolutely miserable with pain and the entire left side of my face had a heartbeat. The triage nurse took my blood pressure twice, then went and got the doctor right away because apparently I was starting to go into shock a little: IT HURT THAT MUCH. The doctor was a very nice Russian lady who looked in my ear and exclaimed \"ohhhh eardrum is rupture, is no wonder you haff pain!\" She made me lie down and put some topical anesthetic drops in my ear, which helped some, prescribed Levaquin and Vicodin, and strongly suggested I see an ENT about getting a tube put in after this heals since this is the second time she's seen me for an ear infection this winter and she could see notes from two others in the past year alone, all in the same ear.\r\nFigure Two:\u00a0Ballllls!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I feel quite a lot better now that I am home and in bed and the Vicodin has kicked in, but I'm still hurting pretty badly and shocked at how quickly this came on, and I'm also absolutely GUTTED over losing five hours today and having to spend sixty dollars on medical care and drugs (thank goodness I have insurance and Levaquin has gone generic--I'm upset and feeling rather cheated by life but also well aware this could have been a lot worse) on top of what I already lost to Temp Agency #1's tax-form fuckery and Temp Agency #2's payroll gaffe. Probably we'll end up with an overdraft, and it all just seems so very fucking futile; why am I busting my ass at three different jobs if we're fucked in the end anyway? So fine, I cry Uncle, this horrible week has defeated me entirely. I don't know why I can't fucking catch a break lately, but for right now, and definitely until at least Monday morning, I just give up.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016301f648b0970d-pi", "http://twoadultsonebrownbaby.blogspot.com", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016762eba618970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/02/defeated.html", "title": "defeated"},

Speaking of which, I feel like ass; according to the paperwork from Urgent Care if I am not feeling better by tomorrow I need to go back in and possibly get my antibiotics changed up. I really, absolutely, catefuckinggorically CANNOT afford another round of co-pays. Maybe I'm just being a big old baby?

This is because a couple of people asked why I didn't have a way for people to chip in and help out with the current financial clusterfuck; apparently the Tip Jar is not terribly obvious. I was hesitant to do this because TROLLS but also did not want anyone who wanted to help to not feel like they could, because I am totally drowning and willing to grab any lifeline at this point. I had saved almost half the cost of Hotter's upcoming dental work (three weeks from now, OHMYGOD), but spent all of it yesterday at the vet. If you feel like that was stupid of me, you are entitled to have that opinion and part of me even agrees with you. But, as a wise friend on the Twitter pointed out, if human beings always made rational decisions we would not be human. Also, if the tables were turned, my dog would do whatever it took to save MY life (judging by how courageously she protected me from her own reflection in a window the other day, bless her poor unselfconscious little heart).

{"date": "May  1, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So. I didn\"t go to work, which should tell you everything you need to know about how my back is. I got up when the alarm went off, and shuffled to the bathroom, holding onto the hallway wall all the way, and then in transferring into the bathroom, proper, almost fell flat because my right leg twitched out and then buckled at the knee. I caught myself on the vanity (my arms are okay--it hurts to move them, but only because that pulls on my trunk; whatever this is is down at L5, which I know because that is where I broke my back and it is ALWAYS L5), and took a moment to get my shit together and think. Seeing as it's my right leg that's the most wonky (and given that I have nerve damage in my left leg from the break twenty-one years ago that alone is pretty alarming), that was one strike against going to work anyway. Because that's my pedal-pushing leg, obviously, and while the MFA Minivan has cruise control, braking in a timely manner is essential to safe driving. The whole \"not able to walk/balance worth a shit without holding onto things\" scenario was strike two, obviously. I mean, I do possess a Rollator, but all concerns of personal dignity aside (I pretty much got over those when I had to use the thing to get around for months and months a few years ago), the idea of lifting it in and out of the MFA Minivan seemed tremendously optimistic at best (and downright idiotic at worst) (in the Rollator's defense it is VERY lightweight, but it weighs more than string cheese. So). Strike three was the fact that I had an hour-long anxiety attack* in the wee hours of the morning after sternly telling myself I NEEDED to sleep to go to work and that it was mind over motherfucking matter, and I looked and felt like someone operating on three hours' nightmare-riddled sleep following an hour's helpless tears.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I so totally can't even afford this, y'all.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But since my body doesn't seem to give a shit about what I can and cannot afford or tolerate, I have to decide what to do about this, and since I cannot, even with unpacking and examining my reasons for liking or disliking any one option, discern what the best way to handle this would be, I'm crowdsourcing it and giving y'all a chance to weigh in.\r\nOption One: Do nothing, by which I mean continue to take NSAIDs and Tylenol-laced narcotics, ice my lower back, and move as little as possible up until VERY CAREFULLY stretching, applying heat, and gradually ramping my level of activity back up is feasible. This is what I've been doing so far. Pros include not costing anything, not having to leave the house, and the fact that historically this always turns out to have been the wisest course of action in cases like this. Cons include possibly running out of leftover dentist pills before the pain is less terrifying, the possibility of overlooking something like a disc issue, and the fact that seeking some medical attention MIGHT have me back in fighting (or at least white-collar working) form sooner than this.\r\nOption Two: Drag my sorry ass to Urgent Care (my GP, in addition to being on my shit list, doesn't have an x-ray suite in her office). Pros include ruling disc issues in or out via x-ray and neuro exam, documentation to show my boss (who doesn't care about such things and kind of rolls his eyes when I present him with doctor's notes after absences, but I like to demonstrate accountability), and possibly obtaining better pain relief in the form of steroids and/or more narcotics. Cons include costing money,having to leave the house, and \u00a0the fact that realistically and based on precedent this won't actually make me feel any better any sooner than waiting it out.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What say ye? At this point I could argue either side, and Hotter is the KING of \"whatever you want to do about it, baby,\" so I'm interested to see what other people think.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Which...what the fuck? All self-deprecating hyperbole aside, I haven't had a genuine anxiety attack like that in YEARS, like, probably at least three of them. And yet there I was having a conversation with myself in the wee hours that went something like \"There is absolutely no reason to hurt yourself rolling over to make sure nobody is standing at the end of the bed, because the dogs would've gone nuts if someone had broken in and ZOMBIES ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE JUST BEING STUPID ABOUT THE ZOMBIES, THIS IS NOT AT ALL LIKE YOU WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, ANYWAY I MEAN ZOMBIES, SERIOUSLY???\" And then I finally went to sleep and had nightmares about my maternal progenitor until the alarm went off.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wayfair.com/Drive-Medical-Mimi-Lite-Rollator-54-DVE2243.html?refid=GPA49-DVE2243_6314963&PiID=6314963&gclid=CKHStoii368CFUJx4Aod4AwF2Q"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/05/crowdsourcing-because-i-really-dont-even-know-what-to-do-with-this.html", "title": "crowdsourcing, because I really don't even know what to do with this"},

I decided to take y'all's advice and see a doctor, but only after it had been forty-eight hours (at which point I figured whoever would have a more accurate picture of the damage; barring something ridiculous like a mobile fracture waiting a bit wouldn't be dangerous, and at no point did I have a continence issue or consistent inability to use my lower extremities).  The first thirty-six hours were absolute misery, and I think staying home and resting most of Tuesday was a good call.  After that, however, I noticed that while I was still in a lot of pain, I was able to move a lot better and the pain went from incapacitating to merely excruciating and cranky-making (ask Hotter how well I coped when he was an hour late taking his pills, or better yet don't...). So I decided to give it another day and quit taking narcotic pain relief to make sure I wasn't just masking symptoms (that was doubtful, as narcotics don't actually help me much, maybe because I've had to take them at least a couple times a year since I was in elementary school due to a combination of sod's luck and faulty connective tissue). I also may have removed a piece of string cheese from the offending packet and eaten it in front of the open refrigerator, just to show the rest what I'm capable of! Heh.  Sans-narcotics, I'm still not anywhere near my baseline level of function. But the pain has lessened by at least twenty-five percent at this point, and what I can't do, I can't do because it hurts, not because my body won't work. THIS IS A GAME-CHANGER! Since I doubt I would've seen this kind of improvement if this was a disc issue, I'm just going to keep taking it easy and taking NSAIDs (and avoid lifting and sharp objects) for now and see how that goes.

Vetch has much larger seeds and needs to be planted deeper than the other stuff, which is all wee bitsy seeds that you can broadcast onto loosened soil, so it would've been a pain in the arse ANYWAY). I figure that stuff'll all make for good bunny-fodder as well as fixing nitrogen into the soil and aerating it. I also planted Premier kale and repotted my ailing dwarf Meyer Lemon.\r\nFigure One: No, YOUR desk is covered in plastic and pushed up against a South-facing window being used as a plant hospital!\r\n* \u00a0 Today I overheard something I wasn't meant to at work. I was lost in the cubicles (it happens at least once a day still; I try to orient myself within the building by remembering which side I can see the river from at my desk but end up lost on the way back from the loo on a regular basis) and two young Turks were conversing and one of them said \"OHHHHH you know The One Who Dislikes MFA Mama? Who works in X department? Yeah!\" and made an obscene gesture that I believe was meant to convey carnal knowledge thereof. Which, well, the fellow wasn't bad-looking, but mostly I felt a) scandalized by the vulgarity, because apparently I am eighty now and b) bad for her that he was bandying it about in such a manner. I even made a mental note to add \"kissing and telling\" to the round of \"YOU DO NOT DOs\" next time I'm lecturing my boys on The Importance of Being Non-assholes, because yeesh!\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of star-crossed lovers, the bunnies are eight weeks old now and I decided it was time for them to go all Heloise and Abelaard and move into separate quarters to avoid a too-early breeding stunting anyone's growth.

Has is enjoying having a clear shot at the food and water. Pfeffer the Heifer didn't want to move cages and I ended up hauling her out by the scruff. She was pissed! Poor bunny.

Thank you for your comments, your tweets, your e-mails, your WWF chats and facespace comments and messages and oh, hell, there is something in my eye. I'm not going to stop blogging. I just don't want to be a big fat downer, y'know?\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Since so many of you expressed concern about Isis and I'm not facespace friends with all of you and not everyone is on the Twitter, here is the deal with Isis. We spent three hours at the vet. It sucked a lot. They had a poor little mutt come in as an emergency who was hit by a car and we had to wait while they patched him up as best they could. His owner was bawling in the waiting room. I felt awful for her! Meanwhile, Bumpus flying-tackled Hotter, launching himself from the exam table directly into Hotter's face and knocking him onto the floor, Little Child climbed the exam table, Bumpus humped the shit out of Isis, both dogs and at least one human had gas, and chaos pretty much reigned. You think I'm kidding? Here is the only picture I snapped that doesn't show any of my kids' faces:\r\nFigure One: Believe it or not this is them playing, not fighting to the death.\r\n* \u00a0 As for Isis's lump, the vet didn't like the look of it and did a needle biopsy. The mass in Isis's abdomen is a lymphnode, and the vet is more concerned about the superficial lumps (there are two now). She was hoping they were cysts and that she would be able to drain them with the needle, but no such luck. She did get enough of a sample to send to pathology, and in the scuffle I forgot to ask when that would be back (I know, I suck! I'll call tomorrow). Meanwhile, Isis is on a broad-spectrum antibiotic that kills \"everything but MRSA\" and we're to apply hot compresses twice a day to encourage any infection to come to the surface and drain. If that doesn't happen they'll need to operate. Between the cost of the biopsy and HALF the course of antibiotic (I'll have to go back for the rest after I get paid), here is what our bank accounts now look like (I actually thought we'd be overdrawn and laughed the laugh of the unhinged when I saw this):\r\nFigure Two: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAOHFUCK.\r\n* \u00a0 The MFA Children, exam-table climbing aside, were absolute angels during the long wait. Middly said \"your face is worried about my dog and so I am worried, too.\" Take that, people who said he'd never read faces or show empathy! When I saw the bill and he saw my face, he teared up and gave me a hug. \"Thank you for saving my dog,\" he said happily. Oh, buddy. I hope this works.\r\n* \u00a0 I...am not even a little bit okay. I don't really feel anything except wheezy, because our vet treats cats, too. I'm a little concerned that my priorities are out of whack. My husband desperately needs a ton of dental work and I just spent everything we had trying to save a dog? The trolls of the world are going to love this shit. Physically I think I am on the mend; my ear and sinuses were not terribly painful today and things are draining. Some of what is draining is blood, but I think that's just what I get for taking NSAIDs. At this point I'm more concerned about my mental health (see: priorities, above) and so I am going to get back off the innernet.

So it's like a giant medical circlejerk with my husband in the middle (barfing, most likely), and this is why Hotter usually isn't allowed to go to the doctor without me. Because I probably would've cut Transplant off at the knees when they sent him to the goddamn ER, or at the very least put the kibosh on the ER being all \"your brain and blood are normal so have fun throwing up and passing out at home, sucka!\" Since he's been hypotensive for the past week I'm thinking SOMEbody probably needs to scale back one or more of his BP meds, which only Transplant can really do (they manage those, plus nobody else will alter a transplant patient's meds). Either that or Hotter just needs to sack up and quit being such a wussy about having a BP in the 90s over 60s, because I walk around like that every goddamn day and you don't see ME retiring to my fainting couch over it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The MFA Children and I were actually on our way to go and get our bees when Hotter called to say he'd been discharged.

I was kind of worried because I have the kind of veil that goes over a hat (that is the cheapest kind) and my feral children destroyed my straw gardening hat (which I'd been planning to use with the veil) doing some kind of Mexican hat dance on the thing, but then I realized that their plastic Bob the Builder hard hat would a) fit me and b) have enough of a brim all the way around it to hold the veil.

This gave me a chance to go and mess with the bees, though!

{"date": "January 11, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 MFA Landlord, when Hotter e-mailed him to ask about a new lease, voiced his intention to raise the rent by a hundred a month. Which...well, if it was JUST that it wouldn't QUITE break us, but with that AND my health insurance going up AND the MFA Minivan being, unexorably, drifting away toward The Big Junkyard In The Sky...no. So our lease is up at the end of the month, and we may have to move. We'll see. The house clearly wants us to stay, being as it's unsaleable without $20k in septic system renovations, tiny, possessed of only one bathroom (in need of tilework), drafty, reminiscent of nothing so much as a brick shoebox, and in a very odd little neighborhood. To rent it out to anyone else the landlord would have to paint the entire interior, fix the bathroom up, repair a few other miscellaneous things, and generally spend at least one month of vacancy sprucing it up. And realistically he's not likely to get any more for it than we're already paying. So there's that. We've countered with \"well in that case can we have three months at the old rent amount to find a new place to live; we wanted to stay but can't afford (another) rent increase, plus you promised us there would not be one.\" We'll see, I guess. I am Very Worried and also bitter as when this news came I was moments away from clicking \"confirm purchase\" on seeds and other supplies for this year's garden. Balllls.\r\n* \u00a0 But that's not all! Apparently PseudoCorp told me the truth in the interview about my position being temporary. Which means that either they weren't truthful with Temp Agency #1 or else Temp Agency #1 was overly optimistic when they described the job to me as being temp-to-hire (I have no way of knowing which it was and would be maligning an entity that has helped to feed my family if I ventured a guess either way, so I will refrain from verging into conjecture; either way it sucks). Apparently now that they've hired someone for a key position, The One Who Dislikes Me (who has been downright decent lately...all in all there are much worse people to work with and if my next job is with a bunch of lazy cretins I know I will miss her quiet and innocuous competence) will go back to doing the job I've been doing, and I will be going the way of the dodo. Sigh. There are three potential rays of hope that I am trying to cling to right now or I'd be a total basketcase: first, the co-worker who is on the way to becoming a friend may have a lead on a permanent position within the company that I'd be suited to, second, there was mention of another department within the company needing a temp (said department has one of those incomprehensible corporate-speak names that tells me NOTHING about what they actually do, so I dunno whether I'd be qualified or even able to fake it convincingly just yet) and I'd have a leg up in that I already know a lot about the company, know people's names and positions, and have a badge and a parking pass, and third, Temp Agency #1 might have something for me (they're looking--I expressed my dismay to them about the situation and they were apologetic). I've also been scouring local job postings and there's at least ONE full-time with-benefits position listed currently that I think I'd be qualified for. Which is approximately 100% more than there's been in weeks.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I can't really tolerate even thinking too hard about being potentially jobless and homeless by the end of the month, because it will break me, so let's not discuss either of those possibilities any further.

It's less to do with vanity (Hotter is the only person who has to see me naked on the regular, and he actually PREFERS me zaftig, bless his poor blind little heart) and more to do with stuff like \"not getting the Type Two Diabeetus\" and \"spare the joints!\" My family tree is full of hideous, but largely preventable conditions either caused or exacerbated by being overweight, and I'm not getting any younger. It's hard. I'm not gonna lie. I fell wayyyy off the wagon over the holidays and gained back everything I'd lost in two months of hard work, partly due to an injury and partly due to lack of restraint. That sucked. But now I'm back at it, and I am sloooowly seeing results.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All of that is to say that sometimes I would sell one of my children for some damn chocolate cake, but I've learned that I can't cheat on The Diet without going buck-ass wild and gaining ten pounds. Then I found this lady's blog, and thought \"well hell, I could have some of THAT cake!\" But I didn't have black beans, or liquid stevia, and I don't even want as much sugar as is in that much honey, and I have cholesterol issues, and I suck at following directions...anyway here is what I made, which isn't exactly her recipe, but is its kissing cousin:\r\nMFA Mama's Poot-cakes\r\nTrader Joe's Cannelini Beans - 1 can (420 calories)Five egg whites - \u00a080 calories (16 ea.)Two egg yolks - 100 calories (50 ea.)\u00a0Unsweetened cocoa powder - 6 tbsp (120 calories)1/2 c. Horizon Whole Milk - (80 calories)Coconut Oil - 7 tbsp (840 calories)1 tsp. vanilla extract1/2 tsp salt1 tsp. baking powder1/2 tsp baking soda1/2 c. Splenda\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Blenderize everything, ladle into a cupcake pan (WITH LINERS!), bake at 350 for about 20 minutes (until a butterknife comes out clean), and eat before going to bed facing AWAY from your spouse (HA!).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0They're really good, high in protein and fiber, and honestly you'd never guess about the beans if you just took a bite without knowing what they were. Next time I think I'll use actual black beans, I just didn't have any in the house, and maybe a teensy pinch of vanilla sugar sprinkled over the top of each one. These would probably be KILLER with peanut-butter on top, but obviously that would add a ton of calories (each of these has 136.666666667 total calories, which I rounded to 140 since there's no nutritional information on the ingredients without calories listed but they have to have a TINY amount, right?).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nAll calorie counts courtesy of Myfitnesspal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://blueviolafarm.blogspot.com/", "http://blueviolafarm.blogspot.com/2012/03/eat-your-beansfor-dessert.html"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/05/140-calorie-wheat-free-chocolate-cupcakes.html", "title": "140-calorie, wheat-free chocolate cupcakes"},
{"date": "January 12, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday wasn't done hurting me after I published my last post, because one of my bedtime pills stuck in my hiatal hernia on the way down.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I spent the night mostly awake in searing agony. I got up several times, to take TUMS, to take naproxen (yes, I know, horrid for the stomach actually but it was 2:30 a.m. and I was desperate), to eat yogurt...nothing helped. It's not quite as bad as the last time this happened, I think because it wasn't motherfucking Clindamycin in the capsule in question, but it's close. Hopefully the GI bleeding won't be as bad this time, because last time I did have a few dizzy spells.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I almost didn't go to work this morning. Hotter literally nudged me, moaning, off the bed with his foot, and before you hate all over him (keep reading, he gets his later I promise) it was a good thing I went in because I managed to finagle another temp job out of PseudoCorp that'll keep things afloat for another two months.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then comes the part that pushed me over the edge, and I wish I could tell y'all about it, especially since nobody at work was being an asshole (quite the contrary, actually), but I am too paranoid about what Eyeballs Who Dislike Me would try to make of it and who they would try to make it to so I can't. So instead I'll just say that everyone involved in my new position seems positively lovely and I really look forward to showing them my gratitude for the job by rocking it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I went home, and Hotter made a fabulous Bambi Stroganoff for dinner, and then the children were acting out because they need more attention, but I was tired and bitter and in an unbelievable amount of pain, and we proceeded to have a horrible evening. EVERYBODY demonstrated the absolute worst facets of their personalities. EVERYONE. And then I sent the grounded children to bed crying with admonitions that I just couldn't. Take. One. More. Thing. and then Hotter accidentally wiped a hunk of raw chicken ALL OVER THE KITCHEN in the process of preparing the dogs' food and I LOST IT. I have issues with raw chicken. It is gross. He knows this, and chose to berate me for using hot soapy water to clean it up when there was hand sanitizer closer to the scene of the crime against my sensibilities, and that, gentle readers, is when I as a grown-ass woman of nearly thirty-three years old beaned my husband with a large, wilted carrot.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Do I really have to say anything more about my mental state than that? I assaulted the person who loves me most with a wilted root vegetable. Shiiiiit.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the midst of my subsequent bawling, Middle Child got out of bed and apologized for his role in the evening and told me not to cry, that he knew I was doing my best, and oh, y'all. My kids deserve a better mother.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Tomorrow is my birthday. I can't afford to take the day off, even if it's just to go to the doctor, because I don't have the co-pay. Honestly I kinda hope I get lucky and bleed out in my sleep, because it's the happiest ending I can think of right now, but chances are I'll wake up feeling like death itself and a torrent of shit will rain down on me from the sky the moment I walk out the front door.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And you?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/bad-day.html", "title": "bad day"},

I thought it was that all of the \"OMG I almost ended up without a job when we had NO savings\" (but I got the new job, which it turns out is something I could rock with one hand tied behind my back and the people I am working with continue to be lovely) plus \"GAHHHH HIGHER RENT NOOOO!\" stress had finally caught up to me, but while that is MORE than enough to ruin a gal's sunny disposition it was worse than that.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I woke up this morning in the throes of a fullblown autoimmune clusterfuck, complete with sacroiliitis (which, well, I guess that'll teach me to snivel over the World's Worst Heartburn sensation of a gelcap disintegrating in my lower esophagus). As something of a pain connoisseur I have to say that sacroiliiac pain is really up there and one of my very least-favorite things. Booo, body.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It got preempted by the Day of OMG SUCK yesterday, but I meant to tell y'all that the XY had been a (reluctant, heavily coached, but I was still prepared to give credit where credit seemed to be due) mensch and agreed to kick in an extra fifty dollars per month so we wouldn't have to move IF I could talk the landlord into a fifty-dollar raise in rent instead of the proposed hundred-dollar one (yes, the XY is STILL underpaying in terms of child support but oh well). But that was yesterday, and today when I called to tell him that yes, I had succeeded in talking the landlord down to a fifty-dollar increase and make extra sure before agreeing to sign a new lease that he would keep his word the XY cursed me out, accused me of \"nickel and diming\" him, called me a liar about the rent, and threatened to sue me and take the children away if I left the school district. Which was how I came to spend nearly an hour discreetly weeping at work.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then the PMS Buddy reminder e-mail arrived, an apparent day late. Ballllls. Et tu, ovary?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All in all I feel like I've been beaten heavily with a bat and left for dead by my thirty-third birthday, and my hiatal hernia is still killing me, and I'm working an eight-hour shift tomorrow as a prep-cook for a local banquet through Temp Agency #2. If my stomach was up for it and I didn't have to work and I had the cash to go to the liquor store I think I'd be looking for the bottom of a bottle right now, but as it stands I'm going to...\r\n...EVIDENTLY PASS THE HELL OUT! The above was written yesterday, 1/13 and I fell asleep writing it. Work today was good. Still in hella pain but oh well. Feeling slightly less grim about things over all; it seems Temp Agency #2 might be able to find me weekend work on the regular and maybe the demise of Weekend Warrior job won't have such a major impact on my little family, after all? At any rate, this year's birthday was not my favorite but at least it's over, and thank you to all of my sweet friends on here and the facespace for your kind words, small presents (OMG PEOPLE GAVE ME PRESENTS?!?) and reminders that no matter how bad it gets, y'all care.

Has on the left and Pfeffer on the right. They are pure white; the dark shadowing in Pfeffer's left ear is her rabbitry tattoo.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We stopped at the feed store we used to use when we had the MFA Flock on the way home. Winter greeted me with a smile and a \"long time no see.\" She was sorry to hear about our birds but pleased to sell us a bag of rabbit chow, bundle of cedar shavings, and 60-lb bale of compressed alfalfa hay (I have no idea whether two bunnies can consume that whole thing before it goes musty or not, but considering that a \"bunny bale\" from the pet store is half the cost, an eighth the quality, and 1/30th the size I think it was a sound purchase). From there we triumphantly returned home and installed our rabbits in a large tank that has housed generations of poultry and various reptiles.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Since it seemed like a celebratory occasion, we roasted a whole chicken with herbs from the garden cut into butter shoved under the skin. It made the whole house smell like a holiday, and everyone enjoyed it (even picky Little Child, who scorns most meat, had four helpings of the moist, flavorful breast). After dinner, we took the bunnies out to pet and fuss over.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was holding Has when my children quite literally scared the shit out of him by getting up in his face. He let loose, filling the palm of my hand with dry, round rabbit turds, some of which rolled onto the floor and bounced around. The children shrieked, the rabbit looked terrified, and I took him to join Pfeffer in pulling apart a handful of alfalfa back in their cedar-scented home and picked up the mess. I poured the manure-balls around the base of my potted Dwarf Meyer Lemon as the children squealed in disgust, and gave the plant a cup of water to start washing the nutrients into the soil.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think we're going to enjoy having bunnies.\r\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834016760a70b12970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/contented.html", "title": "contented"},
{"date": "January 17, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I don't know, y'all. There's a whole lot of ugh in my life right now, including (but not limited to! NEVER limited!):\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0* My SI joint is still a dick, although it's improving, thank goodness.\u00a0 \u00a0* I am getting a fresh cold, and am very bloaty, which...well, I'm trying to think positive and tell myself I'm just coming down with a virus and very, very hormonal (yes, THAT is me thinking positive these days) but I'm worried it's going to turn into another sinus/ear debacle, which I can't afford on any level.\u00a0 \u00a0* Hotter and I had to have A Big Talk, of the \"What The Hell, Dude, No SERIOUSLY Have You Lost Your Mind\" variety. It went well, which was a relief (I'd been avoiding this particular talk for fear of coming off like some kind of asshole, but then I realized that bottling it all up until I snapped and beat him to death wouldn't really be very non-assholy either). I think he know Some Things Had To Change. We're not, like, On The Rocks or anything. But the thing with Hotter and me is, even though we've had the occasional wobble, I still put him on a pedestal as The Light At The End Of My Twenties, Saver Of My Sanity and am therefore unreasonably disappointed when he effs up, as well all tend to do (yes, even yours truly, which is probably a good thing as I just turned thirty-three and that was not a very good year for the LAST perfect Jew, or so rumor has it).\u00a0 \u00a0* My ex-husband. Oh my word, y'all, I can't even. Really, I can't. He is largely to blame for this recent autoimmune bullshit; stress triggers that stuff in me in the very worst way and it is no great coincidence in my mind that while I was mostly bed-bound and on copious time-release morphine during the last years of the XY's and my marriage, I was upright and fully-functional, working for a living within mere weeks of kicking him to the curb. I have had to re-draw a line with him that I smudged and finally pretty much erased after his big car accident, namely I will not communicate with him off-record anymore, at all, effective immediately. I had relaxed on my \"texts, e-mails, and talks in front of third-party witnesses ONLY\" policy after his near-death experience briefly rendered him a kinder, gentler XY, and it was going okay for a while, but either he is over his post-concussion syndrome or has gone off his antipsychotics or hell, I dunno, maybe CATHERINE! stopped putting out or something...at any rate the result is no bueno. I can sit here right now, having not spoken to that man about it in DAYS and say that of COURSE he isn't going to succeed in taking my children away from me, because I am a (mostly) good parent, they are happy, healthy, and well-adjusted in my care, and he is an unstable, unreliable bastard who doesn't follow court orders worth a damn and has THREE psychological conditions that would render any sane human being dubious about awarding him full custody of a GOLDFISH on record with the judge. But five minutes of him screaming at me and calling me names on the phone on a day when I am feeling vulnerable can CONVINCE me that I'd better go home IMMEDIATELY (as in, leave work--I really almost did) and hug my babies because my days of seeing them regularly are numbered. I hate admitting that, and it feels like weakness to have to set these kinds of limits with that wretched man.\u00a0As a psychologist friend of mine recently reminded me, though, he is a sociopath and I am not. It's not a fair fight. There is no shame in defending my sanity. And maybe if I say that enough times it will start to ring true? I dunno.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All that is to say that I think I'm going to stop shampooing my hair. Wait, what? No, really. Lately I'm knee-deep in Novella Carpenter's blog archives and so jealous of her for having goats that I can hardly see straight. I miss my poultry. I'm planning on acquiring a rain barrell and diverting the grey water from our washing machine for garden use in the Spring (I'm already making my own bio-friendly laundry detergent), and lately, with finances being what they are, I am trying to figure out some ways that I can be green and be frugal at the same time. One of those is that I'm breaking free of as many personal care products as possible (except toilet paper and good ol' highly-carcinogenic industrial-strength antiperspirant--there are LIMITS to my insanity, y'all). I've already stopped using lotion (instead I use coconut oil with a jot of lavendar essential oil in after showers for now, although I have Big Plans for when we get our bees up and running and have access to beeswax on the regular) and fancy leave-in conditioner products (I use the same combination on my ends as I use on my skin, actually). Next up to get the boot, when I run out of what is currently in the house? Shampoo.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not mired in depression and apathy, I'm GREEN.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, fine, there's maybe some overlap.

{"date": "January 19, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So the most amazing thing happened last week, y'all. I got an e-mail with the subject \"Advertising Inquiry,\" in which a nice person from Frugal Dad expressed an interest in buying ad space on my sidebar for a 160x300 widget (oh look, over on the left--THERE IT IS!). I had been disgruntled with AdBrite for a while (they're not a bad company or anything, in fact they've always been very good to me and are, in my experience, the most flexible of the ad companies to deal with in that you don't have to be HUGE or claw your way up a long waiting list to work with them) due to some of the ad content and the way they kept bugging out people's antiviral software (mine included). Again, it's TOTALLY NOT ADBRITE'S FAULT I was unhappy, it wasn't them, it was me: I didn't like having random ads whose products I may or may not hate popping up and while I could have cracked down and restricted things to what I personally approved, I also wasn't thrilled with the ratio of income-generated-by-ads to headaches-generated-by-ads\u00a0in general.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was going to try BlogHer ads, but then when they approved me off the waiting list I was busy with life and working at a job that didn't feature computer access, so filling out the paperwork kind of got back-burnered and I lost my spot. BUMMER!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then came the e-mail from the Frugal Dad folks asking about my rates for a one-year ad placement. I asked them what size/type of ad and whether they had any URLs they could send me of examples, and proceeded to Google the HELL out of \"blog ad space rates\" and \"ad rates by blog traffic\" and such. They thought about it for a few days and kindly put me out of my misery by sending a URL and naming their own price, which...WELL OH MY GOODNESS. I'm sure it'd be nothing to the likes of The Big Dogs in Blogging, but the figure they tossed out was A Lot of Money by MFA Standards, and between that and the fact that the ad itself is quite unobjectionable (and having checked Frugal Dad out, it even seems like a pretty cool site that I'll use now that I know about it), I happily accepted. SO! Just like that, I apparently now sell ad space.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Do any of you have any interest in buying ad space here? I can send you my rates if you are, but I'm also willing to entertain any and all quasi-reasonable alternate offers (pretty much the only way I'll say no is if your ad button is a picture of your unwashed taint or you want me to design and write the HTML for your ad that you only want to send me a coupon code for by way of payment). If you have an Etsy shop that features products I might enjoy and want to work out a barter, or pay in holiday gift-cards to merchants you don't love but that I don't mind patronizing, I'm even down with that.

{"date": "January 19, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Black bears, y'all. Remember that fight Hotter and I had back in the The Summer of Surgimacallititis (kind of like The Summer of Love, except instead of peace, love, and hippies there were ER trips, rampant assholery, and surgical staples) where he basically pooh-poohed my fears? Black bears have become kind of a standing joke/sore subject in our household: we'll see one in a zoo/nature preserve and I'll point out on the information plaque that TECHNICALLY our state is within their natural habitat range, or there'll be a random noise in the woods behind our house and Hotter'll go \"it's probably a black bear--HOLD ONTO YOUR FACE!\" Har. Aaaaanyway, this morning as I was getting ready for work I noticed the most recent edition of the small-town free newspaper that comes with the junk mail, and right there on the cover? WAS A PICTURE OF A BLACK BEAR WITH AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW ONE TRIED TO EAT A DEER HUNTER AND SIGHTINGS ARE ON THE RISE! Of course I woke Hotter up to crow over this. \"Awww look at him,\" Hotter said, squinting at the picture of the bear (it wasn't the one that menaced the hunter, which he shot, it was just a stock-type photo of one sitting in a tree), \"they're like Labradors that climb trees!\" The bear in the picture did look kind of cute. Except that probably that is how they look when they're thinking about eating someone's face.\r\n* \u00a0 I...think I may have lost a friend over the rabbits. Yes, the rabbits. Said friend has rabbits. WE have recently acquired rabbits. But we view and treat our rabbits differently from how this friend views and treats HER rabbits and therein, apparently, lies the crux. There are many schools of thought on keeping rabbits, ranging from \"tastes like chicken\" and \"these are our pets but their babies are dinner\" all the way on up through \"that's the rabbits' room\" and \"of course we don't CAGE them, we just rabbit-proof our ENTIRE HOUSE because OMG THEY ARE LIKE KITTENS THAT HOP.\" I used to have horses, and horse people tend to run toward The Crazy (with occasional super-cool exception--of course I didn't mean YOU if YOU have a horse!), but rabbit people, as it turns out?\u00a0Rabbit people are also disproportionately touched by The Crazy\u00a0(although if YOU have a rabbit then of course I didn't mean YOU; YOUR rabbit is tasty/adorable/pick one). Maybe it is just something about animals that eat hay?\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Worms: does anyone know, off the top of their head, whether you can start a worm bin with just regular old worms from the dirt that you find when you're digging in your garden? If so, I may try and start one when I begin preparing beds outside. If not, though, well. I'm not paying for a bunch of damn worms.\r\n* \u00a0 Finally, and this is totally random, because apparently even though Casa MFA is zoned Agricultural and plenty of people in similar neighborhoods in this very county DO have critters, if your neighbors/cyberstalkers are dicks there are ways of keeping you from pursuing happiness/low-impact sustainable eating by having any animal you want and that DASHED MY HOPES so I'm just saying: man I wish we could have goats here. Sigh.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://ghosttownfarm.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/update/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/updates-from-the-animal-kingdom.html", "title": "updates from the animal kingdom"},

Maybe you don't, since I didn't mention it really except on the Twitter\u00a0and on here kind of in passing. I tripped while out walking at night, and fell hard onto my hands and knees on a sidewalk. My running gloves saved my palms, but my sweatpants didn't do much to protect my knees, and it sucked. There was so much blood and general swelling that I couldn't really tell what was what, but nothing was going numb and the pain wasn't unbearable so I just kind of ignored it at the time. A few days afterward I lightly brushed the left knee against the doorframe of the minivan while loading children and felt like I'd been smashed in the leg with a sledgehammer, and it swelled impressively, but...well. I mean, it sucked, but it wasn't THAT BAD.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It occurs to me here that perhaps my sense of \"that bad\" is distorted by my terrifying medical history.\r\nFigure One: 'S jus a flesh wound!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Aaaanyway, so now, a couple of weeks later, the blood and most of the swelling is gone and the skin is starting to heal, but it occurs to me that perhaps I ought to have gone for an x-ray when it happened after all, because there is a large, hard lump on the left side, and when I absentmindedly went to kneel in the bathtub to inspect a slow drain I saw stars and almost threw up. It still doesn't hurt when I walk, so I don't think it needs a cast or pin or anything, but...\r\nFigure Two: Sorry about the leg-hair, but really, if *you* can shave that you're a better man than I.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So uh, yeah. Pretty sure I broke my effing leg. Question is, WILL it heal okay?

Since Bonnie poked me with the stick of Are-You-Deadness I thought I'd pop in and wave feebly.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This holiday was not the best one, but it's OVER (the younger MFA Children, in a display of what I would ordinarily call poor upbringing except they're MINE and therefore I am stumped, spent much of Christmas morning talking about how much more generous Santa is at CATHERINE's house, how many more presents she gives them, how much fancier the wrapping is there and taller the tree and OMFG by the time The XY came to collect them an hour and a half late I was MORE than ready to see the back of them). I've also been poorly; dental woes tend to give me migraines and I've had a truly wretched one for the past couple of days, I suppose from the filling I lost (my dentist's office was closed today, although so was PseudoCorp so Hotter and I at least got to sleep late). At first I was afraid I was getting sicker, because my migraine aura consists mostly of horrible pain in my left ear, which is also the one that always gets infected, but no, it's \"just\" the migraine. Blehhh. On a positive note, while I wasn't thrilled to have to spend Christmas Eve at Urgent Care, the doctor I saw felt badly enough about the mistake that she comped me the second bottle of Levaquin, so at least that wasn't too expensive and I didn't miss a dose or anything (I don't like to take antibiotics, but if they're truly necessary then by Godiva I'm going to take the full course because resistant bugs are no fucking joke).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Other than that, the final book of a series I've been reading since I was NINE came out, so uh, I'm kind of busy :) I hope all of you had a nice holiday.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/12/im-not-dead-just-headachey-and-peevish.html", "title": "I'm not dead, just headachey and peevish"},

Unfortunately, as always, the presence of unfriendly eyeballs reading puts a damper on my saying anything any more specific.

A truly touching and special moment occurred between me and my boys and the innernet! I was sitting at the table playing Words With Friends and keeping the littles company while they cut a whitepages phonebook into spaghetti-strips for the worm box, and Big Child came and hung over my shoulder trying to come up with a word for me. Middly and Little Child got up, too, and wanted to see the board, so we all had a look.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Since the game is called Words With Friends, the person you are playing with is your friend, right,\" asked Big Child, The Literal. I took a breath to say that I often play random strangers because I am addicted to Words With Friends a big fat slut on the innernet, just ask Daddy everyone's friend but then noticed that yes, actually my opponent was someone I \"met\" online as a blog reader years and years ago, am now Facespace friends with, and who my kids have an awareness of and HEYYYY! \"Yep, that's _______,\" I said. \"You know your favorite jammies, Little Child, and your snow boots, Middly?

It is made up of our friends who send us stickers and hand-me-downs, homemade hand-balm that soothes eczema and birthday cards, gift cards that have fed us celebratory dinners and good knock-knock jokes, and then there are The Perverts.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Perverts are why Big Child wasn't allowed to subscribe to Lego Universe, even if he used his birthday money from the XY's family (because the subscription version had a chat feature, which means The Perverts could get at you!). They're also to blame for people not being allowed to link their DSis and Xboxes and Wiis to the (encrypted, password-protected) wireless router. \"What do The Perverts DO, Mommy? I wouldn't give anyone our address or anything! They can't like, reach through the innernet and get me!\" They're perverts, I say. They are clever and nasty and good at manipulating kids, and I am not taking any chances with them. When you're eighteen and you get your own innernet you'll see what I mean. The MFA Children seem to think The Perverts are perhaps mythical figures Hotter and I have made up to avoid sharing the innernet or something, but they largely accept it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Heeeey, wait.

Apparently there's going to be another banquet on Friday, too (and one on Saturday that I'll have to miss due to it conflicting with Hotter's and my second beekeeping class, which is the last in-class lesson) (there's an outdoor session TBA that'll involve suiting up and messing with some bees during the nectar flow, but we don't know yet when that'll be because weather factors in--probably in April sometime).

Finally I decided it was stupid to let my pride get in the way of my having the tools I needed to be productive tomorrow and marched in there. \"Wow, look at you,\" said the guard on duty, grinning. \"Yep,\" I said, \"now my secret is out. My second job is at Chippendales--you oughta see me spin the bowtie!\" And we had a good laugh and then I went and got my computer.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/02/the-one-with-the-yella-sweetener.html", "title": "the one with the yella sweetener"},

When I woke at 6 a.m. unable to breathe and then had to boil and cool water for my neti pot (stupid amoebas ruin everything!), which left me Awake For The Day, I would have paid good money to not have to make effing gingerbread houses. I took some decongestants, and drank some caffeine, and crawled back into bed to let it all kick in while the children ran roughshod over Hotter. He was trying desperately to get everyone medicated for minimal assholery (the mentally ill dog tranqed, the older boys pilled) and keep them quiet, but it sounded like a losing battle. Hotter's shushings and the boys' shrieks were like yodelers on opposite mountaintops out there, interspersed with the pre-tranq morning stylings of a whining Bumpus-hound.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I heard Hotter reach the end of his rope with the human miscreants. \"THAT IS IT.

{"date": "February 18, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I think maybe nineteen hours is too long a work-day, because yesterday I was a hot mess (thank you to everyone who did the virtual equivalent of petting my head and fetching tissues when I had my big emo hissy-fit yesterday on the Twitter). I saw the kids for less than an hour all week long and then realized that I was already at work and would be working until 2:30 this morning and wouldn't see them before they left for an Away Weekend and...lost it. Like, ugly cry in the ladies' room at work lost it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And that was around nine in the morning, so my day had barely begun and I got to spend the WHOLE THING with the post-ugly-cry achyface.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0A couple of you have asked just what is the deal with the dental work and the more-than-the-bluebook-value-of-the-minivan...I guess people were picturing crowns or something? But no, to be clear, all of that is just to make Hotter's mouth SAFE, not PRETTY. It's things like removing the root of a tooth that is broken off below the gumline, and filling giant holes...just things my dentist (who I trust) has said are serious infection risks (and yeah, in someone who is immunnosuppressed dental infections can get really ugly, really fast, so...). Mind you, he ALSO \"needs\" four crowns on front teeth that are disintegrating, but we're not even considering trying to do that, because then the cost of his dental work would be coming up on half of what I made last YEAR and there is just no way. So no, I am not killing myself to make my husband have a pretty smile, I am killing myself to keep him ALIVE and therefore it's kind of non-negotiable. And yes, Hotter brushes and flosses and all of that good stuff. But the \"throwing up thirty+ times per day\" thing he did for months prior to his transplants due to gastroparesis (AND the smoking...*grumble*) just wrecked his teeth (the dentist says he actually started out with excellent teeth and that they're very strong--bad as his mouth is, it apparently isn't NEARLY as bad as what they were picturing and they told me \"if it'd been you we'd be pulling 'em all\"). We've been ignoring Hotter's dental situation because there wasn't anything we could do about it anyway, but now that I'm actually making decent money, if I'm willing to really bust my ass and we keep on living like we did before when it was kind of up in the air whether there'd be enough for everyone to eat at times we can at least address the very most dangerous stuff going on in Hotter's mouth, and given how badly things could go if we did NOT, that is the plan. We're tackling Hotter's mouth in \"quadrants\" and Phase One is scheduled for 3/20, so I've got until then to raise about $500 over and above our usual living expenses. Oooof.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And yes, I am not proud to admit it, but I *did* get kind of bitter about this. I let myself spend an afternoon sulking because I had plans to buy some soil and really go nuts on the Spring garden, and get myself a cute new purse (nothing designer, just a $35 jobbie I fell in love with on Etsy) (isn't that gorgeous?), and get Little Child a new bed (at six he still fits in his toddler bed so that is what he sleeps in, but he is FINALLY pushing the weight limit for the thing and really ought to have a twin). Plus? I'm tired, y'all. It would be great to be able to cut back to just the day-job at PseudoCorp and Fairy Sweatshop Job (which I can do at home while I help people with their homework), and have dinner with my family every night, and be there to tuck my kids in at bedtime. I never sank so low as to get resentful or anything, because if you'd told me ten years ago that I'd be where I am today I would still marry Hotter in a New York minute; because of him I can finally say that someone in my life (who I didn't give birth to) truly loves me like in the movies, and that is worth everything and then some. But bitter? Yeah, for that afternoon I rocked bitter.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't a good look, so I put it back on the rack.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not bitter (anymore) but oh my goodness, I am tired.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.etsy.com/listing/92252077/pink-and-orange-floral-print-reversible"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/02/tired.html", "title": "tired"},

WHOO TITS!\r\n* \u00a0 Today I got some potentially very-good news at work. I can't really say what without getting into a long, involved, and potentially identifying story, but it gives me some hope of possibly being hired on full-time in the new year. This is particularly good in light of my stupid health insurance premium going up by sixty bucks per a letter I got in the mail yesterday (*grumble*).\r\n* \u00a0 Today I got a call from our Mennonite butcher friend; a hunter donated a deer to the MFAmily (we still had to pay the processing fee, which this being a smallish deer worked out to something like $2.63/lb. for the meat, but we love venison and it's organic and very lean, which means that Hotter can eat it, too) (he can't really eat beef at all because it has a super-negative effect on his GI motility). I got to leave work early because there was NOBODY there, which gave me time to pick up the meat. We had Sloppy Does for dinner and they were delicious!\r\n* \u00a0 Since I was already all the way out in East Jesus (is that just something my family used to say? It means kind of the same thing as \"BFE\"), I also picked up some Mennonite-made fruit jellies they sell out there. The black raspberry is particularly delicious!\r\n* \u00a0 I asked the butcher whether he had any bones for the dogs, and he said \"if you wanna go through the barrels out back you're welcome to take as much as you want, but I don't think you wanna do that.\" They were unwilling to part with a garbage bag (the local Mennonites here are super-cheap; I'd feel bad making that kind of a generalization except that the pastor of their church, who is a friend, was the first person to tell me so and he's TOTALLY right) (and it's understandable I guess, because probably if they gave up a garbage bag to everyone who asked for one for dog bones it'd add up), but I had a paper grocery bag and a soda crate in the MFA Minivan, so I pinned up my hair, tucked my scarf out of the way, and pulled a bagful of very meaty bones out of the heap (they were very fresh and odorless; really not that gross although ten years ago I wouldn't even touch raw beef or poultry) (I guess I've changed a lot since I now butcher poultry bare-handed and, evidently, go through slaughterhouse scrap barrels without a second thought) then used the soda-crate to keep them off the carpet inside the MFA Minivan. The dogs are in HEAVEN!\r\nFigure One: I think Isis looks kinda dangerous in this picture!

Sometimes it's because I'm more aware than usual of unfriendly eyeballs reading (if you're not the known sociopath I refer to as Stalky then that is at least 95% NOT about you so RELAX, non-threatening unfriendly people of Earth!), sometimes it's because I'm trying not to wallow in the negative, sometimes it's because I have a wretched headache...and sometimes it's all of the above.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Today it's all of the above. I had a dream last night about CATHERINE! reading my blog, money woes are worse than usual lately, and I had to instruct Hotter this morning to shove my nightguard in my mouth afterward if he's going to sex me into a coma in the future (heh).\r\n* \u00a0 Am I worried about CATHERINE! reading my blog? Not really. I don't want to hurt her feelings, because she seems like a nice person (although I am still aggravated with her when I think about that damn ear candle...be that as it may if medical ignorance is someone's worst sin they're doing aight in my book so if she's reading this I hope she doesn't take that personally) (note that I didn't say \"medical ignorance and poor taste in men:\" while the XY would be an extraordinarily poor informed choice in a man, he is positively gifted at making himself out to be the lovably bumbling victim of a series of unfortunate events rather than the damnably lucky bastard who only ever pays for 5% of his--potentially at least partly unwitting given that his mother is a real disaster of a human being--crimes against humanity), and I would hope she'd have the levity to take my impression of her with a huuuuge grain of salt given that it is largely based on the second-hand impression three inherently unreliable sources I gave birth to have passed on in the information they occasionally volunteer about her. Any negative feelings I have toward her over anything OTHER than the ear candle (and her purported inability to enforce a civilized bedtime, although it's not really her fault my ex made of habit of dumping three children who aren't hers and who she probably really wants to like her on her until I put the kibosh on that) are largely not her fault. I hate the fact that the XY will potentially marry her and have access to her funds to make my life difficult in court, but ultimately if that comes to pass it'll eventually suck more for her (when it finally dawns on her that she's been had to the tune of thousands by a conman) than it will for me (I hate court and can't afford it, but I'm not genuinely concerned that the XY would stand a chance in hell of prevailing on matters of custody and that's what I care about most--money is just money and will always suck for me due to student loans, debts the XY ran up in my name, and the medical bills everyone I love is prone to). If anything I feel sorry for her, and maybe that in and of itself would piss her off, but it's the honest truth and no more or less than I'd tell her to her face if she asked me directly. I think if we got trapped in an elevator, independent of the XY's existence in both our lives, we'd probably emerge fast friends. I hope the XY really HAS changed since our divorce, mostly for my kids' sake but also for hers (although I'm extremely skeptical). The worst thing that might come of her reading my blog is the XY getting pissed at me for having it, which would be nothing new (he hated my blogging during our marriage) and not likely of any consequence to me, so no, I'm not worried about it.

I've gotten to where I'm pretty happy with who I am, and while I blog for a specific audience (namely the online community of friends I've come to think of as an extended family of sorts, and their friends, and pretty much any like-minded individual who might be able to relate to any part of my somewhat unusual life and want to become my friend) that not everyone is a part of, everyone is welcome to come here and read about my life.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I blog and comment on other people's blogs pseudonymously, which means that I always use \"MFA Mama\" as a signature but don't connect MFA Mama with the \"_______ ________\" you know and love (or loathe). I don't name my hometown (or even my state). I don't say what kind of car I drive. I don't post pictures of myself (unless I am wearing a mask or something), or my children, or my home (you might see the edge of some brick or siding, but you won't see my house).\u00a0This is not because I am ashamed of anything I write here, but rather because while I love the innernet, it is like offline society in that it has its crazies, and I don't want someone showing up at my front door with an (ideally metaphorical, because geez) axe to grind because of something they read on my blog.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then there's work.\u00a0I'd prefer that employers make decisions about me as an employee based on my resume, comportment in a professional setting, and job performance, not on what I write in my own time on my personal blog. That's not the same thing as this blog being a secret. If I work for you, you're as welcome as the next person to read this for entertainment value; if you're here because you're worried that I'm a liability, though, not because you enjoy my writing, I can save you a lot of unnecessary reading by saying that if I'm writing about my job it's ONLY in the context of my own personal life (i.e. what I ate for lunch or how much it sucked that I had a wardrobe malfunction). I give my various employers non-identifying pseudonyms so that readers can tell them apart, but I do NOT name them, go into identifying detail about their locations, products, or logos, or discuss any non-public information I am party to as a worker.\u00a0I don't blog while I'm AT work (unless it's from my phone, on my lunch while I am off the clock), I don't blog from work computers, and\u00a0I NEVER post pictures of co-workers, buildings I work in, or products I work with or on.\u00a0I may mention that someone I work with is an amazing person, or that they are really unpleasant to me, but if I do then I do it in such a way that their own mother wouldn't recognize them based on anything I've written.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0All of that said, while I don't think I say anything on here that I shouldn't, just like random people on the innernets, people (like you!) who know me offline (or even work with me) might have a problem with something I write, either because they just disagree with me on an issue I write about or because they feel I've said something inaccurate or unfair about them/our common employer. If it's the former, we may have to agree to disagree. If it's the latter, consider that a)\u00a0nobody you know is likely to read this and recognize you unless you point them toward it, and b) even if you or someone else \"see\" you in something I've written, it may not actually be about you (I've written things on here before and had a person THINK I was talking about them when actually I wasn't...when you take the kind of pains I take to be vague you sometimes end up writing the prose equivalent of a Rorshach print). That said, if you're absolutely certain I wrote about you and it bothers you (and you are NOT my ex-husband or the known sociopath I refer to on here as \"Stalky,\" in which case you may blow your gripes out your respective arses), then speak up! My e-mail address is on the \"About\" page, and that's how I prefer to discuss Things Blog-related. If you want to discuss it \"off-record\" then that's okay, too. Call me if you have my phone number, or just ask me to speak with you privately (unless I am on the clock and need to be working). I've taken things down out of respect for people's feelings before, and I'm not an unreasonable or unfeeling person.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Of course, you CAN also fly off the handle and go the \"tattling\" route. Since my ex already hates me about as much as is humanly possible and doesn't have the money to sue me anymore, and I don't have any living family who would care about my blog and aren't already aware of it, that leaves my employers. If you don't work for them and you want to run your mouth about someone who does and is a good worker, they probably won't care. If you DO also work for them, this probably STILL won't have the desired effect, and may even make YOU look worse than it makes ME look. I don't blog about most people; to be noteworthy you either have to be great or terrible. People rarely have a problem with praise, so let's say you work with me and you're terrible. You go on my blog and read my account of someone being utterly horrid to me, decide I meant you, get upset, and take it up with our common employer. They will most likely either brush you off (because, really? You kids settle this, the growups are busy!) or read my blog, which just tells them that a) since I don't identify anyone or anything having to do with work, you can't tell the difference between something that hurts your own personal feelings and something that ought to affect my ability to earn a living and b) you're nasty enough to co-workers that I may have actually been talking about you. MAYBE (IF they read far enough) they think a little less of me when they read that I am in default on my student loans and have a potty-mouth. MAYBE. But...that's pretty much it, aside from my netting some additional ad revenue, since page-views from unfriendly eyeballs pay just as much as page-views from well-meaning eyeballs. And that's if they even bother reading. I once had occasion to discuss my blog with one of my employers, because a co-worker found it (I suspect through nosiness, not Googling, although I don't know or really care) and had a problem with something I said on here but evidently didn't want to take it up with me personally (although apparently that is what The Powers That Be ultimately suggested they do). Due to the emotionally-charged (on the part of the other party) nature of that eventual...let's be generous and call it a conversation rather than a vitriolic tirade I patiently listened to (after which I did, in fact, apologize for the party in question being upset and offer to take down anything that upset them)...I went of my own volition to the source of my paychecks and said \"hey, I have a personal website where I discuss my life, my family, my pets, and my opinions on products with which we are in no way affiliated, and someone read that I didn't enjoy their treatment of me and is upset. I don't name names, mine or anyone else's, and I'm pretty careful what I say on there, but they seemed to feel I deserved firing...would you like the URL?\" Their answer was something along the lines of \"That sounds more like a personality conflict, which we don't like to get involved in as a general rule. I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with one because they are never fun but no, of course you are not fired, you are a good employee. As far as the website...uh, no offense, but we don't really care about your blog.\"\u00a0\r\nFigure One: Probably not an appropriate gift for Boss's Day, but it doesn't mean I wasn't tempted!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom line, this isn't 2004: companies know that people have personal blogs and use social media, and as long as they aren't discussed in a manner that negatively impacts their bottom line they don't really care.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What if you aren't great OR terrible, and I've never written about you or even anyone who remotely resembles you, or maybe you ARE great or terrible but I haven't written about you yet, and you're just WORRIED that I'm going to write about you? That's easy. Ask me not to, and I'll never mention you, by a pseudonym or no. You don't have to be uncomfortable around me or fear my bloggy wrath (yes, even if you're terrible--I am perfectly capable of just telling my spouse what an asshole you are and leaving it off the innernet like a grownup). Chances are I'm not nearly as popular and widely-read as you might fear if you think you're on my bad side anyway.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Maybe you just happened upon this website kind of by accident, succumbed to curiousity, and read something you wish you hadn't. Maybe you read one of the posts where I've reviewed sex toys and you don't want to think of me in a sexual context because I am a chubby, frumpy mom and you are turned off by women/just the dental hygienist who works on my teeth twice a year/against sex toys for religious reasons. Maybe I talked about a traumatic experience I had that is similar to one you had, and it's something you are less open about than I am and never, ever want to talk about. The beauty of my putting it all out here the way I do (for both of us) is that I can't necessarily tell you're reading (sure, I have Sitemeter and can see if someone in my hometown uses a Mac to spend six hours reading everything I've ever written about my relationship with my husband, but lots of people use Macs in my hometown). If you don't mention it, I won't even know, and I'm not any more likely to just bust out with \"so have you TRIED the vibrator that hooks up to your iPod because WOW!\" or \"have you ever been beaten by a domestic partner?\" in casual conversation than I was before you read my blog, even if you do cop to it, because that would be weird. So you don't have to avoid me, or give me the suspicious side-eye every time we meet.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What if you found this blog, and you think you know me offline, and I've never written about you, or have but only to say how fabulous you are, and you enjoy my writing and look forward to each new post but don't know if I know that YOU know? Well, then you don't have to say anything to me about THAT either, but I kind of wish you would so that we can be friends and I can send you hilarious e-mails about some of the things I have too much discretion to discuss publicly. Or, you know, we could have a cup of coffee and talk in person about stuff like backyard chickens and baking with coconut oil. It probably wouldn't be very rewarding, because I'm even lamer in person than I am on the innernet, but I'm game if you are :)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.zazzle.com/no_one_cares_about_your_stupid_blog_tshirt-235373471003461648"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/so-you-think-you-know-me.html", "title": "so you think you know me"},

Someone who knows me offline just seems to be a little too interested in monitoring the seemliness of my online life, and as those of y'all who already follow me on the Twitter know I am NOT A LADY on there. All of the stuff that's too racy for the blog and my vilest, most spontaneous profanity born of check-engine lights and stubbed toes goes on the Twitter, and I didn't want to have to change the whole way I use the platform just because one person who I didn't even marry or give birth to thinks it's shameful and wants to make an issue of it. I also kind of like the idea of having a place (besides the facespace, which I reserve for people I either know in \"real life\" or have known online for ages and ages) where I can interact with Blogland without fear of Stalky or my ex's unfriendly eyeballs, so I may leave the Twitter locked pretty much indefinitely, but here is the thing: if you want to follow me on there, and have been on the Twitter for more than a week and aren't trying to sell me herbal remedies to lengthen my penis or a barely-legal Russian bride all you have to do is send a follow-request.

I am bummed about that, because this seems to be the start of a trend, according to my boss at Temp Agency #2. Of course, it's the off-season for such ventures.\r\n* \u00a0 New Job #3, which we'll call Fairy Sweatshop Job, is moving right along. It suits my ADD nicely to have something I can sit down and do a few minutes of, then leave and come back to. Fairy Sweatshop Job is like eating a very sparkly elephant. At my own dining room table! I think it's a good fit for me for now and it's a real relief to have fallen into this with NWWJ kind of up in the air. It certainly won't pay my bills if something happens to my primary job, but it's a flexible something I can sit and do when I am worried to the point of needing something to do with my hands that'll actually help dig us out one spangled widgit at a time.\r\n* \u00a0 Meanwhile, back at the ranch, PseudoCorp is fabulous. My new boss is so kind to me that I hardly know how to handle it. My previous job at PseudoCorp was...well. There was nothing wrong with it (aside from an unpleasant co-worker) but if the minivan broke down or I was sick and couldn't be at the office, I didn't think about it beyond calling in. With the new job I think about it off the clock, quite a bit, and I am getting to brush up on skills I'd almost forgot I have. This job is so awesome that I really wish I could tell you what an amazing thing they have arranged for me to do in the course of my duties, but when one gets an opportunity one would NEVER ordinarily have, one that few people even at the corporation itself have enjoyed, the chance to do something that, work-project payoff aside, will be an opening line at cocktail parties for the rest of my life...well.

Field mice with a taste for Mennonite-ground whole wheat flour, which pisses me right on off.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So far I've caught two in snap-traps (I originally caught one of those in the Havahart, which has a faulty spring so that when I picked up the trap to take the mouse outside it JUMPED ON MY GLASSES AND RAN ACROSS MY HEAD, at which point I said fuck it, bring on the cruelty and the killing, because some things just WILL NOT STAND) this winter. The one that seems to live inside the kitchen stove, though, is a wily little fuck. It's sprung a snap-trap and licked it clean of peanut butter, and feasted on celery (which Hotter inexplicably left on the stove claiming that it was \"bait,\" only what the fuck kind of mouse passes up peanut butter for celery? Is the mouse on a diet?). It will sit somewhere in the inner workings of the stove (how? I do not know. Of course it doesn't make any sense that a mouse would live inside a freaking stove, that's just STUPID, but it wasn't MY idea and I've seen it run into the rear burner-vent, for fuck's sake) and gnaw loudly at something, and when you walk into the kitchen and stomp around and turn the light on it will pause, probably to laugh evilly under its tiny breath, and go back to gnawing.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I never thought I'd say this, but it may be time for glue. Because I'm not willing to go with anything toxic (that's cruel, plus then the afflicted creatures die in your walls and stink) and clearly humane and not-so-humane traps are not up to the task of dispatching this particular mouse. I agreed to give the snap-traps one more night, and if they come up empty-jawed I am buying a glue-trap tomorrow on my way home from work.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter already isn't speaking to me over that. Hell, I'm not sure I'm speaking to me over that! But it is what it is and when it comes to things effing with my family's food and spreading germs I have a heart that is shaped increasingly like an axe.\r\n\u00a0\r\nII. Mic-key\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Last night, after an epic twenty-minute argument over checking the balance in the balloon, I finally decided six months of leaving the thing in \"just in case\" was more than enough and removed Little Child's mic-key button. For the first time since he was seven weeks old my kid is tube-free. Now everyone go and knock on some wood that he stays healthy for the rest of the cold and flu season and let's not celebrate it too loudly! We don't want to anger the gods.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.havahart.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousetrap#Glue_traps", "http://www.mic-key.com/mic-keystar.aspx"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/mfa-mama-mickey-slayer-and-little-child-mic-key-slayer-.html", "title": "MFA Mama, Mickey-slayer (and Little Child, mic-key slayer).

{"date": "February  9, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So I worked from home today because a) everyone except for Hotter had dental appointments and b) my boss is awesome and gets that it's silly for me to come in for half a day when I can spend more hours working and save fuel costs/emissions/travel time by working from home on a day like today. Which was great and terrible. I mean, don't get me wrong it was mostly great; I got a lot done (I think I'm actually MORE productive when I work from home because I'm so honored that PseudoCorp trusts me like that with company assets and self-policing of time and non-asleepness and the like) and it was awesome to save the time and gas and whatnot, but I think part of why I hated teaching so much was that I did it from home, and when you work from home people just naturally have a hard time leaving you the hell alone. Aaaanyway, dental appointments: nobody had cavities. WHOO!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I've been very worried for a long time about Hotter's teeth. They're awful. He threw up nonstop for months before getting his transplants and smoked for over twenty years and drank real sugar in his coffee until I introduced him to Splenda and OH MY GOD Y'ALL. Any one of those things plus lack of dental coverage would be bad, but all of them together plus a suppressed immune system is just an ER trip full of judgment and avoidable danger waiting to happen. It's been bugging me more lately than usual; I have real guilt about me and the boys trotting off to the dentist, even though my dental insurance costs no more than paying out of pocket for two cleanings per year would and the boys are covered through their father. Anyway, I asked my dentist today what he thought I ought to do about this given that the local dental college has really long waits, takes all day, and still costs...he asked a few questions about Hotter's teeth and health and said \"well I won't lie, he might be better off just having them all taken out.\" I said I'd raised the possibility and Hotter hadn't been a fan. \"Well, what could you afford right now?\" I said anything over a hundred dollars would really be pushing it. \"Then I will see him for a hundred bucks. We'll give him a good deep cleaning, take some x-rays, and I'll tell you what I think as far as whether anything is about to cause trouble,\" my dentist said. \"That way if nothing else, he's in my system as a patient and you can call me if something godawful happens on a weekend or something.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I have said it before, but it bears repeating: my dentist is good people.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/02/the-one-where-i-continue-to-huge-puffy-heart-my-dentist.html", "title": "the one where I continue to HUGE PUFFY HEART my dentist"},
{"date": "November 23, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Some people have asked if I'm going to use the blog to try and fundraise for the MFA Minivan's repairs, or rather suggested that I do so, but I'm really not comfortable doing that. See, it's taken everything we had saved and left us in a bad place vis a vie December's rent, but I am well aware that it could be much worse. This could have happened during a time (and there have been many in the past year) when we had NOTHING put aside for emergencies, or were already late on the rent AND had nothing put aside. I'm not saying we're going to be okay, because as of right now I don't really see how that's going to end up being the case, but hell, EVERYBODY is struggling right now. It's true that I asked for help before, when Isis was so sick, and y'all saved her life, but as of right now our situation isn't a matter of life and death for anyone, human or canine, and I don't want to abuse the goodwill of my readers by sticking out a tin cup every time life's not going my way. If any of you are just filthy rich and aching to help us out I won't turn it down (while there is no \"donate\" button, the tip jar on the upper right sidebar works the same way), but I don't want to ask y'all for a handout, either, because I know most of you aren't any better off than we are.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I run ads on the blog, in the hope that someday they'll at least cover the hosting fees, and do the occasional well-labeled sponsored post (look for one in the nearish future), and I do have the \"tip jar\" up, but I have a very small readership (compared to a lot of blogs) and will probably never be a \"big-name\" blogger, and I'm okay with that. Because I don't blog for money. I've said it before, cheesy or no, and I'll even say it again today: y'all are like the extended family I don't have offline. You've seen me through good times and bad. You've virtually been a fly on the wall at my wedding and held my hand through some pretty heavy shit. You make me laugh when I'm sitting in hospital waiting rooms. You send me hand-me-downs and give me tips on household matters and advice when I ask for it (and sometimes when I don't, heh). You've bailed me out and kicked me when I'm down (well, maybe not YOU, but Stalky, and as I've also said, she's like family too, because my family of origin has some first-class creepers in it that put even HER to shame). And, with the exception of Stalky, I don't want to do anything to risk alienating y'all or driving you away.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Nobody has said anything untoward in the comments, but because Thanksgiving is coming up and Stalky likes to pop up around the holidays (which seem to fan the flames of mental illness almost universally, not just in her), and because I'm feeling pretty \"lowly worm,\" as my friend k would say, I've turned comment moderation back on for a bit. It probably doesn't help that I'm coming down with something, which isn't all that surprising given the stress of the past couple of days, weeks...hell, the past month has been one big kick in the teeth. Given how I feel I'm not sure if I'll even be up for it, but tomorrow is Thanksgiving and even if the effing van DID, in the end, cost exactly as much as our rent to get rolling again (and it still needs an alignment, and a new valve cover gasket, both of which will have to wait, and an inspection...yes, MFA Mechanic agreed to do that for free but when I went to collect the van he said he couldn't enjoy the holiday if the effing thing didn't pass knowing that I'm all tapped out, and I probably couldn't either, so I'm taking it back for that on Friday) (he did say, at least, that he had given it a once-over and hadn't seen anything obvious that would cause it to fail, although he said the slight shimmy in the front end could either be due to it needing an alignment or there being something up, possibly with the tires, that would preclude its' passing), I want to try and make it a good one. If the van flunks the inspection I'll be out of ideas on how to keep my family together, and it won't be a matter of spending the rent money to fix it, it'll be a matter of not having any more money to spend even if it IS robbing Peter to pay Paul, so I really want to have a nice day with Hotter and the boys. I don't want to take a chance on Stalky posting anything in my comments that'll get in the way of that; it might be the ONLY thing about the rest of this year I CAN control and therefore I will.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I hope all of you have a wonderful holiday, filled with minimal family drama, all of your favorite foods, and stretchy waistbands. Or at the very least, less fear and uncertainty than we've got going on over here.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://twoadultsonebrownbaby.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/a-word-on-cashflow-and-comments.html", "title": "a word on cashflow and comments"},
{"date": "November 24, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I don't have anything profound to say, but wanted to let y'all know that I managed to drag myself out of my doldrums and get my thankful on in time to bake, cook, and otherwise prepare a wonderful holiday dinner that we all enjoyed a lot. We had our homegrown turkey (she was very slightly tougher than a storebought bird, as we let her roam freely instead of confining her for the sake of tenderness, but moist and with an excellent flavor), ham, mashed potatoes, baked yams with Shebangarang, stuffing, fresh-baked rolls, green brean casserole, homemade cranberry sauce, and I baked two kinds of pie (pumpkin and pecan) (I made the pecan one with Agave nectar instead of corn syrup, which I wholeheartedly recommend as a healthier and equally delicious alternative). It was delicious, and I ate way too much (seriously, I've been on a strict diet the past few weeks and not used to large portions or rich foods...both at once nearly made me ill). Big Child was, as always, an appreciative audience for Hotter's and my culinary performance, Middly didn't cry at the table (which is always a victory with that kid), and Little Child was insanely picky with what he'd eat of the dinner but somehow managed TWO slices of pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top. The dogs enjoyed some meat scraps, having had their real Thanksgiving on Tuesday when I killed the turkey (Isis ate the head, neck, and feet while Bumpus got the heart, liver, and intestines). I'm sure the dread of what the future holds will kick back in at some point, but right now I'm still in a tryptophan haze and nearly through with the Hunger Games trilogy (SO GOOD), so I'm going to get back to that. I just wanted y'all to know that we made the holiday a good one and I'm thankful as always for my wonderful friends inside the computer, who do things like leave me wall posts on the facespace saying \"pecker UP!\" and make me giggle no matter what is going on. Y'all are the best! xox\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/happy-thanksgiving.html", "title": "happy Thanksgiving"},

I asked her advice on Something Unbloggable and she had some useful feedback for me.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I have a birthday coming up. I will be the age Jesus allegedly was when crucified. I am going to try and make this next one my year of being RIPPED LIKE JESUS by exercising more. We'll see how that goes. We're not doing anything to celebrate and I do not anticipate receiving any gifts; in fact I am kind of dreading the occasion for the same reason I used to dread family-centric holidays.

What'd you get?\") rubs that in.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 At the end of the week there is something going on that could heavily influence our future here.

{"date": "November 22, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Earlier today I gave up. I took a day off to take Hotter to the neurologist, but when I asked him to confirm the time he instead gave me his best recollection of the time, and that was two hours after the actual appointment time. I was pissed. I fumed. I'd spent $4 on gas and $5 on parking, lost $88 in wages and a precious day off to go to the hospital that makes my eyelid twitch all for nothing. I refused to speak to Hotter on the drive home. Then I took Little Child his Thanksgiving costume (made of feathers from the MFA Flock and medical tape and crayon drawings) at school and took the MFA Minivan to the mechanic, because the check engine light was on.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The check engine turned out to be an error code from the computer indicating that the catalytic converter was bad. I've mentioned on here that there was also an antifreeze leak, kind of in passing because it was slow, and all in all once MFA Mechanic looked at it it turned out that the MFA Minivan needed:\r\n-- a new catalytic converter (they made me come and look, and it was cracked in half; \"I have NEVER, EVER seen that happen before!\" said MFA Mechanic, as all of the guys from the shop nodded, having gathered around to look, too. \"Welcome to my life,\" I said)-- two new O2 sensors (those apparently go before the catalytic converter, and make the check engine light come on, hence warning you that the much-more-expensive catalytic converter is about to blow)-- a new water pump (this is nothing to do with the catalytic converter, just kind of a bonus)-- a new idle belt (this would apparently account for the \"tweeting bird under the hood\" sound I've been hearing)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The cost for all of that, AFTER they came down by $300 out of sympathy and threw in a free state inspection? One thousand dollars.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fuuuuuck.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Earlier today, I was ready to give up, and let the XY take the boys, and send Hotter back to his mother's, because we couldn't do this without using up all of our meager savings and putting our ability to pay rent in jeopardy. I was ready to cancel Thanksgiving and lie down and wallow in my misery, because fuck, y'know, how bad can it get?\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then MFA Mechanic came in and asked me if I wanted a tissue. I nodded, hands over my face, bawling. He didn't leave the room, and asked, apologetically, \"would a paper towel be okay. I don't think we have any tissue.\" I nodded again, pulling myself together, but unwilling to move my hands away from my snotty face. A moment later, I felt the edge of a paper towel brush against my fingers. \"I'll give you a ride home if you want,\" MFA Mechanic said, sounding every bit as awkward as I felt. \"If you drive the van...well, I don't know that the engine'll go, but I also don't know that it won't, and I'd really rather you didn't drive it.\" I gave up on dignity and took the paper towel and mopped my face with it. MFA Mechanic didn't go anywhere. \"I'm really sorry. I'm taking the markup off the catalytic converter and the 02 sensors. I'll throw in a free state inspection, if you think it'll pass. How's your credit?\" I started bawling all over again.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I have sixty-three thousand dollars in student loans that're in default. My ex ran up almost that much in credit card debt in my name, then we split up and he tried to take my kids, and--\" he held up a hand. \"Never mind. We'll work this out. Do you need to get anything out of the van?\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I went over to the MFA Minivan, still a couple of feet off the ground, and opened the passenger-side door as far as it would go, up on the lift. I took the Hawaian print bag Gwendomama sent me containing my wallet and my prescription sunglasses out, and went out to the ridiculous little red sportscar MFA Mechanic was test-driving, which he pointed to when I looked up at him.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0On the awkward drive home, he talked to me about his dogs. I told him about Isis and Bumpus, and told him where to turn, and thanked him for the ride.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I went inside to face my husband, who I'd been so mad at that I told him not to bother coming with me to the mechanic's after the appointment that wasn't. \"Fuck it,\" I said. \"We may go down, but we'll go down swinging.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll be your bullet,\" he said, and smiled.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I went outside with the Darth Vader mask and took a quick iPhone video, then slit Thanksgiving's throat. Hotter brought the kettle outside and I scalded the bird and started plucking. The MFA Children came home while I was finishing that up. I sent the little two inside and told Big Child that the minivan had broken down, and I'd started reading The Hunger Games in the waiting room at the mechanic's. \"What part are you at,\" he asked, eagerly. \"The baker just gave the protagonist the cookies,\" I said. \"Listen...\" He held up a hand. \"The minivan is broken, isn't it? I didn't see it in the driveway and thought you were at work, but then I remembered you stayed home to take Hotter to the doctor. How bad is it?\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"It's pretty bad,\" I said, blinking back tears. \"I don't know if we can still...I'm going to have to walk to the store. Do you want to come with me? There are some things we need to talk about.\" I figured I'd broach the subject of moving to live with his father to him on the walk. Big Child fidgeted. \"I dunno. That's a really long way. I'd probably get tired.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll come witchoo, Mommy!\" Middly came running over. \"I didn't mean to eezdrop, but I heard you say da van is broken. I wanna come witchoo!\" Big Child scurried back into the house.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know, Middly. It's a really long walk. Your legs would get tired.\" Middly jammed his hands into his pockets, resolute. \"I won't get tired, and if I do I'll keep it to myself and keep walking anyway. I wanna come witchoo!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Against my better judgement, I said okay, but only if he went back inside while I finished up with the turkey. Middly ran into the house, and I quickly gutted the bird and took the head and feet off. When I was through digging the lungs away from the ribcage I carried the carcass up to the house and knocked on the kitchen door with my elbow. Middly ran and opened it. \"I told Hotter I'm walking witchoo to da store,\" he said excitedly. \"I told him I won't be tired, or complain, and I'll help you carry stuff!\" Hotter looked dubiously at me, and I shrugged, rinsing the turkey out in the sink.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I put a reflective vest on Middle Child, and velcroed the other one onto myself. \"It's going to be dark by the time we get there and do the shopping,\" I said to Middly. \"Are you sure you won't be scared?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I won't be scared, Mommy. I will hold your hand!\" Holding my hand is something that took Middly years to be willing to do. He used to fight me as a toddler, screaming at the bottom of the stairs leading up to our apartment where we lived before I took the XY back for the last time. Before I knew he was autistic I used to lose my temper sometimes and scold him. Middle Child has never liked holding an adult's hand, but he clearly really wanted to come with me to the grocery store. I said okay.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We walked to the store. On the way there, Middly made a confession.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I was going to go in da house like you said for me and Little Child to do, but I accidentally heard part of what you said to Big Child,\" he volunteered, the reflective vest slipping off his narrow shoulders as he trotted along, holding my hand. \"What did you hear,\" I asked. \"I heard you say da minivan is broken. You were sniffling like you were going to cry. That's why I wanted to come witchoo to the store. I didn't want you to feel alone, and I wanted to tell you it'll be okay. It'll be a little bit scary, but it'll be okay. Because you won't give up, I know it. Remember I wrote that story about you? I said my mom will not give up, you know why?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Why,\" I asked, glad it was getting dark and he couldn't see my face.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Because I know you're sad dat da minivan is broken, but if it didn't break we wouldn't get to walk to the store together and see the stars. So dat's a good thing. You always tell ME not to give up, so you can't give up, because den if YOU gave up, dat would be AWKWARD!\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I had to smile at that. \"It would, wouldn't it?\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup. And dat wouldn't be any good. So you won't give up, just like I won't give up even do my legs are little. I don't feel tired at all, because we're together on an adventure!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I sucked it up, and Middly and I did the Thanksgiving shopping. We talked about what we were going to make, and what we needed to make it. I told him he could get a special treat for walking with me and being such good company, and he chose some chocolate doughnuts, but then said he wouldn't feel good about eating them unless he got something for each of his brothers, too. He chose a fresh fruit cup from the produce section for Little Child, who loves fresh fruit, and a box of Nilla Wafers for Big Child, who loves cookies. And then he offered to carry anything that wouldn't fit in our little red wagon on the way home. Luckily it all fit.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When we got home, I apologized to Hotter for being cranky about the missed appointment, and Middle Child showed his brothers the treats he'd chosen for them. Big Child picked him up and spun him around in the air, and Little Child pulled him back down by the knees to hug him. And Hotter made dinner and we sat down and ate it together.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Earlier today someone wished me a miracle, and I very bitterly asked that no one else do that, because there are no miracles.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fuck it. We may not make rent with the pathetic one-day-of-work paycheck I'll get next week and all of our savings in MFA Mechanic's pocket, but we're going to go down swinging, together on our little ship of fools for as long as it lasts. Tonight Middle Child willingly held my hand for a mile to the grocery store and a mile back, something I never thought he'd willingly do, and anyone who says autistic kids lack empathy can kiss the fattest part of my ass.

Later, over pizza, your husband will explain to the ten-year-old that all humor is based in human suffering.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the end of the day you won't care as much about the boob-sweat.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/12/today-was-one-of-those-days.html", "title": "today was one of those days"},
{"date": "November 25, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Well, it was a lovely holiday but pretty much the moment it was over my crushing depression and sense of imminent doom shattered the chair I'd propped under the doorknob of the closet I'd locked them in and took up their old positions on my shoulders (the better to whisper sinister things in both ears).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Crap.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I know what to do with this kind of terror over my immediate and longterm survival; I've felt this way more often than not ever since I can remember. When I was little I'd just shut everything out, curl into a ball, and sort of come to when it was over. As an older child I escaped into books or wandered my parents' neighborhood making lists of places I might be able to sleep for a day or two if need be. As a teenager I did LOTS of drugs. And as an adult I generally take stock, act on anything I can, then remind myself it's temporary and to eat, sleep and exercise appropriately until things get better. I'm already VERY well medicated against the possibility of actual clinical depression, in case anyone was thinking I sounded like I need some happy pills, although my shrink says (and I agree) that anxiety and depression are appropriate reactions to what I'm up against, so there's not a whole lot I can do besides suck it up and get through this.\u00a0I've always come out on the other side of my life's various disasters one way or another regardless of my coping (or lack thereof), and therefore statistically there is every reason to believe I will this time, too.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It just really doesn't seem possible at the moment. Rent is due in less than two weeks, my next paycheck will only be for a one-day workweek, I haven't gotten Little Child anything for the holidays, and Hotter and I both need the dentist and the eye doctor (no, I still haven't followed up with any kind of specialist on the whole \"OMG going blind\" thing, because I can't afford the co-pays or the anxiety right now) with varying degrees of urgency (just as the MFA Minivan still needs the mechanic). The days are short, the nights are long, the XY is coming for the MFA Children in a couple of hours for his weekend visitation, and the temptation to revert to my earliest way of dealing with this kind of fear and curl up in a ball until this is over or I have to go to work Monday morning is great.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But I am well aware of how pathetic and unhelpful that would be, so I probably won't.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Tell me something good. Tell me an awful joke, a funny story, something egregious your great-uncle Bad Touch did at the Thanksgiving table (or if he's filthy rich, tell him to hit up my tip jar). Drop me a link to something amazing, or hopeful, or hilarious. Share some bad fun.

It certainly feels that way. Nothing major has happened (no news from Medicare/Social Security on the \"extra help\" yet; glad I took the \"one week\" guideline with an entire mineral-enriched salt lick...), it's just the tragicomical death-by-a-thousand-cuts of life. Since that post I've had my weekend at Weekend Warrior Job canceled due to the company filing for bankruptcy (!!!--allegedly this \"will not affect operations and was a strategic choice to help with debt restructuring\" but...yeah), picked up a shift through Temp Agency #2 for a holiday party that I worked last night, and developed a new shoulder pain that's truly sickening. I've never felt anything like it; if it was on the left I'd swear I was having a heart attack but it's not. It's not the same \"feels like I just had a flu shot\" ache I had before, it's not exascerbated or relieved by any movement or poking, it doesn't feel musculoskeletal and isn't the searing burn of nerve pain, it's just...well, as I said, it's sickening. If one could feel nausea in one's shoulder I'd call it that. It's weird, and extremely unpleasant, but naproxen seems to help it so there's that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Let's see, what else?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I decided to read the Twilight saga and see what's so special about it. I'm deeply unimpressed so far with the quality of the writing, but pressing on in hopes that it'll captivate me at some point and I won't have to deal with the fury of someone who I feel is inferior to me at the craft being a bazillionaire. I'm going to walk to the store shortly (the MFA Minivan is running, yes, and even passed inspection, but I'd rather save the pricey fossil fuel and get the exercise). Money sucks. My diet is going swimmingly and I've lost seven pounds (I'm even putting up a BMI ticker at the lower right sidebar in solidarity with May). Salt scrub is still for sale until midnight if you want any (I'm making it tonight and mailing it out tomorrow). I didn't get to run yesterday, which may be why I'm so blahhh.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not taking a blog break or anything, I just don't have much to say right now.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://nutsinmay.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/12/the-one-where-im-not-dead-or-anything.html", "title": "the one where I'm not dead or anything"},

A couple of days ago I was walking and the top of my compression sleeve (I wear them on both legs from ankle to knee to hopefully help support the healing stress fractures) started to roll down. I went to pull my khakis up to fix that and found that it was VERY DIFFICULT to get the cuff up over my calf muscle. AM RIPPED LIKE JESUS!\r\nHate: My weight loss has plateaued for the time being, and yes, I said stress fractureS, plural.\r\nLove:\u00a0The super-cool opportunity that blogging has brought me to speak with one of the nation's leading specialists in orthopedic maladies and sports medicine in the very near future about ways to hopefully help prevent further injury.\r\nHate: That he's probably going to give me the \"you poor thing\" face and the \"are you crazy\" face both when he hears my orthopedic history and exercise goals. I haven't seen one in ages, but there is a certain feeling of failure that comes with seeing a top-level specialist and having THEM be horrified by what is wrong with you (at least if you're me). I haven't missed that.\r\nLove: That there are gadgets like USB-powered electric blankets and slippers in the world.\r\nHate: That my workplace is so miserably cold and my circulation so poor as to make such things truly necessary (the blanket is for work and the slippers are for home use; I actually only wear them in bed to keep the soles clean but my feet get so cold without them that the pulses vanish up to my heels, yeouch).\r\nLove: That Social Security gave Hotter a PHONE appointment for tomorrow, so that I don't have to take time off from work to drive him to the local branch office.\r\nHate: That the reason for said appointment is the \"preliminary action notice\" informing us that Hotter is NOT eligible for \"extra help.\"\u00a0Hate 2.0:\u00a0How does Social Security screw up as much as they do? HOW? They counted the child support I receive from the XY for the MFA Children as income for our household but did not count the three CHILDREN as members of same. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN, I FILLED OUT THE APPLICATION ONLINE AND I KNOW I LISTED THE CHILDREN GAHHHHHHHH!!!\r\nLove: That I have friends who work with children who remind me that the nine year change is normal and my immature-for-his-chronological-age ten-year-old won't always be an asshole.\r\nHate: The \u00a0nine year change.\r\nLove: I beat Antiangie at Words With Friends! That was HUGE (she has mopped the floor with me many, many times).\r\nHate: I also played Jenndola\u00a0for the first time recently.

Instead I had to stop running (again), got mauled by a retractable dog-leash, and came down with a cold. Yeah, a dog leash. No, I'm not high on decongestants. Seriously, Bumpus went nuts while Hotter and I were taking the dogs out to pee and rushed Isis, Isis yanked her leash out of my hand and took off after Bumpus, and when Bumpus hit the end of his flexi-leash he started tearing in circles around me and Hotter. Hotter was wearing jeans, and I'd been running and then showered and was wearing a nightgown under my coat. Bumpus wrapped the leash around my legs like a crazed Maypole dancer. In case you were wondering? Flannel is not much protection in such a situation:\r\nFigure One: This is the back of one of my knees. That thing in the middle? Is a blister. I'm actually kind of shocked at how bad this looks. I mean, it smarts quite a bit, but...damn.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then this morning I woke up with a fresh cold, and when I rinsed my sinuses out there was some blood (not a ton, but still normal is NONE, so). I think maybe I need to lay off the NSAIDs. Clearly I'm not clotting so well, and this is WITH my having a daily leafy-greens smoothie for the vitamin K. Oof.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Also I am back to walking instead of running because connective tissue diseases are assholes, and speaking of assholes the MFA Minivan is leaking antifreeze (slowly, but still: normal is NONE, so).

Staying under calorie goals and exercising daily? HERE HAVE AN EXTRA POUND. Going over calorie goals slightly and exercising daily then saying \"ah fuck it\" and snarfing half a box of Triscuits with cream cheese on? WAKE UP TWO POUNDS LIGHTER. Maybe I should make the Triscuit and cream cheese binge a daily thing, then? Probably not.\r\nLove: I have Weekend Warrior Job today, and while it'll make gas money...interesting...until my next paycheck, it's a fun place to work and pretty good money (plus free food).\r\nHate: Being away from my husband on a child-free weekend. Also: Weekend Warrior Management, for jerking me around LAST weekend and texting me last night to change my hours for today slightly, and how much today's free food will prolly eff up my diet (yes, I know, moderation etc. but there is NOTHING healthy to eat at Weekend Warrior Job so I've just decided that Weekend Warrior Days are days off of the diet, for the sake of my mental health).\r\nLove: Good karma. Yesterday a PseudoCorp employee found an ID badge outside the building that wasn't one of ours, and technically all I'm supposed to do is hand it over to Security to chuck in the Lost and Found but I wasn't terribly busy at the time, so I Google-stalked the badge's owner and she was absolutely delighted that it had been found because at her job you have to pay for replacement badges if you lose yours. When I got home I found that Amazon.com had sent me a mystery gift card for a bungled order I don't remember placing. WHOO TITS!\r\nHate: Bad deductive reasoning. Last week the head cheese from Temp Agency #1 came to meet with PseudoCorp HR, and everyone who works in my area except me had a mysterious meeting that no one would talk about, and I'd just about convinced myself they were going to make me an offer. I could TASTE the benefits and the on-site gym membership, and then...nothing happened. So probably it was nothing to do with me and I was just reading too much into things, although on the plus side I now know How I Really Feel about PseudoCorp and that if they DO make me an offer I will gladly accept.\r\nLove: Hotter's phone appointment with Social Security went well and it now looks like he \"probably\" WILL qualify for \"extra help,\" meaning no \"gap.\"\r\nHate: We won't know anything for certain for \"a week,\" and apparently if Hotter DOES qualify it's only by the very narrowest of margins, meaning that if money sucks even a LITTLE bit less next year we'll have to deal with this all over again, and we still won't have that kind of money just lying around.\r\nLove: My new cooties. The old ones never really took off and started generating more and more icky sediment, and not multiplying AT ALL, and carbonating the water kefir less and less so I ordered some new ones from someone on Amazon.com and these ones MULTIPLY LIKE CRAZY and carbonate the water kefir enough that the glass stopper-bottles sound like champagne bottles when I open them, and WOW!\r\nHate: Cultures For Health. If it'd just been me with the bad result I would've been willing to call it user error, but I also purchased some of their cooties as a gift for a friend and hers never did anything at ALL, and having seen the night-and-day difference between their stock and cooties from elsewhere (which incidentally were half the price) I have decided that Cultures For Health is bullshit. AND overpriced. DO NOT BUY COOTIES FROM CULTURES FOR HEALTH.\r\nLove: Thanks to the way my new cooties multiply, I have enough to send some to said friend, and actually if any of YOU are dying for some cooties of your very own, let me know and we'll work something out as long as you can cover shipping and packaging costs.\r\nHate: I am just today feeling human enough to possibly get to the effing Post Office with those salt scrubs in addition to working, which pretty much makes me a TOTAL asshole, and if anybody would like a refund just let me know. I'll wait until Monday to ship 'em out to give people time to see this. Oof.\r\nLove: I think I am FINALLY getting over that cold (still sneezing, but the weight drop means it's on its' way out).\r\nHate: That my body is such a jerk about sickness in general. And exercise (owww my legs). And pretty much anything besides lying in bed subsisting on tofu, spinach, and flaxseed meal, or somesuch (I'm guessing; haven't actually tried that or anything).\r\nLove: The sun is out today!

{"date": "November 28, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So I've gotten really into the whole dieting/fitness thing, and now in addition to Runkeeper I have the Livestrong Calorie Tracker, and OMG. I may have to leave Hotter for the Livestrong Calorie Tracker (but only if it will let me keep Runkeeper as my dirty little bitch on the side). It has EVERYTHING. For instance: I use one half of a cup of Chobani Black Cherry yogurt in my smoothie, along with a bunch of other ingredients? No problem! I can pull that up BY BRAND and indicate that I had a half a serving, plus a cup and a half of raw spinach, two tbsp. of Bob's Red Mill flaxseed meal, and half a cup of frozen mixed berries with eight ounces of water kefir (yes, it has water kefir! Only the kind made with coconut water, but I figure the calories are comparable). BOOM.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At this point I should probably point out that I am not being compensated by the Livestrong folks and this is not an official review; I paid the $2.99 like everybody else and my desire to hump their product is spontaneous and genuine.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Aaaaanyway, I put my height, weight, and age into the app, tell it what my weight goal is (to lose 2 lbs. per week, which is the max the program allows you to choose), and specify my job activity level (sedentary), and it tells me how many calories I get over the course of a day if I want to meet that goal. BUT! I can then engage in various activities (also very, very specific, like it has different \"walk\" options for \"walking with a dog,\" \"walking with a leaf blower,\" etc.) and it takes the calories burned off my calories consumed for a \"net calorie\" count. So in theory if I was totally dying for a cheeseburger and fries I could run a 10k or something and then have them without endangering my goal or starving for the rest of the day. And in practice, I can have my oatmeal and grapefruit in the morning for breakfast, my salad and water kefir for lunch, take a forty-minute walk on my lunchbreak after I eat my salad (using Runkeeper to track my distance covered), come home, eat a TON of homemade turkey noodle soup along with a glass of Blueberry Pomegranate juice for dinner, futz around on the innernets and helping kids with homework, then make a spinach smoothie and go for a thirty-minute jog (again with the Runkeeper), and finish the day not hungry in the least but with 164 calories \"left over\" even AFTER randomly squirting a tablespoon or so of whipped cream into my mouth (the effing can ATTACKED ME and I seriously think it may have...okay, broken is a strong word but I do honestly believe it CHIPPED...my shinbone as I was virtuously rooting out the Cranberry Pomegranate juice bottle in order to accurately enter its' information into Livestrong).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That's pretty badass.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And yeah, I'm still pretty wretchedly depressed, although as you may have noticed, I've embraced the philosophy of \"if eating, sleeping, and exercise are GOOD for one's mood then I'll just do MORE of ALL THREE\" and I think it is helping. At the very least it's filling my non-work time up in ways that are productive or at least not HARMFUL and distracting me, what with the gadgets to log everything. There WAS some good job news recently on not one but TWO fronts: at PseudoCorp the Big Boss's assistant let me know that if I continue to perform as well as I have been I can plan on staying on indefinitely as a temp (while not the holy grail of BENEFITS this is still excellent news) and Weekend Warrior Job unexpectedly has work for me this coming weekend. So that's good.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. Thanks for the comments on my last post, by the way. I think Hotter is overruled and I'll be checking in grumpy or not. If he doesn't like the grumpy on the blog* then he has the same option to click the little x in the upper right corner as everyone else does.\u00a0\r\n* As for the grumpy in person, well, he's the fool who married me. Don't feel too sorry for him. I give excellent head.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/the-one-with-the-nerdgasm-over-fitness.html", "title": "the one with the nerdgasm over fitness"},

Endorphins rock.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Also I ran out of Vitamin D3 oil caps for a little bit there. I swear my mood declines when I'm not taking that stuff! But I've been back on it for three days now. I started taking Fish Oil supplements again too; the omegas are supposed to naturally improve your mental health or something, and while I have no way of knowing how much (or little) that's helping (since I'm also doing a ton of other things to try and feel better, including exercising for forty minutes of my lunch hour, outside in the afternoon sunshine weather permitting), SOMEthing is definitely working.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Which? YAY. I even survived today, wherein nothing truly traumatic happened but I LEFT THE PRECIOUS AT HOME AND DIDN'T HAVE HER ALL DAY.

They keep it a cozy fifty-five degrees or so in the ginormous high-ceilinged lobby at work; Management has announced that they're not paying the heating cost to make it comfortable since it's only one or two receptionists plus a security guard who spend the day there, and I guess it's plenty warm in their offices. Whatever PseudoCorp, I'll just freeze my ass off in my fingerless gloves for typing purposes. I'm totally getting one of these.

{"date": "March 22, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Today I had The Rage. I keep trying to tell myself it is just the steroids, but you know what? While I am sure they are not helping, and also that I am overreacting to at least a CERTAIN extent, there is also a lot of really infuriating shit going on.\r\n* \u00a0 To wit: my ex. I don't know if CATHERINE! stopped putting out, or he needs his psych meds adjusted, or he has some kind of post-concussion psychotic break happening or WHAT his deal is, but he has sunk to new lows of sucking at life (which is REALLY SAYING SOMETHING) and also general interpersonal offensiveness. If I told you what he recently did in relation to my children, and the bullshit he threw out to try and deflect my righteous outrage, you would bang your jaw on the floor. It's ridiculous! But I probably shouldn't go into specifics! Even though I'd love to, because even Hotter and I have to laugh at this shit so you would just DIE!\r\n* \u00a0 Yesterday's work-drama. Oh my word, y'all. It is over with, dead and buried, forgotten, and business as usual except one person CANNOT seem to let go of it. And that person? Is typing this. It's not so much the drama itself as the fact that it clued me in to a certain naivete I had been guilty of when it came to PseudoCorp. And this is so dumb, but see, I had kind of lionized the corporation as a whole and built it up in my mind to the point that finding out it had feet of clay all along is breaking my heart a little. Probably it's for the best that I figured that out or else I would have been devastated not to be hired on permanently, but...well. It's kind of like how the therapist of my formative years used to pry and poke and prod as to why I always defended my father (who was no angel, really, in fact not even remotely CLOSE), until one day two years in I looked at her and my chin started to wobble and I bleated \"because SOMEone has to be good in all of this!\" And she sighed and said \"no, not really, although it's very human to WANT to see it that way.\"\r\n* \u00a0 The Twitter. I have put myself in a time-out on there, and haven't even corrected my last (misspelled) tweet. Ordinarily I love the Twitter with every fiber of my social-media-addicted, ADD-riddled being but...lately, dating back to BEFORE the steroids but oh boy, right now ESPECIALLY? Well. It's just a steady stream of 140-character long reasons why a lot of people need to SHUT THEIR HOLES ABOUT THEIR FIRST-WORLD PROBLEMS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND DECENT. I spent a large portion of my lunch chatting with a very understanding friend, and listing all of our mutual friends who need to shut up and why they needed to shut up and how one in particular needed to shut up and then maybe go and hang themself in a closet and then she, as one of very few people who could say such a thing to me (especially right now) and have me not only not tell HER to shut up but also listen, suggested that I take a break from the Twitter until I was less ragey. And she is right. Because if I do not then I am in serious danger of being abhorrently unkind to a number of mostly-undeserving people, and I am doing an absolutely MISERABLE job of following my self-proclaimed motto of Plato's \"be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle\" inside my head, and I am kind of starting to horrify myself. I don't even like admitting this. But I figured I would, because a lot of the time people are all \"OMG I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK FROM TWITTER AND THE DRAMA\" and I am all \"seriously? TWITTER is stressing you out? Pansy!\" If anyone knows how many calories are in one's own unspoken words, let me know so I can plug that into MyFitnessPal, mmmkay? There's no drama with anyone on there, though. I just need to take a powder, possibly until the steroids are out of my system.\r\n* \u00a0 And finally, and this is probably what's driving all of the above EXCEPT for the mishegas with my ex (who just sucks objectively speaking no matter what is or isn't wrong with me or society as a whole): I am just so VERY goddamn angry about my health right now. A few weeks ago I felt like I was on the way to being healthier than I have ever in my life been, nothing was wrong with me that wasn't being controlled nicely with maintenance meds (except for my eyes but, well, those at least do not HURT), and now? Well, as much as I whine on here about my health, there is plenty that I do NOT go into (largely because my ex has attempted to use my health against me in a court of law and Stalky used to go on and on accusing me of making my medical history UP, which damn, I am NOT THAT IMAGINATIVE OF A WRITER...but also because it's fucking depressing and at one point in my life I laid down in that and wallowed for a bit and it wasn't a good look so I try not to dwell on it), and as of today there are, in addition to the ENT clusterfuck y'all know about, not one but TWO (completely UNrelated, either to the ENT situation or each other) additional issues that surgeons ideally ought to address in the very near future and seriously WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK? I am SO MAD. Even if I had the money to just have this all of this taken care of in an expedient and minimally-painful manner by competent medical professionals like some kind of fancy person it would involve AT LEAST THREE OPERATIONS, one of which would temporarily have a major impact on my motherfucking MOBILITY and I am THE BREADWINNER IN MY FAMILY and can barely make my HEALTH INSURANCE premiums, nevermind afford the 20% coinsurance I'd have to pay to get this shit fixed!\r\n* \u00a0 I think the above would be enough to give just about anybody The Rage, but as is so often the case, down at the bottom of all The Rage is The Fear. Because all of the last bullet point is just logistics. There is also, time and money and pain and fury aside, the fact that of all the times--and there have been more than I can count on one hand--I have gone under the knife it has NEVER ONCE GONE ACCORDING TO PLAN. There has ALWAYS been AT LEAST one hideous complication, and most of the time it isn't even anybody's fault, and rather something no one present could have predicted or has ever even SEEN, but at the end of the day I end up going in with one problem and coming out with bone sticking out where it doesn't belong, or MRSA sepsis, or a piece of gauze erupting from my scar, or hemorrhaging, or a nearly-lethal drug reaction, or SOME GODDAMN THING to the point that it is like I am CURSED, and while I want as much as anyone in their right mind would to have these things that are currently wrong with me fixed because they hurt and also because intellectually I know that the various situations are untenable in that they will cripple me or cause me ever-increasing pain or rob me of one of my senses or possibly even my LIFE if left unaddressed IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME TO CONTEMPLATE SIGNING ON FOR ANYONE TO HAVE ANOTHER GO AT ME BECAUSE MY MOTHERFUCKING LUCK SUCH AS IT IS IS SURE TO RUN OUT EVENTUALLY.\r\n* \u00a0 I don't know, y'all. The only other time in my life that I have felt so helpless, and angry, and scared, and dangerously close to straightjacket-crazy was when Little Child was a tiny baby in the hospital for weeks on end and nobody could figure out what was wrong with him. It started to mess with my mind. I started to tell myself lies like \"they are only running all of these tests and doing all of these procedures because I told them he did x, y, and z and I will just TAKE IT ALL BACK and tell them I was wrong or hell that I just LIED and they will leave him ALONE!\" I literally had to put poor Little Child down in the hospital crib wailing at one point and take a step back, because I wanted so badly to grab my baby and run out of there. But this time it's me. I was talking to Hotter today and saying that maybe I'd just cancel that ENT appointment Monday since I felt a LITTLE bit better and it's not like anybody with a medical license had looked in my ear so maybe I was MISTAKEN about the eardrum and Dr. Anonymous was reacting to my IMAGININGS and...he very kindly said it was up to me, which forced me to admit that that was a bad plan, but my point is that sometimes in a situation like this the ONLY way to not do something utterly stupid is to take a step back, but I can't exactly take a step back from mySELF.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 FuckshitcocksuckingsonofawhoregodDAMN!\r\n* \u00a0 Plus also?

{"date": "March 21, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0Shortly after I posted about how well Neuro and Transplant had gone, Hotter's transplant coordinator called me and let me know that his blood levels of his very most expensive medication were lower than they liked to see. So they're doubling the dose. BALLLLLS. I have no idea how that'll fit into our budget--NONE.\r\n* \u00a0 This morning Bad Ear woke me at four a.m. hurting like a total bitch so I went in and got an early start at the office. Considering I couldn't get to sleep until midnight I'd planned to go in at seven as usual and make tomorrow and Friday early days as a little gift to myself, but we need every hour in next week's paycheck anyway.\r\n* \u00a0 There was Drama At Work. STUPID drama. Drama so ridiculous that I am tempted to break the cardinal rule of blogging and talk about work in detail just so that you can all laugh because it is THAT FUNNY, but...huh. Look at that, up until just then I would have sworn I had lost every shred of my mind and yet I'm not going to share the drama. Sorry. Just trust me it was so ludicrous an example of Human Misbehavior that it should be a sitcom episode. During Sweeps Week.\r\n* \u00a0 Totally unrelated to said drama, I absolutely humiliated myself in front of my boss today. I only THOUGHT I humiliated myself yesterday, y'all. See, today, I went into a one-on-one meeting with my boss, who is a Very Nice Man and asked me how I was today, and I had PLANNED FOR THIS and GIVEN MYSELF A PEPTALK and EVERYTHING. I had told myself that in my thrice-steroidal (inhaled, nasal, and pill-form, in addition to yesterday's shot in the arse) state, given how godawful Things are and the amount of pain I was in, it was Perfectly Acceptable and in fact A Good Idea to redirect conversation if asked how I was/what was wrong, since I probably couldn't pull of fine/nothing (yeahhhh I woke up with both eyes swollen almost shut due to my sinuses, and am sporting purple bags you could practically fit a credit card and keys in under each eye. I kind of look like I've been crying for the past two days, following being punched in the face, plus I have to blow my nose every couple of minutes). So when my boss asked me How I Was I tried for a reassuring smile and a breezy \"let's not dwell on that, haha!\" Unfortunately, Nice Boss was undeterred. \"Well is everything okay? Talk to me,\" he urged, doggedly. \"If I talk about it I will cry so really, please let's not,\" I said. And then burst into tears. Awesome. Nice Boss apologized and said we could reschedule, and beat a hasty retreat, and I sent a damage-controlling e-mail saying \"what time is best for you, as long as you don't ask how I am I think I can maintain my composure. Sorry about that, a combination of bad news from yesterday's appointments and high-dose steroids for that ENT thing that made me miss a day the week before last have rendered me less capable than usual in that regard,\" and he said no apologies needed, and we met after lunch and it went fine and actually he was quite impressed with the work I've been doing. But still. Gah.\r\n* \u00a0 Re: ENT stuff. Everyone and their sister-in-law's hairstylist's college roommate, as it turns out, knows somebody who knew someone who had THE SAME THING and DIED, and all crabbing on my part aside the people who care about me most were collectively urging me to Go See A Specialist, God Dammit, And Worry About Paying For It Later. And in my experience no matter how little you want to do something, if more than three of the people you love and trust the most are saying you simply must then generally they are right and it would behoove you to listen to them. So I called the ENT who did my tonsils, but I haven't seen him since 2008 so would be a new patient, and therefore a doctor had to call to make an appointment for me because he's the Grand Poobah of ENT Surgery at Local Teaching Hospital. I called my GP's office and told them I'd decided to go with their recommendation to see a specialist after all and damn the torpedoes, and gave them the relevant information, and they said they'd pass it on to my doctor. Then they called back and asked if it HAD to be The Grand Poobah, or would I be willing to see another doctor, and I said I'd follow my GP's recommendation but would PREFER The Grand Poobah. They called back and said they'd got me an appointment with some non-Grand-Poobah ENT on the thirtieth. I asked if my doctor was sure it was okay to wait that long, given that the guy yesterday made it sound like I was in some danger from this, and I only had enough steroids for a week anyway plus the situation was getting steadily worse and also could they please tell her I'd like some help with pain management, be that in the form of more steroids, an antibiotic anyway just for the hell of it, or pain medication of some kind. They called back and said they'd gotten me in with ANOTHER ENT Monday, and that I simply hadn't given the steroids enough time to work. I then went and had a little cry in the ladies' room because my goddamn ear hurt so much but I didn't want to bother the doctor's office again, and when I came out a very wise friend observed that she thought maybe my own neglect as a child had taught me to be okay with having my needs ignored to the point that I failed to advocate for myself when appropriate,\u00a0and suggested I think of this in the context of What Would You Do If It Was One Of Your Children? Well I'd raise hell, I said, and not LET them ignore this! Go get 'em tiger, said my friend, and I called the doctor's office back and said look I hate to be a pest but would you please tell the doctor that the pain is really pretty unbearable and I am asking for her to come up with a plan for how to handle that until the steroids do their job. I then went and quickly humiliated myself in front of my boss, which freed me up to answer the phone when the doctor's office called BACK, and said...that the doctor had said that I needed to give the steroids at least another day. So I took an early lunch and went back to the ladies' room and quietly sobbed in a stall for a few minutes, and was honestly considering the emergency room because I was hurting so badly when...POP!\r\n* \u00a0 Oh yeah. It ruptured. And drained all down my neck. I'm really glad that didn't happen in front of anyone. Bad Ear immediately became Quiet Ear, but the pain went from a high eight or possibly a nine on the much-vaunted pain scale down to a four at the most, and I think most of that is referred pain from my cheekbone. So I mopped my face off and my neck up and ate my peanut butter sandwich and got back to work, ignoring Dr. Anonymous's entreaties to Go To The God Damned ER Already.\r\n* \u00a0 At the rescheduled meeting, Nice Boss gave me a tentative end date for my projects at PseudoCorp. Which...well. I really didn't have any reason to expect they'd hire me, but so many people have been so impressed with my work that I'd foolishly gotten my hopes up. God damn it. Don't anyone crap on Nice Boss, by the way; at least he was decent enough to give me a heads-up. That's more than I can say for pretty much ANYONE I've worked for in my time as a temp (except, oddly, Soulless Corporate Megalith) and I don't even think the client is supposed to do that, but I appreciate that he did. He even offered to be a reference for me. Still...\r\n* \u00a0 I got home mere moments before some rednecks with a new-to-us second-hand refrigerator. And while \"climb behind defunct appliances with a dustmop\" is probably not what ANYONE meant by \"relax and avoid dust,\" at least we have a refrigerator again. Of course, we don't really have much to put IN it and I have NO fucking idea how I'll feed us all for the next two weeks, but...well, I'm out of tears or else my tearducts are swollen shut at this point (distinctly possible given the state of my eyes at the moment) so whatever. No, we do not have renter's insurance. It lapsed two months ago due to nonpayment.\r\n* \u00a0 All in all I'm trying to focus on the positive. I ought to have at least a FEW more paychecks, my pain level is manageable enough that I won't be tempted to take any forbidden NSAIDs (probably for the best as I have reason to believe I might be having ENT surgery in the not-too-distant future, and the ENT region is vascular as all HELL) and MAYBE I can avoid or at least put OFF said surgery since Quiet Ear went ahead and vented itself, and I don't even strictly speaking NEED to go to the ER since I have topical antibiotics for use in the inner ear at home already because two of my kids have tubes (Dr. Anon reluctantly got on-board with this plan given that I have access to the antibiotic drops, although she really doesn't like that putting them in hurt like an absolute motherfucker because that apparently indicates a largish tear in the eardrum...me, I'm just happy because I hear the brain itself lacks sensation so hey, the hole isn't THAT deep!). And the rest I'll worry about when I'm capable of crying again, I guess.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm closing comments on this one like an absolute asshole. I know this sucks. I know it's not fair. But unless one of you is secretly Bill Gates there really ISN'T anything you can do that I would ask of you, and the\u00a0more people are nice to me right now the more I feel like bawling\u00a0and the more pressure builds up behind my eyes, and if anyone was an asshole today I think that might just break me. So.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/03/when-it-rains-it-pourssometimes-down-the-side-of-your-neck.html", "title": "when it rains, it pours...sometimes down the side of your neck"},
{"date": "January  1, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJanuary: I was sick, my health insurance clusterfuck occurred, and basically Anthem took five years off my life.\r\nFebruary: I'm sick-ish. Middle child falls ill, I blow a crucial deadline at my former job to be with him at the hospital, and I find myself unemployed (fuuuuuck). Also, I talk to CATHERINE! on the phone for the first time and decide she's dumb but harmless. I apply for lots of jobs. The MFA Flock begins to grow.\r\nMarch: I am still having asthma issues left over from the early spring's illnesses, apply for and am rejected by lots MORE jobs, and start working for Temp Agencies 1 & 2, as well as a third agency that didn't last very long. I volunteer at the Hippie Food Coop lots. The MFA Flock grows by many more fuzzy little chicks, a handful of ducklings, and Paul the Rooster. I butcher my first chicken. Finances go downhill. A Twitter-troll rakes me over the coals and I flip them the bird. My front tooth explodes, but my dentist is able to piece it back together. God, March sucked!\r\nApril: I start working at Local Teaching Hospital a lot through one of the temp agencies, as well as several OTHER places, Hotter spends an evening in the ER, I garden a TON, CATHERINE! uses an ear candle on a kid with a badly infected ear and I have a conniption. The MFA Children stop having Away Weekends. We try and fail to hatch some eggs in an incubator. The tooth falls apart again and can't be repaired, I start working at The Botanical Garden, and I have a massive asthma attack that lands ME in the ER. April was not my friend either.\r\nMay: I continue to have asthma trouble, The Botanical Garden kicks my ass, Prednisone makes me a basket case, Hotter commits a sin of considerable magnitude...basically all of life turns on me brutally. Middle Child's \"Mother's Tea\" pulls me out of the dumps but things keep on sucking. MFA Mama goes offline for a while when I can't afford to pay my hosting fee, but then Typepad helps me out because they're awesome. I start working the third shift helping to renovate a Soulless Corporate Megalith store, which is a miserable job, and become nocturnal.\r\nJune: Middly gets Strep for the first of what would be MANY times (his pediatrician actually thinks he's a carrier now, which I try not to even think about because OMG), my lungs still suck, I continue to work at Soulless Corporate Megalith (and hate it) while also moonlighting for Temp Agencies 2 and 3 in my time off, and my back goes out on me. Hotter commits a grave transgression that causes me to seriously consider divorce. The MFA Minivan takes a major shit on me, costing us everything we have. Little Child transitions to oral intake but I am too superstitious to make a big deal over it.\r\nJuly: We start to harvest stuff from the garden, which is nice. My lungs still suck, which is not nice. There's a horrific accident at Soulless Corporate Megalith, one in which someone could easily have been killed, and it freaks me out. Two chickens die within days of each other of natural causes. My tooth disintegrates further and I get my first migraine in over a year. I also get to drive a forklift, which was super-cool, and a co-worker threatens to cut me, which was not. In thinking about it I realize that some people are just fundamentally unhappy with their lives and need forgiveness, so I forgive said co-worker (and Stalky). Shortly after that, the Soulless Corporate Megalith job ends. I file for unemployment for the first time in my life.\r\nAugust: There's an earthquake and a hurricane. Away Weekends resume. My lungs stop sucking so badly (finally). I am able through an act of incredible generosity to get my tooth fixed. Yay!\r\nSeptember: I find out I'm going blind, The Precious joins our family,\u00a0I start a new temp job that I truly love, my ex wrecks CATHERINE's truck, I find out we have to get rid of most of the MFA Flock, I start running again, the XY announce that he and CATHERINE! are getting married.\r\nOctober: I get cellulitis in my finger and have a GI bleed related to the antibiotics for that, the in-laws come to visit and my stepson gets on my nerves, our water heater dies, I get laid off AGAIN, I start working for PseudoCorp.\r\nNovember: I develop a stress fracture that means no more running for a while, it turns out ALL of the poultry have to go, Hotter and I win tickets and backstage passes to a concert that demonstrates once and for all that we are Too Old For That Shit, Hotter is kind of a dick as he adjusts to my working at PseudoCorp, I go on a diet, we get notice that the Medicare \"donut hole\" will apply to Hotter in the new year and panic, the MFA Minivan dies and knocks us financially flat on our faces, I sink into a major depression but still manage to put together a nice Thanksgiving for our family.\r\nDecember: I get super-sick, blogging is sparse, we find out Hotter will, in fact, qualify for Medicare \"extra help,\" I fall while out walking at night and injure myself pretty badly, the minivan takes another shit on us, I have a small dental emergency, and all in all I am more than ready to kiss 2011 goodbye.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Y'know, I thought maybe I was being silly and melodramatic in hating so extravagantly on 2011, but in looking back over it?

{"date": "January  1, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0In the interest of being greener (and hopefully saving a little money), I decided to put up some insulating window film this winter. Casa MFA is old and kind of drafty, and Hotter's and my bedroom in particular gets COLD, especially if we sleep with the door shut, which we do most nights so that a) Isis doesn't get down from the bed and go wandering and b) we can sleep naked if we so choose without scarring the kids for life. So I researched it and the general consensus per the innernet was that this product was by far superior in both performance and ease of installation:\r\n\r\nFigure One: Yep, it's an affiliate link.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I ordered myself some kits (although I actually didn't order mine from Amazon; I am too cheap to join Amazon Prime and didn't need enough kits to qualify for free Super Saver shipping so instead I got mine from Drugstore.com) (they have 'em on sale currently and right now you can get 12% cashback through eBates as well--WIN!) and a couple of days ago I installed them with help from Hotter and Big Child.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The installation was a breeze, which is really saying something when you consider that I was mixing mySELF, heights, double-sided tape, and the assistance of my husband and oldest child. You don't have to get the film perfectly taut before adhering it to the tape; it shrinks up nicely when you heat it with the hairdryer. WHOO TITS!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As far as the performance of the product goes, Hotter and I got a night of very poor sleep the first night after we installed the things, because WE WERE HOT (I did the windows in our bedroom first but didn't want to lower the thermostat until we did the boys' rooms). Once we adjusted the thermostat (we ended up lowering it by three whole degrees after everyone's windows were done) all was roses, and I can't wait to see how this affects our power bill!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, 3M gets two thumbs way up in my unsponsored, uncompensated review that they totally didn't endorse in any way, shape or form, and all of y'all should give this a try (preferably either through that affiliate link up there or by signing up for eBates through my referral link and buying them from Drugstore, heh).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=tk4AR6w6UXfc7TGQISHHqQ%3D%3D"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/and-now-for-something-that-doesnt-suck.html", "title": "and now for something that doesn't suck!"},

{"date": "March 28, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 The ENT office was huge and cushy and efficient, and ran on-time. The very nice ENT, Dr. JewishName,** first came in to meet me and have a cursory look into both ears/tap around on my face and head. He pronounced my GP to have \"dropped the ball\" and Bad Ear's eardrum to be \"not as awful as I'd expected,\" and sent me for an immediate hearing/audiology workup. My hearing in Bad Ear is diminished, but I didn't TOTALLY bomb the hearing part of the test. The sucky-puff thingy to check eardrum flexibility showed a diminished range of movement on Bad Ear's side, but apparently only to the degree that's to be expected in a recently-ruptured eardrum, not to the point that it's not moving because it's stretched tightly outward with fluid or infection. It's just stiff and creaky like everything else on my body right now. \"You should have come and seen me a month ago,\" said the nice ENT. \"I would have been a hero. I could've relieved all of your discomfort and speeded your healing by popping a tube in that sucker,\" said the ENT indignantly, while pinching and manhandling the area around the former pustule (it drained en route to the appointment, apparently, and is still a little sore but Dr. JewishName felt no tract or swelling of the underlying tissues and said to just keep using hot compresses and topical stuff on it unless I spike a temp/grow a horn). \"Open and close your mouth a couple of times, please...ohhhh. Yep. I think this is coming from your temporomandibular joint. Are you under any extraordinary stress?\"\r\n* \u00a0 Dr. JewishName then took me to a \"procedure room\" and had me lie down. He crawled Bad Ear with a microscope, then torqued my head and neck around some thoughtfully. \"How's THAT?\" he asked, digging the tip of his thumb into my head directly in front of my tragus. \"GAHHHH!\" I yelled. \"Uh huh. Yep. There's nothing I can do for this. I treat it sometimes with steroids, but if those haven't helped and you haven't developed a fever it's most likely not autoimmune or infectious, and I'm going to say it's PROBABLY musculoskeletal, which is usually stress-related. You're going to have to see an oral surgeon about this. All I can do is give you some pain relief you can safely take before a potential surgery...NSAIDs...mishegas!\"\r\n* \u00a0 So, you know, the appointment wasn't a waste of time. I both showed up and walked\u00a0away with a plan to see a specialist who should hopefully FIX ME, yes, but at least now I have something to take at night when I am not working or driving or doing homework or kicking the garden's ass.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I am VERY IMPRESSED that I cleared the residual resistant bugs from Bad Ear with nothing but my native immune system, Ciprodex drops, regular neti pot rinses and everything-the-innernet-said-to-try-that-didn't-sound-dangerous. GO, ME! It's nice to feel like I had something to do with that what with all of the positive dietary and lifestyle changes I've been working on making. Over all this is FABULOUS NEWS, not only in that I went into this appointment with all of my pills, my mouthguard, and a spare pair of panties in my purse (because I was so sure I'd end up either in Club Med for IV antibiotics or having surgery) and was able to then leave the office and meet my kids coming off the schoolbus and hug my husband, but also in that MY IMMUNE SYSTEM DID ITS JOB FOR A CHANGE!\r\n* \u00a0 I am less excited by the news that this is most likely a result of chronic known issues, and there's no five-minute fix to the discomfort to be had, but oh well. I have an appointment April third with the oral surgeon Dr. JewishName recommends, and in the meantime I am doing all I can to keep my stress levels down.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 The fact that Hotter adjusted the \"new\" fridge shortly after I replaced as much of the spoiled food as I could afford to and froze it all solid (exploding a glass water kefir bottle and all of the eggs in the process)...well, shit happens. We'll figure something out.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 The way Pfeffer escaped from her hutch and climbed onto and devoured much of what was on my seedling and cutting propagation table...well, I can't kick her ass over it but SERIOUSLY OMG IT WAS LIKE FLUFFY WHITE GODZILLA. Still. Calm blue oceans. Noooo stressss...\r\n* \u00a0 One more day of steroid tapering. Zen. Thoughts.\r\n* \u00a0 And how are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n** \u00a0 I don't know what it makes me that I was so relieved when I found out the ENT I would be seeing had a very Jewish last name. I felt like one of the little old ladies from my granny's Jewish Old Folks' Home who would reportedly roll into the ER and screech \"GET ME A JEW!\" But I found it immensely reassuring, and did the equivalent of throwing Ashkenazic gang signs by putting part of my oral history into Yiddish, and at that point the doctor did slow down and seem to become even more compassionate and attentive so GO TEAM ABRAHAM!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/03/ent.html", "title": "ENT"},

{"date": "June  5, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0 This morning is already bringing The Crazy to Casa MFA, but out of the chaos did come something so cute that I actually wanted to make sure I wrote it down and remembered it forever. \u00a0\u00a0 Hotter was letting me sleep in/sleep off the maximum safe dose of Benadryl (because last night I had hives, BAD ones, the kind where I wanted to rip my skin off but couldn't stop smacking, rubbing, knuckle-grinding, and every other non-scratching fake-out maneuver my skin's nerve endings laughed at me for trying long enough to try it) (and no of COURSE I don't know what gave me the hives, but this happens to me once in a while and has only culminated in my needing the emergency room and lots of shots of epi twice so it's mostly just annoying and I generally wake from a Benadryl coma hive-free) this morning even though he was up and down all night, er, indisposed, because even when he's cranky and sick he thinks I deserve a break most of the time.\u00a0 Oh wait, did I tell you we ALL HAVE THE STOMACH FLU?\u00a0\u00a0 I think I'll keep him.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, apparently Hotter stepped outside to call CVS about a prescription foul-up (presumably to play Good Cop before I woke up) and the MFA Children made use of his being out on the front porch to open up, root through and partially empty a box that had been sitting inside the (unused, clean and vacuumed out) fireplace in the family room.\u00a0 The box doesn't live there because we're that desperate for storage, but because what appears to be the flue for that stupid fireplace is on the bottom of it and doesn't close fully unless you weight it down, allowing cold air inside during the winter and camel crickets, skinks, and mosquitoes inside in the summer, something needed to go there and a heavy box that I'll never unpack (it contains everything I have saved from my life before the age of twenty-one, things I didn't have the heart to just destroy because SOMEone ought to care about them but don't really want that much because most of those years I've managed to wall off through a well-placed fugue of PTSD non-memory) worked well.\u00a0\u00a0 Until this morning.\u00a0\u00a0 I lurched out of bed, checked in with the children, who informed me that Hotter was outside on the phone, and went out to say good morning to my husband.\u00a0 When we both came back in Big Child (a.k.a. The Informer) came to report that his little brothers were \"going crazy\" and were convinced Santa Claus had come (The Informer still believes too, but gawd, y'all, he only comes at Christmas and have you stepped outside lately THIS IS NOT CHRISTMAS WEATHER).\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, my kids believe in Santa.\u00a0 I give them free reign to enjoy the secular magic associated with major retail holidays, because why should their being Jewish and my being a lifelong atheist to boot keep them from getting to believe in Santa?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Little Child came pounding down the hardwood flooring of our hall on his fat baby-feet and, wide-eyed, exclaimed that \"YES!\u00a0 Santa CAME BACK TO OUR HOUSE AND LEFT PRESENTS, he hid them inside a box RIGHT IN THE FIREPLACE which is totally from him because THAT IS HOW HE GETS IN and he left it there after he came down the chimney MOMMY LOOK MOMMY MOOOOOMMMMMYYYYY LOOK!\u00a0 He left us a map to where the rest of the presents are!\"\u00a0 Middly had slunk up quietly with his hands full of evidence, which Little Child proceeded to show me like a QVC presenter.\u00a0 \"SEE?\u00a0 And he put plastic on it in case we need to go outside wasn't that smart of him?\"\u00a0 It was a laminated child's drawing of a map of a house trailing yellowed tape-streamers, which I recognized as the cover to my first Young Authors Award submission when I was Middly's age.\u00a0\u00a0 Little Child went to grab the next item, but at that point, Middle Child couldn't contain himself and spoke up, too: \"SHARKTH TEESE, LOOK MOMMY THANNA BRING ME SHARKTH TEESE TO UTHE WHEN I BIL-DA SHARK!\u00a0 Thanna tricked me like it wuth a card but I untied it an got it open LOOK!\"\u00a0 He thrust a souvenir package of calligraphy nibs that I think The Narcissist bought at the Sistine Chapel when I was sixteen after she threw me out of the house at me, which were stitched into their stiff cardboard display packet, shaped like an envelope and shut with fabric ties.\u00a0 \"THEE HOW POINTY,\" Middle Child raved.\u00a0 \"Be careful Mommy!\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I gently explained what the things in the box were (at least the \"treasure map\" and the \"shark teeth\") and put them back into the box and replaced the lid.\u00a0 I haven't unpacked those in several moves and don't really want them, but as I have no family to hold these things dear on my behalf I hold onto them myself.\u00a0 Because I know my kids will really enjoy hearing about them sometime when I'm less overwrought and also not flu-stricken or in an antihistamine fog, god dammit.\u00a0\u00a0 Hotter apologized for letting the boys jump up in my grille before I'd had my pills or any caffeine, like they didn't do just that every day of their lives that they were with me prior to his coming along (read: 99% of their existence) and said that CVS had been kind enough to just offer to GIVE him two days' worth of medication until he can get a new prescription called in.\u00a0 \"They still fear you there,\" he said, shaking his head in awe.\u00a0 I said okay, I'd go pick that up, stepped into some pants and out the door.\u00a0\u00a0 I passed the local middle school on my way to the pharmacy and noticed what appeared to be a massive yardsale/fleamarket scenario going on in their parking lot.\u00a0 I am broke and never carry cash, but noticed some framed art and thought about how I could use a couple of frames...on the way back I decided to see if anything there spoke to me and whether I had enough quarters in my purse to be worth the stop.\u00a0\u00a0 The stop was worth it.\u00a0 They were getting ready to pack everything up and haul it to the dump due to the heat and lack of interest, and cheerfully invited me to go ahead and take anything I could haul off, which SCORE, Y'ALL!\u00a0 We rent one of the cheapest addresses in one of the most affluent school districts in town and there was a lot of NICE STUFF.\u00a0 I scored a flour-sifter, cheese cutter, set of wine glasses, rolling-ball foot massager (unused), mens' fedora in mint condition in its original box from the turn of the century (!!!), one of those brass desk lamps you used to see in libraries and banks, a floor lamp for the older boys' room, an onion/potato bin (solid wood with nice hardware trimmings), a few t-shirts and pairs of shorts for the boys, Operation and a couple of other games, and...AND...OMG Y'ALL THIS DESK!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I took the brass lamp off of it and admired it a moment, because it was huge and solid dark wood, with the dining-room table-sized top of it consisting of four or five massive thick planks stained dark walnut and ohhhh so pretty.\u00a0 Then I decided I couldn't even spare the twenty-five bucks and didn't have a way to get it home and left.\u00a0 Then I decided the desk would haunt me, and did a U-turn and came back and asked the men loading the furniture up what their bottom price was.\u00a0 \"Five bucks if you don't tell anyone, I just don't want to take it back to the storage place,\" said one guy. \u00a0\u00a0 This is where I preface the rest of this story by saying that a) it wasn't a yardsale to benefit the school but rather a church group of some kind and b) I get the dirty end of the wimmen-are-so-stupid stick enough that sometimes I feel like accepting the clean end to swing to my advantage is a pretty okay thing to do and possibly even karma in action.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0\u00a0 I smiled sweetly and said \"well in that case why don't I just take it \r\noff your hands as a favor,\" and he said alright but how will you move \r\nit.\"\u00a0 And reader, I got the toolkit out of the MFA Minivan and announced brightly that I'd just take it apart and shove it in in pieces (mind you, I saw no bolts or screws; this desk is pre-IKEA for sure and I wouldn't be surprised if it was older than I am), I mean how hard could THAT be!\u00a0 The older men running the sale were horrified and it took all of thirty seconds for one of them to volunteer to run the desk home for me in his truck if I lived close-by, and another to say he'd help lift it in, ma'am, why don't you get out of the sun, and just like that I showed up in Casa MFA's driveway home from my pharmacy run with a chase vehicle bearing a great hulking magnificent desk, and Hotter was gobsmacked but just shook his head and laughed.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 We were really happy for about thirty seconds and then the MFA Minivan blew up in the driveway.\u00a0 MFA Mechanic assured me via telephone that it \"just\" sounds like a \"hose blew\" but y'all there was a BOOM and then a cloud of furious steam and smoke hissing out for a good five minutes and ALL OF THE COOLANT LEAKED OUT.\u00a0\u00a0 Mother.\u00a0 Fucker.\u00a0\u00a0 The desk was a great find, though.\u00a0 Hotter's father refinished fine furniture for a living and taught him how to strip and refinish wood for fun and profit, and when Hotter got a chance to examine the desk himself (\"THIS IS SOLID WOOD!\u00a0 LOOK!\u00a0 LOOK HOW THICK IT IS!\") he popped a total boner and praised my eye and exclaimed over what a find the desk had been, so I'm managing to ignore the vehicular carnage for the moment and just, you know, revel in the stomach flu.\u00a0\u00a0 And oh what else, the peas are blooming, the beans are making tiny baby beans, I caught the skink that got into the house and released it, and...yeah.\u00a0 Anyway.\u00a0 Strange days, y'all.\u00a0 How are YOUR weekends going?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n

{"date": "June  7, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 Last month our finances here at Casa MFA were all \"ouch, crap, well stuff happens I guess but srsly MFA Minivan?\u00a0 Fine, so this month and next month will suck, I dig it.\"*\u00a0\u00a0 This month I am noticing that my husband (who started his tenure as MFA Alpha Male only about five months ago at the same weight-class I am in, that of \"red beans and rice din't miss ya but who cares about the extra ten pounds, that's an easy fix\") actually looks gaunt, and oh crap, he really is Not Healthy on top of having been smacked with the GI Flu and damn, you really will be having a staycation at Local Teaching Hospital when they go to fix this because no way are they letting him out the same day.* \u00a0 About that same-day thing (yes the Unseen Administration at Local Teaching Hospital really did book this originally as \"same-day surgery\" and sent us to the Acronymous Same-day Surgery Highlights Or Lowlights, Explained Simply branch of the hospital to have a nurse ask questions about Hotter's surgical history and a nurse-anesthetist tell him what to expect from general anesthesia.\u00a0 HA!\u00a0 Yes, really.\u00a0 And I was all \"But ASSHOLES, you realize the transplant team is performing the operation and I asked for the head of anesthesia due to Hotter's floppy airway, history of smoking, and rampant thus-far untreated sleep apnea, yes?\u00a0 I think we are in the wrong place.\u00a0 ASSHOLES aren't supposed to work with us, we've been at this so long we could RUN this piece\").\u00a0 The honest to Godiva truth of it, y'all, is that Hotter and I went to the meet-and-greet with the transplant surgeons with concrete agendas, which I guess you could say were a little bit different.\u00a0 Mine included making sure they were familiar with his case history, had accounted for known risks, were aware of his actual symptoms and the ways in which they veered from the usual presentation of Surgi-ma-callit-itis, and were as aggressive as we wanted them to be in correcting both current and potential surgical problems and making good use of the anesthesia time.\u00a0 Hotter's included \"making sure I get to leave the same day because man, I hate doctors and I WILL HAVE THE ANGRY FACE THE WHOLE TIME!\"\u00a0 So after I exchanged friendly fire with them over the nitty-gritty of what they'd be doing and the merits of not being pansies in general given how ugly this had the potential to become given Hotter's surgical history, current list of meds, sup-optimal functioning of one donor organ, and pitbull of a wife and they made some really big decisions about saving his life, when he stuck his lip out and asked about going home the brilliant minds with the golden hands looked at me like \"is he serious\" and I looked at them like \"dudes you are ALMOST OUT THE DOOR\" and they said \"potentially, in the remote hypothetical possibility wherein we could get this done laparoscopically and without any complications SUUUUUURE!\" and beat feet.\u00a0 And one of the trailing minions checked \"same-day surgery\" on a form and there you have it: ASSHOLES.\u00a0 Who were all \"OMG THEY CAN DO THAT KIND OF SURGERY NOW?\" and while I was extremely impressed with the nurse-anesthetist I am also just being a total cunt about MDeities Only and No Residents Please this time around because the margin for error here is very, very slim.\u00a0 The surgery is in one week and clearly Mama needs to lovingly redirect a certain major teaching hospital in that time.*\u00a0\u00a0 But hey, ALSO the finances this month?\u00a0 Are kind of like \"okay, well, we're as weak as a baby kitten and we've got an audience with the Pope, but hey what's the worst case scenario?\"\u00a0 Then the MFA Minivan was all jazz hands and we and the mechanic were both like \"just needs a hose, HAHA, that's what she said\" but guess what?\u00a0 It was really the radiator.\u00a0 Broke right in half.\u00a0 Well, shit.*\u00a0\u00a0 This leaves us, by which I pretty much mean me, with some very unpleasant choices to make in the seven whole days before Hotter's major surgery, involving things like selling jewelry and cancelling my Ladies' Social Media Convention plans and such, just to keep our heads above the water, and I has a big sad.\u00a0 I seriously got up this morning feeling wobbly and gassy but otherwise potentially okay, got the call from the mechanic, went back to sleep, and here I am.\u00a0 The MFA Children missed the bus and I let them stay home because the MFA Minivan isn't home and well screw it, they're just watching cartoons and having extra recess at this point anyway.\u00a0 And Hotter is pissy because he hates poverty and is about done with small boys and his wife being useless, and has already yelled at me about the money and how I need to make MFA Mechanic take payments or something twice and I'm all \"MFA Mechanic cuts me big breaks on labor as a favor and is a good guy but there's favors and then there's oral sex and financing a part he pays for up-front is more like oral sex than a favor and I don't feel comfortable asking MFA Mechanic for oral sex.\"\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Sigh.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://thebloggess.com/?p=2695"], "link":

WATCHING or anything cool like that (MFA Family: 0/Animal Kingdom: 1).\u00a0 The innernet informed me that rat snakes need to feel like they're ambushing their prey in order to eat voluntarily, and suggested providing a cereal box for Poe to hide in (as to what the innernet suggested if that did not induce Poe to eat the damn mouse, do your own search for \"feeding snakes\" and \"braining,\" or just take my word for it that the cereal box saved the damn snake's life).\u00a0 Apparently this did the trick, although why Poe felt the need to \"ambush\" a creature that spent all of its days dragging its nuts over his face in every direction is beyond me.\u00a0 Animals are ridiculous like that, I guess.\u00a0 I was elated though.\u00a0 Hotter was not.*\u00a0\u00a0 The chickens.\u00a0 Are growing.\u00a0 Like weeds.\u00a0 We still have to keep them inside at night, but they're getting a bit crowded in the box:\r\n  Figure One: It's gotten a little cramped in there since the last group photo.\u00a0\u00a0 During the day, they go out in their coop.\u00a0 They travel via paper bag:\r\n  Figure Two: \"Peep peep peep peep peeeeeep!\" (translation: \"fuck ALL of y'all!\")\u00a0\u00a0 They're also getting a little harder to handle.\u00a0 Mofos can FLY now!\u00a0 The MFA Children are always wanting to hold the chicks, who now want to get on your SHOULDER, and last night a chick tried to flap and scramble up onto Little Child's shoulder and scratched his face (just a tiny scratch, but it scared him).\u00a0 Little Child was all \"WHICH CHICKEN DID IT???\" and when I said Geronimo did he announced \"I don't WIKE Geronimo anymore!\" (MFA Family: 0/Animal Kingdom: 2).\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday was Tuesday, the two-week anniversary of the MFA Flock, and so I dutifully went outside to take a picture of Speck so that y'all could see how she's grown.\u00a0 The first week's picture was easy because the chickens were all stunned from their epic journey.\u00a0 The second week's picture I forgot to post because I had PMS and then Middle Child said something hilarious, but here it is:\r\n  Figure Three: Still pretty cute. \u00a0\u00a0 This week, though...I went outside and opened the door of the coop, and Speck (who has emerged as mama's clear favorite) came running out and hopped onto my wrist, and I went to take a picture, and here is what I got:\r\n  Figure Four: There was a chicken there a second ago, I swear...(MFA Family: 0/Animal Kingdom: 3)\u00a0\u00a0 I got about twenty more like that, and a couple like this:\r\n  Figure Five: \"PEEP!\" (translation: \"BITCH, WHAT THE FUCK!\")\u00a0\u00a0 But I didn't want y'all to think I was some kind of chicken-torturer wanted to get a shot of her sitting on my hand for consistency's sake (because I'm anal-retentive dedicated to blogging like that).\u00a0 So I chased the damn chicken around the yard casting aspersions upon her ancestors to the neighbors' great amusement for about half an hour (no lie) until I was drenched with sweat and she was panting from the effort of dodging the Blackberry and my stream of terse invective en route from my hand to my shoulder to the ground, rinse, lather, curse, repeat.\u00a0 I won't show you what I looked like at the end of the chase to preserve my pseudonymity, but Speck looked like this: \r\n  Figure Six: Much more humane.\u00a0 Not.*\u00a0\u00a0 As I staggered inside, perspiring and utterly defeated by a creature with a brain the size of a lentil, a damn skank got into the house, and it's still at large.\u00a0 Joy.\u00a0 (MFA Family: 0/Animal Kingdom: 4)\u00a0 I suppose I ought to clean behind the toilet.ETA: Imma leave that typo in because it's hilarious, but it was, in fact, a skink (thanks terri c.) and not a skank.\u00a0 My mother was not involved in this afternoon's shenanigans.\u00a0 I'm chalking the error up to my having just had my arse handed to me by a pullet which makes the score 0/6.*\u00a0\u00a0 Tonight the MFA Children are having dinner visitation with The XY, and Hotter and I went to Trader Joe's and then stopped at the nearby pet store to buy Poe another mouse.\u00a0 When we got home, we dumped the mouse into Poe's tank, turned our backs long enough to put the frozen food away, and the damn snake ate the damn mouse before it even acquired a blog-name AND WE MISSED IT AGAIN.\u00a0 BALLS!\u00a0 (MFA Family: 0/Animal Kingdom: 5)*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to go ahead and publish this before any of us is savaged by a wild boar or anything.\u00a0 How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n

(remember when I had that rebuilt for a million dollars last year?) but at least the radiator job cost thirty-five bucks more than I thought it would!*\u00a0\u00a0 Still, you will notice that I have not given up utterly on the Ladies Social Media Convention and still have my party badges up, because damn, if you had all of that on your dance-card would you let it go gently?\u00a0 Plus, my roommate keeps telling me I need to trust the universe more.\u00a0 She's a California hippy and shit; I'll be like \"we're both really broke, why the hell are we even buying tickets to this thing and sitting here drinking Starbucks and making plans when our water and power are probably cut off RIGHT THIS MOMENT?\" and she'll go all \"see, I'm a hippy, I trust the universe and it all works out, you need to TRUST THE UNIVERSE, MFA MAMA\" and when MFA Mechanic (who has become a friend, I won't lie; his wife has twin boys on the spectrum and we talk about our woes and I even shared my oral sex analogy with him and he laughed and said I was exactly right) asked me what I was going to do about all this (because he knows how grim things are and cringes when he gives me the bad news) I said that my spirit animal was a chubby-hot girl with devil-horns and she was suggesting that I trust the universe, and I was going to give it a try.\u00a0 So yeah, my mechanic thinks I'm nuts now but he'll live.*\u00a0\u00a0 I'm even having a contest!\u00a0 One of you here in the next day or few will become this blog's THREE HUNDREDTH COMMENTER and I will happily give you a Marx Fine Foods in Bulk (Wholesale Online) discount code for a fifth off your order from them, plus a little in fact which is a funny story:\u00a0 Justin Marx had this kickass idea and issued 20.09% discount codes for bloggers that he included in this sample \"the first hit is free\" package to bloggers who wanted in on it (packages of things like delicious gourmet sugars, salts, and dried chilis, which are pretty much better than drugs at Casa MFA).\u00a0 When I wrote to them in late 2009 that discount was No Longer Available (because in 2010 20.09% is just a funny-looking discount and they were thinking ahead) but I told Justin how I would be the PERFECT BLOGGER to review their stuff because I COOK LIKE A MOFO and I was MARRYING A CHEF and do you know how totally awesome Justin was?\u00a0 He sent me samples of EVERYTHING as a wedding present, and he even threw in some VANILLA BEANS because I mentioned how awesome they were and how I'd found his website searching for them online--two kinds, y'all, including the ones I used in Big Child's belated birthday cupcakes here and in this rice pudding and the infamous French Toast!!!\u00a0 In fact, that chili I made for our wedding guests?\u00a0 Those were Marx Foods ancho chilies in it.\u00a0 So they rock a lot and I use and love their products and they are also all about word-of-mouth in the online foodie community (see what I did with that?\u00a0 That is eight years of upper-level study of Creative Writing in action right there, and Justin is going \"and why did I throw in the extra vanilla beans aside from I'm so damn nice?\u00a0 I could have written that myself\" or really he's too nice to think such a thing, but sadly for him I'm the writer here and I'm telling it my way) and gave me this vintage discount code to pass along to one of you lovely people and it was like \"whoo!\u00a0 Exclusive!\" and then it was like \"whoa, bad things!\" and time went by and now I just look like more of a spazz than usual because 2009 was so six months ago but anyway I told y'all Hotter lost my Ritalin prescription so this is what you get until August.\u00a0 Way to go, Hotter.*\u00a0\u00a0 Justin Marx is probably out truffle-hunting with a virginal pig by the light of a waxing Pacific Northwest crescent moon or some-such shaking his fist at Hotter for that right now via satellite because this is the lamest blog-giveaway he's ever seen.\u00a0 Sorry about him, Justin, but if you had him making you dinner you'd forgive him for losing your methamphetamine prescription too.\u00a0 SO!\u00a0 To summarize, Justin Marx is too nice for his own good, but he runs a kickass company selling products I can personally vouch for and the three-hundredth commenter wins the discount code, and once you've looked at the Marx Foods website you will want that thing.*\u00a0\u00a0 If this was the movie version of my life some big fancy travel company would be all \"and that is exactly the kind of review we want her to write for US!\" and hook me and mom up with tickets to and from BlogHer '10, but if this was the movie version of my life then let's face it Hotter would be as brilliant outside of the kitchen and the bedroom as he is in them and I would have enough Ritalin to write well enough for that to happen AND probably I'd be played by Cameron Diaz.\u00a0 But instead Justin is wondering what he'd have to send me to never mention his company again and mom and I are trusting the universe to get us to NYC in August and Hotter is probably not putting out tonight, not that I'd give HIM any anyway, since this is pretty much his fault to begin with.Disclaimers: I did receive free sample products to review from Marx Foods, and accept from them a discount code to give away to a lucky reader, but they did not compensate me in any way for writing this review itself and no one except for me had any authority over editorial content.\u00a0 The words and ideas I have used here do not reflect the views of Marx Foods.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n

The school can absorb the cost of the book if she can't locate it, and I am aghast to hear of any member of my staff treating a child like that. I'm very sorry. Please tell him he can borrow any book he likes next week,\" she said as I left her office. I ran into Middle Child's Special Education case manager in the hallway after the meeting and she asked how the school year was going so far, so I told her and she was HORRIFIED. Horrified but not particularly surprised. Apparently Nasty Librarian no likey the Special Ed. kids. Which...well, I can't even. So the case manager is going to check in with Middly and speak to his classroom teacher, because as she put it, after asking me not to take it the wrong way, \"some kids can withstand that kind of treatment from an adult but Middle Child is not one of them; she CANNOT do that to him!\" Yes. THANK you, wonderful Special Education case manager, for getting it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The principal called me later in the day to follow up and said that she spoke to Nasty Librarian and told her in no uncertain terms not to say one single negative word about ANYTHING to ANY of my children ever again and to pass any necessary communications about any future problems that may come up through her office to me. \"She verbalized understanding of my expectation with regard to all of that,\" was how the principal put it, so yeah, we'll see. I plan to attend Middle Child's next class library session to keep an eye on things, and so does the Special Education case manager.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The dental work (which it turns out was not a root canal after all but something else hideously painful) went well from a results-oriented standpoint. My dentist insisted on trying some new kind of block on me, which succeeded in numbling the left side of my face all the way out to the cheekbone and up to the eyeball and paralyzing half of my upper lip for several hours but alas did not keep me from feeling what he did to That Tooth. It pretty much feels like I got punched in the face, but thanks to the temporary crown for the first time since March I don't LOOK that way :)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Other than that it's gray and rainy here to the point that we're under a floodwatch, I have a stomach bug and a migraine, and The Top Secret Job of Legally-Binding Confidentiality and Nondisclosure ended early. Booooo, life. I picked up the refill on my Pristiq today though, and by tomorrow I should hopefully be less miserable about it all. Hey, Thursday?

STOP IT AT ONCE!\r\n* \u00a0 A merchant I purchased something from charged us twice. I pointed it out and they said the soonest they could fix it was Friday.

Eff.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm having a root canal tomorrow as part of the crown-prep, which on the whole YAY because OMG FINALLY and also THANK YOU, BRIGHTER.COM! But that said, and with the caveat that I KNOW I ought to just be grateful, I am not looking forward to this. Because, well, nobody enjoys a root canal. On top of which I am immune to dental anesthetics so I'm going to feel the whole effing thing. And also my dentist is a very sweet and gentle man who truly hates working on me because he hates hurting people, so I'm going to have to try and play it off all \"NO REALLY IT'S FINE\" for his benefit, because I don't want to make him feel bad or, worse, say he can't go on because it's inhumane. Again, this is a HAPPY THING for the most part because not having a front tooth sucks and so does all of the toothache with (almost) none of the tooth, and I promise and swear that I am incredibly happy and grateful to be able to get this done...I'm just dreading the actual doing bit.\r\n* \u00a0 I'm still gutted--GUTTED--over what happened yesterday. I've e-mailed the principal and let her know we urgently need to have a sit-down, because that's the next step up the chain of command and if I'm going to go over her head I have to let her fail first (gee, is my lack of optimism showing?).\r\n* \u00a0 Because life loves me, I was supposed to pick up a refill of the medication that keeps me from being a panicky, pessimistic wreck 24/7 today, but now I can't until tomorrow when I get paid thanks to that merchant effing up. Which...great and also OH HAHA, THIS KIND OF CHAIN-REACTION CLUSTERFUCK WOULD BE KIND OF COMICAL IF IT WAS HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE. Missing even one dose of that stuff has a catastrophic effect on my general outlook, and at this point I think I can objectively say I have every right to be in a shit mood, but by tomorrow I'm going to be in The Bad Place regardless, so...yeah. I think Imma shut it for a couple of days until I have something less Eeyore to say.\r\n* \u00a0\u00a0It's gray and rainy here, and supposed to be ALL WEEK LONG.

{"date": "November 15, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDear Sir:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hi there! It's me, the lady who you ran into at the high school soccer field earlier this evening. You know, the one powerwalking with the dog on a leash, who your two dogs came galloping up to out of nowhere in the dark? They seemed like nice dogs, and you seemed like a nice guy, so I'm not going to be rude or anything, but I really wish you'd leash them when you take them walking at night.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0See, I am a dog person. I have two dogs myself (a guard breed and a mutt also) and I like dogs in general. So I didn't freak out when your dogs rushed at me, and knew to stand my ground and wait for you to come over and tell me that they were friendly before I tried to pet either of them. If I'd been afraid of dogs and carrying mace, that's the first point where your failure to leash your dogs could have ruined both our evenings.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I was glad you came running over immediately with your flashlight to supervise your pets, but I was a little taken aback when you asked anxiously whether my dog was male or female. It was a relief when you said that the Doberman wouldn't \"mess with\" a girl dog, but half the time I go powerwalking in the field where we met I have a boy dog with me, and what would have happened THEN? That's the second point where your failure to leash your dogs could have ruined both our evenings.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The third point wasn't really an issue, because my girl dog is friendly and obedient, and sat on command at my feet rather than trying to roughhouse with or dominate either of your dogs, but you know how I pretended not to hear when you asked what kind of dog I had? That's because I worry about other people making assumptions due to the fact that Isis is a pitbull (you may not have been able to tell because her ears are not cropped; I wish your Doberman's ears hadn't been either because that's really ouchy, although I'm not necessarily judging YOU as for all I know your Doberman was a rescue). She was raised in a loving home by a responsible owner, and she's the friendliest dog I know, but my next-door neighbor has an unneutered male pit that he sometimes walks in the area, and he's a little LESS responsible than I am. I don't think he fights the dog or anything or I would have called the police on him, but my point is that when you chose to let your dogs run loose in that field you didn't know if someone would come along walking a Chihuahua they would have viewed as a tasty snack or a mastiff that would have viewed them as a tasty snack. You never know what's going to be on the end of someone else's leash (or, you know, orbiting them freely in a radius the approximate size of a city block, as the case may be) and that is another reason why it's a good idea to keep your dogs on leashes (well, that and it's the law, although I'm not going to get preachy about the law as technically we were both trespassing).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Finally, while it may not have ruined anyone's evening TONIGHT, how do you know my dog wasn't carrying something contagious that your dogs could have caught from her, and for that matter how do I know YOUR dogs aren't carrying something contagious that she could have caught from one of THEM? You don't. Maybe the reason one of us was walking our pet in a deserted high school soccer field was that they had bordatella from a stay in a kennel and couldn't go to a dog park. That's not why I was there, and I didn't hear either of your dogs coughing, and my dog has had the bordatella vaccine, but that particular vaccine isn't the MOST reliable (don't get me wrong, it's still worth getting for your pet, I just worry because my dog has a weak immune system).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In conclusion, while nobody's evening was ruined tonight, you're placing yourself and your animals at risk physically and legally by not leashing them. I get that you probably work all day and your dogs need the exercise, and I know it's fun to see them run, but it's really not worth the potential ramifications, particularly if, like both of us, one of your dogs is a guard or fighting breed. People make assumptions about these dogs that can cause them to be rude, belligerent, or fearful, and none of those things lead anywhere good. I would never let MY dog run loose in public, even if no one seemed to be around, because while the only way she'd ever hurt anyone is by accidentally tripping them up or bowling them over exuberantly, and that may well be true of your Doberman as well, that's not generally going to be someone's first assumption when they see a large, muscular dog come barreling toward them in the dark. If I had to judge you as a pet owner based on the five minutes I interacted with you and your dogs I'd say you seemed fairly caring and attentive, but you still put me and my dog at risk and I don't appreciate it one little bit. Please be more responsible and considerate of others in the future. Sincerely, MFA Mama\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/an-open-letter-to-the-guy-with-the-doberman-and-the-mutt.html", "title": "an open letter to the guy with the Doberman and the mutt"},

{"date": "November 19, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 Thank you, from the bottom of my black little heart, for the e-mailed and Twitter-DMed offers of cash, help with \"the system,\" contacts in high places, etc. You are wonderful people. Let's not all rally to Do Something just yet, though; while I can't rule out the possibility that I'll ask anyone and everyone for anything and everything they can do or give if it comes to it, at this point I think we should all hold off on doing anything drastic until we know for sure that \"the gap\" applies to Hotter's situation.\r\n* \u00a0 After reading up on the \"extra help\" criteria, I don't see how he WON'T re-qualify (he has received \"extra help\" up until now because he was on Medicaid for a while before we got married, and being on Medicaid AND receiving Social Security benefits automatically qualifies you). It may be (and I am hoping LIKE HELL) that this only a matter of us needing to go through the application process (which we have already done online), and the letter Hotter received yesterday was just to let him know what would happen if he did NOT qualify. According to the online assessment thingamajig he \"probably\" qualifies. So let's all just hold onto the hope that he will qualify, and that I will stay sane while we wait to find out (yesterday I had my first panic attack in over a year, and lordamercy it was a doozy).\r\n* \u00a0 For several days now, my right upper arm area has ached the way it does when I've just had a shot (like a flu or tetanus one). The last shot I had was several weeks ago, and was in the OTHER arm. The pain isn't particularly debilitating, doesn't get better or worse with exertion or changing position, and there isn't any bruising or other discoloration of the skin over the area (although if I press it does get a lot worse for a few minutes). So it's not a big deal, it's just kind of \"there.\" What gives, body? Why you gotta do me like that?\r\n* \u00a0 I think I have solved the problem of The One Who Dislikes Me by giving her a small gift of a type of electronic charger I heard her say she was looking to acquire (I had one because I used to have the type of equipment it charges, but I no longer have that equipment so it was of no use to me; I figured at the very least giving it to TOWDM was better than sending it to a landfill). The charger was not the standard model, but rather a nicer type that I'd purchased through an after-market source, and TOWDM was thrilled with it. Since I gave that to her she's been much nicer to me; she is still fundamentally lacking in the sense of humor department, but that's okay. I can handle humorless but friendly; it's humorless and HOSTILE that gets to me. Between that and someone's brilliant idea to bring Stalky up with HR myself so that it's on record in case some wacky accusations come in from an unidentified source I would ABSOLUTELY take a permanent job at PseudoCorp if one was offered to me.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Temp Agency got back to me with \"the job is ongoing for the time being,\" which gives me absolutely nothing to go on, and I finally decided to go the white lie route and told my boss at PseudoCorp's assistant that I'd gotten a call about an interview for a job that wasn't better than PseudoCorp but was, you know, at least a JOB and wouldn't dream of going IF PSEUDOCORP NEEDS ME because I LOVE the company, but the month I was quoted during the interview is up next week and therefore I need to know if I'm done with the company next week or if they would like me to stay on longer. I made sure to tell her to please make it clear I wasn't trying to run out on PseudoCorp AT ALL, but just, you know, needed to know whether to go on said interview.\r\n* \u00a0 The boss's assistant DID say it was news to her that I'd been told I was there for only a month, and that the vacant job position TOWDM is covering \"until we find a replacement\" (this is allegedly why PseudoCorp brought me in, to cover for TOWDM while she covered for that position) hasn't even been POSTED yet, which would seem to imply that they need me to hang around, and also that she'd only heard positive things about my performance from the higher-ups and would be shocked if they didn't want me to stay on for at least the forseeable future. So there's that.\r\n* \u00a0 Maybe they're thinking of promoting TOWDM to the vacant position and hiring me on to do TOWDM's old (and my current) job? That would be pretty awesome. Once I thought about not having the job any longer I realized that it's really grown on me, and a lot of the perks (the building is gorgeous and offers spectacular views, is near a super-nice public park that I can walk through on my lunch hour on nice days and has a secure and enclosed parking garage I can walk through on my lunch hour on rainy/snowy days, and while it took some adjustment on my part I'm coming to enjoy the corporate culture) are very agreeable. Plus I imagine that if they offered me something fulltime it would entail benefits and ohhhhhh beeeennnnnefiiiiiiiiiits...even if they just kept me on indefinitely as a temp the money is good enough that I don't have to worry about losing my self-paid coverage, and that would be a huge load off my mind (assuming \"the gap\" doesn't apply to Hotter, in which case we all panic because life is shit and OMG).\r\n* \u00a0 One positive thing came of all the panic over \"the gap;\" Hotter announced that he \"had some feelings\" and went out and started kicking the shit out of the busted back-hatch of the MFA Minivan. I didn't expect it to do any good but seeing as how my LAST husband would have kicked the shit out of me or one of the children didn't say anything to dissuade him, and he actually bent the hatch in such a way as to render it functional again. WHOO TITS!\r\n* \u00a0 I have to go and transport the turkeys (minus Thanksgiving), two ducks, and half a dozen chickens plus the parts of the pen they reside in to my boss at Temp Agency #2's house about an hour away. Loud and Crazy the turkey will be riding in a giant burlap sack. WISH ME LUCK because I AM GOING TO NEED IT. If you hear about a minivan full of poultry going off an overpass on the news and I never post again, you'll know why.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/braindump.html", "title": "braindump"},
{"date": "November 20, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Well, we got the poultry moved. It wasn't easy (think all of the parts to a 7x12 chain link enclosure, ten birds, three kids, plus Hotter and me packed into the MFA Minivan at once for a long drive to the middle of nowhere) or pretty (turns out tom turkeys don't enjoy being bundled into giant burlap sacks--WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED?) but we got it done. My boss texted me this morning to let me know that Loud and Crazy was puffed up and gobbling and scared the crap out of her horses (whoops--she's more amused than annoyed, though) and she got two eggs already. Heh.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As some of you already know, I mentioned the poultry exodus on the facespace and Lefty (my prodigal stepson) decided the time was ripe for a flame war (apparently he takes exception with my blaming his IDIOT UNCLE for the deaths of the first wave of refugees). So I unfriended and blocked him, because life is too short to suffer fools regardless of relation by blood or marriage. Hotter was all \"OMG ARE YOU THAT DEFENSIVE, HE'S JUST BEING HIS SARCASTIC SELF\" and I was all \"apparently so! Or alternately: he is an irresponsible, entitled, shiftless little punk and I'm still pissed about him complaining when I couldn't take a weekend off with zero notice that one time he wanted to have a party and calling me and the boys your 'fake family' and am also sick of having to defend my right to work like a goddamn dog to provide for us. Either way? BLOCKED!\" Then he backpedaled some with \"well I'm fine with it if you don't wanna associate with him\" and I was all \"good because it wouldn't make any difference if you weren't!\" So yeah, everybody was an asshole. GO US!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm kind of conflicted here. On the one hand, I feel for Lefty, because his mother is an unmedicated bipolar waste of skin and breast implants and he and I have that in common, plus I think somewhere deep down under all of the tattoos and bad attitude he's a good egg. I probably shouldn't take much of what he says personally, because he'd probably be jealous and resentful of me and the boys regardless, and I am the grownup and all that noise. I've become fiercely protective of my own serenity, though, and can't say I particularly regret anything. I guess I just wish things were different and everybody could get along a little better.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Oh well. It was nice to have a day off to spend with my family yesterday, and I'm making the most of my lazy Sunday morning today (I'm working an event for Temp Agency #2 later on). It looks like Hotter and the boys aren't the only ones who miss having me around more:\r\nFigure One:\u00a0She's been in my lap, on my feet, or snuggled up to me like this most of yesterday and today.

{"date": "November 16, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I don't know what is going on with my job. Temp Agency #1 thought it was temp-to-hire (and therefore so did I, initially). PseudoCorp said \"maybe a month, maybe after that part-time, we'll see,\" so I adjusted my expectations accordingly. But come to find out the temp before me was there for six months (and apparently sucked), then she quit and they hired me, and there have pretty much always been two people doing my job (currently it's me and The One Who Dislikes Me, who has been there for over a year but started off as...a temp). So I don't know if that means PseudoCorp is hedging their bets in case I suck and keeping me as a temp to see what kind of worker I am before they offer me a job outright, or is one of those places (and there are many) that THINKS the temp is temporary but always has a temp and therefore you can stay as long as you do good work, or lied to Temp Agency #1 in order to get one of their better workers, or what. I asked Temp Agency #1 to see if they could find anything out, and if they don't get a straight answer I guess I'll ask my boss myself when it's been a month? I dunno. This is all further complicated by the fact that I don't love working at PseudoCorp (well...if PseudoCorp and I were in a relationship on the facespace it'd say \"it's complicated;\" I don't think I dislike the job itself so much as I am growing to loathe The One Who Dislikes Me, who was downright nasty to me today for no good reason).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If PseudoCorp offered me a fulltime job with benefits tomorrow I honestly don't know what I'd say. I mean, on one hand steady income would be fantastic, obviously, but on the other hand I don't want a job that makes me miserable with no end in sight, and I think PseudoCorp might eventually do just that (although if I was a fulltime employee and had some job security I think I'd have an easier time handling The One Who Dislikes Me, because we'd be on more equal footing and I could call her on her rudeness, and to be fair to PseudoCorp TOWDM is 80% of what makes me not love the job and the other 20% I could totally live with).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I think part of my dilemma is that for all of the uncertainty it entails I really like being a temp for multiple agencies; it means it's pretty much impossible for Stalky to somehow find out where I work and threaten my livelihood (again, some more). I don't like to admit it on here knowing that she reads, but Stalky has changed the way I look at life: I like to be a moving target. Standing still for too long makes me antsy. If I could afford it I'd move, and I've even seriously considered changing my name. Taking a job with no end date in sight would make me vulnerable in a way that I'm currently not, and not having to worry about Stalky somehow getting me fired has worked wonders for my mental health.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Maybe it's a good thing this is all so unsettled for now.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/complicated.html", "title": "complicated"},

If you don't, you should. A TON of online merchants participate, and you can even go to their site and search by the product you want to buy to see which member sites offer it, what they charge, and what coupons, if any, are available. We buy a ton of stuff through drugstore.com (which is today's DOUBLE CASH BACK vendor--usually you get 6% in eBates for shopping there but today it's 12%), which gives you free shipping for orders over $25. And they don't just sell typical drugstore items, they sell electronics, small appliances, snacks...just a ton of stuff.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Here is where I become your new best friend. If you sign up for eBates (and by using that link, you give me a $5 referral credit, which obviously brightens MY day), then go to \"coupons\" and d for Drugstore.com, there's one right now that gives new customers 20% off of any order. Which means that if you need a big-ticket item like a video game console or a new heater now that it's getting chilly or whatever, you get:\r\n12% in cash back from eBates + the $5 sign-up bonus20% off your order from Drugstore.com5% in \"drugstore.com dollars,\" which they apply to your account and let you use as cash at the end of the month (you get a 30-day window during which to spend them)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, I'm kind of jealous of any of you who aren't already Drugstore.com customers, because all *I* get is the 12% cash back and the 5% in drugstore dollars (plus the free shipping), but I'll live.

Actually I was wild about the idea at first; sneering left and right at other parents who were having a harder time with their babies embracing the brave new world of social media in the classroom.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That stage lasted all of ten minutes. Which is how long it took my kid to join his classmates in collaborating on a fan-page for their teacher. They were each posting their favorite things about her, and I was still loving it at that point, because awwwww and YAAAAY, but then Big Child asked me how to spell \"emotional\" and I started to worry. A few minutes later, he brought his laptop into my room to confirm my worst fears.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"How does this sound, Mommy,\" asked my kid who has recently hit five feet and is starting to get blackheads (WTF? Noooo), \"My favorite thing about Mrs. Teacher is that she does not yell at her students and says she never will because she does not like to be yelled at. I especially don't like when adults yell* because I hate yelling and also I am very emotional and start to tear up any time someone yells at me or even just around me.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Uhhh...crap. This is where Big Child's developmental delay makes him a prime target for schoolyard bullies. I go back and forth a lot on whether to try and help him avoid catching grief for his unselfconscious naivete or whether that's something he just has to learn to do on his own, but in the end I'm his mother and I just don't want anyone to hurt my baby.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, son, here's the thing about revealing stuff about yourself on the innernet,\" I began, trying to choose my words with care--\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"THE INTERNET IS FOREVER, I KNOW,\" he said, wearily.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, yes it is. But more than that, the innernet is accessable to everyone, whether they like you or not, and therefore you want to be careful what you put out there. Because anything you write that someone could use to hurt or embarrass you CAN AND WILL come back to bite you in the butt.\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. \"I think you could maybe just say that you hate yelling and leave it at that.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Why?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Because...well, kids are horrible, and our ER copayment is a lot of money--\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"MO-mmy!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"I just don't want to see you get hurt, your feelings OR your face! It's up to you what you write on there, but...just think about it, okay?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then Hotter totally undermined my parenting by telling the kid to write what he felt, because he had a lot more respect for someone who came right out and said what they believed, and anyone who had a problem with that wasn't a good friend anyway, and Big Child was all \"thanks Hotter, I really needed to hear that\" and they man-hugged and Big Child went to bed.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"THANKS A LOT,\" I told my idiot husband, after we finished making the rounds tucking everyone in and kissing foreheads. \"They're going to KILL HIM, you know.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah.

It sucks.\r\n* \u00a0 Today a red beverage exploded on me at work and drenched my shirt, my newest pair of pants, THE PURSE, and The Precious. To say I was not amused would have been an understatement; this motherfucking beverage basically assaulted every non-living thing I hold dear. I nearly cried, especially after Googling said beverage and finding that it is notorious for exploding on people and staining things indelibly. Fortunately, the Otterbox saved The Precious and Oxiclean saved everything else. YAY, OXICLEAN! BOO, SPARKLING ICE BLACK RASPBERRY WITH EXTRA RED #40!\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 To try and shake myself out of the doldrums (and burn off angst from some fuckery on the part of the men of the planet) (The XY is being a tool and Hotter has lately confused his role as the resident Jackass Whisperer with being the resident Jackass Advocate), I started the Couch to 10k workout program today. YAY, RUNNING! Unfortunately, BOO, COUCH TO 10K! I found the app (a NON-FREE one, no less!) to be anything BUT user-friendly, and ended up programming the intervals it seemed to be suggesting for Day One, Week One into Runkeeper (which is free, which would seem to defeat the purpose of paying for Couch to 10K). You win some, you lose some, I guess. The good news is, I went running (or run-walk-run-walk-run-walkOMGing) and did not die. My legs felt alright. My lungs were a little bitchy. I had way too much jiggle going on. But I did it!\r\n* \u00a0 I was ready for it to be Friday yesterday.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Chia seeds are my new favorite thing ever. SO delicious. I mentioned this on the facespace and people's reactions were divided between \"HELL YEAH!\" and \"what do you do with them?\" So yeah, you put them in smoothies or float them in beverages (I like them in kefir, both the milk and the water kinds). If you float them in beverages they swell up and sort of en-goo-ify to a tapioca consistency. So if you are skeeved out by tapioca they are not for you, but I happen to love the stuff! Textural bliss aside, the things are packed with Omega 3s and fiber.\r\n* \u00a0 k mentioned today on the Twitter that she wanted a soda fountain, a Murphy bed, and a butler for her office. Doesn't that just sound fabulous? I think I would like the same.\r\n* \u00a0 Condescending Wonka is cracking me up. The Northface jacket one is a classic, but this one may just be my favorite. Of course, this one is kind of awesomely meta...\r\n* \u00a0 I have a post brewing about my hatred of Banfield Pet Hospital...but I'm pissy enough today without getting into all of that hot mess.\r\n* \u00a0 Like right now? My ex-husband is sweating my jock via rather aggressively via text message about my youngest's shoes, which he claims are irreparably damaged.

The devil made me do it!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So today I set about doing some of the many wonderful things I have discovered on the Pinterest, and so far I've been pleased with all of them. First I made this; my parsley survived the winter in fine style, and the fresh parsley really adds to the flavor nicely; I used homemade white-balsamic vinaigrette as my dressing, substituted white kidney beans for the chickpeas since that is what I had in the pantry, and crumbled in a little feta. SO GOOD! I packed it up into five little tubs for my work lunches this week. Then I went out and put a HURT on the DIRT! I got a small bed ready to plant (cleared away weeds and hauled them to the compost pile, dug down and removed encroaching roots, turned some organic vermiculite into the soil, and spread a layer of last year's dark, rich compost overtop) and used this little trick when I set out my cabbage seedlings. Not only will it help prevent the cabbage moths from eating my plants, but I also found it helpful to position the squares of waxed carton before transplanting the seedlings to ensure even spacing.\r\nFigure One: Look at that gorgeous compost!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Here is one of my little seedlings wearing its waxed-cardboard cabbage-moth shield.\r\nFigure Two: Double eco-nerd points for pesticide-free pest-control measures AND re-using the milk carton itself (our locality does not recycle these).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And yes, I know, the cold weather isn't TOTALLY over. That is why I covered the bed up with a hoop-tunnel when I'd finished planting my seedlings and surrounded them with freshly-planted radish and clover seeds:\r\nFigure Three: All tucked in until after the last frost date!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Finally, we finished a bunch of celery today and I planted the base of it like this. I'm getting kind of a crap germination rate on celery this year, so I really hope it works--if it does I'll just plant the base of each bunch as we use it and in theory I'll end up being able to harvest new celery at the same rate we go through the store-bought bunches! So neat.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What have YOU done after seeing it on the Pinterest? How did it turn out? And how the heck was your weekend? I'd really like to know!\r\n\u00a0\r\nP.S. We took Isis's cone off this evening, since she's pretty well healed up and her stitches can come out on Thursday. She's delighted to be able to lick her arse again, the nasty dog.

PLEASE go to the doctor.\" So I went to Urgent Care where a twelve-year old MD gave me a diagnosis of severe allergies and a stern lecture on the evils of overusing antibiotics, and said he bet my ears hurt based on the way my eardrums were bulging, but that it was \"clear fluid\" from the allergies and I ought to get myself some Actual Sudafed and change from generic Claritin to generic Allegra or Zyrtec and see how that worked for me.

They could not, but she had the front desk call me back and read me a note from her saying that if I was willing to come in it MUST be bad, she was leaving me a sample of Symbicort at the front desk, and we both knew that if that and albuterol nebs weren't helping then I needed the ER. LOVE. HER.\r\n* \u00a0 Yesterday I was able to do my run without having an asthma attack, which was a major victory.\r\n* \u00a0 After my run yesterday afternoon I planted ten feet of beets and ten feet of turnips. Whoo, root vegetables! Also a bed of beans.\r\n* \u00a0 Today? Oh my lands, y'all, today I planted fifty-three strawberry plants and many borage seeds before breakfast, then dug up a row, dug and hauled two loads of compost, planted my fertilized row with onions and bush beans, dug two wheelbarrows full of crabgrass from the front walk and garden, planted leeks, fennel, two kinds of shallots, horseradish, moonvines, and a triamble squash seedling, and my lungs finally let me know that they were DONE but holy cow I am pleased with the day!\r\n* \u00a0 There's also this:\r\nFigure One: Tonight Hotter and I are grilling a couple of porterhouses and I am having some hard cider, and I am not going to feel even a LITTLE bit bad about that!\r\n* \u00a0 Speaking of weight and calories and things, MyFitnessPal is A-MA-ZING (you can SCAN BARCODES OF FOODS to enter them!), I am updating the weight ticker again, and I think the reason it's moving so slowly is that I'm building muscle like crazy as I lose fat, so that's all good!\r\n* \u00a0 Funny story: I am using kelp meal as fertilizer for the first time this year, because I have heard wonderful things about it. It has a tendency to make the yard smell like a fishmarket though, especially when I water things I've used it on. Hotter and I were standing outside on the porch and I remarked that the kelp meal sure was stinky in the manner of yucko rotten fish and he said \"OH THANK GOD, I THOUGHT...well, you're really working up a sweat and...I didn't realize the kelp stuff...well.

My Pinterest-inspired lunch today was lovely, however, and my angst-fueled attack on the garden resulted in an entire front bed weeded/rooted/vermiculite-and-composted. So there's that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Plus I went running. Which, ugh. My legs feel fine! My lungs are another story. What the stinking hell, lungs? This run and the last one I was juuuust on the verge of quitting and heading home to the nebulizer the ENTIRE TIME. The only reason I didn't is that I'm a stubborn asshole the burning/tightness didn't progress to actual wheezing. Also, the Couch to 10k app's crazy-assed run-walk-run-walk-run-walkOMG system is well-suited to asthmatic runners in that the walk intervals give you time to cough up a lung and catch your breath in between the run intervals. I don't know if this is just my lungs' way of being all \"damn, bitch, we're not so sure about this exercising again thing\" or whether the recent sickness knocked them down a peg or what; it's been months since my lungs got in the way of my doing anything I wanted to do...I am not liking this! Hopefully they just have to relearn to deal with cardio? I did start taking a daily antihistamine in case it's pollen-related, but that hasn't made any difference (although I'll probably continue it at least until I stop having so damn much trouble, since in my experience that's the first thing an allergy/asthma specialist would have me try anyway). The day after tomorrow is going to be a real bitch, because it's the first day of a new Cto10k week, which seems to be designed to make you feel fortunate for the REST of the week that it isn't Day One. I may go ahead and use the nebulizer BEFORE that one...\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How was YOUR Monday?

{"date": "March 19, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 The good thing about being a temp, or one of the good things anyway, is that generally even if you make an ass of yourself to your writes-the-paychecks boss, if you're golden with your tells-you-what-to-do boss (these are always two different people) it doesn't matter a bit, and vice versa. Today, half-delirious with what passes for a fever according to my craptastic immune system (yeah, when my eardrum ruptured I was at 98.8 and yesterday at Urgent Care I was 98.2...maybe my thyroid is sucking more than usual?) and hopped up on antihistamines and decongestants, I managed to inadvertently act the fool with BOTH OF THEM. I also, at one point, had to Google the word \"windshield\" to ascertain the correct spelling. It was THAT BAD, TEH DUMB. Mind you, both my writes-the-paychecks boss and my tells-me-what-to-do boss think I'm fabulous on the whole, and this was more of a \"WTF, MFA Mama?\" than anything along the lines of a costly or humiliating error in both cases, but...yeah. BOTH feet in my mouth today. Awesome!\r\n* \u00a0 I dragged my arse home and proceeded to try and salvage the day, biking to the grocery store and coming home and planting garlic and spinach and then mowing for half an hour. No, I'm not TOTALLY insane. See, if Doogie Howser, MD had been correct about the OMGSEVEREALLERGIES yesterday, I would DEFINITELY have had an asthma attack. I didn't even wear a mask while mowing. And I was FINE. Yes, I am on tons of medication including albuterol and inhaled steroids and generic Allegra and whatnot to prevent me from reacting badly to allergens, but I think if I was this sick from allergies I would've gone tits-up in the yard AND I DIDN'T. This is actually a huge win, in that if I was suddenly going to have severe, debilitating, sick-in-bed allergies it would put a real damper on my gardening and exercising and pretty much surviving. The bad news is, Doogie was wrong and I'm sick, but then we already pretty much knew that.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Then we had a charge hit our bank account that neither Hotter nor I made. Not a big charge, but it definitely wasn't one of us. EFFF! We called the bank immediately and had them shut down the debit card the charge was linked to (Hotter's), and we're filing a claim with the fraud department. Lovely.\r\n* \u00a0 Then the whole freezer thawed itself for no apparent reason. Because WHY THE FUCK NOT?\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Also, and I'm going to be vague here, because there's a possibility we'll all change health insurers in the next six months and this isn't likely to be taken care of anytime soon, but someone in our household (no, not a child) needs surgery and the out-of-pocket after insurance would be about $1,500. That's obviously out of the question right now, and while said surgical issue is not even REMOTELY life-threatening, it has grown increasingly painful and would be stupid-easy to fix. I mean, this could be done with local anesthesia. It's SO DUMB. I don't think The Patient is going to permanently lose any function or suffer anything more than constant minor (like, four and under on the infamous pain scale) discomfort, so it could absolutely be MUCH WORSE, but...well, it's still a real pisser. And I feel like a loser because we live in the first-world and I should be able to get things like this taken care of when they happen to a member of my family, and I can't even really complain about it around the water-cooler at work, because that kind of problem is so totally foreign to the 1%ers I work with. I can't even fully vent about it on my blog, because it might (or maybe not, I haven't researched it) constitute a pre-existing condition and should our insurance situation change before it's been dealt with I wouldn't want Stalky to be able to describe The Situation to my new insurer. This...thing...is something that's been a part of The Patient's life for years and years, and didn't suddenly get worse today or anything, but when I am sick or stressed or both things like this get to me a lot more. Boooo.\r\n* \u00a0 Tomorrow is transplant-neuro-dental-appointmentfest, possibly with a side of DMV, and I'm not even kidding.

Fortunately the medication worked like a charm, rendering the tooth a total non-issue and the migraine at least bearable (in conjunction with some forbidden NSAIDs) (my H&H are fabulous, so I was less worried about the potential for unusual bleeding than I was about the agony of the migraine).

Visit their Facebook page here to learn about their charitable partners and decide which cause Walgreens will donate to with a quick vote.\r\n********************************************************************************************************************\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As y'all know, I occasionally do sponsored posts through Clever Girls Collective, and when I saw this opportunity I jumped at it, because as y'all know we here at Casa MFA have had our share of experience with Things Medical. I thought I'd go with the general pharmacy theme and talk about medications and some things to always do and never do when it comes to them, and asked a physician-friend to collaborate with me and share some of her own pet peeves. Here's what we came up with (Dr. Anon's words are in bold).\r\n* \u00a0 Don't try to bully your doctor into prescribing anti-biotics for a virus (like a cold); they won't work. Viruses aren't living organisms the way bacteria are, and therefore don't respond to medication that kills live organisms. Occasionally a physician will prescribe an antibiotic to a vulnerable person who has a virus - that's to prevent bacteria from taking advantage of someone who's already down with a virus; this is sometimes done for someone who is elderly, immunosuppressed, or very young. But if you're generally young and healthy, the best thing to get rid of your cold is rest, lots of clear fluids, and TIME. Preach, sister! This is where I jump in and interject my two cents: overuse of antibiotics (such as when physicians prescribe them to shut someone up) contributes to the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria like MRSA, VRE, and other nasties that can KILL YOU DEAD or just make you WISH you were dead (I've had systemic MRSA and can personally attest to how wretched it is). Either way the best way to avoid these infections (besides good hygiene, especially after working out in a gym) is to ONLY use antibiotics when a doctor has deemed them necessary. Your doctor wants you to get better and if you need the drugs, they'll prescribe them!\r\n* \u00a0\u00a0PLEASE take all doses of an antibiotic your doctor told you to take, even if you're feeling better half way through the doses. This keeps you from developing a resistant infection, which is harder to treat, often takes nastier medication, and can even land you in the hospital. She is SO not kidding, y'all. MRSA. IT'S EVIL.\r\n* \u00a0 Cholesterol medications are often incompatible with that morning grapefruit - that includes grapefruit juice - which can actually keep the medicine from working!\r\n* \u00a0 Don't lie about alcohol consumption; many medications when combined with alcohol can be dangerous or fatal. For example, medications like Warfarin that prevent blood clots and strokes when combined with ongoing alcohol consumption can lead to internal bleeding; even benign over the counter medications like Benedryl when combined with alcohol can lead to fatal car accidents. Some medications in combination with even a single drink contain enough alcohol to put you over the safe driving limit in some states. If your doctor asks about how much alcohol you drink and how often she's not trying to catch you out or judge you - she's trying to make sure your medication doesn't kill you.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Carry an index card with the names of the medications you take regularly and the doses; at appointments, your doctor can check for drug interactions before prescribing anything new, and if you should be in an accident and unable to speak for yourself, you can be started on your medications right away. Hotter and I, uh, don't do this, and with him being on a ton of medications including things like anti-rejection drugs and seizure meds where missing even a single dose could have grave repercussions...well, I'll be making us some wallet cards tonight. Thanks, Dr. Anon :)\r\n Figure One: Hotter's pills. He's very expensive a medical marvel.\r\n* \u00a0 You can't just \"do the math\" and lower a dose of an adult drug for a kid. Even the drugs that kids take that adults also use (like acetomenophen) are proportional doses. So don't think, \"Oh, I take one pill and I weigh 100 pounds so my 50 pound kid should have a half a pill\" - the doses aren't proportional and some drugs that work fine for adults can harm a child.\r\n* \u00a0 If a medication isn't doing what it should or is causing severe consequences, don't just stop the medication; let your health care provider know. Some medications (like steroids and some medications for depression) have to be tapered slowly or they can have severe consequences; other medications need to be replaced.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0See, look at that, I even learned something! Thanks again to Dr. Anon, for collaborating with me on this post; left to my own devices I probably would have been all \"USE A BACKUP METHOD IF YOU'RE ON THE PILL AND HAVE TO TAKE ANTIBIOTICS,\" posted a picture of Big Child as an infant, and called it a day (y'all know about that one, right?), which wouldn't have been NEARLY as educational. HAHAHAHA...yeah.

{"date": "September 13, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday I went back\u00a0to the dentist and he replaced the temp crown, using \"permanent\" cement. \"I'm going to use this stuff on you even though I usually don't use it for temps, because you're basically a rottweiler in human skin and probably put too much pressure on the temp glue with your grinding and clenching, and every time you expose the stump of the tooth you're going to trigger a migraine,\" he said, and reiterated that if I'm ever mugged I should bite the perp. \"Won't that make the temp crown hard to get off,\" I asked as he glued the temporary crown up. \"Yep, but I'm going to cut it off with the drill. Don't worry, I'll numb you up first and use the gas!\" he said, cheerfully. I have a feeling that won't be much fun, but he's probably right--temporary dental work has never held very long in my mouth. He also ground the temp crown down in the areas that were preventing my nightguard from fitting so that I can wear that while we wait for the permanent crown to come in. Today I woke up headache- and toothache-free! Whoo tits! Thanks again, Brighter.com :)\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 It's a good thing I'm feeling better, because clearly I need to lay off the NSAIDs--I scratched an itch on my arm that dislodged a tiny (TINY) scab over a scrape I got from a turkey's wing, and it bled enough to soak an entire paper towel. I thought it'd finally stopped, but I just noticed it's oozed through the sleeve of my button-down. Booo, bleeding disorder. Boo. Oh well, we have Oxiclean (this is not a paid endorsement or anything, although if Oxiclean wants to sponsor a post they should totally call me because our household of bleeders has proved its efficacy on bloodstains many times over) (the secret is to use VERY HOT water, which is counterintuitive with stains but is what makes the Oxiclean work) (you're welcome, now use that information\u00a0for GOOD...no stabbing!).\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 The third female duck laid this morning for the first time! Her egg came out with spiral grooves, which if you read up on duck anatomy isn't very surprising (it's still hilarious though). I'll try and take a picture of it later, but currently I'm at work.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Oh yes, I'm blogging from work, with my boss's blessing. It's a temp gig where they basically just needed someone who looks and sounds professional to mind a desk in an empty office for three hours and lock up on the way out. The phones are forwarded to another office and nobody's scheduled to come by for any reason, so it's pretty much me, the fancy cappuccino machine, and innernet access which the boss told me to feel free to use on the way out. \"You should have brought a book, you're just going to be sitting! Here's the login information--play on Facebook or update your Twitter or something!\" It's a tough job, but I suppose somebody's got to do it...\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of work, Temp Agency #1 called to let me know that the designer I worked with before is doing another model home in the area next week\u00a0and specifically requested me! Yay! I really enjoyed that job and am looking forward to getting to work with those folks again.\r\n*\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of my friends inside the computer are having a hard time right now.

{"date": "November  6, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Well, I survived Day One of The Weekend From Hell, although I dunno that I'd go so far as to say I made it through unscathed. Tonight was an utter goat rodeo; SOMEone screwed up (I'm pretty sure it was the client although it could just as easily have been Management) and we served half the salads before being told the ceremony the dinner was in honor of hadn't concluded and we had to TAKE THEM BACK UP and those couldn't go back out. So the kitchen had fifteen minutes to re-make half the salads for 2,500 guests. A line-cook walked off the job in disgust and the chef was in tears. For me the worst part of the night came earlier, though, during setup, when I found that one of the coffee cups at one of the tables in my section had a large daub of something stuck to the inside of it that had evidently been through the dishwasher \u00a0(it looked like possibly fossilized cheesecake?). In the venue where tonight's event was held the kitchen is up one story, across a skywalk, on the other side of the emm-effing street, and the guests were five minutes out. And so I pretty much had no choice but to do the one thing I knew I absolutely shouldn't: run.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Any lingering doubts I may have had about the sore leg being a stress fracture have departed.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Also on our \"lunch\" break (during which employees got burgers and dogs, despite there being PLENTY of extra entrees) I checked my e-mail to find that the electric company had, for no discernible reason (I paid on time, dammit!), booted us off the budget plan, meaning a $500 power bill. Oooof.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The one bright spot in the sea of suck is that my very sweet boss at Temp Agency #2, with whom I often talk poultry, agreed to take the entire MFA Flock. She already has chickens and ducks, and says she's always wanted turkeys. Her only reservation was in the fact that she had nowhere to put them, as she keeps all of her post-menopausal hens and just gets new ones to lay eggs because she can't bring herself to slaughter any of them, and thus has run short on pen-space. So I told her we'd give her one of the chain-link enclosures and a feeder and waterer; we could MAYBE sell those but eff it, this way we know the birds will have a good home and don't have to drive to the Arctic Tundra to make that happen.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Other than that the night sucked unequivocally; my right knee randomly puffed up halfway through the event and started clicking every time I bend it, both shoulders feel wrenched, an elbow is acting up...I think my autoimmune shit is acting up and it's the very worst possible timing, because I have to work tomorrow and all week and next weekend...damn.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/ow.html", "title": "ow"},
{"date": "November  3, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 This morning on my way into work, I called the local radio station when they announced a giveaway, AND I WAS THE SEVENTH CALLER! I won two tickets and backstage passes to a concert, and I can't tell y'all what band it is because that would reveal my location, but YOU HAVE HEARD OF THEM and THEY ARE FAMOUS and TICKETS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. This particular band wouldn't have been my first choice if I could pick, but Hotter and I do enjoy their music and OMG CONCERT EXCITING! Miraculously the XY has agreed to take the MFA Children the night of the show and keep them overnight, so Hotter and I get to go on an actual date. WHOO!\r\n* \u00a0 I was in a good mood all day because who doesn't like winning and getting to meet famous people and a real date with their husband? Surely this was a good omen!\r\n* \u00a0 Oh how wrong I was. Starting around lunch my leg started REALLY hurting, and I think it's safe to say that I've got an actual \"you-have-to-stop-running-for-at-least-a-month\" stress fracture (finding out for sure would involve missing work to go to the doctor, and x-rays and probably a CT scan or MRI since stress fractures rarely show up on x-rays, and that would cost a LOT of money so I just plan to take naproxen as needed and stop running until it heals, which is ultimately what a doctor would tell me to do along with ice, compression if needed, and elevation; I've had numerous stress fractures in the past and know the drill) (disclaimer: if YOU have not broken greater than thirty bones in your life and think YOU have a stress fracture and can AFFORD the doctor, probably YOU should not try this at home; I on the other hand am a seasoned connoisseur of orthopedic mishaps and know what is and is not going to cause permanent damage and what it feels like well enough to make a call like this with a great-than-average degree of accuracy). I'm going to forgo any exercise until after The Weekend From Hell and the two twelve-hour shifts on my feet it entails, because I can't risk gimping myself up before that, and then see if the leg will at least tolerate power-walking while it heals. In the meantime I'm RICEing like there's no tomorrow and taking a TON of calcium and vitamin D to hopefully support a timely recovery.\r\n* \u00a0 I talked to the guy from Zoning today, and apparently a) the grandfathering paperwork we turned in doesn't take 90 days to process and b) it won't be adequate after all, and essentially they changed their story due to another anonymous call they received. Now the story is that without our being able to get sworn affidavits from every single person who has owned our house since 1978 INCLUDING our current landlord we can't keep our flock because apparently an ANONYMOUS SOURCE provided information none of our neighbors had any way of knowing that caused them to question the veracity of our application more closely than the average applicant's (in other words, my writing about getting our flock grandfathered here on the blog turned into an anonymous call to our county's zoning office wherein someone who had clearly done their homework threw a wrench in the works). So Stalky is still doing her thing and I...well, I am out of fight on this. It's possible that I could research the HELL out of this and satisfy the now-more-stringent requirements, but I'd have to do it within the next ten days, meaning taking time off from work and spending a day paying a bunch of administrative fees at the county courthouse to find names, Google-stalking them, and begging them to provide me with sworn and notarized affidavits, and even if I did all of that and these strangers were findable and willing to do me a solid the county might STILL reject it because if they do it's not like we have any recourse. I'm not going to put my family's livelihood at risk, and the county won't budge on the timeframe, so that's that. This is such bullshit. We have until December 1st to get rid of all our birds or face a hefty fine. We\u00a0talked about various options up to and including moving, but ultimately keeping the MFA Children enrolled in their their current (very highly-rated, best in the area) school district trumps all, at least for now.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 I did at least retain the presence of mind to tell the Zoning people that if they were going to discriminate against us like this they could at least have announced their intention to do so before I forked over a check for $75, and they had the decency to refund the money. Which goes toward buying some car insurance, TOMORROW. After which there will be nothing in my life that anyone could even REMOTELY use against me in the eyes of any sane person. So I'm not going to quit blogging or anything, Stalky or no Stalky, because I enjoy it and the only way she'd really win is if she silenced my voice. Which? Ain't happenin'.\r\n* \u00a0 My twitter profile bio has said lots of things over the years. It used to list a lot of things I was, including mother, writer, runner, etc. and I haven't written fiction in years and dropped \"runner\" after my LAST stress fracture and now I'm benched AGAIN and I have to take \"keeper of chickens\" out and...I'm starting to get a little superstitious. Currently it just says \"giggling inappropriately since 1979,\" because that has ALWAYS been true and WILL always be true (I even giggle as an inappropriate response when things are fucking horrible). So that stays. The rest...well. Y'all know I have kids and a husband I'm crazy about without my hex-o-matic Twitter profile bio saying so.\r\n* \u00a0 I also changed the header back to the original one by Calliope because I don't want to see chickens on my masthead right now.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 So yeah, today can eat a bag of unwashed dicks.

No, I would not put a dog through chemo even if I could afford it because I don't think that's fair to do to a creature that wouldn't understand the why of it all, but there is a chance (if this thing is, in fact, malignant) that it's isolated and removing the thing would be a cure.

Not only did they pretty much refuse to fax the cytology report to the surgeries-only place, but they also didn't bother calling me back with a treatment plan (I at least wanted to find out how much they'd charge to do the surgery there, if for no other reason than that it would console me somewhat if we end up saving a bundle).\r\n* \u00a0 I was going to cap ad sales when I'd filled up the immediately-visible portion of the left sidebar, but I'm willing to put up with my right-sidebar content (which you may have noticed I try to keep to me-only stuff) being displaced for a couple of months if anyone else would like to buy an ad. I need to raise at least $125 but ideally at least $225 by Monday, plus I'm in the hole for a co-pay and four prescriptions (at the very least; currently we are not even thinking about what the deal is with the MFA Minivan).\r\n* \u00a0 I hate to do this, but at this point I'm desperate and the trolls can rant all they like if it means I'm able to get my dog her surgery and still make rent this month: if you've even considered hitting up the Donate button, now would be a fabulous time (although I'd rather sell you an ad--as you can see, someone already took one out for a cause near and dear to their heart so you don't necessarily have to have a blog/Etsy shop/small business you want to promote--you can even gift a blogger you like with ad space, and if you want to play anonymous Santa for another blogger I'll play along).\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Thank you (yes, YOU), for the ad purchases, donations and other small helps, moral support, and just being here, reading this. If you're reading this, I appreciate you, and that's not even (just) the narcotics and steroids talking. Even if you're that uptight butthead at work who tried (and failed) to make my life suck just a little bit more by complaining about my big bad blog to The Powers That Be, your traffic has helped make this place more marketable to advertisers, so it's all good I guess.

She came into the room, noted that it'd been a while since they'd seen me in the office (I uh, hadn't been back to the girly-doctor since the hysterectomy/tumor removal extravaganza of '09) (don't look at me like that; I was tested for everything under the sun JUST IN CASE after leaving the XY '08 and have only slept with Hotter since then), and then, pointing to my wedding ring, said \"I guess I don't need to ask you about any new sexual partners!\" (which in my case she didn't but I have enough polyamorous friends and friends who are married but \"play well with others\" that I don't think she should necessarily make that assumption...). \"We can still test you for STDs though, if you're worried that he might've...\" (again with the assumptions: who says it's always the man who cheats in a monogamous relationship? I've never cheated on anyone, but plenty of women do).

Heh.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 No, Hotter is not incapable PHYSICALLY of the sex act, but in addition to just not being the cheating type he can't DRIVE and we don't have public transportation in our neighborhood, so if I'm not home I know he's where I left him.

The company I work for is full of amazing, kind, and caring people. However, when you end up defending your mental health and general harmlessness to someone so high up the Corporate chain their salary probably has more than one comma in it as a result of something you wrote in jest on the innernet, it causes you to question the wisdom of sharing anything deeper about your life than recipes and cat pictures in a forum where it can be selectively copied and shared by someone who might wish you ill. The chat about mental health in question was not a result of anything I wrote on here, but rather on the facespace, and I have aggressively pruned my friends list on there as a result (if I unfriended you and you are not a co-worker of mine, I am sorry and it is nothing to do with you or anything you said on there, I just decided that for that to be a safe space I needed to remove anyone who\u00a0worked for the same company, and anyone whose doorstep I would feel weird showing up on to borrow a cup of sugar).\u00a0 \u00a0It's kind of funny that my blog has survived The World's Most Acrimonious Divorce and a certain online character's eight-year campaign of stalking and harassment, but a family restaurant shut me down in the end.

The hygeinist actually gave me a small heart attack by coming out to tell me they needed an extra x-ray of Little Child's mouth (she had started the appointment by telling me he wasn't due for any); his lateral incisors have been missing for several weeks now with no sign of permanent ones emerging, and they weren't able to feel the permanent ones up in his gums so were wondering if he, you know, HAD those. Fortunately the permanent teeth showed up on x-ray; they're nowhere near coming in and will likely take their sweet time but they're there. PHEW!

POPPY! The damn dog had snapped her cable and, while she initially went to shrink away when I pulled over, as soon as I called to her was obviously VERY glad to have been found!

I say that as someone who is currently walking-wounded kind of sick, but STILL! Today I:\r\n* \u00a0 Slept in, because my husband is awesome and gets the boys up and off to school with a hot breakfast (if they will eat it--the littles frequently opt to skip what is on offer at home and have breakfast at school and as long as they eat SOMEthing I don't get terribly exercised about it).\r\n* \u00a0 Got up, piled into the car with my husband and flatulent dog, and got lost several different times in the wilds of County Over The Line, where we inevitably end up going to purchase meat in bulk. Purchased beef in bulk from a very cool farmer. Got lost once more for good measure on the way home. WHEE! Getting lost in rural areas takes Hotter and me back to our dating days :)\r\n* \u00a0 Made a delicious chicken stir-fry dinner that everybody ate featuring roasted greens from the winter garden (okay sure, Little Child didn't like it and only ate the three-bite minimum to not be In Trouble, but that beats the nights when he takes one lick and gags histrionically then bursts into tears--bad as that sounds he has gone from \"can't eat at all, pukes all things\" to \"merely a turd, haha\"--and he ate all his rice and most of his veg). When everyone eats something that I make, even Hotter with his GI issues and the littles with their food aversions, I always feel like I've won something! Sure, only Hotter and Big Child appreciated the individual lemon custard cups I made for dessert, but they were so very taken with them that it made up for the littles' lackluster reactions (Big Child in particular was all \"OMG YOU MADE THAT WHOLE THING BY YOURSELF FROM SCRATCH? WOW I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO TALENTED!\" and is just ever so gratifying to cook and bake for), and ate their own custards and those the littles scorned with gusto.\r\n* \u00a0 Fed the center stalks from the dinner greens to the beasts of Squatter Workshop, and finely chopped some for Isis's dinner.\r\n* \u00a0 Bonded with Little Child over our shared love for iThings (I lost The Precious today and was half-convinced it was in County Over The Line but was able to page it via Find My iPhone from Little Child's iPod Touch, because they're both registered to my Apple ID and technology is fucking amazing), showed him how to work the various features, and watched him figure out the interface even faster than I did (and proceed to learn how to do things I hadn't yet mastered my own damn self, because kids are amazing like that, the damn whippersnappers).\r\n* \u00a0 Took Middle Child on a pharmacy run to get a prescription and spend some CVS Extra bucks. We got Hotter a fleece throw since he is always cold, and Middly remembered that it's his teacher's birthday and selected a heart-shaped box of chocolates for her. We talked about how Little Child is picky and we therefore do not discuss ingredients at the table, how awful Isis's breath is (we got some chews for her that are supposed to help with that), how Big Child is a lunatic for Minecraft, and things we might want to make for dinner in the near future now that Middly has hit the \"hollow legs\" portion of boyhood.\r\n* \u00a0 Walked dogs with Big Child, and discussed Bumpus's progress in training (he is slowly becoming a civilized canine citizen of Casa MFA, rather than a Fraggle/Alien demon-thing), Minecraft, music, and literature.\r\n* \u00a0 Made myself buffalo wings from the wings of the whole chicken I cut apart for Isis's meals this week (Bumpus is now on high-dollar kibble once more in an attempt to make him look less like a walking coatrack with fur; he's not a delicate speshul snowflake like Isis is and can have grains so we're trying that route again--Isis now eats one entire chicken, giblets included, over the course of a week minus the breasts and wings, which become peoplefood). They were ridiculously good.\r\n* \u00a0 Made turkey stock from the frozen carcass of our Thanksgiving bird, picked the meat, and refrigerated the broth preparatory to skimming off the fat--turkey-noodle soup tomorrow, aww yeah!\r\n* \u00a0 Took a hot bath.\r\n* \u00a0 Baked some ugly drop-biscuits so that everyone will have something they enjoy for breakfast tomorrow morning (the littles see it as a terrible hardship when Big Child has bacon and/or eggs, because they don't like those things and end up \"starving all the way to school,\" and everyone likes biscuits with various permutations of jam/honey/butter/fried egg on them or else plain in the case of Little Child).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I feel like utter shite and think I may be abed all day tomorrow; whatever is wrong with me my lungs are sucking and given all of the eating I did today I'm declaring it a well-fed fever at this point.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0In other words \"didn't even have to use my AK, guess it was a good day!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/01/lets-just-call-it-a-fever.html", "title": "let's just call it a fever"},

Business was steady, money was decent, banter with co-workers and guests alike was pleasant, and I didn't have any comps, voids, or problem tables. I didn't feel overwhelmed or unprepared once, and was able to support some co-workers when they were in that position and contribute to our success as a team instead of being the one leaning on others, which was a good feeling. I really love working at \"Eclecstasy!\" After work I stopped at Trader Joe's and got some Ahi steaks and lovely fresh asparagus, and I came home ready to cook a celebratory dinner with Hotter, because The Situation aside, the past week had been full of win (progress on addressing The Situation! A speedy and FREE resolution to the problems my left front crown had been giving me for months! Street-legal vehicle! WHOO!).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, yesterday was also Lefty's birthday, and I did my duty in reminding Hotter to call him, and after Lefty not answering his phone or responding to Hotter's text Hotter received a text from The Wrath ALSO reminding him about Lefty's birthday and finally did get in touch. Apparently Lefty had been \"working\" with his stepfather, who last we'd heard about it Lefty hated. Lefty explained to Hotter that really their problems had stemmed from the fact that while Lefty was using, his stepfather had tended to catch the brunt of Lefty's mother's feelings over at all, but they talked and worked things out and now the stepfather was the only step-parent Lefty liked. I guess Hotter then asked what was up with that, and apparently Lefty is mad at me for preventing Hotter from drinking after him when Lefty had active Hepatitis during the worst of his heroin-fueled shenanigans five or six years ago.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I.

The first years of Hotter's and my relationship were majorly overshadowed by Lefty's drug usage. Weekends were put off or rescheduled if he was expected to be arrested or had a court date, the timing of our wedding was planned around first his eighteenth birthday and then his incarceration schedule, his needs have contributed to some of Hotter's and my worst fights as a married couple...I realize that it's Hotter and not Lefty I am actually mad at, here. It's Hotter's handling of Lefty's bullshit that has been hard on me more than it's been Lefty's actual bullshit. I get all of that. But the unfairness of Lefty's remark about how he and his OTHER step-parent were cool now that Lefty understood his bullshit had made the other step-parent's life hard set me off. It brought every feeling of being unfairly picked on by the universe I have (and there are a LOT of those feelings in my head) screaming to the forefront, and instead of having a nice evening with Hotter I ended up drinking a LOT of wine, rage-cooking a lovely meal that we ate in silence, rage-cleaning the rabbit pens, and being told that I was ruining our child-free weekend.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then I woke up at four a.m. scratching myself raw because I was covered from head to toe in huge, angry hives. It actually looked less like hives and more like I had a total-body sunburn with occasional white speckling. I was THISCLOSE to going to the emergency room and begging for steroids, and health insurance and money be damned, but finally after I took WAY more Benadryl than is generally recommended and spent half an hour shivering in a cool shower things settled down. I hadn't eaten anything new or unusual, the pattern of the hives didn't point toward a contact reaction of any kind (they were everywhere, not just on exposed skin), there are no new soaps, lotions, or detergents in my life...I kind of think it was stress. My body has this way of taking me out at the knees when I'm trying to get through some shit; my long-time therapist of many years ago suggested that since I shrink from strong displays of negative emotions they find a way to manifest in the physical, and I certainly have a lot of negative emotions right now. The Situation has the potential to wreck every single aspect of my existence, and renders problems with teeth and cars and money and even in-laws laughable by comparison, but that doesn't mean that those other things don't suck, too, and I'm tired of coping.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The problem with that, of course, is that I don't really have any other option right now.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/09/sigh.html", "title": "sigh"},

Excited about this already (it was SO GOOD and I am on SO MUCH PREDNISONE). Originally it was two pieces of top-round steak that together cost less than $4 (reduced for quick sale), four organic carrots and an organic baking potato, organic tomato soup, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, horseradish, water, MSG-free beef base, and some fresh thyme and oregano from outside. Also some dehydrated onions, since we were out of those and I wanted the flavor. Then I threw a box of mini wagon-wheel pasta for the resident potato haters (and to bulk up the meal, since I only had one leftover \"people-grade\" potato after making latkes on Friday--yes, there are grades of potatoes in my house because potatoes are one of the DIRTIEST crops in terms of chemicals, and people here only eat organic ones as a result, whereas the non-people get whatever potato is cheapest by the pound at the big-box store, sorry animals). I figure the entire meal cost us less than six bucks, which for five people to have dinner and two to have lunch the next day as well is NOT BAD.\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Go to feed store and buy two metal trashcan-style bins for rabbit and chicken feed at Squatter Workshop. Also eleventy-seven or so mousetraps. Ahem.\r\n* \u00a0 Purchase molasses. Not at feed store. Probably make a separate stop for this. Ideally at a place that also sells good-quality Earl Grey tea, since I almost burst into tears and punched Hotter today after he confessed to drinking the last of my stash (BASTARD!)

Today I called in sick as instructed by the doctor I saw yesterday morning, and I think he was right to tell me to do that given that I was winded and in need of a nap earlier today just from eating a bowl of soup that Hotter heated up for me. That was before today's dose of Prednisone had kicked in (and I think the antibiotics are helping too, since my ears and sinuses feel much better, although the rattly cough isn't budging just yet), and well after I would have left Job 1 and headed to Job 2. Hopefully I am even better tomorrow but don't want to assume. I do, however, want to give the boys as many little seasonal joys as is feasible (and fatten Hotter up).

Plus also? The termite guy said the mold and insulation have to do with age and climate, not the effing crawlspace door. I dug up every e-mail I've ever sent to them mentioning the daggone crawlspace door for good measure, and recapped things in an e-mail to the landlord.\u00a0In my e-mail, I listed all of the known issues with the house that he has not repaired (at least one of which is a building code violation), and said that we were not asking for or insisting on those repairs, because we don't want the rent to go up, but we also don't want to get blamed for the issues and/or not reporting them. I don't think I could be any more reasonable here, and I really wish I could speak the landlord's native language and suss out the ratio of prevarication to misunderstanding at play here, because it's\u00a0hard to tell how much of the malarky with our landlord is due to the language barrier (English is not his first or probably even second language), how much is due to his wife being kind of...um...excitable?

{"date": "December 26, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0Last night I arrived at work, and not five minutes later was passing through the hallways where the restrooms are located when a mysteriously damp man flung himself into my arms, laid his head on my breast, and sobbed \"where is the--I'm sorry, I just--I HAVE TO PEEEE!\" I immediately spun him around to face the mens' room door and gave him little push, because whatever the hell was going on DUDE HAD TO PEE, and continued about my business after locking eyes with a maintenance worker who'd seen the whole thing and shaking my head. Strange stuff happens all the time. Especially around the holidays.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0A co-worker, a sweet young kid who is still in the \"figuring out life\" stage of things, organized a festive holiday meal for all of us who were stuck working Christmas Day. It was amazing food, and something the co-worker in question absolutely did not have to do, and I sat down with the ragtag bunch of misfits I work with (because honestly, almost everyone in the service industry is there because something in their life has gone sideways at some point--we were our very own Island of Misfit Toys last night), a group of people I have nothing in common with, and ate Christmas Dinner.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0My encounter with Bathroom Guy bothered me afterward. See, there was something off about the way he spoke, and obviously he wasn't socially appropriate. I was annoyed at having had a moist stranger enter my personal space, and without knowing for sure what his deal was, couldn't decide how I felt about it. If he was drunk then obviously I had every right to think ill of him, especially in light of his familiarity with my bosom, the letch! If he wasn't drunk, though, he could have suffered from an intellectual disability of some kind that affected his speech and comportment, and I was an asshole for being annoyed with him because he couldn't help himself. If it was the latter, he really shouldn't have been out in public without a caregiver, but then there are such things as compassion fatigue and possibly the parent of an adult child with cognitive/mental issues just really fucking wanted to sit down on Christmas Day and have themselves a drink, in which case who was I to judge?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the holiday meal I shared with co-workers, I mentioned Bathroom Guy and immediately the bartender laughed and said \"oh, y'mean the one wearing _____? I had to cut him off, that guy was a mess. He and his lover had a big 'ol fight and the other guy is PISSED and finally drug him off to bed. I think they're going to break up.\" I paused and chewed a mouthful of prime rib thoughtfully. Bathroom Guy was free of mental disability, and I could therefore be annoyed with him in good conscience. However, Bathroom Guy wasn't heterosexual,* which meant the whole laying-his-head-on-my-breast thing wasn't pervy of him, so I wasn't AS annoyed as I might've been if a drunken straight man had done the same thing. In light of his sexuality this was more child-like than anything else, and that was kind of touching. Someone at the table asked what I was thinking about and I told them, and they all agreed that it was complicated, and that only I would put this much thought into a collision with a drunken stranger (which is fair enough). And everyone had a laugh at my expense, and I looked around me and was simultaneously nostalgic for and glad to have walked away from my own extended family more than fifteen years ago.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I don't talk about them on here, my extended family that I have nothing to do with, because they're not a part of my life. They're a small-minded and intolerant lot who drew a \"come to Jesus or don't come to Thanksgiving, and certainly not with a female date\" line in the sand with me back in college, and aside from a brief reunion with them during my marriage to the XY (they were willing to accept me as long as I was living the heteronormative American Dream) that ended when I decided his cheating on me while our baby was in the hospital meant I was was done with him (divorce? FOR SHAME, SINNER! was their reaction, regardless of why), I haven't wavered (ignore my children saying hello to you in the grocery store because you disapprove of my life choices? That is your third strike. YOU'RE OUT!). The holidays are traditionally the time to miss one's family, but these are people who consider me unworthy of basic human regard because I'm not a straight, godfearing doormat, and I can't make myself see anything OTHER than walking away from that as a healthy response to such judgmental hostility. Now that I am once again married to a man they might be willing to accept me, but I don't want that kind of superficial acceptance from judgmental assholes (if they knew that Hotter is not straight either, they'd probably retract their approval, and it's not like it would come up, but it's also not like that makes it any better).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The fact that sharing a holiday meal with a group of people I have nothing in common with even makes me THINK of family kind of lets you know what a skewed perception I have of the concept, I suppose. And yet there are those who judge me simply for not having an ongoing relationship with extended family, because surely the problem is me and not them. Someone without people must have been cast out, right? Because who would just walk away? Anything is better than being alone in the world! I don't really know that I can refute that statement. It's hard (I am no longer Alone In Life, obviously, as I have Hotter, but I've certainly been there). But it's a hard that I can live with, and all of the judgment and attacking of my choices and beliefs and sniping at me for sins of previous generations was not. So there's that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for Bathroom Guy, I've decided he was an interesting character, and that I bear him no ill will. Who knows what his story was. Maybe his own family is like the one I was born into, and he was spending a major holiday with someone he was about to break up with not because they meant so much to each other anymore, but because the fact that they ever had made him less in the eyes of the ones he'd otherwise be with on the occasion. Maybe the bartender misinterpreted things and he's a straight pervert who was also drunk. Either way, he was a mess and he had to pee, and he needed a push in the direction of the mens' room and I was in a position (literally! Ha!) to give him that much and so I did, because it was the right thing to do.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Sometimes life doesn't go as planned, and yet you still end up doing the same things, sitting around a holiday table where you have some tenuous sense of belonging and the others present know you well enough to laugh at you. Sometimes you need a push into the bathroom. And in the end, as long as you still end up not-alone and not pissing yourself, I guess it's all good. So here's to the lone wolves, the misfits, the drunks in public who have to pee, all of us who don't quite fit in! We're still in this together. Happy holidays. May you always run into those who are willing, even begrudgingly, to push you in the right direction and may your hangovers be merciful.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Yes, I know, I am assuming.

I had an eleven-hour day at work, which was supposed to be a twelve-hour day but started and ended early (an unhappy homelife has been great for my work-ethic; I am always willing to come in early or stay on-property overnight and was commended for it in my recent review for increase). The major change, however, continues to cause everyone a lot of angst, and the morally sticky situation I wrote about\u00a0(which is actually an entirely SEPARATE pile of bullshit) is still ongoing (I have Said Nothing, because I am a coward who really likes her benefits and PTO). Plus someone in the department with all the Very Large Personalities walked off the job and so That Lot is extra-special right now. Joy. Also, in case everyone wasn't on-edge enough, our Corporate Overlords hath vistited upon us a Customer Satisfaction Specialist whose main purpose in life seems to be to materialize out of thin air to interrupt everyone when they are their absolute busiest and suggest Fun! Little! Changes! to the way they do their job, send them scuttling to get some obscure object with which to improve upon something, and disappear, presumably to destroy someone ELSE'S workplace zen. This is about as popular as you might imagine.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Long days like yesterday suck even in the best of times, when I just miss my family and would rather be in my garden or my kitchen or possibly even my bed. When work is my only adult interaction, however, a long sucktastic day can feel like a prolonged test of my will to fucking live, and then I got to thinking about the whole Hotter situation on the way home, and I was supposed to stop at the grocery store but my usual car-crying time ran long so I skipped it and walked inside, breezed through The Awkward that is getting home from a long day to sleeping children and a spouse one isn't speaking to, and went and finished up my pity-party at Squatter Workshop, where the hens cheered me up. They were Violently Excited about the leftovers I brought them (some dressed salads that nobody ate at a dinner-function and artisanal bread-heels, plus a bruised whole apple). So yeah, the high-point of my day was watching some chickens throw down on some kitchen scraps.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I've gotten a couple of \"are you okay?\" and \"are you getting a divorce?!?\" e-mails, and have tried to answer them all with at least a sentence or two to the effect of \"Yes, fine, just, you know, NOT!\" I dunno, y'all. Heartbreak fades eventually, and divorce is expensive (plus my kids \u00a0have already lost a shitty father to divorce, and losing a pretty good one to ANOTHER divorce would probably permanently wreck their mental wellbeing, even if mine survived it). Plus as much as he values their dysfunctional presence in his life, Hotter's family are an irresponsible lot of fuckups and would let him die of something stupid (like starvation, or lack of meds because they wanted his Social Security money for heat or heroin) and then I would feel guilty.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And then there's the fact that I love the asshole, even if I can't look at him right now without wanting to punch him in the fucking face, possibly with a brick. When I say he remurdered my personal sense of romance, I mean that he, in stunningly poor form, destroyed the happy notion I've held for the past five years that There Is A Perfect Someone For Everyone. Which is a dumb concept to begin with, and not much consolation to people who aren't even close to finding their Someone, and I am an asshole. I just...I don't talk about my childhood on here but IT WAS AWFUL, and then I married the XY and that...wasn't so great...and then after that was over with Hotter came along and was everything I'd ever wanted out of life (namely, someone who cared The Most about ME, and had the gentlest touch I've ever felt, and didn't seem to be afraid of anything in my life, like the health stuff, the children, and The Poverty). And for a while, we all lived happily ever after. Now, though...well. Apparently The Poverty is A Problem for him, and judging by how often he's been snarky or cranky about it in recent months, and the amount of bile behind the Recent Outburst, it's a big one. He seems to have gotten to a place of not being actively pissed-off anymore (he's wanting to do things like text me to ask how I am and try to hug me, which either means he's over being mad, in which case TOUGH SHIT I'M NOT or just plain lonely, in which case ME TOO, SUCKS DOESN'T IT?), but I'm just a little too \"ET TU, HOTTER?!?\" for anything like that. I am motherfucking furious with life that I don't get to have just ONE person who can be my soft place to fall, my nonjudgmental Sharer Of All The Things, someone I can deal with without censoring myself.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Now that things are all \"don't talk about heroin like it's such a bad thing, you'll make the junkie feel judged!\" and \"what do you MEAN you couldn't round up $XXX if I really NEEDED* it?!?\" I am just kind of...blah. I don't like the feeling of being judged, especially for things that I don't even feel like I SHOULD be judged for, and DEFINITELY not by the person I had built up, in my head, into My Reward For Enduring The First Twenty-nine Years Of My Life. I REALLY don't like being yelled at. And when I come home at the end of the day feeling absolutely fucking whipped, I don't like the feeling that the eleven-hour day should have been another hour longer because Now What and Oh God, Money. If I'm not off work to spend time with Hotter, I worry that I'll be seen as lazy and selfish any time I'm off work now.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It doesn't help my mental state to know that if I hadn't married Hotter, I wouldn't HAVE to worry about money, because the XY would still have to pay spousal support, meaning I could stay home with my kids and have roughly the same amount of money overall as I do with Hotter contributing his disability check to the household and me contributing a paycheck, AND not have anyone except my ex-husband judging me on the regular. So it's kind of O'Henry that I married for love and gave up money, and now am not getting any love BECAUSE I don't have money.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So I guess, in the end, I'm left with a nasty headache, a wretched case of insomnia, this dead horse in a \"poor me\" t-shirt, and a whole lot of unpleasant feelings.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I hate when that happens.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Needed as in \"to feel good about a certain situation,\" not as in \"to buy immunosuppresent medication so as not to lose my donor organs.\"\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/02/hotter-remurders-romance-mfa-mama-beats-dead-horse.html", "title": "Hotter remurders romance, MFA Mama beats dead horse"},

I'm going to start setting aside a certain amount each month for him to spend at his discretion, and we're going to create a Special Savings Account for in-law emergencies, and he's going to take off his judgy pants and I'm going to burn them.

I responded by blocking him on the Twitter, largely because I could, and don't intend to lift the block. Not because I plan to use Twitter to bitch about him in the future so much as because Twitter is a free-speech zone for me. Stalky can't read there, people I work with can't read there, and people who have threatened to sling mud on the innernet can't read there.

Specifically, I broke down and confessed that I hated how money was making me extra-terrified of something happening to a member of his family (entirely possible given risk factors such as age and heroin addiction), for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to get him to and from The Arctic Tundra.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hotter, of course, interpreted that as me disparaging his family, and the opposite of hilarity ensued. He was mean to me, REALLY mean, yelling, cold and cruel in the face of hysterical tears...hell, he even threatened to \"take this to the innernet.\" The reason that there is currently peace is that I agreed to a $200 Special Savings for family disaster.\r\n\u00a0 Here's the thing though: we get Hotter's disability payment and the first of March's child support tomorrow and after rent, the phone bill, a tank of gas for the car, a new Betta fish for Little Child (the old one died) plus water conditioner to hopefully help this one live longer, a bag of potting soil to start seeds with and a payment toward Hotter's credit card, all that's left is $69. And that has to last for a week of near-daily milk purchases, coffee (because if Hotter is out of coffee EVERYONE SUFFERS), dinners, field trip money, prescriptions...hopefully I'll make cash tips here and there because for a family of five to survive on $69 for a week is...optimistic, at best.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, I really need some new lenses for my glasses, Hotter still needs dental work, we have to buy a \"super\" for the bees to fill with honey sooner rather than later, Little Child needs a twin bed, Hotter needs glasses, Little Child needs glasses, we owe on Hotter's credit card...\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So yeah, I don't see that $200 materializing any time soon, and it's still pretty likely that something will happen to either Hotter's mother or son and I won't be able to afford travel.

{"date": "March 10, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So I was vague on here, but those of you who follow me on the Twitter know more and those of you who know me on the facespace know almost all and those of you I have drunkdialed from Squatter Workshop know all and THEN SOME, but the day after Hotter's seizure he was a major dick to me and the day after that I asked him for a divorce. Then I cried for two days straight and we came to a compromise and had kinky make-up sex.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I fucking hate the month of March.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I don't know what it is about it, but every March since like, 2005 has sucked for me and this one is no exception. In sorting through All The Things over the past week I read back and saw that the LAST time Hotter had a seizure that lead to my facespace-divorcing him was March (of 2010). This recent one was the first grand mal he's had since we've been a couple, and I was utterly unprepared for the huge shift in personality the random internal electrocution brought about. In retrospect I should have considered that as soon as he behaved abberantly, but when someone has reopened decades-old emotional wounds and rubbed salt in them, logic tends to faint at the sight of blood and it's downhill from there.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We've talked through everything that had been bothering us about each other prior to the seizure. I am following certain guidelines in regards to money (as we'd pretty much already agreed), and knowing what we now know about what post-ictal personality changes, Hotter has agreed to be more judicious in his sleep habits (the seizure was his fault--I am not cold-hearted enough to say that it's Hotter's fault he had a stroke and was left prone to seizures, but that being His Lot In Life he needs to not stay up all night gaming or drink four pots of coffee in a day, both of which he did more than once in the days leading up to his recent event, and that's not just my personal uneducated conjecture, it's also what the neurologist said so yeah). I feel a little squeamy about even getting mad at him over something that is No Fun for him (Hotter's seizure aura includes nerve pain and since he usually stops breathing after a seizure they're also scary as hell for him), but I think six or seven years in a row of no grand mal activity had made him cocky, and since it affects everyone in the house when these things happen it's not as simple as \"well go ahead and give yourself a seizure, ya dumbass, and see how that works out for you.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Brains are such assholes. If they were simple enough for us to understand, we'd be too simple to understand them, but why they gotta be so COMPLICATED?\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for me, and How I'm Doing, I voluntarily went to work yesterday on my day off, because our car insurance premium is due next month and will eat an entire paycheck, and I don't have another day off for at least a week, so that...is what it is. Fortunately I genuinely enjoy my job and most of the people I work with, so it could be a lot worse. I decided against getting The Jew Tattoo fixed during all of this, because a) I'd like to have at least two days off in a row during the early days of the healing process when I get it re-inked, b) knowing what I know about my body and bleeding tendencies and shitty healing abilities, I like to prepare myself for voluntary woundings by making sure I spend at least a week straight loading up on leafy greens and avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol, and haven't done either of those as of right now, and c) it's March, and therefore despite any sensible precautions it would probably get infected and my fucking arm would fall off. Aaaand last night I got glutenated somehow, probably at work, which means that tomorrow's DietBet weigh-in will be a cliffhanger. I've lost more than my goal amount for the purpose of \"bet,\" and therefore am not over the target number CURRENTLY, but I've only gotten glutenated a couple of times since going hardcore GF and therefore don't know enough about how the reaction will play out to feel 100% confident.

I think I may have at least partially failed in making the point that while I disapprove of and react strongly to that word's misuse on a PERSONAL basis, it's also one that, if you INSIST on (mis)using it as part of your personal lexicon, you need to leave the fuck at home and NEVER bring to work (especially in the service industry, where business is all about making EVERYONE feel comfortable and welcome). It was pretty disappointing, but I'm glad I said something.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And when it turned out that the group who gave us the majority of the day's business was involved in special education (something I picked up on in recognizing some IEP-committee buzzwords they were using amongst themselves that I then had to explain to my co-workers for them to even know what I was gloating about), well, I like to think I wasn't ENTIRELY insufferable in alerting my co-workers to that fact, but it was probably close :)\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And how are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.r-word.org/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/03/word.html", "title": "word"},

{"date": "September 10, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 I have a summer cold from HELL, and no voice. Luckily I've only been on call at work, and haven't had to go in, but tomorrow I have a regular shift and need to be there!\r\n* \u00a0 This is complicated by the fact that the MFA Minivan is dead in the driveway. It was having some kind of odd seizure this morning that Hotter noticed when he was walking by; it was locking and unlocking all of the locks nonstop (which is crazy because the power locks don't even WORK when you try to, you know, USE THEM). He dragged me out to show me, and I was like BABY. She is an unpapered, inspection-needing, 90% rusted-out, steel-belts-showing-in-the-tires, battery-corroded-so-badly-we-probably-couldn't-change-it-if-we-tried, windshield-wiper-held-on-with-a-paperclip, 4,000 miles over due for an oil change AMERICAN VEHICLE with nearly 250,000 miles on her! If as part of her vehicular Alzheimer's she wants to lock and unlock her doors then not only is that fine by me but YOU WATCH YOUR TONE and DON'T MAKE HER FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT! Then I gave the minivan double finger-guns and said \"who's a good van? WHO'S A GOOD VAN! YOU ARE!\" Evidently she wasn't fooled by my attempts at placating her, or else Hotter was right about the locks eventually wearing down the battery.\r\n* \u00a0 And that may go down in history as The Last Time Hotter Was Right, because he lost his fucking mind earlier tonight. The XY likes to set the kids up to complain about various things; Big Child is apparently having a hard time making friends in 8th grade and was told by the kids in his Home Ec class that he smells funny. Instead of giving him a quick sniff-test (clothes smell like soap, body smells like Axe) and then explaining that teenagers are assholes, the XY said that this is because our entire house (which he has not been inside) smells funny, and Big Child ought to tell us to clean it more. Which, Big Child having Asperger's, is exactly what he came home and did, and Big Child's excuse in the confrontation that ensued is that he is thirteen and has Asperger's. Hotter HAD no excuse to sink to the level of yelling and swearing at a child, even if said child is physically larger than he is. Yes, my ex is The Lord Of The Douche and runs mindgames on the kids. Yes, it's irritating to have a thirteen-year-old tell you your house smells funny and you need to clean it better, and not even be able to see where my ex-husband's hand goes up his arse to move his mouth, BELIEVE ME I KNOW THIS. However, if I do not get to lose my shit and yell and swear about this, neither does anyone else in the house, and if you cannot listen to reason I will absolutely put you in time out until you can calm the eff down, whether you are eight or forty-six.\r\n* \u00a0 It's remarkable the salubrious effect a closed door has on manly comportment. When I first dragged Hotter outside to finish our discussion out of minor earshot he was all \"YOU PEOPLE DON'T HELP ME KEEP THE HOUSE CLEAN AND I HAVE HAD IT I WAS NOT YELLING AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO, THE LAW DOWN HERE WOULDN'T CARE IF I--\" and then when he went to follow me back inside and discovered himself to be locked out there he went pretty quickly to \"I'll apologize to Big Child, I loooove you, I'll love you FOREVER and I am SO SORRY FOR YELLING.\" I finally decided I had to let him back in sooner or later and opened the door, and shortly Hotter began screaming. Because it turned out that while he was having his back-porch change of heart a five-inch slug had crawled up his pants-leg. I informed him coolly that that looked to me like a personal problem, and went to make a wine-run but at that point discovered that the MFA Minivan's battery was dead. So it was an evening of nobody getting what they wanted! Except for the XY! Yay, strife!\r\n* \u00a0 No, not really. Boo, strife. And boo to you too, Wednesday. NEXT!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/09/car-ma.html", "title": "car-ma"},

I was worried, because I forgot the jumper cables at home, that it wouldn't start back up after work.\r\n* \u00a0 It was slow at Eclecstasy tonight, and I was worried I'd make shitty money because of it being slow and my only having about a third of a voice, but...surprisingly I did pretty well for a slow night! I don't know whether I'm ordinarily babbly from nerves and the guests liked my more laid-back and voice-saving approach, or thought they'd better tip me well enough to get to a doctor, or just liked my new rubber duckie tie, but I got nice tips and not one but TWO notes saying how great I was! Whaaa?\r\n* \u00a0 The MFA Minivan started right up after work, and everything was fine until the engine, all of the lights, and everything else cut off and it caught on fire on the highway on the way home, at midnight, in the rain, at 65 m.p.h. Which sounds bad, and was, but went as well as it possibly could have, really. Nobody was behind me, so I didn't get hit due to the lack of lights, and while the steering and brakes both died along with everything else, I was able to wrestle the thing safely to the side of the road. Heck, when I lifted the hood the rain even put the fire out. My best offline friend, who also works late, was able to come and get me within half an hour, and really every vehicle fire should end so safely.\r\n* \u00a0 That said, everything else about this SUCKS. We JUST got back on our feet to where everybody who helped me during job training had been paid back, the bills were current, and the back-to-school craziness was covered. I have about a hundred bucks to my name, a tow truck to get the MFA Minivan's mortal remains to MFA Mechanic's shop will be $35, I have no idea how I'm getting to work tomorrow, and tomorrow I either have to buy a new piece of shit or else come up with a way to finance repairs. There's a chance I can get the minivan back on the road for less than $200; if I am correct that the burnt-up doohickey below is the alternator and that is ALL that needs to be replaced, I'll probably try to flog the thing along for another month or two while I save for something new. But...given that there was fire I'm thinking there might be other damage.\r\nFigure One:\u00a0The wheely-blowy-looking thing of DOOM, a.k.a. Probably The Alternator per my best friend's boyfriend and a friend of mine on Twitter. It would make sense given the manner of demise.\r\n* \u00a0 I hate this, hate hate HATE this, but...given that I have very little pride left and Stalky is the least of my concerns at the moment, I'm going to suck it up and ask y'all for help again. Unlike last time I won't be so optimistic as to predict when I could pay everyone back by, because buying another vehicle right now would necessarily involve some help, a lot of double-shifts, and some serious robbing of Peter around here to pay Paul to pull off. But if you are in a position to be able to make me a loan, or donate toward repairs/replacement, or if any of you have a cheap car for sale somewhere along the Southeastern seaboard or are secretly Bill Gates and feeling generous...well. I'm not overlooking any potential ways through this, and would appreciate the help. The donate button to the right is linked to PayPal, and if you need the money back please mark it as a loan in the \"purpose\" field and I'll get it back to you ASAP.\r\n* \u00a0 Thanks, y'all. Just for being there in general. I imagine people with families rely on them in a similar manner, the person to call when you have life questions, the last resort in times of hardship to go to for help or at least a sympathetic ear, and while I don't have family, it's pretty great to have all of you to tell me how long to charge a battery after a jumpstart, that that looks like the alternator, that I'll figure something out...I'm not entirely losing my junk right now because I feel like I've got y'all collectively THERE to help me figure this out, and that's pretty great.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401b7c6de96ee970b-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/09/thursday-nights-alright-for-a-vehicle-fire-apparently-help.html", "title": "Thursday night's alright for a vehicle fire, apparently (help?)"},

In that box? Was my (former) alternator. Apparently they don't usually catch on fire and/or melt, and mine was not actually connected by a wire. \"It was just arcing in there! Your minivan is magic,\" one of them informed me. That's one word for the freaking thing...\r\n* \u00a0 There is a special place in hell for people who tip $10 on $265.

I'm guessing that the stress and grueling hours finally caught up to me and my body is just kind of done at the moment. I'm definitely better today than yesterday though, and no longer appear to be losing much blood, so there's that.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I still almost fainted when they told me how much dental work Hotter needs ($625 worth urgently, for the curious, and another $4,000 or so \"pretty soon\" but not in a manner likely to cause infection, so that will have to wait until I get on Eclecstasy's insurance in about eight more months). For those of you new to the saga or who may have forgotten, it's not his fault or anything, he just threw up so much due to gastroparesis before his transplants that his teeth are a hot mess. And we can't ignore them, because a dental infection in him could get ugly fast with the transplant-related immune suppression. So I asked them to pick the MOST urgent thing and they said it's two of the fillings, which will be $350, and I scheduled an appointment for him to get those done late next week although I have no freaking clue how I'll make it happen. I have to, so I'll figure something out.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for Big Child, one of the double-decker canines fell out on its own a couple of days ago, and the other was so loose today that MFA Dentist said he could probably nip it out without even using any anesthetic and it wouldn't really hurt. Big Child freaked out though, and MFA Dentist said it wasn't worth a \"procedure\" so he's giving the kid three weeks to wiggle it loose (at the end of which, if it is still hanging on, we'll have to talk sedation options since Big Child is scared silly and way too big for the bear-hugger). Other than that, Big Child's adult molars have the enamel issue most people with our connective tissue disease suffer from and will need to be sealed at the next appointment. Big Child claimed to feel \"really out of it from the drugs\" after his appointment, but the strongest thing they used today was a flouride treatment so...yeah.

Then Big Child brought it to my attention that Bumpus has a goopy eye that is probably infected, and wanted to take him to the vet and I told him we'd watch it for a day or two and see. He kept pushing, and I finally snapped and broke my big rule of not discussing money with kids and told him I hadn't gone to the doctor my own self for a kidney and chest infection that could've killed me because of money and while I'd found a way to get myself the medicine I needed and be okay and would do the same for Bumpus, if I was willing to wait on medical attention for my own self for a major issue then Bumpus was going to have to do the same with his goopy eye.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I went to work and it was slow (by Eclecstasy standards), and I agonized over whether to spend $2.87 to get myself something to eat or not (that is how much a side of mashed potatoes is after the employee discount; it's the cheapest GF thing on the menu) and was disappointed with the money I made in the end, and then I came home and lost my shit.

I said yes but we are in a state of emergency, WHY would you do that? He said \"well you were certainly ready to go out and get a bottle of wine the other night,\" and I pointed out that I had been stopped by the van being dead and hadn't spent any money on anything for myself since then except some generic Cipro, some\u00a0phenazopyridine, and a bottle of store-brand cough syrup.

{"date": "September 14, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So last night I had a fever/chills thing going on, and was worried that maybe my chest infection had turned into pneumonia. The good news is, I don't think I have pneumonia! The bad news is, I woke up with crippling back pain, was like \"WTF DID I DO???\" and then it alllll made sense when I started peeing what looked like straight blood at work and having bladder spasms. This was bad: peeing blood is not generally associated with winning at life. As the day wore on several co-workers did double-takes and asked me if I was feeling okay. In other words, the wheels fell off and my body was like \"fuuuuuck youuuuu.\" I couldn't tell if I was dizzy because of the amount of blood I was losing (I doubt it, it always looks like more than it is and given that I don't have a period to contend with I can probably spare some hemoglobin, but...it looks bad) or because I was so damn sick, but I finally asked my boss if I could have fifteen minutes to make a couple of medically-necessary phone calls and paged the doctor on call for my GP. Their recording giving the on-call number specifically stated that on-call physicians would not phone in any prescriptions including antibiotics (which kind of seems to defeat the purpose of an on-call physician if you ask me, because otherwise what can they do besides tell you to go to the ER or suck it up until business hours?), but I figured the worst they could do was say no. Fortunately when I gave a rather minimalistic overview of my symptoms (I left out the fever and back pain and said it was just a tiny bit of blood) and said I felt like it was silly to go to the ER for a UTI but was pretty miserable, the on-call doctor grudgingly said he'd phone in an antibiotic and something for bladder spasms. VICTORY! Given my current uninsured state there was no way in hell the ER was feasible, or even an office visit. Three cheers for merciful on-call doctors! And also for very understanding bosses (the Big Boss himself covered my section for me while I sorted out the rx issue, and asked me if I was okay and offered to let me go home if I needed to, but I said I thought I could tough it out).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0It turns out that was a tad overly-optimistic of me, and I did end up paying one of the early-outs $20 to close for me so I could leave an hour and a half early to go and get the prescriptions filled and die in the comfort of home. I was worried the meds would be unattainably expensive, but Cipro hath gone generic (cue choir of angels!) and the\u00a0phenazopyridine was also gratifyingly inexpensive (the two together were less than $50!), and perhaps the Cipro will also kill whatever is lurking in my chest and this will turn out to have been serendipitous! There certainly isn't any way in hell I could've talked anyone into phoning something in for the chest infection, so I WIN!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, or else mayyyybe I'm a little delirious. In any case I am off work tomorrow and hoping that a day of rest, a ton of cranberry juice, and antibiotics will have me feisty and ready to take on the world again by Wednesday at the very latest.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0If the universe would stop smiting me for a bit now that would be fabulous.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And how are all of YOU?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/09/just-whose-people-exactly-do-i-need-to-let-go.html", "title": "just whose people exactly do I need to let go?"},

Last night, however, I was NOT waiting tables at work, and the hens raised such a furious ruckus when I got home and gave them a scoop of chicken feed that I finally went back to the house and put some kitchen leftovers into a plastic shopping bag from Kroger to fake them out, then took that down there to shut them up. IT WORKED. I hate chickens :)\r\n* \u00a0 I also hate rabbits, mostly because they don't grasp simple concepts like cause and effect. As in, \"if I rattle the water bottle with my teeth instead of drinking from it and chew the cord holding it up, it will fall off the side of the cage and I will get VERY THIRSTY.\" That one goes right over Iden's head. Unless maybe she's approaching it from the angle of \"if I rattle the water bottle with my teeth instead of drinking from it and chew the cord holding it up, bitch will stick her hand within biting range and I can get me some sweet, sweet mamaflesh, YUM!\" and is an evil genius. Either way? HATE.\r\n* \u00a0 The clinic over at the elementary school sent Middle Child home for suspected pinkeye the day before yesterday, despite my assertion that what he had going on was viral in nature. I took him from school to Urgent Care where they said they really thought it would look worse if it was true bacterial pinkeye, but would give Middly some antibiotic ointment to placate the school just in case (and yes, I got some drops for myself). Middly subsequently developed a revolting cough-snuffle-hack thing, and despite his normal temperature and assertions that he felt \"FINE!\" I took him to the pediatrician today, because my ex has dinner-visitation tonight and I do NOT want to hear about how I am neglecting a sickness. His temperature was normal and they said they didn't think he'd really ever had pinkeye at all but rather a virus. They did, however, agree with me that he SOUNDS revolting and is probably well on his way to a secondary bacterial infection, and put him on Augmentin, which means no more eye ointment needed even if he DID ever have pinkeye. So that's good I guess. Meanwhile the school clinic hadn't returned my call from the day before yesterday asking when Middly could come back to school, so I called them back. \"I think I owe you an apology,\" said the clinician, \"we've had a lot of children APPEAR to have pinkeye but turn out to have a virus lately, and you can bring him back any time.\" I hate the school clinic.\r\n* \u00a0 Who or what do YOU hate today?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/03/things-i-hate.html", "title": "things I hate"},

He's going to love it. I got the idea because a) he's the only MFA Child without a computer and b) he found an old flip-phone of mine and became obsessed with it, just taking pictures and listening to the various ring-tones. He was very sad to learn that those phones can't run apps and okay, fine, I went a little overboard but he's going to FREAK OUT. I can't wait!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Big Child has asked for Minecraft, which I plan to get him. I'll probably also give him an Amazon.com gift card to use on more books (he's a reader, that kid is, and I love it--he just finished the Wrinkle in Time trilogy and my heart grew three sizes--it's so cool to have a kid who reads like I did at that age) (well, minus all the smut--I was very poorly-supervised!) since Minecraft doesn't cost much (I try to spend about the same amount on each kid).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Middly is more complicated, since I received a special dispensation from Santa in order to spend $75 on the newt habitat for Sir Isaac, a.k.a. the WORST RAFFLE PRIZE EVER (I jest--he's kind of cute and eats pelleted food--no crickets!). So I want to spend less than $50 in addition to that, but I don't want to get him Minecraft (since he doesn't have a computer capable of running it without blowing up, plus if I get something for two of them the third would feel left out). Y'all are usually full of great ideas--do you have any for me re: Middly's Festivus gift?

{"date": "February 10, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI. \u00a0 There is fuckery at work. One particular department that works very closely with mine is positively fraught with dramaz, and filled with very large personalities who feel very strongly that they are in the right about things not related to anyone's job so much as the individuals in questions' personalities. Unfortunately they are, to a wo/man, largely mistaken and, quite often, highly offensive. The very worst offenders outrank and/or outnumber the ones they offend the most, myself included, and therefore there is unhappiness amongst The Little People, most especially in the department led by said very large personalities, but also in those in the other departments who work most closely with that one (including mine). Which is all a very longwinded way of saying that there is fuckery at work, but also that today said fuckery, which is usually confined to matters of personal taste and interpersonal civility (or lack thereof) and/or Screwing With Underlings Because They Can, went to the place of the kind of -ism that is absolutely and actionably Not Fucking Cool by any stretch of the imagination, as in workplace hostility toward an entire race/gender/religion/sexual orientation/pick one I'm being deliberately vague in general and yours truly in particular. Which? Crap, utter crap, and I'm both scared silly by the potential ramifications of Saying Something (in the sense that I really need my job and really do NOT need to make any enemies in high places) and scared silly by the potential ramifications of Letting This Slide (in that people treat you how you let them and these particular people are already Not Nice and at some point one begins to wonder what is next and at what point, if any, one's basic human dignity is compromised beyond the point where risk-avoidance is worthwhile, and to HELL with the economy). It's a shitty place to be. I don't enjoy it.\r\nII. Speaking of compromising basic human dignity, in the service industry you cater to customers from all walks of life. Some are stereotypically good people (clergy, for example) who are total jerks to those who serve them. Some are unquestionably bad people (hit men/drug lords/con artists/pimps/again with the vague) but are perfectly pleasant. Both the former and the latter enjoy good service, and the latter tends to have more money. Tonight I ran into a customer from the latter group, and made more as a tip than I typically do in wages in two days. My customer was charming and pleasant, and I enjoyed our banter, and I was overjoyed with the windfall that tip represented to my family, but I am also a little uncomfortable with the fact that, well, I was charming and pleasant in return to someone who probably belongs on the other side of some bars and/or would most benefit society by leaving it via the death penalty (and also someone from the department I mentioned above went out of their way to condemn me for going the extra mile, service-wise, for said customer, but I was only doing what I'd do for anyone who dropped that much cash in our establishment and didn't really see the point in losing my job and said customer's business by Taking A Stand).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0What would y'all do with the above?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christianpiatt/2013/02/a-breakdown-of-infamous-applebees-pastor-tip-gate/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/02/work.html", "title": "work"},

While there, we also picked up a bag of crickets, some vitamins and supplements to keep Clementine healthy, and a new \"basking tree\" because Hotter's inner interior decorator was insistent that the homemade platform her previous owner had constructed HAD to go. We brought everything home, put the \"tree\" in Clementine's tank, and watched her crouch at the base of it, looking waaaaaay up. \"D'ya think she'll be able to climb that thing?\" I asked dubiously. Clementine studied the tree, the way a cat will study the top of a refrigerator, then leapt easily onto the topmost branch. LIZARDS CAN JUMP??? Holy shit. * \u00a0 The hens are laying again, all four of them! Hooray!  * \u00a0 Iden the carnivorous killer-rabbit continues to be vicious and misanthropic. She also, however, gave birth to a litter of six the night before I'd planned to butcher her, so she gets a pass for at least six weeks. DAMMIT. After that she goes, though. She's just terribly vicious and untameable (I tried to befriend her once again, with romaine leaves and apple slices, but the moment I went to pet her the way the other rabbits like to be petted, she went for me). * \u00a0 Bumpus is doing much better in general than he has in ages, but he still goes into frenzied paroxysms of noise when the middle school bus is due to deliver his lord and master home. Clementine disapproves of this, and does pushups of reptilian fury. Hotter and I decided that this indicates she is a higher form of life than Bumpus, but then so, in our estimation, are certain species of blue-green algae.  * \u00a0 Hotter divides the animal kingdom into two main groups \"Things that like to be pet [sic]\" and things that do NOT \"like to be pet [I have given up correcting his English; it's become a running joke in our house to say this phrase incorrectly]. The day we got Isis, Hotter looked up at me in ecstasy and exclaimed \"she likes to be PET!\" (the cockatiel SOMETIMES likes to be pet, but not enough to fill the animal-hole in Hotter's heart). Hotter has decided that Clementine likes to be pet. I'm not sure if Clementine agrees, but she at least tolerates it. Iden? DOES NOT MOTHERFUCKING LIKE TO BE PET. The jury is still out on the disabled vulture at the local zoo who stole my heart a couple of years ago. I have a fantasy menagerie, you see, of various creatures I have fallen in love with and requested that Hotter find and bring to me at various times.

I am now insured (whoo tits!) via an individual plan, but they are declining to cover Pristiq until I have met my deductible, so I am pretty much paying a $340 flat-rate fee for the all-the-doctoring-you-can-stomach-each-month plan PLUS paying out of pocket for meds. This is not going to be sustainable longterm, particularly since January marks the start of a new fiscal year during which I get to meet a NEW deductible. God damn fucking health insurance!\r\n* \u00a0 Also, The C(o)unty decided that since my chickens are now legal and they can't ruin my happiness THAT way, they would issue me a citation for 2013 property taxes on the MFA Beater AND the original MFA Minivan, demanding that I pay within five days or come to court. And naturally they delivered this four days into said five-day period, so I had to scramble and come up with some money I didn't have for THAT, too.\r\n* \u00a0 The Situation has ramped up in its urgency, and I have an appointment to do with that in a little over an hour. Good thoughts, mojo, vibes, wishes, etc. are much appreciated there. I will tell y'all what The Situation is as soon as I have some answers and the time to relay them (those of you who are friends with me on The Facespace already know what this is about, which I say not to tease the rest of you but just so that my close friends who read here know there aren't TWO situations).\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter thought the one day this week that I am not working a double or trying to work a double due to The Situation and a job interview would be a fine time to go back to sleep after his alarm went off, so I had to get up early and drive Big Child to school. THANKS FOR THAT, HOTTER.\r\n* \u00a0 No matter how I juggle it, there is just no fucking way we're going to make rent this month, which scares the hell out of me. I thought we'd be okay, but then $200+ bills started popping up out of the woodwork like goddamn financial whack-a-mole, and I can't let the power get cut off because obviously, and I can't let the phones get cut off because same, and I can't not fill the Pristiq because that's what's keeping the wheels from coming off entirely, and I can't not have health insurance right now because The Situation (yeah, it's medical and very much a potentially worst-case-scenario type of thing, although currently I at least FEEL fine), even if said health insurance is crappy enough that I still (SURPRISE!) have to pay out of pocket for prescription meds for right now. The possible silver lining to today's Situation-related appointment is that the testing involved may well eat up my deductible and render Pristiq a $40 co-payment instead of a huge fucking expense, and hospitals at least bill you instead of demanding it all in advance. I am currently out as of yesterday, and waiting to fill it until after today's hospital-stravaganza just in case, because that is what passes for optimism in my life right now.\r\n* \u00a0 Oh and it's a minor thing in the grand scheme, but I have identified my nemesis at Eclecstasy. Two months without a professional nemesis was nice, but all good things, etc. I'm not sure the other party feels the same way about me, but I find it convenient to have someone toward which to channel all of the frantic hate in my head and heart and figure better someone at work than someone at home and so GAME ON, BITCH!**\r\n* \u00a0 How are all of YOU?** Eh, not really. I would never behave unprofessionally at work, because I like my job, but liken this to how, when I was a kid and would go to ballgames with my dad, we would pick a random player on the other team to boo at. I may only boo at my \"nemesis\" inside my own head, but it beats the other things rattling around it there currently.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/10/cranky.html", "title": "cranky"},

{"date": "October  1, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0I've gotten comments and e-mails on the posts I've written about getting stiffed by large parties asking about the \"autograt,\" and thought I'd go ahead and explain.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Yes, you have probably gone out as part of a large group and seen a gratuity automatically applied (usually 18%, sometimes as much as 22%) to your check. But thanks to some tax law changes that went into effect in January, that's less and less common. According to the IRS, tips are strictly voluntary, and automatically-applied service charges are therefore a WAGE, not a TIP. This causes there to be additional fees and administrative dealings on a server's employer's end when there is an \"autograt.\" Some employers still allow the autograt and absorb that cost in the name of employee goodwill and retention, because it's a fact of life in the restaurant industry that large parties don't tip (they either assume there's a gratuity included because that used to be standard practice across the board, all assume someone else took care of it, think $20 is sufficient even if their bill was into three or four digits, or just don't give a crap). Eclecstasy, being a corporate-owned, multinational chain, apparently crunched the numbers on what it would do to The Bottom Line to eat the cost of allowing the autograt across all locations and said \"y'all are on your own, suck it up,\" doing away with the \"autograt\" as of January 2014. Employees have raised a fuss on the company's website and been told, essentially, \"nothing personal, just business.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is a huuuuuuge hot-button issue among employees, some of whom have seen their income diminish by half or, in the case of \"destination stores\" in tourist towns who see lots of large parties of guests from other countries where gratuities aren't even A Thing, stopped breaking the federal minimum wage by working at Eclecstasy, meaning that by law the company bumps them up to that and that is all they make. This means that since Eclecstasy servers tip out to the bar, runners, and bussers based on SALES not TIPS, some servers lose money by working at all, and are quitting in droves. In the case of locations where that is the norm, I don't blame them. In the case of the MFAville Eclecstasy, we aren't really a \"destination\" store, it's only maybe one night in maybe twenty that I walk out of the place with less money than I had when I walked in, and the rest of the time working there is lucrative enough that it still averages out to Very Good Money, so while I think it's shitty of Corporate to take the stance on the autograt issue that they have, and bitterly resent that one night in twenty because it's really disheartening, on the whole I'm not as fussed as servers who have been with the company long enough to remember what the money was like BEFORE this went into effect and don't think it's worth quitting over, to ME, in THIS location.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Which isn't to say that I haven't scheduled an interview with Eclecstasy's biggest competitor for Friday. The lack of \"autograt\" IS the difference between my making enough at Eclecstasy to not need a second job and my needing to find something else now that I've settled in there in order to build up a cushion for when the MFA Minivan goes to The Big Junkyard In The Sky/I need surgery/Hotter's donor organs fail or whatever the next big giant crisis over here is. If the competitor hires me and I like it there AND they still apply the \"autograt\" that may become my new main gig. Nothing personal, Eclecstasy, just business.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2014/10/gratuity.html", "title": "gratuity"},

WHOOOOO TITS! \r\n* \u00a0 To celebrate, MyFitnessPal automatically adjusted my goals and took away eighty calories per day. I'm kind of bummed about that, but when I went to manually dick around with the settings there was this warning about how one shouldn't do that without the advice of a professional, and I don't want to die, so I guess MyFitnessPal wins this round.\r\n* \u00a0 HEY DID YOU SEE THAT? I SAID I DON'T WANT TO DIE! That's a major improvement over all of last week, so that's good.\r\n* \u00a0 The rabbits are eating me out of house and home! Pfeffer's nine kits have all survived thus far, and she's eating a TON to keep up with their needs milkwise. I think Iden is pregnant (for some reason she is very difficult to palpate, maybe because she's so full of hate that her muscles tense up? I can always tell with Pfeffer but felt Iden up the day before she gave birth and swore she wasn't even pregnant, so I don't dare call it one way or the other two weeks post-breeding with her), and the last two fatties from her first litter are still hanging around munching away. I need to do something about that this weekend.\r\n* \u00a0 Hotter is sick again.

Nothing like when my ex famously announced he was \"out of sympathy\" and had me call a cab to get myself to the hospital when we thought I was dying (a.k.a. The Moment I Stopped Loving That Guy), but my inner Florence Nightengale made a very rude hand-gesture when Hotter announced he wasn't feeling well this morning.\r\n* \u00a0 I at least am feeling okay physically, and think I have managed to fight off my Cold of Filth without needing medical intervention, WHICH IS HUGE.

We counted the rabbit kits (you have to do this daily for the first couple of weeks, because if one dies you need to get it OUT of the nest), of which there are still nine (although there is now a clear runt that is less than half the size of the others, and I expect that it'll die off in the next couple of days--I've gone so far as to milk Pfeffer by hand and syringe-feed these runts in the past and they always die anyway, so I think they're runts because something is wrong with them inside and have taken a zero-intervention stance on runts even if they do tug at my heart), and fed and watered everyone.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The beast I told y'all about pressed her face to the bars repeatedly as if looking for affection. Haas and Pfeffer will do that, and they enjoy a good petting. Remembering Jay's comment, I wondered if maybe said critter was just mean because it had developed bad associations around being touched (we aren't cruel to beasts out there, but said animal has a history of fertility issues and has therefore had the extended belly-grope that serves as a crude pregnancy test more than average due to numerous failed breedings; I don't remember such gropings during my own pregnancies as unpleasant but then I knew what was going on).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you just misunderstood?\" I asked the beast, and went to rub her face with my finger.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Reader, she bit the living SHIT out of me.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is the first time a rabbit has caused me injury with its teeth (the other wounds this one has inflicted were from claws), and given that the MFA Children like to feed the rabbits treats of pulled grass and dandelion greens...well.

{"date": "January 16, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 I finally ovaried up and weighed myself for the first time since a combined total of five-ish weeks on steroids over the past couple of months. It wasn't pretty (I don't diet while on steroids, since they make me cranky/insane enough, and I work AND live with very talented chefs).\u00a0So I'm back to MyFitnessPal (which I wholeheartedly recommend if you're looking for a calorie/exercise tracking app). If you're on there, we should be friends! I'm MFAMama, of course.\r\n* \u00a0 I just love this lady's blog, even if it does give me terrible farm-envy. She recently wrote about her experience with cooking a beef tongue and the \"ick factor.\" That was right up my alley; we cooked our first beef tongue just last week! To answer the various questions I've gotten on that: it was both grosser than AND less gross than I expected (I thought touching the thing while raw and peeling the \"skin\" off would be the nasty parts, but those weren't bad--the slimy texture of the peeled tongue pre-slicing and sauteeing, however...shudder), we ate it chopped up as taco meat, and it was FREAKING DELICIOUS! If you're curious what it looked like,\u00a0here\u00a0is a how-to with photos (not my how-to or photos).\u00a0I didn't tell the boys the WHOLE truth about the meat until after dinner (I just said it was beef, which was not untrue), where all three of them commented on how delicious the meat was and squabbled over the scraps in the serving bowl. When I told them, they were kind of shocked that tongue was edible, but all three said they wanted to have it again soon, so I'm calling that a win (especially since the farmer we buy our beef from charges $6/lb for organic, grass-fed ground beef and only $3/lb for the tongues from the same animals).\r\n* \u00a0 Work is...interesting. I haven't worked for Job #2 for a couple of weeks, and think maybe they're pissed at me for calling in sick on a really busy day there, but that's okay! I'm pissed at them for three overdrafts they caused me by losing my last paycheck from them (which you have to pick up IN PERSON--they won't give part-timers automatic deposit or even mail checks) and was strongly considering quitting Job #2 because it is ALWAYS LIKE THAT with them (you just kind of have to expect to be treated like shit on the job, paid late, scheduled and rescheduled at the very last minute, etc. plus this is the same company as the original \"Weekend Warrior Job\" and both times I've worked with them I've been shocked at how badly they treat their employees in general). In an interesting plot-twist, Job #1 has been incredibly slow recently in my usual department, but for the past month or so I've been working in another department where I make a LOT more money in a LOT fewer hours, and customer satisfaction is way up, so this may become a permanent change. If it continues like this, I don't strictly-speaking HAVE to find another Job #2 (I mean, more money would be nice, but I think all the double shifts and weeks without days off were contributing to how sick I've been for the past few months, plus I really missed my family). I kind of feel like I should, though, just in case.\r\n* \u00a0 The hens are molting. Boooo. What this means is that instead of four eggs per day we now get MAYBE one egg, nestled in an entire chicken's worth of feathers. I hope they hurry up and finish with that!\r\n* \u00a0 I think Pfeffer stays pregnant longer than normal for a rabbit. Most rabbits kindle between twenty-nine and thirty-one days after breeding, and she consistently goes thirty-two days. This consistently screws with my head, and you'd think I would have learned by now.\r\n* \u00a0 Wheat? Is in EVERYDAMNTHING (we're doing a trial separation, wheat and I--I don't think I have Celiac disease or anything, but am trying to figure out some GI issues that are consistent with what friends who have wheat problems have, and figured it couldn't hurt; it'll probably also help me lose some of the steroids weight) (can you tell I feel like a total tool here? I think way too many people are wheat/gluten free as kind of a fad-thing lately and the word \"paleo\" trips my gag reflex.

The other waitress, who has actually, er, availed herself of the services said politician's hard work has made continuously available*, said she was in and we quickly pooled our tips and garnished a plate with raspberry syrup and a fan-sliced strawberry, plunking down a slice of Very Fancy Cake and conferring briefly over a note. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0We finally went with \"With grateful appreciation for all of your work on behalf of reproductive rights here, The Waitstaff, P.S.

Oh and I lost five pounds.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hrrrrmph.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Originally I thought I'd try going wheatless for a week, but now I'm thinking I'll go a month just to see what else might improve and/or give my various ailments time to come back in case this is a random improvement thing.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0With that in mind, I decided to investigate my options as far as bread goes...if this was just a week-long thing I'd stick with whole non-glutinous grains for my carbs (oats! sesame seeds! TEFF--if you haven't seen Teff yet you should check it out--it's the teeeeeniest little grain EVAR), but if I'm going to go a month I figure I might actually die without a grilled cheese sammich want the option of bread in case everyone else is having some with a meal. I've worked in hospital kitchens where they served gluten-free bread before, and it was dry, misshapen, awful-looking stuff. Being as how I like to bake, I thought I might just make my own bread, which would allow me to shape some of it into burger buns, dinner rolls, etc. (or so I thought). So far I've learned two things: 1) You don't shape gluten-free bread. GLUTEN-FREE BREAD SHAPES YOU! The lack of gluten means that you don't knead the stuff, you mix it, and you don't form it so much as pour it into pans. Bummer. 2) The various ground carbs you use in place of flour (rice, tapioca, potato, etc.) tend to be called \"starch,\" not flour, which...well. Gluten-free crusaders bang on about how gluten = glue and OMG SO BAD FOR YOU, CELIAC OR NOT but starch is...well...starch...and I think the take-home lesson here is that bread/processed grain isn't so great for you. So I haven't actually baked any gluten-free bread yet, although I tried some gluten-free pancake mix and it was...surprisingly delicious! Possibly even preferable to regular pancakes.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I'm starting to get the sinking feeling that, like that time I started butchering my own meat, this will be one of the \"MFA Mama being a dick about food\" phases that turns into permanent changes in the way I eat.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0But at least my pants fit.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/01/disappointingly-effective.html", "title": "disappointingly effective"},

{"date": "January 27, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* \u00a0 We have had some wintery weather here in MFAville over the weekend, which largely means that the whole damn town lost their minds, rushed out to buy gallons of milk and loaves of bread, and then closeted themselves until every last bit of the snow had melted away. Well, everyone except the eleventy-hundred idiots driving five miles per hour and cutting each other off on the main drag into town that I was on during the worst of the weather; I work in a business that never closes, ESPECIALLY during inclement weather, and with my workplace being staffed by locals (i.e. \"people terrified of snow\") there are always lots of call-outs during a winter storm. Call-outs = MORE MONEY FOR ME! So I spent forty-eight hours at my job (yes, I slept there) and made a lot of money, but this gluten-free thing makes it suck to try and eat there. I'm 90% sure I got glutenated via cross-contamination in the kitchen (or simple ignorance--turns out even chefs who are not themselves affected by gluten intolerance are pretty ignorant about hidden sources of gluten--Hotter glutenated last night's dinner with a flavoring packet from some ramen) at work, and 100% sure it happened again at home (the dinner in question was a roast, and I just cut the outside bits off a couple of slices but yeah, no bueno). Balllls.\u00a0So apparently I have to get better about my self-control, and learn to \"just say no\" to stuff I didn't make myself (or that wasn't made by someone I can quiz on ingredients). This sucks though, because I'm the person, both at work and at home, who people come to when cooking something and go \"taste this! What does it need?\" Answer: NOT EFFING GLUTEN, DAMMIT!\r\n* \u00a0 I then read this. WHAT?!? I love oats. The oats I have eaten since going gluten-free are labeled \"gluten-free\" and not processed on machinery shared with wheat, barley, or rye, but I did not know this about oats. It makes sense, though. I've grown wheat. The garden row where I grew wheat last year is currently planted with clover and kale. There are random stalks of wheat coming up here and there, which I feed to the bunnies. I think if I stay gluten-free (which I am starting to think that I will, given how I've felt without gluten and after accidentally ingesting even a tiny bit since then) I'm going to start over in the Spring with a row I've never grown wheat in, and plant lots of oats.\r\n* \u00a0 Chick-fil-a? Hell no. Several people have asked me if going gluten-free will change my stance on a certain homophobic chicken chain, and it won't. Even if they are, apparently, the only chain restaurant whose fries I could safely enjoy (and man, those fries are DA BOMB--I've had them in the past) (other chains fry things with wheaty breadings in their fryers), I'm not putting so much as a penny into the pockets of the likes of Dan Cathy. Fried foods aren't good for you anyway.\r\n* \u00a0 Xanthan gum: THE HORROR! I figured it probably came from something gross, and looked it up, and I was right. You know that black rot you see on broccoli and caulifower sometimes? Maybe you don't garden and haven't a clue what I'm talking about. Well, lucky you. I'm still going to bake with the stuff, but I'm going to shudder every time I do.\r\n* \u00a0 This diet is turning me into SUCH A DICK ABOUT FOOD. Not that I wasn't already, but man I am truly insufferable now. I'd say I'm sorry, except I'm not.

{"date": "March  5, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0First of all, Isis is going to be okay. That said, the surgery ended up being a bigger deal than planned; the vet said that the surface lumps were the tops of two \"tracks\" where it appears that something (she thinks smart money would be on barbed thorns of some kind, although she didn't cut the hunk she removed apart because apparently Pathology likes to do that themselves) burrowed down into Isis's belly and kept on going, nearly piercing her abdominal wall (which would have been VERY BAD NEWS). So Isis has a two-inch incision with a LOT of stitches, and apparently it goes waaaay down internally as well (they sent her home with a second course of antibiotics and some heavy-duty narcotic pain pills--she is also sporting a Cone of Shame) The good news is that the vet said she is 99% certain that this had nothing whatsoever to do with anything malignant (although Pathology will still have a go at the cutlet she excised to be sure). The terrifying news is that apparently waiting even a few days could have had an awful result--THANK YOU, INNERNET!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0That out of the way, when I picked Isis up and lifted her carefully into the MFA Minivan, I placed my keys and phone in the cup-tray and shut the passenger door. While I was going around, Isis jumped up and stepped on the lock button, and...yeah. Fuuuuuudge. Here is where it gets ridiculous! There was a drycleaner RIGHT THERE and I easily obtained a coathanger, but was then accosted by a group of chivalrous hobos who were all \"ma'am can we help you? You're bleedin' pretty bad.\" One of them took a knee and covered his eyes, another one took the coathanger, and a third ran for the vet (who apparently is a friend of theirs). Son of a gun if I hadn't nicked my knuckle somehow, except I couldn't tell WHAT the hell I'd done because I honestly felt nothing but there was blood POURING out of it. I must say, our new favorite veterinary practice went WAY above and beyond; the vet frog-marched me into her clinic, leaving her techs to ride herd on the hobos, and scrubbed my hand with surgical soap, then applied a neat pressure dressing, grabbed a \"spay hook\" to arm the hobos with, and came back outside with me, and within a few moments they were able to jimmy the lock on the MFA Minivan and Isis and I were on our way.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I got home, Hotter wanted to have a look at my hand. \"This will go one of two ways,\" I told him. \"Either I will need to go and get some stitches, or else it will be something the size of a paper cut and this is just that thing where Levaquin effs up my platelets and there is a bloodbath.\" We unbandaged it and...there was no visible mark. I bent my finger slightly and there it was, the size of an effing papercut, and there came the bloodbath. Yay? I mean, I'm super-glad I didn't have to shell out for stitches, but I'm guessing I shouldn't have bled enough to make a hobo woozy from something so utterly insignificant.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Oh well. I am calling today a wash, honestly, because while there was suckage a-plenty, everything bad pretty much ended up turning out to have been the best-case scenario in the end.

{"date": "March  5, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0So one of the things I did last weekend when I was SUPER-deathly ill was join Pinterest. I mentioned that on here, but Pinterest and I got off to kind of a rocky start in that a lot of people seem to like to Pin vacation spots and fashion ideas that, while I might enjoy them, I am just so far away from having the money to participate in (true fact: I have never in my adult life gone on an actual vacation with my family, or even without them) that it's a little depressing. I'm not generally a terribly covetous person when it comes to material goods, but oh boy. Pinterest has a LOT to covet.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Plus I don't know how to sew and Hotter does most of the cooking these days.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The thing is, Pinterest is kind of like life in that it is what you make of it, and you have to find your own happy little niche. And my niche? Has a lot to do with plants that make food. I've found some pretty cool stuff to add to my \"garden porn\" board (such as OMG if you put a coffee filter in the bottom of a pot before filling it with dirt your houseplants and/or veggie seedlings you're starting indoors won't sift potting soil all over the place--GENIUS!), including one thing that the stars aligned to let me put into action today. I'm pretty excited about it!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Pineapples and I have a complicated history. They're one of my very favorite fruit, but unfortunately about seven years ago, while I was pregnant with Little Child, I became violently allergic to them in a very weird way. I was cutting one up and gnawing the good fruit from around the core (because you know I'm all about the \"waste not, want not\") and noticed a smear of blood on the thing as I brought it away from my mouth. Hmm. That was odd. I figured it was that whole \"pregnancy makes your gums fragile\" thing and that I'd probably gotten a fiber between my teeth and irritated my gums and kept on eating. The next time I took a bite the core came away with what looked like a lipstick-print on it, except it was blood. And my mouth started to feel a little weird. I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror and HOLY HELL, MY FACE WAS BLOODY FROM NOSE TO CHIN AND THE ENTIRE INSIDE OF MY MOUTH WAS OOZING. My throat also started to feel a little funny in the way that it does if I even take a bite of fruit salad that's been NEXT to a piece of kiwi (which I'm VERY allergic to, to the point that the last time I saw an allergist they included that in the testing and issued me an epi-pen), so I took some Benadryl and regretfully left the pineapple I'd been cutting up to the XY and the children. After I had Little Child I tried pineapple again, thinking that maybe what had happened was some weird pregnancy thing, and ended up with the same reaction. For a while I was able to eat canned pineapple (a friend in the medical field told me that there's something in the skin of fresh pineapples that sets people off and sometimes people who react badly to the fresh fruit can tolerate the canned stuff--I might not've risked it except that my throat never swelled from pineapple the way it does with kiwi although my mouth would itch) and still enjoy the occasional pina colada (and people, I LOVE me some pina coladas, although I prefer them \"virgin\" because the alcohol gets in the way of my perfect enjoyment of the coconut and pineapple), but then I started reacting to that, too and had to give it up entirely. It was very sad.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Flash forward to a couple of weeks ago when Hotter and I were at Trader Joe's and he saw pineapples and asked why we never bought them. \"Because I'm allergic, you know that,\" I said bitterly. \"I'm not,\" he said, \"and I'm sure the boys would love it if you'd buy them sometimes.\" This was right after we'd found out about all the work his teeth need, though, and I pointed out that we were not buying ANYTHING unnecessary (and still aren't), nor were we spending money on fresh fruit (which is pricey stuff) that only certain members of the household could eat. Yeah, I'm a joy to shop with.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The next week I joined Pinterest, and soon saw the pineapple trick. I thought it was neat and repinned it\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Which brings us to today, when I stopped in at Big Box Membership Store to get a few groceries and saw that they had pineapples marked down (it looked like the last few they had) for only $2.25. I stood there for a second, considering, and then I had a lightbulb moment: I AM ON STEROIDS! If ever there was a time when I'd be safe to eat myself some pineapple, this was it! Plus it was on sale PLUS I could gain a houseplant! The angels sang--this was MADE OF WIN--and I selected a nice pineapple and put it in my cart.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The MFA Children were delighted when I brought the pineapple into the house. I took a Benadryl and showed them all how to test the ripeness by tugging on the leaves, and they watched me take the fruit apart with Hotter's Valentine's Day J.A. Henckel santoku* (LIKE BUTTER, PEOPLE). I took one tiny taste and then put the fruit away, saving the crown, and served dinner, deciding it was probably prudent to see whether I started to feel funny. Happily I did not and this is what we had for dessert tonight:\r\nFigure One: So. Freaking. Delicious.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0After dinner I reviewed the pineapple-planting instructions, separated the leaves from the crown and trimmed away the nubbin of fruit, then began picking the bottom leaves off. If you decide to try this at home, be forewarned that the roots you will expose look remarkably like worms. In fact, at first I thought I'd bought a pineapple with worms in the crown and was disappointed because I figured that might rule out planting the thing. I soon realized, however, that none of the \"worms\" were moving, and after exposing more realized that those were the roots. Here is what my pineapple rootlet looked like when I'd finished stripping away the bottom leaves:\r\nFigure Two: I shall name him SPONGEBOB! See the \"worms?\" Also pictured in the background is The Santoku of Love.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So Spongebob is drying on top of a bookshelf currently, and in a few days I'll plant him and we'll see what happens. Also, I think this will have to become a ritual whenever I have to take steroids.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0How are all of YOU?\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 Yes, I got Hotter a knife for Valentine's Day. Two of them, actually, a 7-inch santoku and a flexible boning knife. He'd been sighing over our lack of Henckels for as long as we've lived together, and I'd been shutting him down cold because they are EX. PEN. SIVE. but having received a raise when I moved from Old PseudoCorp Job to Current PseudoCorp Job and not yet learned of the dental situation, plus having used a Henckel at Weekend Warrior Job and been instantly smitten, I made him a VERY happy man and I'm glad I did because WOW those knives are amazing.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/253186810271189473/", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c385988340168e868d53b970c-pi", "http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c3859883401630272c525970d-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/03/of-pineapples-and-pinterest.html", "title": "of pineapples and Pinterest"},

I am talking clearing a ballroomfull of furniture, and a second smaller room, SINGLEHANDEDLY, after serving two groups of people two separate meals in same and cleaning everything that involved off of said furniture.

I transplanted lots more strawberries and pulled dandelions for the hens and bunnies.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0When it was too hot to work outside, during the heat of the day, I came inside and cleaned up a little and found a CVS gift card I'd lost ages ago, and was able to use that to fill the Symbicort and start using that again (hopefully my lungs will get their act together before another round of antibiotics and steroid taper come into play, or the Symbicort will at least slow their rate of decline, because I can't afford that until Friday at the earliest).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I then butchered two rabbits and broke them down into filets and \"bunnybacon\" to freeze and grind when there's enough for chili, rear leg chops (those went into the soup pot still on the bone with grassfed oxtails from less than twenty miles away that I've had in the freezer for a while, and simmered with salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, rosemary, carrot peel, green onions, and onion peel until the broth had good color then the pot went into the fridge--tomorrow I'll skim, strain, pick, chop, and add veggies to the broth, including a ridiculously gorgeous leek from the front yard, and we'll have Brunswick Stew), and front and rear stripped backs for Isis's BARF-diet meals (half a stripped rabbit is meat enough to make a meal for her; add some chopped veg and a spoon of coconut oil or a couple of egg yolks and she's a happy girl).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Then I cut Hotter's hair and beard, which had gotten ridiculous, and then the MFA Children came home tired and smelling of chlorine from the pool at the XY's hotel* and we put them to bed and I took a long, hot shower.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Tonight, despite my worries, I will snuggle up to my husband and our rotten dog and sleep well for the second night in a row out of sheer exhaustion born of productivity, and that feels really nice.\r\n\u00a0\r\n* \u00a0 The XY's house burned to the ground Thursday night, apparently. He was at CATHERINE's place at the time, and the boys were home with Hotter and me, thank the odds, so nobody died, and fortunately no pets were housed there either. I am uncharitable enough to suspect that this is just a wee bit too fortunate for the XY, actually (Hotter introduced me to the term \"Jewish lightning,\" which is derogatory and I don't much care for it, but...that), but it may be that I am just a huge bitch and this was an accident...the excellent homeowners' insurance is, at any rate, putting the XY up in an extended-stay hotel where he only goes with the boys that has an indoor pool and free hot breakfast every day, and the kids are sad about the house (particularly their video game memory cards) but enjoying the novelty of the hotel.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jewish%20Lightning"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/04/something-nice.html", "title": "something nice"},

{"date": "April 17, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0A couple of you have asked what is up with Hotter's eyes. To which I say: how long do you have to read this crap? Because it took one of the best eye doctors on the Eastern Seaboard over three hours to fully answer that question with all sorts of machines and instruments yesterday.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Reader's Digest version is that diabetes is super-bad for the eyesight, and Hotter had many, many laser surgeries to \"zap\" bleeding vessels that were threatening his vision as a result of what the disease does to the circulatory system. He also developed cataracts at a young age. At some point the eye doctors treating him decided to remove the cataract from the \"bad\" eye and do a \"vitreous fluid exchange\" (don't Google that unless you have a strong stomach/aren't afraid of eye things) (I'm serious, it's the stuff of motherfucking nightmares) to restore as much vision as possible without risking the \"good\" eye. This left Hotter with a new \"good\" eye and a \"bad\" eye that wasn't THAT bad. All of this was done nearly a decade ago though, and after additional lasering Hotter has zero peripheral vision, a lot of blurring, \"ghost\"-type double vision (there are types of this, apparently), and sees everything very, very dimly.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0So he's pretty much blind, bumps into stuff/falls down a lot, can no longer read standard-size print or menus, and has been getting increasingly frustrated by a visual field that apparently looks like this (copied from the eye doctor's drawing):\r\n\r\nFigure One: The green areas represent what he CAN see (\"good\" eye to the left), although the vision in those areas is...sub-optimal, let's say.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0After over three hours' worth of tests (it'd been a while since Hotter saw an eye doctor, because Medicare doesn't care if you go blind or your teeth fall out--NO VISION OR DENTAL FOR YOU, POOR DISABLED PEOPLE!) subsidized by my employer's excellent medical coverage, the relevant expert said that he wasn't going to push us either way but he *could* remove the second cataract if we wanted to try and improve Hotter's remaining vision. He stressed that this stands a 50% chance of doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from Hotter's end (although he did say that getting the cataract out of the way would let him see into that eye better to determine whether another vitreous fluid exchange or more lasering was necessary, so that would still improve their ability to safeguard the remaining vision even if it didn't improve any from this surgery itself), about a 10% chance of making things worse due to infection, scarring, \"stirring up\" the retinopathy from the diabetes (which Hotter may or may not still have as an ongoing thing--there's not a lot of data on former Type-1 diabetics' vision because pancreatic transplants are fairly new), etc. (if you or a loved one have a cataract, your risk of deterioration as a result of surgery is probably MUCH, MUCH LOWER--I am not a doctor and while Hotter's eye doctor is, he was dealing with Hotter's eyes in laying out these odds and probably your/your loved one's eyes are in MUCH BETTER SHAPE), and about a 40% chance of improving the vision anywhere from \"it's a teeny bit better\" to \"DOCTOR, DOCTOR, I CAN SEE!\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Given that there is so little vision left in the \"bad\" eye, Hotter and I feel that a 10% chance of losing that vs. a 90% chance of the surgery doing at least SOME good (either immediately or by enabling better long-term care) makes this an easy choice: we've scheduled the procedure for mid-May in order to make sure I can be off work to drive and Transplant can check Hotter out in order to clear him for surgery (nobody will so much as trim Hotter's toenails without their blessing).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"But MFA Mama, won't that still cost you money you can't afford,\" I can hear some of you asking. Yes. Yes it will. But a) it's his EYESIGHT and b) what are they going to do if the check for the deductible bounces, repo his vision? I AM NOT SAYING I PLAN TO WRITE A BAD CHECK TO THE EYE HOSPITAL. Please don't think that. I'm going to sign up for all available overtime and do my very best to make sure we can afford this! But...well. It's his EYESIGHT. We have to make this happen somedamnhow.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0And that is what is up with Hotter's eyes.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mfamama.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5501c38598834017d42e12087970c-pi"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/04/eyesight.html", "title": "eyesight"},

Not too shabby for a kid with an IEP! Also Big Child's teacher is so cool I kind of wanted to take her home and make her my sister-wife. She has some of her students reading The Hunger Games. I haven't even read The Hunger Games!\r\n* \u00a0 As for Little Child, he says he wants to be a mercenary when he grows up \"because I love violence!\" I asked him what he loved about violence. \"The blood and guts!\" I said if he was, say, a cardiothorassic surgeon instead of a mercenary he'd get to PLAY WITH BEATING HEARTS FOR MONEY. His eyes lit up and he now wants to be a cardiothorassic surgeon, which I think is preferable to a mercenary. And just like that I've turned into a Jewish mother.\r\n* \u00a0 The local Occupy protesters marched across the grounds of PseudoCorp this morning; Security felt the need to stand outside looking menacing.

I'm kind of curious just what is up with that, but my policy when it comes to his lovelife is \"don't ask, because asking implies caring.\"\r\n* \u00a0 My leg is still really sore, and it has now been an entire week since I exercised at all.

He'd like me to do more when I get home. I get home and I'm tired and ouchy and already sick of people wanting things from me. He snipes at me. I hide because I don't enjoy being sniped at.

My main fear was that possibly something was up with the tires and I didn't want to have a blowout. They switched the tires around and now it pulls to the left, so it needs an alignment, which they said could wait until next weekend, which is my next day off, as long as I keep both hands on the wheel while driving it until then.

And Other Mechanic...well, he totally hit on me. And no, I'm not flattering myself here; he was all asking me about my job and my hobbies and calling me \"babe\" and then he gave me his card and said I could call him any time. I'm not terribly offended; while I think it's in poor taste to hit on a woman wearing a wedding ring, Other Mechanic didn't invade my personal space or say anything sexually explicit or anything like that so it was less of a \"HOW FUCKING DARE YOU\" and more of a \"OMGHAAAAA SRSLY?\" It's kind of funny (more funny-weird than funny ha-ha), though, because I am the heaviest I've ever been non-pregnant and personally think I look like crap, and I'm getting hit on and eyed up more lately than ever before in my life.

So like, don't TOTALLY shit on him in the comments (wet farts, however, are totally acceptable under the circumstances).\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Happy Saturday!\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2010/04/19/demotivational-posters-been-so-angry/"], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2011/11/note-to-self-buy-a-cactus.html", "title": "note to self: buy a cactus"},

A family-size bag of organic chicken nuggets, two steamable veggie bags, half a gallon of organic milk, eight yogurts, two Larabars, and a dozen and a half Bumpus-eggs ended up costing me $15. Whoo, savings! As an added bonus, I taught Little Child how to pick from the garden to feed Clementine greens for free.\r\n* \u00a0 Then I went and put all of the rabbits (that can be safely handled, IDEN) out to graze in their various pens and shelters. And did some work in the garden. And chased a stray rabbit all over creation (I hate Haas almost as much as Iden today).\r\n* \u00a0 My generous customer came back! He was as he usually is, and other than that work was pretty slow, but it all evened out.\r\n* \u00a0 All in all today was good, despite a rough start. Maybe tonight I'll get some actual sleep and tomorrow I'll conquer the world! How are all of YOU?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/04/well-hey-alright.html", "title": "well, hey, alright"},
{"date": "April 16, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe good news is, I figured out why I was/am such a mess: I missed a dose of Pristiq (which I was waiting to fill until the child support came).\n\n   The bad news is, the XY paid late, so we did in fact get an overdraft. BALLLLS. Also? Pristiq withdrawal is UGLY, y'all. Picture coming down off hallucinogens meets morning after bad breakup meets food poisoning. And, well, everything that was wrong yesterday is still wrong today. PLUS we just found out today that Hotter needs some more eye surgery, and our insurance is good but that'll still cost money.\n\n   Someone asked how to help and really? I don't know, y'all. I don't want you to feel like I'm asking you to DO anything. I kind of feel like there's no \"fixing\" us. I mean shit, there is a LOT wrong. We need glasses and fillings and surgeries and sparkplugs and appliance repairs and new workpants and socks without holes and a fucking BREAK.\n\n   And people in hell just want a cold drink.\n\n   If any of you are filthy rich and itching to help us out the \"Donate\" button on the sidebar works, but really I just come here to vent. When one works in the service industry and people ask how you are, the answer pretty much HAS to be \"FABULOUS! If I was any better I'd be twins!\" So it's just nice to be able to come on here and say HONESTLY how I am.\n\n   And how are all of YOU? No bullshit here, tell the truth.\n\nSent from The Precious\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://mfamama.typepad.com/my-blog/2013/04/withdrawal.html", "title": "withdrawal"}
